		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> brings me to what is a subject that keeps getting brought up nowadays is universal basic income with the oncoming Apocalypse of automation is as how it's being portrayed by Andrew Yang is running for president I sat down and talked to him about his very compelling and he's a very smart guy and he's an entrepreneur himself and when he starts talking about Automation and how it's going to adjust eliminate massive amounts of jobs and leave people stranded what it do when I know you're a guy who thinks about future I'm going to popular fun of you by my side I think it said non solution to a non problem and I mean that in the sense that automation has been happening since the dawn of time when electricity came along that put a lot of people out of work did it right lot of people carrying buckets of water and you know lighting lamps and all those kinds of things with factors as well everything literally every single thing that comes automation going to eliminate jobs there is no finite number of jobs around dividing up the same job that were around since the Stone Age obviously new jobs are being created and they're usually better jobs more creative jobs so the question is how quickly this transition going to happen and what kinds of jobs will be eliminated what kind of jobs will be created it's impossible looking forward to predict what kinds of jobs will be created if I told you 10 years ago that podcast or that commentating on video game still get job you would have left me all the rooms are nonsense jobs but yet here we are so Society will always create a new job civilization create new job is impossible to predict what those jobs are so the question is how quickly is that transition happening all the reality is even though everybody keeps talking about this automation apocalypse where the record low unemployment explain that wears the transition I don't see it in the numbers I don't see it actually happening Russian is how quickly can you retrain people so it's an education problem the problem Ubi does a couple of problems that ugj one is you're creating a straight at you putting a slippery slide transfer straight into socialism ride the moment people can start voting themselves money combined with a democracy is the matter of time before the bottom 51 votes and sells everything with top 49 and it just it it Hacienda Llano people like saying that but they haven't thought it through but the moment you start having a direct transfer mechanism like that in a democracy you're basically doing with capitalism which is the engine of economic growth you also forcing me entrepreneurs out or telling them not to come here the estimate I saw for 15K a year basic income for everybody would be 3/4 of current GDP and of course GDP was shrinking responses all the entrepreneurs fled so you essentially bankrupt the country another issued Ubi people who are down and they're not looking for handouts it's not just about money it's also about status it's about meeting in the moment I start giving money to you and put you on the door live load your status I've made you a second-class citizen so I have to give you meaning and meaning comes to education and capability I have you have to teach a man to fish not to basically throw your rotting leftover carpet is that him to say here to eat the scraps so it doesn't smell the meeting problem and last week nonsense to hand 15K out to every you want to means-test people there's no reason to give it to you and me so you end up back towards the welfare system where you do have to figure out who needs it and who doesn't so I think the better route is that we actually establish a set of basic substance services that you have to have and we provide those in abundance to technology base automation so get basic housing get basic food get busy Transportation get high-speed internet access get a phone in your pocket those are the kinds of things you want to give people and finally in terms of the rate of automation I think we can educate people very quickly one of the myths that we have today is that adults can be re-educated we view education is this thing where you go to school you come out when you're out of college and you're done no more education will that's the wrong you have all these great online bootcamps and coding schools coming up there one that would even pay you to go there now you can educate people and mass and you can educate them to create a profession we view education is this thing where you go to school you come out when you're out of college when you're done no more education will that's the wrong you have all these great online bootcamps and coding schools coming out there one that even pay you to go there now you can educate people and mass and you can educate them into creative professions</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> people are talking about AI automating programming have never really written serious code coding is thinking it's automatic stretch your thinking an AI that can program as well or better than humans is an AI that just took over the world that's in game at the end of the human species and I can give you a argument why don't think that's coming either people or things and I know it take to fly from some very famous people in this debate but we're nowhere near close to General AI X you don't have to worry about it even our lifetimes really it's so overblown it's a it's another It's a combination of Cassandra complex you know it's fun to talk about the end of the world combined with a God complex like people have lost religion so they looking for meeting in some kind of end of History the reason why doesn't a is coming anytime soon because a lot of advances in so-called AI today or what we call Natalie AI machine learning not like what is that object on the screen or how do you find the signal in all that noise there's nothing approaching movie called creative thinking to actually model general intelligence you were into all kinds of problems first we don't know how the brain works at all number two would never even modeled a paramecium or an amiibo let alone the human brain number 3 there's this assumption that all of the computation is going at the cellular level at the neuron level where is nature is very parsimonious it uses everything is disposal the lot of Machinery inside the cell that is doing calculations that is intelligent that Disney accounted for and the best estimates are would take 50 years of Moore's Law before we can stimulate what's going on inside of cell near perfectly and probably a hundred years before we can build a brain that can simulate inside the cells so putting it at saying that I'm just going to model neuron is on or off and then use that to build a human brain is overly simplistic for the more I would posit there's no such thing as general intelligence every intelligence is contextual within the context of the environment that sin devolve environment around it but I think a lot of people rappelling General AI the burden of proof is on them I haven't seen anything that would lead me to indicate we're approaching generally i instead we're solving deterministic closed set finite problems using large amounts of data but it's not sexy to talk about that if you you're talkin about mirroring the actual abilities of cells or are you talking about recreating the actual mechanism like what what what about going on inside cells and in biological organism that we just don't know how intelligence works we don't know we literally have no idea so most of the way I approach has basically say we're going to try and model how the brain works but then model at the neuron level which is saying this neurons are on that neurons often combining their signal but I'm saying the neuron is a cell inside the cell there's all this Machinery going on that's operating the new on that is also part of the intelligence apparatus you can't just ignore that an extract that out the Marlatt down to the in inside the cell level it's also part of the biological organism itself because it has all these needs that you know the biological organism has to have food and raston exactly is a bouncing on but when you eliminate all that when there is none of that and it's just calculations and we get to a point where it's just this thing that we've created whether he called a computer with a doesn't have to be moving thing even but a thing that you created that Wars virtually all the information is available in the world start stores all the patterns of all the thinking of all the great people that have ever lived all the writers all the people that have ever publish anything all the people that were spoken any words stores all of their points all the Counterpoint other contradictions applies logic and reason and some sort of sense of the future and start simple upon these patterns and then starts acting on its own based on the information that's been provided with well first you would have to actually simulate a structure of the human brain that can hold all that information you make me some tens of thousands of brains worth of information or two or three yes but what about something that recreates the abilities of a brain didn't like I said nature is parsimonious so we'll got 3 pound wetware object that can hold all this data Nature has been very efficient in evolving, how we get there I just don't think computers or anywhere close to that like they can hold that amount of data would that complexity would like a holographic structure of the brain work in recalling many many different ways and then I don't think you can evolve a creature to be intelligent outside of the boundaries of a feedback in a real medium like if you evolved if you graze the human being a concrete cell no input from the outside they wouldn't have any feedback from The Real World they drive all properly so I think just dumping information into into a thing isn't enough it has them environment to operate in to get feedback from it needs to have context biological I mean what if you if you have just the all the information that people have accumulated and the lessons that people have learned and you program that into the computer like if we can take a computer that can beat someone in chess the real question was we make some sort of an artificial intelligence could beat someone at go Which is far more complex a chat they figured out how to do that too and I was a giant shock right these are still men made very closed bounded games they're they're not they're not on the road to the unbounded Game of Life they are completely artificial but this didn't go didn't that give you a little bit of a pause a little bit go is not go or League of Legends of fortnite they're not completely Mystic Ryan but they're still very artificial of area bounded games being good at go doesn't mean that you can then suddenly figure out how to write great poetry by creativity for sure is something that's the Last Frontier so I do believe that automation over long enough. Of time will replace every non-creative job or every not creative work but that's great news that means that all of our basic needs are taken care of and what remains for us is to be creative which is really what every human wants I will replace every non-creative job or every not creative work but that's great news that means that all of our basic needs are taken care of and what remains for us is to be creative which is really what every human wants when what are you doing right now the creative job sure</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> station now it works if it's it's been a lifesaver for me oh I do it and I I do it whenever I get like spare time I was at the doctor's office this morning and I knew was going to be 20 minutes so I just sat there with my eyes closed for 20 minutes and I meditated you know when I was growing up there was this statement English Pascal he said all of man's problems arrived because he cannot sit by himself in a room for 30 minutes alone and it's very true I always need to be stimulated and the iPhone came along border I would never be bored again I'll give you for standing in line on my iPhone and I thought it was great when I was a kid I used to try and overclock my brain., thoughts going to think it once the answer is only one but I would try that I think multiple thought that was another you're out of that has proud that my brain was always running with engine was always moving and it's a disease it's actually the road to misery and now that I'm older I realize that you actually want to again rest your mind you want to learn how to settle into your mind now I look forward to confinement you leave me alone for a day it'll be like the happiest day of had in a while and that is a superpower that I think everybody can attain the superpower of learning to be alone and enjoying it yeah yeah and I do think that this these times will you just think about things just be alone and think about things are so rare these days and I think during those rare times is when you really get to Stan what you actually believe or don't believe yeah it's it's fine when I first started meditating it was really hard right cuz everybody I think a lot of people who are looking is broadcast ever heard of meditation that has a good wraps everybody tries it this struggle the kind of give it up it's one of those things that everybody says they do but nobody actually does right it's like not even sugar everyone talks about hell yeah back it's not even become a signal anything where it's like oh how much did you meditate the other people not wearing headband saying with three birds that chirp at night when they're deep meditation I don't know I don't know how they make it work but I got a lot of trips today how many trips did you get the art of doing nothing important because I think when we when we grow up right it's all the stuff happening to you and your life and some your processing some of your absorbing and some of it you should probably think a little bit more about and work through but you don't you don't have time so it gets buried in you it's all these preferences and judgments and unresolved situations and issues as I can email inboxes just piling up email after email after email has not answered going back 10 20 30 40 years and then when you sit down to meditate those emails are coming back to you about that issue have you saw this do you think about that you'll regret their your issues there and back in people don't want to do that's like it's not working I can't clear my mind I better get up and not do this but really what's happening this itself therapy it's just that instead of paying a therapist is that they don't listen to you listening to yourself and you just have to sit there as those emails go through one by one you work through each of them until you get to the magical inbox zero and there comes a day when you sit down you realize the only things were thinking about our things that happened yesterday because you processed everything else that's when meditation starts and I think it's a it's a very powerful thing that everybody should experience and that's when you arrived upon the art of doing nothing while I think it's even a problem that most people are getting their meditation from an app I would like it's Sneaky I mean Sam Harris is a very good meditation if you don't think you don't think don't go to effort into it don't put effort against it all you need to concentrate on your breath or do you have a specific technique nothing all the concentration that you can drop the object of concentration but you can also just try going straight to the endgame the problem with what I'm talkin about which is not focusing on your breath is you will have to listen to your mind for a long time it's not going to work let's do at least an hour a day and preferably at least 60 days before your kind of work to a lot of issues so it'll be hell for a while but when you come out the other side it's great you get rid of the shower or when the chatter comes it's in the background it's dimmer it's smaller you've heard it before you see the patterns it's more recent it's something you need to resolve anyway and you will get moments of actual silence what is your what's your ultimate State when you meditate like is there a state where you've achieved rarely if ever where you just you you're you're in Bliss or you're in harmony or urine Enlightenment like what the hell it's Indescribable because when you're really meditating you're not there when there's no thought there's no experience or there's nothing there's just nothing it's hard to describe but I would say that it's like a you can definitely in every psychedelic state that people encounter using so-called plant medicines can be arrived at just through pure meditation and I've definitely had some of those States you hit some Transcendence psychedelic states where are you not every time I know it's really any fact I would say that that's a that's also like an experience that you can start craving which will then actually take you out of meditation where you really I am not enlightened or anything close to it so the ballpark but my own experience at this is this personal experience is the place where I end up the most that is really the one that I want to be at is peace just peace happy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> with a question of stupid topic but the meaning of life is stupid though your parents don't worry about it understand for myself it's got to be personal right breast establish from myself what it could and could not be and that gave me some level of Peace so now I have to keep asking that question what is the meaning of life God will get why that one why this thing the problem isn't the why question you can keep asking why forever write any answer I give you you just ask why again why again when I get it that's right and you end up in a place called agrippa's trilemma This is a philosophical exercise but questioning why you always end in one of three places first is infinite regress right why because of this why that why the Indus keep playing forever II is circular reasoning will a Y8 could it be a white bead for the day or the third is an axiom and the most popular ask him is God but it could be anything because of math to the science of the Big Bang cuz the simulation right either all Axiom results a stopping point stimulation we're in a simulation or saying it's a Big Bang Theory way of saying God how much anymore but same thing so you end up in one of these three dead-ends essentially right so there is no answer the real answer is because answer we would not be free we would be trapped because then we would all have to live to that answer then we be bored like robot each one competing with each other to fulfill that single meaning more than the other back to signaling like better at that than you are but luckily there is no answer so you just do whatever you want the meaning of life it's funny that that would let us the basis of all existential angst that you don't you don't know why you're here and you have this feeling that it could be meaning less it is I mean if you when you start pondering the the Multiverse Universe the galaxies the solar system the planet the organism the cells inside the organism the bacteria the parasites does symbiotic relationship we have to our environment and you start going Jesus Christ with just a little piece of this thing is like all the answers to all the great questions are paradoxes so for example you're asking like do I matter how do I matter in this infinite Universe well you know on the one hand your separate no two points are the same every point is every two enter infinitely different you're completely separated no one will have your thoughts or emotions you're feeling is your experience of your life is a single player game you're trapped inside your head and you just aware of a bunch of things going on and that's it on the other hand I cannot say the words Joe Rogan without invoking the entire universe Joe Rogan alien comes along says what's that Joe Rogan what's the human what's a human bipedal 8 what's an 8 on the earth what the Earth planet what the planets solar system where were the carbon made inside Stars write his create the entire universe to just say the words Joe Rogan do that since you connected to everything is inseparable so the answer to that question of do I matter is I am nothing and I'm everything and you'll find this is all the great questions the answers all paradoxes which is why it's some level it sort of pointless to pursue them to find 8 right answer like I'm giving but the act of pursuing them is actually really useful because then it gives you certain intrinsic understanding in your life are you connected to everything is inseparable so the answer to that question of do I matter is I am nothing and I'm everything and you'll find this is all the great questions the answers all paradoxes which is why it's some level it sort of pointless to pursue them to find 8 right answer like I'm giving but the act of pursuing them is actually really useful because then it gives you certain intrinsic understanding in your life that brings a level of peace</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> these traps that people sort of establishing their own mind of giving themselves excuses are giving themselves in insurmountable obstacles insurmountable it is so difficult for people to do is one of the most difficult things for people to do is to change the way they are Pros approach reality itself at the end of the day I do think even describe I said earlier life is really a single player game it's all going on your head you know whatever you think you believe will very much shape your reality both from what risks you take and what actions you perform it also just everyday experience of reality if you're walking down the street and you're judging everyone you're like I don't like that person cuz their skin color she's not attractive that guy's fat this person's a loser oh who put this in my way you know the more you judge them or going to separate yourself and you'll feel good for an instant because you feel good about yourself I'm better than that but then you can feel lonely and then you just going to see negativity everywhere the world just reflects your own feelings back at you reality is neutral reality has no judgments to a tree there's no concept of right or wrong or good or bad right you're born you have a whole set of sensory experience simulations and lights and colors and sounds that you die and how you choose to interpret that is up to you you do have that choice so this is what I meant that happiness is a choice if you believe it's a choice then you can start working on it and I can't tell you how to find it because he's your own conditioning that are making you unhappy you have to uncondition yourself it's just like I can't fix your eating habits for you can use in general guideline but you got to go to the hard habit forming of How to Eat Right but you have to believe it's possible and it is absolutely possible I was miserable it's not just the money I got them for the money you got happy before the money mostly how did you get happy before the money you know I just realized I'm going to die again Jesus is a bad motherfuker that's a crazy when I was a great one or another one is next time you get sick you know cuz everybody gets sick every now and then it's like a happy person one ten thousand things a sick person just wants one thing so it's your it's your unlimited desires are clouding your peace your happiness have desires your biological creature stands up and says I can do something I I move I resist I live but just be very careful of your desire it is the oldest most right wisdom desire is suffering that money means right every desire you have is an access where you will suffer so just don't focus on more than one desire the time the universe is rigged in such a way that if you just want one thing and you focus on that you'll get it but everything else you got to let go did you make a gradual shift to happiness or was it a radical change its ongoing it's gradual everyday cuz you were happier today than you were a month ago yeah yeah yeah I'm very happy these days deliriously so it's actually hard for me to hang out with normal people really so you've made a significant shift over the. Of like how many years 8 years and years and is this something that you pursued through certain books or is it just like you've you've made understanding or gain better understanding your own mind and then started pursuing it based on an understanding it's basically you have to decide as a priority and then I tried every heck I possibly could I used to you know I tried all the I tried meditation I tried witnessing you know I even tried an SSRI to see what it feel like how did you know it was it turn me from a pessimist and Optimist but I didn't like the physical side effects nor did I want to be a drug for sustained basis so I dropped it and I felt and every moment and everything that happens you can look on the bright side of something right and so used to do that forcibly and then I trained it until it became second nature so for example like a friend of my wife's was over and she and when were dating and she took all these photos difficult hundreds of photos and then she sent them all to us and my me directions like why are you dumping hundreds of photos in my phone I don't need hundreds of photos after judgement immediate reaction the one that I like right there to me the sink almost everything there a few things that are like high sufferings you can't do that other than just saying all this to the teacher but I slowly work through every negative judgment that I had until I saw the positive and not second nature to me I also realized that like what you want is you want to clear Minds you want to let go of thoughts happy thoughts disappear at ahead automatically but you look like a negative thoughts to positive and everything very quickly you let it go right you let it go much faster simple hacks get more sunlight right learn to smile more learned a hug more you think that you release serotonin in reverse and they aren't just out where signals of being happy there actually feedback loops to being happy spend more time in nature you know these are obvious watch your mind watch your mind all day long Watch what it does not judge it and I try to control it but you can meditate 24/7 meditation is not a sick dog close your eyes activity meditation is just basically watching your own like you would watch anything else in the outside world and say why am I having that thought does that serve me anymore is that conditioning for when I was 10 years old like for example getting ready for this podcast you got ready I didn't I did but I did I did but you did help it and what happened a few days leading up to my mind was just running and running and running and running and every thought I would have I would imagine me saying it to you I couldn't help but rehearse what what it's doing it's just rehearsing all the time to talk to you and then I was even rehearsing rehearsed telling you about the rehearsal I thought it all clean all this matter game and I was like shut up stop it what is going on and it took me awhile to figure out o yeah you know what it is when I was a kid in Queens and I had no money and I had nothing to save myself the way I got out was by sounding smart not being smart sounding smart that was kill I perfected so I am hardwired to always rehearse thing so I will sound smart it's a disease that keeps me from being happy so but when you see that when you realize that when you understand something then it naturally calms you. So after that I stop rehearsing has much that you want to sound smart that that many people do that especially young people whenever see someone who is smart or someone who appears smart they say smart things I kind of want to sound smart I want people to think about me the same way I think about that person that that is my disease that is my feeling there's letters my mind the thing I have to ask myself now is if I can would I still be interested in learning this thing if I couldn't ever tell anybody about it that's how I know it's real that's how I know it's something I actually want that's it's very it's very common to all of us start out a winner now in your life you were to you is because you were looser some point if you had gotten all the girls if you had all the money if you had everything you wanted you were good-looking in in junior high school you would have done anything with your life and you would have peaked early so I could Bruce Springsteen Glory Days song right you to marry your high-school sweet you had all the money if you had everything you wanted you were good-looking in in junior high school you would have done anything with your life and you would have peaked early so I could Bruce Springsteen Glory Days song right you to marry your high-school sweetheart you be living in your hometown you know you be a manager at the local McDonald's what I'm supposed to dream job you had thank God we didn't all get what we wanted When We Were Young out of where you came from</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I feel like there's with many people this stress of this question is also a accentuated by unhappy lives since I unhappy choices but being trapped there's a big difference between not knowing what the meaning of life is and God I got to get the f*** out of this job I have to I can't live my life this way what's the meaning of life if this is my life which is why I always start with look at you rich first practical about it because Buddha was a prince he started out really rich and then he got to go off in the woods and in the old days what happened was if you wanted to be peaceful inside you would become a monk you would renounce everything you would become in ascetic you would give everything up you renounce women men you pronounce children you turn on some money you pronounce politics science technology everything and you would go out in the woods by yourself you to give everything up to be free inside what today will this wonderful invention called money or you can just doorstep up in the bank account okay you can basically save you can you can work really hard you can do great things for society and Society will give you money for giving things that it wants and doesn't know how to get and then you can save that up and you can live well below with your means and you can find a certain freedom in that in that will give you the time and the energy to pursue your own internal peace and happiness so I believe the solution to making everybody happy is to give them what they want let's get them all rich Let's get them all fit and healthy and then let's get them all happy is are those things even possible can ever leave everyone can be rich everyone can exercise to me it's more of a philosophical contribution where for it to have meetings and to be legit can't charge you anything for it but yes everybody can be rich and let me give you a thought exercise okay imagine if tomorrow we could wave a wand and everybody was trained as a scientist or engineer everybody even if you weren't very good you had enough understanding computers you can write in code you can build some hardware and don't tell me people can't do it because they can't best of Eternia softex station that's just you looking down on somebody else they can do it they just have to be educated knock their educated all is Hardware software engineer scientist biologist technician hard science is not the social sciences we would all be done within 5 years robots would be doing everything from cleaning toilets to cooking food to flying airplanes driving louvers and what will you be doing we would be doing all creative job to entertain each other and research in science and technology we would have wonderful life so it is really just a question of Education nothing else scale issue though Avenue you're talking about it as if this would work with 300 million people out of work with 10 billion people it'll work during race with a hundred trillion people that we have the resources we have the ability to universe is infinite resources ubuildit you know have you heard of a Dyson Sphere you know you pulled a Dyson Sphere on a star and energy like that there's so much energy out there one asked for his got all the minerals that we need one son one solar system has got all the power we will need for a long what time you know we can extract it up nuclear fusion you know where we're not that far from those kinds of Technologies working it's just a question of guts and you know and interest like we should be building nuclear fusion test plans on the Moon the Moon should be littered with them for downside bright yeah if you could that work energy through nuclear energy bright like the sun create energy Duke Energy now for transmission reviews for Tom because photons don't interact at the photons are great for information transmission that I should not be for energy transmission for energy creation you want nuclear to work and the problem is because nuclear energy in a we both with a bomb we have dirty nukes all those kinds of problems in Fukushima Three Mile Island Chernobyl we renovate any more nukes imagine it from the first steam engine blew out we said No More Steam Engines for a while very carefully regulated billing laws and regulations you can't innovate that way that's the one the first airplane crash we said no more Innovation airplanes right so we need a way to aerate on nuclear fission and eventually fusion and get them working safely clean the passive failure etcetera if we're going to find a way out of the energy trapped and the best place to do that is someplace like on the moon or Mars do you think there's actually a possibility that they could nuclear power to the point where it's not a detriment what everyone's worried about is a meltdown right now and we do have these old plants that are running that are running on this Earth has 50 year old technology is crazy as they'd there's nobility shut them off right and biotechnology they do now have Gen 4 nuclear reactors that are passive Fail-Safe so in other words when they fail they fell into a pull the plug on them into a state where there's no leakage than no problem there default is a positive. as opposed to the current ones the old ones were if you unplug them and these are even these Gen 4 or just Gen 4 they're not Gen 5 and gen hundred where we a microprocessor is right and that should be something that people working towards I hope so I mean Ideal World we would get it. The problem is that you have nuclear energy on the moon how do you get at home right so what you actually got to do is you got to rev it on the moon and you're using it there may be to launch more satellites more Rockets further out into the solar system and that's the initial use case not Gen 5 and gen hundred where we are microprocessors right and that should be something that people working towards I hope so I mean Ideal World we would get it. The problem is that you have nuclear energy on the moon how do you get at home right so what you actually got to do is you got to rev it on the moon and you're using it there maybe to launch more satellites more Rockets further out into the solar system and that's the initial use case but then eventually the technology gets so good you can bring it home</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> no room for nuance when you're dealing with these political Battlegrounds when when you're dealing with right vs left and one side has a clearly established stance you supposed to take it like gun control debate example that right there's no room for what about mental health what about the fact that so many of these people are on psych medication right what why is that not being asked one of the greatest everybody up and I'll rise yeah and you know maybe you should give 30 million people ssris maybe like 29.9 million or a lot happier and then you have a fraction that commit suicide or dictate You're basically trading the meeting for the variance you have blow-up risk why I stay out of politics largely play first-past-the-post System what that means is equivalent to 51% of the vote in this country gets a lot of the power right it's not like proportional representation with a green have 10% and you know libertarian to 3% or whatever it's just like you're all Democrat and power now or republican because of that to win you have to pick one of these two sides right you have you have to choose you can't just you can't just make you can't just basically say I'm going to be in a nuanced about it you can vote for third-party I have a friend is going to fix that I started this thing called a good party would like to kick-start your vote so you combine all your boats you hold them in reserve and then when you have enough to win then you vote that person in power right you don't do don't throw away your boat but outside of those hacks we're never going to a third party elected so because of that all of your beliefs have to neatly fit in the Democrat bundle all the Republican bundle and so when you get into that tribe if you signal outside of that trout out of that bundle you get attacked so it's literally making you in unclear thinker it's making you into a model thinker if all of your beliefs line up into one political party you're not a clear thinker if all your beliefs of the same as your neighbors and your friends you're not a clear thinker you're literally just your beliefs are socialized they're taken from other people so if you want to be a clear thinker you cannot pay attention to politics it will destroy your ability to think but would dread not disease of scarcity old times and they have starved old times I got sugar that was a wonderful thing I should have eaten all the sugar to get my hands on if I got in a piece of news or gossip that was interesting day. I would have helped my life and move me forward if I'd gotten some brief amount of entertainment weather through video games or magazines or whatever that would have been good now it's all diseases of abundance we are Overexposed to everything so the way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic it is to retreat from Sissy days of abundance we are over exposed to everything so the way to survive in modern society is to be an ascetic it is to retreat from society there's too much Society everywhere you go Society in your phone's aside in your pocket sliding your ears yours being socialized right now by listen to this podcast we're socializing you were programming you everyone's trying to program everybody the only solution turn it off the only solution to turn it off and concentrate on your breathing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah peace to me piece of happiness at rest and happiness is kind of Peace in motion you can convert piece to happiness anytime you want but pieces what you want most of the time that's interesting you can convert piece to happiness in time you want your peaceful person anything you do will be a happy activity and by the way being on social media engagement politics will not bring you peace there is nothing less peaceful right and today's date external problems but there's unlimited external problems so the only would actually get pieces on the inside by giving up this idea of problems who sings you can get Peace by resolving external problems of them politicians everybody like everybody's struggling to do right why you trying to make money to solve all your money problems while you try to win at politics cuz then you'll be at peace because your people will have one it's a daunting task to get your s*** together it's easier to change yourself in the the world that's true and the best way to change the world is to change yourself exactly it's alright yeah it's the only people who are shouting of social media the best way is just to actually live the life that you want other people to live like I went to New Zealand and there's this guy that I met with and everyone's on social media shouting about environmentalism and conserve and sustain this guy's house and he was doing a very quietly or gently he was doing a two-week-long zero-waste experiment he was throwing up nothing so every package that he opened he would keep and he would like clean it up so you keep is Amazon boxes or keep looking at Acuity back if you open the tea bag yet to figure out how to compost the tea inside how to make it to yourself useful how to make the tea bag I go to storage item so there was no trash he was literally living with zero trash waste and he was doing it was really inspirational meeting people like him made me far more environmentally conscious then you know any amount of people yelling at me on social media how long did he do that for I think it was two weeks it was hard what the f*** you going to do with tea bags biodegradable the struggle with the modern environmental movement is that they identify the correct problem which is finite Earth spaceship earth has no. Don't ruin it but they don't have the solution so what they say is no growth no growth no growth on the problem is you got three billion Indian and Chinese who aren't going to stand poverty they going to throw what do you like it or not so you can yell at them you can scream at them you can yell at us and scream it off but that's not going to happen so the only way out unfortunately is again through allergy which is you have to build green technology and I give musk a lot of credit you know for being one of the few people who's out there trying to do that so you build things that are biodegradable and good for you and healthier and everybody wants to be healthier Chinese want to be healthier and you want to be healthy or they want to be cleaner if you say I can clean up your Rivers I can clean up your forests I can have your children not get sick with cholera and diphtheria and typhoid I can kill your diseases that can help make your immune system stronger I can give you quit drinking like that is what causes people to become environmentalist not shouting and screaming at them that they shouldn't grow and they should stop pumping things in the sky and you know they have no concept of that they're generally get out of poverty so I think the modern environmental movement identify the correct problem but then doesn't come up with the right set of solutions are appealing to people people are not going to give up economically growth they're going to have to get rich first both you lower the price of create clean Technologies massively so you basically make clean Technologies cost-competitive who subsist Innovation ideally you can subsidize in the short to medium-term until the Innovation curve is is cross any like Tesla doesn't have any patents right with a Big Freedia give away their patents that's example of how you can do it so you know someone if you wanna get rid of plastic straws yeah you can do it here time is not going to ban plastic straws not until you build a paper straw that is a note same cost good durability and then you in in the new educated in Chinese like hey this is petroleum in those plastic at your dreams the coil is bad for you hear the chemical composition here to the things that are going in your bloodstream and they want healthy happy kids also so they going to have their kids use paper straws maybe straws are the best example of a Dixon class and paper and so on. There's a new technology that was just Rhonda Patrick have an inner Twitter today about their able to convert plastic waste into Fuel and that there is companies that are actively trying to do that now so then that way plastic waste will become valuable and it'll become a commodity and become something that people a resource that is certain problems but doesn't soft it doesn't have carbs are you going to have to step in with other meeting so for example of the Amazon right it was complaining about the Amazon being deforested well you're not the poor Brazilian farmer you're sitting here in your comfortable chair like social media hammering away at the end of the evil Brazilian 44cv Amazon but the Amazon has incredible resources if we really care about it we should turn into an incredible tourist Park and put your money where your mouth is start doing ecotourism in the Amazons are paying for it and then maybe take the future rights for all the pharmaceutical come out of all the incredible plants their start selling those off so that people so that maybe give the pharmaceutical companies an incentive to preserve the biodiversity of the Amazon say hey if you buy this patch of the Amazon you can serve it and you can serve it whatever plant medicines that come out of there that you can then license you get the patent for 20 years or 3 years or whatever so I think there are solutions where we as a first world hours will have money can put our money where your mouth is and go and rescue these kinds of properties that's a variant but I could see immediately pushback from people that don't think the pharmaceutical company should have the rights to this natural plant or the government has it and then the government get the patents and the government will auction off the patents later or they'll worse or their license in or whatever it is right in the problem is there is no really good solution there's a bunch of solutions that also have drawbacks that's life yeah human environment that obviously Ice Cube mortimer's a private property capitalist type Solutions because even though they're not perfect they have been proven to actually work right something is your property you take care of it you're not going to crap all over your own house but it it should probably be temporary property not permanent property you see a lot of countries in the world not doing this no foreign ownership of land thing for example or Mexico has no private ownership of beaches right so you can draw the line at private property capitalist type solution because even though they're not perfect to have been proven to actually work right. Something is your property you take care of it you're not going to you're not going to crap all over your own house but it it should probably be temporary property not permanent property you see a lot of countries in the world not doing this no foreign ownership of land thing for example or Mexico has no private ownership of beaches right so you can draw the line at certain points</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I wonder I wonder who has has won the culture War the certainly a battle that's been won in terms of light control social media controls social media is absolutely Laugh Love Isis unfortunate for conservatives but Technologies of force that also pushes left so if you look all throughout human history like the left eventually grows and grows and grows right why is that why is it inexorably that as some commentators have Leviathan slouches left violin is the government why does it smell left and I think a lot of that has been because of technology technology has made it so that it makes more static industrial revolution technology we all band together with a ward of the state right contraception is a technology that it kind of helps clean left where it takes away from the family unit abortion is a technology but it wasn't possible thousands of years ago for technology actually empower the individual the individual means that you have the breakdown of family structure and religion all that and I'm not initially opposed to that it does mean that there's a leftward shift to it now we are getting a small set of technologies that actually can take you more right word encryption is an example because encryption makes it easier to have privacy it makes it easier to have money that is outside of the state Guns 3D printing of guns an example of a technology that is more of a rightward shift but generally technology leads the world left yeah it's it's also usually Highly Educated people that are involved in Tech call Jean the first place and I think when you look at universities in particular they tend to lean left in this country as well well universities universities very interesting University's first one you know became the Arbiters of data and intellectualism and what the right and wrong there was a time. When it was like should we be doing that or not well let's look at the University where they have to say what are the smartest people the professors that think tanks have to say and then you who's got the this credibility from the hard Sciences so they got this from you know physics and math and computer science and chemistry because these deliver real things Manhattan Project a microprocessor the space vehicles and so on the electric car so they gained his mantle of authority and legitimacy from the hard Sciences so then come the social sciences kind of sneak in then you get the economy economics in microeconomics is a real discipline real science behind it logic reason and I need macroeconomics which can be politicised little bit more Voodoo and then you get social studies and then you get gender studies and then you get Bubba Bubba Bubba Bubba lot and so what happened is that because we took scientist to be the high Priests of our new world science itself has gotten corrupted and the social sciences and you can tell their fake Sciences cuz of the word signs tacked on at the end have come in and hijacked the universities and become the new think tanks and so essentially what you going on today in the University's is a war between the social sciences in the physical sciences and the crossover point is biology right where you can see like the whole gender is a social construct movement is attacking biology and evolutionary biology just like in the social sphere they're coming after the comedian's right that you can see the struggle going on the universities and I would say the physical sciences are essentially losing that war what can be done or is it just something have to play out is it we have to realize the consequences of the videos of the physical sciences have a reality on their side is not respected yeah but I still have to compute so there's only so far they can they can take it but I do see for example in biology a lot of biologist or facing this difficult thing where they have to say things that they know are not true to keep their jobs like what you had Bret Weinstein on here I know that's eclectically example you know it does just that the crossover line of what is accepting what's not is entering into a biology and biology will probably suffer the most non synthetic biology for example will you know a lot of this will end up in China because it won't be you you won't be able to map facts and reality and actions together you won't really get grants you won't be able to get the adulation of your peers I don't I don't know enough territory I sent that crossover Battleground right now as an evolutionary biology you can Onix lost in terms of gender in the that that sort of that seems to be one of the major Battlegrounds yeah it's also going to happen with blank slate Theory you know Harvey nature or we knew sure it's kind of socially unacceptable to say that you know a lot of it is nature in and not nurture vice-versa depending on which side you were on those kinds of discussions get corrupted something's really unfortunate because that's a unbelievably important thing to understand like what makes a person a sociopath what makes a person a super successful person Nobel winner but what makes a person a drug addict what it would have one of these factors you can't have a reasonable conversation about climate science anymore not a science on most of these topics people are talking past each other Anyway by different things like when you get into you know it when you when you get into gun control for example right once I was talking about the right to bear arms in case I tyrannical ruler or contrast take over the country the other tot the other side is talking about school shootings and you know protecting people in their homes right from crime so they're just talking about two different things and it's just not politically acceptable to the right is talking about you know the other left it like bundling together illegal immigration and legal immigration into one thing on the right sometimes you got racist hiding in there so it doesn't help your cause Bible talk about two different things if we were talking about the same thing which is how many immigrants should we let into the country and you know what are the criteria for that that would be a very different conversation than no immigrants are everybody comes in and then also on the left you know you have this benefit that are is currently coming in illegally is going to vote for the left because of where they're coming from in their socio-economic circumstances to me the test of any good system is you build a system hand it over to enemies to run for the next decade so for example if you want to censorship on Twitter Facebook you should build that system and then hand it over to the other side to run so if your left Winger who's promoting censorship let somebody else running same with immigration if you want immigration system build a system then hand it over to the other side to running dances to me the test of any good system is you build a system handed over to enemies to run to the next decade so for example if you want to censorship on Twitter or Facebook you should build that system and then handed over to the other side to run so if you're left Winger who's promoting censorship let somebody else running same with immigration if you want immigration system build a system then headed over to get her side to Ryan that's how you know it's a good system</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you were one of things you were saying is that you feel like happiness is something that you can learn and then you can teach yourself to be happy even just by adopting the mindset that you are a happy person and proclaiming that to your friends and so you've sort of developed as social contract I'm a happy person and then I have to live up to that yeah I've got hundreds of techniques developed that one well there's just there's social consistency consistent with our past pronouncements so the way I started my first tech company was I was in a important that a large organization and I told everybody that I'm going to go start a company like I hate this place we would do my own thing I'm going to discuss lunch open or six months past 9 months pass then people circuit you still here I thought you wouldn't go start a company right social contract a very powerful like if you want to give up drinking right you're not serious about it but say I'm going to cut back and I have only one drink a night and then I only drink on weekends you tell yourself but if you're serious you announce it on Facebook you'll know your friends to tell your wife you will say I'm done drinking I'm throwing everything out the house you'll never see me drink again when you say that you know you're serious so I think a lot of these are choices that we make and happiness is just one of those choices and is unpopular to say cuz there are people who are actually depressed Neil chemically or what-have-you and there are people who don't believe it's possible because they increase the responsibility on them it says oh now if I'm you're saying if I'm not happy with my fault I'm not saying that but I'm saying that just like Fitness can be a Choice Health can be a Choice Nutrition can be a choice working hard and making money can be a choice happiness is also a choice if you're so smart how come you aren't happy how come you haven't figured that out that's my challenge to all the people who think they're so smart and so capable if you're so smart and capable why can't you change this a bunch of people do that actually take pleasure and being miserable there's something about the pursuit of excellence and of success that supersedes all other Pursuits that in in their eyes it is it is the peak the Pinnacle the most important thing it's not a trade-off I would argue that is not what I say happy happy is one of those words that means of zillion different things like love desire right this is old old Buddhist wisdom I'm not saying anything original but desire to me is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want and I keep that in front of mine so when I'm unhappy about something I look for what are the underlying desire that I have in my being fulfilled it's okay to have desires your biological creature can you put you have to do something you have to have desires you have a mission but don't have too many don't pick them up unconsciously don't pick them up randomly don't have thousands of them my coffee is too cold doesn't taste quite right I'm not sitting perfectly oh I wish you would have warmer you know my dog going to pooped in the lawn I don't like that whatever it is pick your one overwhelming desire it's okay to suffer over that one but on all the others you want to let them go so you can be calm and peaceful and relaxing and then you perform a better job most when you're unhappy like a depressed person if not they're very clear, mine they're too busy in their mind the sense of self is too strong they're sitting indoors all the time their minds working working working there thinking too much well if you want to be a high-performance athlete How could a man ask are you going to be if you're always having epileptic seizures if you're always like twitching and running around and like jumping in your your your limbs are flailing out of control the same way if you want to be effective in business you need to clear calm cool collected mine Warren Buffett plays Bridge all day long and goes for walks in the son he doesn't sit around that costly loading his brain with non-stop information and and and getting worked up about every little thing we live in an age of infant leverage what I mean by that is that your actions can be multiplied a thousand-fold either I broadcast a podcast or by investing capital or by having people work for you or by writing code so because of that the impacts of good decision-making are much higher than they used to be because nausea 1000 millions of people through your decisions or your code so a clear mind leads to better judgment leads a better outcome so I happy calm peaceful person will make better decisions and have better outcomes so if you want to operate at Peak Performance you have to learn how to tame your mind just like you to learn how to tame your body I love what you're saying Warren Buffett might not be the best example cuz he drinks Coca-Cola and you still alive somehow that shows you that low-stress is more like how old is he and he's he's a fairly old man not that the pleasing of the mind is maybe better than him just eating wheatgrass shots and salads and I just being just super worked up about everything it's like if he needs a glass of red wine a distressing calm down it's probably better than you flying off the rails where I and I think that that's applicable not just in business but in probably any Pursuit and I like what you're saying about allow that one thing to be your obsession but everything else is learn how to learn how to let things go pick your battles and we like to think that we would like to view the world as linear which is I'm going to put in 8 hours of work I'm going to get back 8 hours about to put right doesn't work that way guy running the corner grocery stores working just as hard or harder than you and me how much output is he getting what you do who you do with how you do it way more important than how hard you work by outputs are non-linear based on the quality of the work the right way to work is like a lion you don't you and I are not like cows when I met the Grey's all day right we're meant to hunt like lions were closer to carnivore cinar on Novus development and we are two herbivores we don't tell vegans look I wish all that stuff worked I don't want to eat meat future generation will look back at us as worse than slavers you know because the Holocaust was committing the animals but they'll have artificial meat that taste in her healthier is better than the real thing so allegedly but so isn't as a modern knowledge worker athlete an intellectual athlete you want to function like an athlete which means you train hard then you sprint then you rest then you reassessed feedback loop than you train some more than you'll spring again that you rest then you reassess this idea that you're going to have linear output to spike ranking every day at the same lot of time sitting that that's that's machines you know machine should be working nine-to-five humans I'm not meant to work 95 know I agree wholeheartedly but if it's for people that are working for someone there's not really that option so that's unfortunately the the route right that's kind of where my tweetstorm starts which is first of all in the first thing you're going to make money is that you're not going to get rich renting out your time even lawyers and doctors are charging three for $500 an hour they're not getting rich cuz their lifestyle slowly ramping up along with their income and a Nazi weather income and not saving enough they just don't have that little retire so the first thing you have to do to own a piece of a business you need to have Equity either has an owner and investor shareholder or a brand that you're building that accrues to you to gain your financial freedom</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I was listening my friend Ryan Callahan's podcast today it's cows week in review and he was talking about this animal that they this bird rather that people eat and they drowned is bird in brandy they detected so tiny bird each one of them is like a few ounces and they drown them and Brandy and then when you eat them you eat them whole you need everything but God's you eat the the tissue skin that's that's that's where it is what is the name of it what how do I how do I pronounce it ortolan Bunting bordelon and so when you eat it you put a napkin over your head traditionally when they eat it and as they eat it aboard and was the first one to tell me about this s*** that oh no it was Duncan Duncan Trussell was the first person to tell me about the s*** in the cell it somehow or another but anyway go back to that picture with those guys are reading that we could see the go back to the picture with the yeah see how they have those things over they had they put these napkins over their head to take in the Aromas and to trap the aromaz and they also do it to hide their face from God does the idea of these I think it's mostly I think it's Europeans I think it's something that end in France is popular its popular dish and it's it's endangered not endangered now but there yeah that's okay ortolans could Frances Cruz food be back in the menu as French chefs Lobby for order lawn to be reintroduced onto menus we explain why cooking the rare and delicate song bird is so controversial so it's even gross right it's a songbird like how they named it a songbird not it's not a little tiny dinosaur don't know it's a songbird it just wants to sing woodsprite tweet tweet tweet it's a weird little tiny animal says why is it illegal to cook and kill an order on the rspb list their status as vulnerable and throughout the 1970s and 1980s numbers in France to Clyde dramatically as poachers caught vast numbers to supply restaurants where the bird has long been considered a rare and expensive delicacy some restaurants would charge over 50 lb for the dish what is that in girls are pounds pounds pounds what's 50 lb felt like a hundred bucks something like that Francis league for the protection of birds claimed bordelon numbers plunge 30% between 97 and 2007 as many as 1,500 poachers catching an estimated 30000 live Birds a year so it is decimating these f****** things the method of capture and killing them as what's f***** up about it so the Hunter the birds using traps in the fields are kept in cages encouraging them to gorge on grain in order to double their size and it said the Roman emperors stabbed out their eyes in order to make the birds think it was night making them even more okay here goes and then how would they kill this is where the squeamish Look Away what is the name is website so we can people article this was a squeamish need to look away traditionally in France the fat little birds are drowned in a vat of Armagnac VS Cognac or something Armagnac managing their lives and marinate them at the same time killing two birds with one glug as it were it says here in the article friendships argue that it's not a bad way to die quotes bad way to die quotes what the f*** but I suppose it might be less cruel than throwing a live lobster into a pot of boiling water anyway so that's how they they drown them and then they cook them and then you eat the whole f****** thing bones and all in the bones puncture your mouth and s*** and that's part of it like you taste your own blood as you're eating his f****** things yeah people are weird man you leave them alone for long enough then get drunk and buy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> talk about Tony Ferguson Saturday what about that you got any questions we've been working with them in the best shape of his life it's the same Tony that you do you think like I was going to be the same Tony after you know that he had some family stuff go on is it cuz I can change him you know his opponents Tony when it comes to fighting we don't get into personal stuff we just stick to fighting and strategy he's sharper than ever it's not you know you can't guarantee any winds but I will guarantee that he's going to go win a hundred percent Tony that's crazy matchups very good matchup that's like Russian Roulette right now with Donald has been on a tear like the last four fights 345 me and he's just looked so good man the AL iaquinta fight people who know how good I'll is for Donald to handle a like that and drop them and you know really put it to him like the way I'll put it in a steady beat the s*** out of me that's what I was exact quote was I was very complimentary respectful after the fight Cowboys no joke that guy we respect Cowboys f****** ground game a lot and you know we know we did what we could to make sure you know nothing bad happens on the ground you know what I mean but they both have grapes emissions Tony's coming for war like you always done fat camp cuz someone said that he didn't do any spine it was like one of the rumors from someone who knew him I think he keeps a sparring yes I'm never there for the and never separate we don't know I'm never I've never seen him I'm never there for the strike only show up when I scratch his the amount of time they took him to recover a big bear we can bring anybody to spar like hardcore it was just like touching cuz it means letting the knee heal the mass of knee injury and then he had surgery and then what I heard was your ride ignoring the Powerball right yeah well I guess you know already world-class you could do that and Friday showed up against you look like same old Tony it was stunning as you're talking about a catastrophic knee injury and then in six months later he asked fighting a world-class fighter and he's getting his legs checked you know he even worried it might be injured so good in my opinion just based on working with them is it seems high pressure fight people are aren't as the more cautious they don't want to try to do anything stupid or not mean I'm just letting it swing and let me go Tony isn't like that Tony is people want to get to the point where they just unleash and I don't give a fuk and there's a lot of Fighters like that but only when he's in there it's like Nick Diaz they're not afraid to throw anything you know what I mean he goes in there he'll through to spinning elbows in a row he's just having fun it's like she's alive and he's having fun in there and he's an on-the-ground she's not going to be hesitant to do something wild and crazy that's just the way it is man and he thrives in the cage and there's zero hold back he's he's in he comes out guns a-blazing the whole time yeah they're both at the top of their game and that's for sure you know Tony didn't miss a step when he's got that knee injury just very impressive even striking was on point when he fought Pettis you know he knows how to survive man he's a very unusual fighter man very difficult to prepare for cuz I was always studying always adding new weapons to is Arsenal always adding something to his work out routine he's always adding should he has the ability to focus more than anybody I know his ability to focus and you see that not only in you know the Striking aspect of his game or the rest of what you see it in the Jiu-Jitsu that's where I see it is he has so much Focus he doesn't I don't have to reteach them s*** I will show him a very complicated transition of Moves Like the spiderweb doing the Ballinger break there's like four moves you got to do you got to find them it's got to be so smooth and I show him this and afterlife for 5 reps he's got it down and most people are tickets Pick 6 months to get it down to understand it and he just he just doesn't take him long to learn anything wrestling anything new he's down but he doesn't forget it that's the most important thing he remembers all the s*** and you know it's so who's working with him was driving a guy named Rashad I think he was like an Olympic hopeful back in the day boxer we got a whole crew then you don't that's important he's really awesome to really into recovery I can spend some serious time recovering he's got all these Contraptions you know those things that you could ignore my texts and and they inflate and he's peed on that all the time like a professional NFL player you know and Ice baths like you know at massages he doesn't f****** around man normatec done and they inflate and he's peed on that all the time when comes to rehab for any injuries like like a professional NFL player you know and Ice baths like you know at massages he doesn't f****** around man he's he's 100% thinking about and doing something for the fight usually just non-stop you can go on for hours crazy</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> he might be a might be the most powerful man what do you think about all this alien ships going on right now all this UFO ship what do you think that it's a distraction the stuff is going on right now. D class they're trying that's what it is cases that they say listen if anything gets weird we're just going to let this m*********** lose when I tell people listen we've seen the aliens we've got a hold of them we've got an alert Congress we got to talk to people and then people start just forgetting about corruption forgetting about the BP oil spill forget about whatever the f*** is do the aliens are coming they've been talkin to the government you know my argument against it has always been why would they talk to the government another f****** planet like wheat when we visit pansies we don't say hey what's the number one champ we want to bring you bananas &amp; a peace treaty with you I don't give a fuk who the leader is special deals and in one look exactly like you said where there's for distractions and right now they're going ahead with it but you know Wernher von Braun the last four years of his life had cancer and he had an assistant and you can watch on YouTube. Her name is dr. Carol Rosalyn and she said that he kept telling her over and over there preparing act like on his deathbed they're preparing for a fake alien invasion that's what they're doing scare us into a new world order and aliens and asteroids it's going to be an environmental threat global warming and then there's going to be a asteroid threats and then the final one and she says it's in fake Alien Invasion that's why there's movies like Independence Day it gets everyone used to prepare for a new one world government that's what it's really all about the aliens and the Nazis were doing that to the wrong people that they made in the when I was balls deep in the UFO Community we would you know they would they would show us the pictures of German UFOs and in the UFO community evidence that they must have found crashed UFOs and then they're trying to reverse-engineer that's what everybody in the UFO Community thinks but when you look into it dude ever try to scare their own people to look for the government that they're just war is over with an operation Operation Paperclip 1945 1946 we bring it over all the guys that ended up creating the CIA and NASA were from Operation Paperclip so right away so the Germans were scaring people UFOs before the United States were going to be a master of propaganda like Hitler was manipulation of propaganda that'll be the movement there was no way they could pull it off cuz the only way to make a new world order actually happen if you got to get the people to embrace it you can't force him into it so you got a mind f*** them to embrace a new world or you got to make them want it otherwise they're not going to lay in their own little truck exactly when you're in the UFO Community you take that Reagan speech in the UN in from the CFR and you look at that as proof that there's aliens but now I look at that and you look at him and see if our egos are jobs making it sound like humanitarian like wooden all our differences just seen a diminished if there was some sort of extraterrestrial threat was getting everybody used to this s*** we're going to come by the One World on off when you imagine what I told you about this last week you said you didn't see it what does the talking about the military-industrial Campo yes yes yes let me hear this is my friend Steve Hilton show and don't kid yourself you do have a military industrial complex they do like War you know in Syria with the caliphate so I wiped out 100% of the caliphate that doesn't mean you're not going to have these crazy people going around blowing up stores and blowing up things he's a seriously ill people I don't want to say over there wipe that you know Isis they want to keep that where you have people here in Washi wanted they never want to leave until you know what I'll do I'll leave a couple of hundred soldiers behind but if it was up to them and they bring thousands of soldiers in someday people will explain it normal person are you sure that from the actual sitting president of the United States was no reason to say that like why is it why does everything say that it must be an excuse for why he didn't pull everyone out 100% And that's an that's a really over look inside that's part of the problem is it's so many people hate Trump but even when he says something like that that we should listen to because it's coming from the president of the United States while he's a sitting president wise talking about pulling people out of at War and people still don't want to listen because it's on Fox News and because it's the president because people so many people hate the president they don't want to hear about this that should be something that's talked about that the D class is about to happen s*** there you think so well is a d class is about to happen it's you know was that mean everything involved and how the Russian investigation started at the problem everything involved and how the Russian investigation started at the problem they were there's evidence in this is coming with the fisa declass that Trump won supposed to win there's text messages going back between two FBI agents</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> real way to get someone into Jesus's sullied by Jesus's example and be a really good Christian and someone says full body such a nice person say because I'm a Christian and a real Christian is really nice person the person be like damn I want to be a really nice person and they will want to come to church with me on Sunday you got pretty eyes that's going to be cut up out things like that you make a great day man by imagine what it must be like to be a fly on the wall when those billion-dollar preachers just thing must be getting p**** there must be to be a shelf from Czechoslovakia make it because I get put in trances and shittin overacting but some of them are like you know there's a certain percentage of people that are hypnotized in the pro wrestling pro wrestling them they would have believed that was real then missed that and they got they got sucked into like the snake handlers and they go into the audience and they find people that are easily hypnotized right so that I brought a lot of things they do stay let you be aware that they might call upon you and so just to make sure that your story matches we would like to know what whatever happened to you is there something is bothering you so that we know that when Cindy the Magnificent when she calls out to you that your story matches up with a piece of paper this little weird tricks they do with yeah they asked them to fill out these forms talk about your childhood a spell on under spell and they do something under command with without any control and they don't remember and then they get snapped out of it yes all that's real yes degrees but in is real and live audiences which is particularly weird Frank Santos the R-rated hypnotist was a staple in Boston when I was coming up and I wasn't open micro Frank actually even ran a comedy club at one point in time his son is a hypnotist now Frank Santos what he would do stitches Comedy Club me and Greg Fitzsimmons and Nick depalo and all these guys we saw him do this and he would do it on a regular basis it happened every week he had one night a week and it wasn't just that club it was one anyway we could stitches but it was like one night a week at Nick's comedy stop and one night a week we could Giggles but he would get a bunch play the audience and who have a bunch of volunteers who want to talk to you and you get to be on the stage and everybody can't believe we hear anybody hypnotize been hypnotized hypnotize me into this thank you getting sleepy and listen to me I'm going to count to five and when I count to five you were going to be doing push-ups and underneath you is going to be Madonna and she's going to be naked they would do the end it would work on some people look at me because you're not under come on come with me and we'll get rid of them but then some people just be under and you would like this isn't real is this real but then you would see your friend go up there when you knew go up there and you see people see their friends go up there and what they couldn't believe it when the person was really doing it and you can tell they're really doing it may be so embarrassed to be so embarrassed when they found out that they did this were probably people to like what you came in your pants and like some guys would actually, in their pants they would come in their pants he would tell them on my count to three and a number three you're going to come in your pants 123Movies see the embarrassment their face they were bewildered there was so confused with what happened how did this happen but it wasn't everybody with all your prayers. We can go there if there's a I would love to see a documentary on people getting hypnotized in like proving that at 3 on doing different I laid there and he talked to me while I was laying there and want when he was talking to me I knew he was there and I knew I was there and I knew I was just chilling on the couch it wasn't like I was in a trance and I was going somewhere and I was very aware that it was happening but it was like he was put me in his put me in a suggestive State and he was talking to me about various things that I wanted to work on mostly organization and discipline stuff like play my getting things done and my little just want something that I'm only concentrating on and then when it was over was just over I was awake through all of it but it was weird was like a weird state it was like as if like the regular world has like a crazy filter over it like three stone nothing yes it's hard to guess I would probably say Yes sounds like like those dudes that don't remember without getting all that but he doesn't do that though and I think other people can do that I think they do that to some people but that's not what he's trying to do anybody with his I think I'm speaking for Vinny but I think that anybody can allow themselves to get into this suggestive state to get in the state of hypnosis but that's different than the kind of people that will think that they really are having sex with Madonna on stage yeah they could tell people they really do come in their pants like crazy locked in something blocked in about them but it was a hundred percent real you think those people that can't easily hypnotizable can be influenced they can be hypnotized by something on a TV screen but even if possible maybe we're not I don't know what that what is what causing you to go under you know I'm saying like is it just the words glasses and he's kind of like a big guy and I was having and I was overweight and it just seemed real unassuming and sweet and kind and soft and just hello everybody how are you how are you know they just just talking to you and going to get sleepy sleepy sleepy sleepy and not off maybe like woe to do it and he would do it so calmly and confidently and he would do it every week and every week we would watch some people who work on some people wouldn't work on I wonder if anybody anybody can put someone on their trance if they were taught the right way and then maybe you got to do is learn something or is it some kind of special gift or some I bet it's a skill but I bet it's just like having a good personality like some people you want to hear them talk all the time dude what if there's dude like that but the date and they're just looking at girls looking for girls orcas hypnotist and I could hypnotize people and I remember walking by him while he's talking to this girl and she was no I don't want to be hypnotized why I think comedy is a form of mass hypnosis is funny you say that cuz I think that's what's happening when you're locked in like when you're locked in and everyone's locked into what you're doing and you're killing this is these moments where it's like the audience sinks Minds with you like hypnotism is very similar because when you're killing there's this feeling that you get where are you you're like it's an energy feeling it's not just you say say something and they think you're so funny so you feel so good it's like you're riding this wave and as long as you practice the material so much that you know where the beats are and as long as you're so engaged in the material that you really are thinking about it as you're saying it you're not bullshiting them not just saying the words they know what you just say no one they want you to be fully engaged but there's these moment when you are fully engaged and they know you are you you're riding this wave together because you know the material so much so that you can be fully engaged but not have to think about what comes next cuz you know what comes next but you're saying is if you've never said it before and you're thinking of it as if you've never thought of before you thinking of it as if you never said it before and they're locked in and it's like hypnosis it's very very similar as far as I know I mean. I've never hypnotize anybody but I feel like when you're killing it's a state of mind is like you're you're you're achieving to think about what comes next cuz you know what comes next but you're saying is if you've never said it before and you're thinking of it as if you've never thought of before you thinking of it as if you never said it before and they're locked in and it's like hypnosis it's very very similar as far as I know I mean I don't never hypnotize anybody but I feel like when you're killing it's a state of mind is like you're you're you're achieving a group State of Mind with all these people weird</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> like they can do that with anything so we left the Bruce Lee movie with Jason Scott Lee bunch of bulshit it up right where he learn Wing Chun doesn't work on American it was it was in a YMCA he was fighting for the right to teach foreigners Kung Fu cuz the elders that live in San Francisco or Seattle forget they didn't want him to teach foreigners and and they said if you beat the guy up in will let you teach border so yeah. YMCA but in the actual movie to the f****** dungeon dude even the elders are sit up like that that's right Max and some kind of spinal or some kind of brace but so but in the movie The Dude kicked him in the back and broke his back back in the 60s it was like a karate tournament and he did some demonstration it's in front of it's like at the like idjj afternoon he's not doing a demonstration and in the movie it was a real fight and you fight the same dude from the dungeon at the rematch imma just hoping there's a movie coming out about a dude who is a famous actor in the late 60s and early 70s and in the movie He-Man and in the movie there's a Bruce Lee part where he's in a Bruce Lee movie and also naquin Tarantino movie called once upon a time in Hollywood he shows up as like it went with the CGI Bruce Bruce Lee movie all CGI tonight that should imagine how good they are the Illuminati created well they would if they didn't they would let you know hey f******* we already can make movies out of anybody anytime we want we could have someone talk like Bruce Lee look at that without CGI I mean it's close enough is that the new Bruce Lee watch back it up where you at the side what if they're doing like that to me on hold on me that looks what you could do it like that movie Manus was like 20 years ago to Final Fantasy movie where they kids animation but they try to make it look real old people that look real Prince point for Dragons they can make a dragon look real where is like a Game of Thrones so they have the wolves wolves are always just like the hair removed the CGI yet for a whole movie and make him with Bruce Lee's face and do it perfect so they could have done that but then everybody else in the movie isn't like Steve McQueen and all the other famous folks in the movie like are they using different people for that mother that would be f***** up imagine if in the future all they ever make is like Charles Bronson movie Steve McQueen movies Bruce Lee movies and they do it with regular actors in the regular actors get paid scale these are giant on them and they have new Bruce Lee movies and they have some dude would be a lot cheaper than the North Tower Road that added Princess Leia back I think I missed I haven't seen the new Avengers I've managed to avoid all spoiled by when they start doing like a lot. Take Angelina leaves face and put her on Jolly and put it on Michael and Beyonce's body or something that song see how Big O Titties like Angelina Jolie that was a big hit so I can probably got about that yeah Angelina Jolie got some big ass titties that was a song it was a it was like different people that had some big ass titties that was the name of the song</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> did you like the people that really want to believe in Bigfoot or the people that really want to believe in UFOs UFOs are coming back right now everybody to talk to each other almost exclusively about UFO evidence Navy Pilots report unidentified flying objects we don't know what kind of s*** the Chinese have figured out we don't know what kind of s*** the Russians figured out we assume that we know cuz but we did it we didn't let them know about the stealth bomber or any of the crazy s*** they were building Area 51 we didn't let them know do you know me I was balls deep into the you know community ancient Egypt the conspiracy side of ancient Egypt there's the main street in egyptology at the CIA pilot he's saying it so when your when your balls deep in you really want to believe it you look at it that we like look there's all these government officials saying they saw UFOs and they got their own UFO story you know and then you know you listen to Bill Cooper and he was former Office of Naval intelligence officer and you know it and when you hear what he says that he wrote that book Behold The Pale White Horse He is a base on the moon behold the pale white horse he said there's a base on the moon first his dad owned Learjet I forget what seems like a super rich troll I totally his job was to prepare notes top secret notes classified should it for meetings with high-level people in the military and he was based on he was reading was I damn UFOs are real look I have proof so that at first he was like for sure UFOs are real for sure they're hiding that's what he was saying he was preaching that then he learned later they let him whistle blow he never got busted for whistleblowing that they they want him they wanted him to leave that you are so that's what his conclusion was he started to realize wait a minute they want me to leave this and then he he he got to the point where he believes that UFO Abduction like like the key believe that everything was a product of the government all UFO sightings abductions and they're taking you in its GP believes it's like the CIA doing that s*** and that's what he was really about before with you do they put ice on your doorknob or something like that cuz there was a who found something I forget what he found some old thing and as he was opening it up just by touching it was like some old thing it was dipped in acid and he went on an acid trip for like 6 hours so this what they do they do show up they somehow or another dose you up with a touching a doorknob tryna guy Thomas girlfriend can't think I'm f****** hi yes and they did exactly the store so they could do that to you and then sneak up on you with some special effects wear some f****** crazy mask and f****** flashy with lights and you're so crazy high you don't know what the f*** is going on they grab you and put you want to tell a desk and tell you you you've been abducted by aliens from another planet you don't think they did stuff like they do for a fact that he seen the documentary abducted no I have not which one sort of sort of this guy he was married had a couple kids he was tight with the family who had three daughters he was a predator so far as a twelve-year-old and what he did is he like f*** with the mom f*** with the dad sexual relations talk to Dad not Brooke Adam jerk them off bike riding and starts telling her that there's all these alien abductions going on and we got to be careful for alien just told years old so he setting her up so he doesn't drugs her she wakes up she's strapped to a table he's got a speaker with alien Voice is coming out and the Alien and she wakes up you know where she's a psycho my God and this is alien voice says that she is a responsible for saving the Earth she has to marry that dude just a Mary the dude in the alien voice Mary Bob are you out to have his picture can't tell nobody and their drugs I don't know and then she passes out again if she wakes up and she's not strapped she's looking around the trailer and she's the guy he's not he's pretending he's all f***** up and she's like waking him up and he has fake blood on them or whatever and then he wakes up and then she tells him we've been abducted by aliens and I need to have your child did they end up catching him with the girl like a week later FBI gets involved and the girl can't tell anybody or everyone ties Joseph some so she's obsessed now she's back with the family the guys in jail for like a day cuz when you know what he does he he has his lawyers send letters to the mother and father and to make him sign like that it was consensual he threatened to Blackmail so they say they sign go to the next state over but that s*** she's like she's 12 13 14 and she's obsessed with him she has to save the world so that that's an example of and then it turns out it turns out that I think the guy was CIA probably political enemies why would they do that and then Bill Cooper The mutilated cattle thing that are for sale what's really happening with UFOs oshit we're being the government is pretending to cover it up there they want to push it they want people to believe in aliens so what do you think that the cattle mutilations were think they were testing weapons on his cattle Bill Cooper statusbrew was really simple all the cattle were found by military bases and what they do is they went there constantly check checking radiation levels around base is constantly so what they do is if there's cows Delta routinely take a cow take out its rectum take out infection Oregon Surgical and then they dumped them just ask no kill two birds with one stone they really needed to get from radiation to happen but that's always good it's always good to push UFOs is good to scare people with aliens I wonder if those those cattle abductions if they coincided with areas where there was like some sort of toxic dump you know that you live the Sunday examination dump or something like that look anything where do they have more of them around Nevada where they did all those nuclear I'm not sure but adjustable Bill Cooper said was nothing wrong found near military bases and he not like once he looked into his like all I know what they're doing they're checking radiation levels and they're scaring people the same time that makes sense because it was surgically removed right like people can do that like why would that eliminate the possibility of people could do it if we could do it show that they catch poachers that way sometimes they find out where the gut pile is so I say a few you didn't really have a tag to shoot a deer and then you shot a deer and another place where you're not supposed to be but you have a tag in a different place you you just because of the some places where it's easy to get tags you just take the beer out of the Forbidden Place take a picture of it at that and then go back home with a busted people because they like Park Rangers recognize certain mountain peaks and I don't know you weren't there I know exactly where you were when you when you killed this deer you in a different place and then go to a different place and they they look at the pic the picture and they try to coordinate and then they finally got pile and then they convict people approaching that's happened before they look at the photos yeah so like miles away and drop it off there. Like this is crazy there's no blood at the scene of the crime all the blood missing it's been surgically removed like no one give you this impossible. Literally no blood on the ground that because they put it there you f*** you f*** wit you think the aliens came this far to f*** with cows imagine if we went all the way up to like Neptune shoot Gophers we're just going to go up there you go first that's exactly what they thought aliens did that is hilarious hilarious in that regard to do that they did it so many times that it became a thing that people looked for and then they let all these people who believe in aliens anyway that let all these people just student how many liters are f****** hilarious in that regard to though that they did it so many times that I became a thing that people look for and then they let all these people who believe in aliens anyway that let all these people just student</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how many people think that we're living in a simulation really really f****** smart people thinking that's okay that isn't crazy conspiracy theories like people that are not on that side there's a conspiracy theories aside and then there's the people lay on the other side hilarious there's going to be a program but it's going to be able to prove it one way or another who knows but don't talk s*** on a government conspiracy I've never heard I've never heard anybody like categorize people like that based on the people that I come in contact with you like I would say 80% of my students Elon Musk says that we might live in a computer and everyone's like it may be true but through their cereal Evans computer what was the proposed some sort of theory that proves that life is a hologram life is a simulation what I'm saying is it might not be the same people that you're talking about that do or don't believe the people definitely get rigid that's called to believe that you could talk to me like you know Elon Musk said it's wrong it's like a cool thing we will and we all know it we all know it we all know that one day you could be in some this is ridiculous what you're experiencing right now and it could be a simulation yes yes but they believe there's war happen yeah that's what I'm talking about that's like a conspiracy. Should be one of the you should drop its logical to lump that in with all those like 9/11 conspiracy 9/11 friends but there if you look into this scientifically science supported with an inside job someone Inside Job conversation. I'm just using that as an example like as if that's a crazy conspiracy theory but there's a lot of evidence whether it's true or not who knows you know what I mean I think it was an inside job but a lot of people don't whatever but there's zero evidence of us living in a computer simulation don't want to believe that don't want to look at the evidence I'm saying aren't necessarily the same exact people to people to believe when it's information you're right I haven't there's no poll on it I haven't taken the pool I know I'm just going a single 2911 just went you wanted to talk about it so you got us into it that's that's aren't necessarily the same exact people's people to believe when it's Russian you're right I haven't there's no poll on it I haven't taken a pool I know I'm just going to be a season 2 911 just went you wanted to talk about it so you can got us into it that's that's</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what do you think of 5G and all that scared if that's how much long-term testing if they done zero or negative numbers around my family my wife is obsessed with recognizing plates she's always calling at Florida or against her and my son they got a little game they play there always look at the place I'm always cell phone towers and satellite dishes to the southeast for some reason to the North in Southern California that is DirecTV satellite there always wins Southeast all of them great majority of satellite dishes that you see are probably like DirecTV or the other one she did it but I don't know why I don't know why but also those cell phone towers I was on this website called Smart Meters murder.com Smart Meters murder. Do you want to get your f****** head blown off go to that website and read documents that are pulling from different agencies dude back from their documents from government agencies but I'm 2001 July 2001 is like this whole I don't know how big my 400-page plan for the world is a plan for the world of the way you're holding it is quite hilarious it's the perfect like if someone's talking about conspiracy theory and they had a blunt and they're just like in the full bore conspiracy while they're holding a joint so scary dude that you know if you want to look into it go to smart meters. Smart Meters murder.com but it's scary do you have really want to talk about it I have red things were people are questioning that like whether or not 5G is going to be healthy but I haven't anything that verifies it is or it isn't I haven't seen alien incision I need to look into a bit but just in the what I'm worried all told is that I really think that Wi-Fi signals all the various signals that surround us all the time I think they have an effect on us and I don't know what that effect is I don't know if it's negative or positive I don't know if it didn't it dulls the senses it's entirely possible that it does something to dull the senses because it occupies an area if we have the capability of recognizing the fact that they're the thieves you signals around at all times cellular cellular signals radio signals satellite signals work surrounded constantly by signals are we absolutely sure that our body doesn't have the capacity to recognize those signal even though we don't have like a really clear method of taking those signals in and then translating them into visuals or into audio but because we can't like take that Sirius Satellite Sig and then in that have like a player in our head because of that we assume that we're not taking it in and some black that's what they said that's what this report about but it's about the least foggy is when I'm in the woods when I'm in the mountains when there's no cell phone service there's no Radio Service no Wi-fi then there ain't s*** UPS warehouse tablets don't work when someone's in the woods satellites to work you can you put on the roof of your car you can watch TV this new thing is Steve rinella. Our phones work on satellites so he can find a way out of the map if your phone was on the GSP the GPS GSP hours alone when you probably could try to triangulate your position from Towers but you couldn't broadcast is such a gigantic area like you can with satellites you can see satellites of the people that think the satellites aren't real they need to talk to somebody make satellites they there they are you can see them with telescopes they're up there we we we have the ability to tune into the very specific spot in the sky with a DirecTV and you'll pick up the signal that's how you get the signal you tune to the spot in the sky with satellite is and you pick up the signal the real people have and you'll pick up a signal that's how you get the signal you tune to spot in the sky with satellite is and you pick up the signal the real people have a problem with f****** everything that's ever existed everything everything's fake everything's fake</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you know what's interesting to me people that buy dinosaur skeletons apparently there's a giant market for them in China they'll spend like a million dollars and buy a dinosaur skeleton they walk in this motherfukers house f*** your artwork b**** pretty goddamn wood doors and you see a dinosaur in the middle of his front Prince that's what they're going for so they're buying Nicolas Cage return stolen Mongolian dinosaur skull he bought at Gallery will it will be repatriated at work after was bought by the actor from Beverly Hills Gallery in 2007 a T-rex skull wow what he bought it for $1,000 pretty good deal why was 2007 I think you said yeah is a good f****** dinosaur skeleton set design huh giant head little tiny baby arms arms what the f*** is the purpose of those arms I did this the only animal that I can think of that developed that way and was that a plant eater they think by the shape there's some some talk that by the shape of his bone and what he might have been doing was using those bones to crush giant dinosaur bone and that like he might be surviving on dead things yeah and that they also that's what speculation that they might have had their didn't want to know what they really look like cuz I don't know the skin color they had some speculation that they might have had faces like vultures like red f***** up really brightly colored faces though just to let you know they're disgusting and an idiot you know cuz like vultures it's not did the grossest f****** looking animal on the planet all these dead s*** and their big vultures are f****** big that's a big animal walking around we're not nearly as impressed by them as we are with an eagle you see like vultures never going to be the f****** national bird get out of here with that b******* when to start that has brand new deep time to Irish elk Natural History dinosaur exhibit in this some of the highlights of what they have their they have this like t-rex triceratops yeah mean who owns the dinosaur skeletons who owns that the Smithsonian I think is its freaks its US taxes so some of the stuff I guess we technically on I guess I don't know I don't think DC or New York one of them doesn't charge for any of the Museum's I think I might be DCS in Montana they found a T-Rex probably what the f*** is that so it's cleaning it up find something that brings in some paleontologists to start digging they like what daddy with a toothbrush for 8 hours a day trying to find a bone Sam Neill Sam Neill Sam Neill from Jurassic Park Jeff Goldblum sexy jacket and has life finds a way appears world's biggest T-Rex discovered Jesus Christ what is this 19500 they're so weird without big the feet and legs are and the giant ass head that's the thing that thinking like that this wasn't something that chase things down it just sort of bent over and just jacked whatever was on the ground but I don't know if that's like I think there was some speculation cuz there's something about the physics of its body that it wouldn't be able to run fast because it's so weirdly shaped they like trying to figure out why head so big it has little tiny ass arms these big ass legs is big f****** Taylor nothing run what it would and then there's also some speculation that the atmosphere was way different back then and the atmosphere is much more oxygen rich and maybe things just different and I like the physical run longer and Spirit Lake held them up somehow or another I go sticker I don't know what the f*** I think this is just saying that I should have been slower made in the Jurassic Park when they've been running that says running would have broken and adult Tyrannosaurus Rex has legs but he couldn't run because of the shape Google the atmosphere was different during the Jurassic. Because of there was some mean it might have been horseshit was just an article that was written about how like we have to take into account the whole world was like different before that giant asteroid came and f***** up everything and slammed into Chichen Itza and now that a sudden drop in oxygen from roughly 30% of the atmosphere of the atmosphere to about 10% may have contributed to mass extinctions Oso from the impact the dinosaurs whole bunch of different ideas they have how quickly the dinosaurs died off but one of the more interesting ones that I saw it recently was that they all died almost instantly it says it would have made everything more humid with higher levels of carbon dioxide and more likely more cloud cover breathe yeah that doesn't have anything to do with why they moved though it was something about I remember reading something about the way a T-Rex move but it's a f****** mystery cuz it's not like you look at a crocodile you like it uses those four legs to get you his big fat face and I'll make sense thanks I can see with that tail that's crazy. You have to blindsider tackle her get a leg up there getting like that you have to get one of late but then what the f*** you have no arms vicious weapon save it nerd save it nerd what like unlike his f****** giant face filled with huge swords he's got a huge head filled with swords well that totally makes sense we think about like ostriches and s*** like that they used to have wings they turned into those they let me see it again shity arms that makes way more sense that way it's way more sense of the remnants of four wings cuz if you think about what an ostrich looks like you can kind of Morphin ostrich into a T-Rex right yeah I mean they don't have a tail but they do have those f***** up legs legs in a weird body and a f****** head and when they look at you they look at like it look right through you but you don't mean s*** like if you got run over by a truck in front of an ostrich they would even Flinch they don't give a fuk about you I'm just like a dinosaur bird face of zero compassion for you I love when people keep them as pets so you can find buried loves me keep your window open see what happens T-Rex used to look like vulture has a weird one they don't even know they're covered in feathers I think it might have been covered in feathers more recent speculation to think that all dinosaurs were covered in feathers literally is a dinosaur just one that lived when I made it oh that's one crazy looking red-faced there was some yeah that's it right there I have no idea what the skin was like easily could have been covered in feathers is it amazing that every kid I don't know if it's girls too but every boy gets fast any with dinosaurs that is her name is not weird it's like archetype of something deep in your brain that wants to know and connect with Dinosaurs when you're liable for 5 years old because it's such a f****** wild Hail Mary by nature and they ruled for so long and they were snuffed out by a rock I Got That Rock didn't hit her we would be under the reign of these vicious f****** reptile roaming plan eating every word and never evolved where we are we would have been hiding and little holes in the ground would be little mammals this is good as you ever going to get you never going to develop a f****** City good luck b****** Raptors everywhere this running around for hundreds of millions of years we were these weird f****** creatures and then from 65 million years ago that mole evolved into a human being according to these f****** scientist all their fancy weird f****** creatures and then from 65 million years ago that mole evolved into a human being according to these f****** scientist all their fancy they have $5,000 a year that you have to pay for education</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> oh that's why we were talking about I think you had a guest on that talked about how with how everything's getting wrote robots are taking over that's the book by and yang was probably the presidential candidate going to subsidize the the whole population I agree with both things unfortunately that's how I agree that most likely automation is going to take over easy thing when when people need purpose they still need purpose they need purpose now but would $1,000 a month if everyone knew they had $1,000 a month coming from the government would it make you more invested in being an American would it make you more invested in keeping this thing running like you're you're actually getting paid from you looking at the American like it's generating in and you're getting paid from it you getting enough money so you can eat and have a roof over your head like the three of us got $1,000 a month plus $3,000 a month there's a place we can get with three of us is like fifteen hundred bucks a month and then the rest of it we would just put in the food and whatever and that way you can live like that that's that's a livable wage for enough if you get enough people to get $1,000 a month feel about yourself and about your country and this is the question to does that stop you from pursuing your dreams cuz it's not like you're getting 50 Grand a year if you getting 50 Grand a year be hard to get me to work if I just had 350 grand every year like how much do you do really know if you have an apartment does not eat I know folks that are making 50 Grand Lake Dale you know you'd be surprised you'll really save much and you know once you out if you have a car and a lease and either a mortgage and apartment pay my get it I get it but if you had 50 Grand a year will be really hard you to grind and be really hard for you to really go after something just be obsessed unless that's just your style was that's just who you are but I don't know if it's more manageable ways just socialized medicine and make higher education free why would it cost much it cost money to figure out how to make people more intelligent in give you better why wouldn't you want less losers when you want more educated people that have a better understanding of how the world works we need people that understand how to manage and to be entrepreneurial and you know that communicate with just be educated I mean there's more people that are smarter than you have more competition than you have more productivity it mean it would just be better for everybody you don't want ignorant people my son's going to college it's f****** $65,000 a year for years times two kids at $600,000 a year what Americans got an extra 6 so your kid is now saddled with a debt that he'll be paying off forever he's underwater hundred total over over the course of their college careers you have your base and you have to make more than a million to have that by the way just only spending money on that you got to spend money on living expenses and your mortgage in your house so that you know you're really talking about 2 million probably and don't think your kids come out of college into a job is going to be able to support himself subsidizing there owning a car insurance is probably part of the rent for the next 5-6 years and eventually come to visit and if you think about that over over these for years but you really if you want a hundred grand you kind of have to make two hundred and then you got insurance if you're on the market as a family of four to get health insurance in California you're paying $20,000 a year between 15 and $20,000 a year which means again you got to earn 40 I'll be realizing I can live in Nevada and not pay any state tax yeah why would I want to pay state tax what am I doing that's a lot of money it is 10% right and then if you live in New York City you have to pay a sneak attacks that's to keep the electricity going for the NM percent right and then if you live in New York City you have to pay a stink any tax is that to keep the rats that's to keep the electricity going for the guys are taking the training from Connecticut everyday and working on Wall Street that aren't they in the f****** city tax</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I just went to a food truck before I got here and there was an Asian girl and like my favorite kind of Asian girl she was ugly Filipino big lips dark tan with Daisy Dukes sandals beautiful feet nice pedicure and freaking out it was just me and her so I couldn't stay there and it was so painful you're like you're fighting your neck like don't f****** turn keep your head straight years was interesting this is the Dynamics is this a difference in men and women if we were just describing this exact same thing but you were a girl and you're describing a guy it would be innocent Aquaman oh my God knows you think he looks good movies he looks so good in real life sweetie I couldn't stop I was looking right at his dick I looked at can I look this face I love this dick and look and he started smiling when I start nodding and no one would care now and you say that girl's liberated she's afraid she's crazy wild on the way out to call the cops right but if I think this is something that as men this is us a shaky one because there are definitely some fake male feminists they're they're just doing it because they want women to love them and they say a bunch of s*** that really screws the curve up cuz you're being honest and being rashly have to realize that the way a woman purse he's being hit on is going to be way different than the way a guy does cuz the girls in danger she's in potential danger like legitimately like a view or some f****** serial killer psychopath and you decide to follow her back to her house that's on the menu that's on the menu how rare is it that you need a girl somewhere back to your house and kill you clean wuornos that monster for the Charlie's Theron movie life that men became at me a big lesson in that man I've known guys and watch them as they got older and like failed relationship after failed relationship with a started developing this like resentment towards women you know this is like a a deep-seated like f*** them all they want is this now they want to cuz what they're getting from the women all the time is negative beginning rejection cuz they're trying to get laid the touch him and women and they eventually develop this thing where I hate your name for those guys know there's like an online me and yeah yeah insults or guys who I think mostly they're talking about like a lot of genetic deformities or whatever reason or maybe there maybe they're even neurotic to or they can a woman and so there should be a place where a woman can knowingly and confidently and safely be a prostitute yes yes it should be your option the problem is we equate prostitution with two things are horrible sexual abuse and sex slavery sex trafficking we we we equate prostitutes with those think that's why I like when Robert Kraft got busted one of the first things they said is this guy's a billionaire and he was participating in sex trafficking but then they had to drop that I don't know if you know that now has no sex trafficking there prostitutes there was women who wanted to have sex for money and he said they weren't dating come over in a CDL tanker and slept in the know they were prostitutes yeah you know and it's their choice and they you don't hear much about that does the sex trafficking was like a big think I think to get him to plead guilty and they put it out there and they said you know there was shaming making this big deal with this guy paid to get his dick touched you know here he is what is he like 78 years old eight-years-old something like that this old guy just want to get his dick touched he paid it was a Deal's a deal she probably did it 13 times a day before him you know me that's what they were doing that place they were jerking guys off but people kept coming back why they keep coming back cuz they hated it why they keep coming back as with a rip-off why they keep coming back because as adults they want to get their dick touched and this woman was willing to do that and she yeah is that a bad job is a job so is Wendy's so is being a dishwasher those are terrible job to do you want to do you want to be the guy who puts the coal. The f****** Taran the streets in the hot day do you want to be that guy sucks do you want to be a guy who works in a gas station we constantly stiff and fumes f*** that that job sucks La job suck Isaac feel the same way about prostitution I feel about massage it's like if you can pay someone to touch your feet and rub your feet you can pay a dude just be rubbing your feet why can't you why can't I touch your genitals turn on dyed T-shirt with the tour dates I want to come take it to her and like because of the connection I kind of knew him so if you want to come take a tour of the ranch Nike let me call my wife and I called her and I go can I go I just want to see it then you can go can we go off and we walk in and it was like one room had like a f****** trapeze in it the other one has a hot tub they all have different like themes to them and it was like it wasn't a skanky that's not what it was pretty down and dirty was like trailers but they were clean and while I was there a doctor showed up and they gave them all f****** they check their snatches for whatever they had a little kitchen at date somebody cook a little snacks for them they offered me some I said I'm going to pass and then at the end opposing side to goes by the way Greg take any of the girls on the house and I go well that's I've never been with a prostitute before and it wasn't cuz of a hundred bucks I wasn't waiting for a freebie and but the girls were they were happy they keep 50% of the money they can't use drugs on the premises they they can refuse a customer and they come and go I think people should be able to do whatever they want that doesn't hurt people and think that falls into that category and I think it does provide a service for really frustrated man they can't get sex any other way and I think it's stigmatized I think it's stigmatize in a very weird way it's not a good job I don't want to do it I don't want my children to do it I don't want your children to do it I don't want my kids to work as a dishwasher either I don't want my kids to be a coal miner those things are real jobs you know I just don't that if we had different attitudes about sex we wouldn't look at it as harshly we look at is as horribly as we look at it we look at it different because we think they like intimacy is connected to romance and romance is connected to this emotional connection you have with this person that you sharing pleasure with me that's that is wonderful but physical release is also very important for men it's like very important and it's very important for everyone to be touched and some people people don't want to touch him it is not doing so good not a good spot they don't they're not physically attractive whatever it is whatever the movie ever it for some people and they have a desire and need to be touched and it f****** Rex them to the soul when they're not touched all the time they constantly walk around filled with resentment filled with bitterness we just quietly in rage inside if the hand that life has given them and for those people if you had legalized prostitution if it was like someone who like you you could conceivably friendships with these people that you're having sex with if you wanted to do that like I knew a girl who when she was younger she was a sex worker and she's a I might even reveal her it'd be too obvious or Truvia what she does but she did it for a while when she was like young and she f***** some older guys that would like to know and their sixties and s*** they didn't know it you know they had the money but they didn't have the time to date and you know maybe they had a wife and they want to have sex with someone on the side she would take money from them she liked it to look at the great way to is a lot more money not that big a deal because I knew who I was doing it with and I like wow she's smart you know I mean I don't think everybody has that attitude and I would never want anybody to do that doesn't have that attitude but if you're one of those girls is like hustling maybe you don't have a family that backs you up I don't have any sit like you know they're and his friends have some of them have like a girl in New York and they pay for her apartment and she's going to college and he New York 7 8 times a year when he does she freezer calendar and goes out to dinner with him goes to wherever he sleeps there they have sex and it's a comfortable working relationship so I don't know where's the where's the problem with that was the victim right permanent of all the moral and immoral things we've done especially when it comes to sex that's just sexy Fox great everybody wants it but everybody doesn't get it and sometimes people get rejected so cares all this weight and so it's it's like a bit and then you're not supposed to do it cuz God doesn't want you to or I could get pregnant Jesus Christ you pro-life or pro-abortion illogically your brain is going in a we got a f*** okay I got loads building up I got to get rid of these things you know like I just have a bit called jerk off first then think about it was with my advice for everything cuz it's only moments in life will you jerk off first and then you go you jerk off person you still want to call someone you really care about them you love them it's right not just lust yeah that's empty bags at that like I reset the clock one nowadays I pop in 24 hours did leave me alone 24 hours right not just lust yeah that's it that's empty bag think I was never good at that like I reset the clock one nowadays I pop in 24 hours did leave me alone 24 hours</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> problem with history right like who knows what the f*** Lincoln said all we know is what Lincoln wrote okay when you have Lincoln holding hands was boyfriend going for a walk through the garden but you just making s*** up you make me for long periods of time in the same bed but apparently people did that very often back then for warmth cuz you lived in a place that was made out of wood that you chop down your f****** self should have been for 4 years so that's what I just told for 4 years in a row have to share a bed with Lincoln he was f****** huge years old strong to the wrestler you know think about it in context right I think if you go back to the Greeks and the Romans gay sex was way more common new was like almost everybody was half guy right and pedophilia was just a normal thing young boys like if you read Socrates Theory the history of of him or of all the scholars and like really respected thinkers they had young boys that they would bang so what was what today is a horrific crime against humanity was completely normal back that so when did that stop went to do to stop by and dudes and did they just kind of do it and not talk about it or was it it seems like Christianity first brought about the shame the sexual shame that we have today so I would probably trace it back to like 2,000 years ago if you hear the question how much of being gay is stopped by society's expectations like what is the percentage of people who are actually gay who just can't act on it because it just brother their mom or their religion or their church that go to or there they got married they had kids but they really want to be gay how much did that exist what percentage of all all the gay activity do you put on a pie chart how many more gay people would there be if it didn't warm to there's no options from religion no expectations from your community we're running bottom just like when your water boarded you'll be talking to spasming uncontrollably who said that's what a lot of the guys are into unfortunately just set the big in return air on the community water board and waterboarding it's the New Black it's the new thing yeah it's the rage it's all the rage nipple clamps and</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what is it with it with MMA what are what are the big nationalities is that a good question Russians Russians are murdering it right now there's a lot of bad ass Russia's wherever life is hard and going to find Fighters and you can find people that survived where life is hard and Thrive and then that's how you get like a khabib nurmagomedov yet a hard motherfuker who knows how to fight and it scares the s*** same thing with Conor McGregor you get a hard neighborhood hard life you know growing up in Dublin dangerous fighting since he was young you know that's how you get these beasts and then the American MMA guys come from wrestling or the military right some of them some of them for the military units rare you know we had special forces guy like Tim Kennedy of course we'll probably the most famous Brian stann also a military veteran and you look at these guys that are you know the guys are capable of being SEALS or Rangers or Green Berets there are just Ali humans they just did the people that know do things and push themselves in a way that other people don't sometimes that translates or the fighting sometimes doesn't just don't have the physical capability of it like they might have the mindset to survive War and the ability to get through Buds and to get through grueling physical training but he ain't being Jon Jones you know like there's just levels to this thing this genetic levels you know Jon Jones has like some of the best genetics ever and then uses them as good as anybody that ever existed bastard controlling disc ball time you got two brothers in NFL players so this like super genetics in the Wright brothers NFL Stars that's amazing and he's the baddest light heavyweight of all time and he's smart so it's not just physical it's also an intellectual he's also set straps for people who measures only sees what they're doing and he feels and weakening pressures and put heavy pressure on people he knows when the Ebon flow he's just a genius at fighting do light waves have longer careers no no the opposite I would say the bigger guys actually have they they can compete at a higher level deep into their thirties and even 40 the granny Kotor think I think he re won the heavyweight title Wings 42 check it out anymore Knockouts with heavy weights but they their bodies maintain what got them to the dance later in life like George Foreman George Foreman won the heavyweight title I think he was 46 when he knocked out Michael Moore the oldest ever heavyweight champion and that's just unheard of at welterweight you're not going to see 46 year-old welterweights winning the world title against Earl Spence Jr someone that I used I can see that 4343 Brandi was yeah that's crazy that's crazy old 43 you just don't you just don't 25lb no one wins the title at 4 system apps almost helped you survive something like that I also think they lose less as they get older news 4445 so yeah George Foreman was the oldest ever heavyweight champion 45 crazy that is so unusual is maintained a world championship caliber skillset deep into his forties was Bernard Hopkins and Archie Moore when Archie Moore was younger that was he fought deep into his forties as well but he was just a real crafty veteran he actually also trained George Foreman so like that crappy veteran trained George Foreman to be a crafty veteran put his hands up like you didn't know how to fight enormous man with enormous arms so we needed to stack them and top of each other and walk towards you like that it was his weird offense and he learned that from Archie Moore part of the part of his defense and holding his hands up in a weird way he learned from Archie Moore 43% Dana Chara what Slovakian that dude is from The Lord of the Rings Legolas list of that name they gave birth to him in a meadow it wrote a horse out there and they predict how long he took him up with one hand watching him with the other lifted him off the ice with one hand I saw one thing the guy did it's really f*****-up a guy hip tossed a dude he Judo through them like you swept him like he grabbed ahold of them swept his leg out kicked his leg out like a hoochie Mata and slammed his f****** head onto the ground is rough on ice rightly use some really f****** sneaky s*** you know he had a really great clips of guys talking to each other before fights and it's amazingly come they literally go like a they want to go and then I'll be like y'all go and then they fight and then they threatened tennis players that fighting is players that don't and if you're on if you're on the ice with another goon then it's it's expected that you guys are going to fight some point slippery floor you're seeing way more guys who have boxing skills turn that punch over like I know what a punch there's not as many overhand so you're all you do with the overhead door in the guy in the helmet with your fist the other flailing sometimes you don't see that sometimes you seen guys we throw f****** straight punches and you don't know how to fight in and then this guy knows how to do that while he's out yeah this one boom boom boom fan punching in the face while he's punching you in the face to its chaos video to watch I can't show it people at home of might have seen this but the puck literally flies and hits him right in the face and he barely moves as a day or two might have shown again in slow motion right here check to see if his teeth got knocked out oh man that is hard while I can take it against the blues but the Bruins are how to win the Stanley Cup which means Boston to win the f****** Super Bowl the World Series and the Stanley Cup in one year remember when we live there they couldn't Winship it was like they had such an inferiority complex will the Yankees beat the Red Sox they'd never pulled it off and then that Bill Buckner thing go back to just so sad that the thing about being a Mets fan we had season tickets since I was a little kid and so when they get into the World Series and surrounded by assholes watching games and I'm sorry for from Boston take it the f*** easy about your sports are so loud like like last night with it with the Bruins game they they boo the entire they introducing the blues they boo every f****** player it's just it's barbaric animals so then f****** Buckner who's this storied amazing player who's a journeyman it's been out there forever they put in the first base used to be an outfielder but he he slow down either he had bad luck with first base he gets a f****** ball hit to him and he missed it and they f****** there were death threats they dropped in that year you went down to South Park tuck it in Rhode Island's play in the minors they showed up there and f****** terrorizing get to move out to like Arizona. Hyde says he's f****** Boston fans yesterday lost yeah walk in the street yeah we're so mad it was all anybody wanted to talk about all right because they hadn't won a World Series since 2017 or something it was crazy obsessive martial arts in Lake 881 so by time 86 rolled around like what the f*** are you people paying attention to some guy dropped the ball he going to be okay but that same year I believe it was that same year the Mets lost to the Bears in the Super Bowl and a guy was on the biggest blowouts in Superbowl history year I believe it was that same year the the months that the Patriots lost to the Bears in the Super Bowl and they got it was one of the biggest blowouts in Superbowl history</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think it's an interesting time for people to communicate though I don't think anybody is ever really gotten to the bottom of things in later I mean in then in the past the way people trying to get to the bottom of things now this lot of noise with each other or even the way people are examining government and and examining foreign policy and examining the the Office of the President examining voting in the electoral process this is things are people are in analyzing now and looking at it I think because of all the other chaos of the internet we kind of lose sight of all the crazy s*** that's doing like it's doing so many different things and changing things so much that it's it's rewiring the way people are looking at the world South yeah and that's why all these f****** drugs are getting legalized the giant part of wise psilocybin is getting legalized now it's decriminalizing marijuana been decriminalized left and right it's because people here people like you and me and anyone else that has a brain that understands about drug laws here I'm talking about and you know this is pretty lock people up for mushrooms and you should take them take them to probably fix your brain to probably give you a new perspective and make you realize you were being a dick it's half of what's wrong with us we're just worried about how we interface with each other and we can the internet is giving people insights and information that's changing the way we live I think so for sure I think the access to information because the stream is so large so much nonsense comes through it that you you can lose perspective of all the positive changes taking place because the internet all these drug legalization think I don't think would ever be possible without all of the information that's been distributed online whether it's through videos or through people talking about or podcasts or routines or just fax with fact-based you know news organization start putting of the who's the real facts about marijuana and you know and fatalities and this is this Visa real facts about where they're always going how it's going right now to fun cartels and how this is crazy because we're literally creating an organized crime Empire because we're making something and everybody wants ya wash it with propaganda like they couldn't have had a just kind of decide what narrative gets played out a newspaper can't do that anymore stories versus facts yes I did and it's the Noah Yuval Harari write stories Trump facts and they basically we are a culture that human the human species has always believed the meth whether it's religion whether it's a political Dogma that we are more apps to ignore facts that don't support a story because telling facts being factual is difficult because sometimes that fact doesn't jive with what you thought was true and that you have to rectify that and that's hard and so it's easy for us to just say you know where all Jesus came and when we die our sins will be forgiven and we're supposed to do this and then if facts come up gate how how long ago man you know all the all the things we know from archaeology that negate everything is in the Bible then the story you still have 60% of it of our country doesn't believe that the they think the planet is 6000 years old I think it's 46% yeah but they won't denounce the Bible do they really had a gun to their head they really think that I don't think it's that high I think it's a lot of horseshit I think there's a lot of people that say that's what the Bible says is that what the Bible says about a good boy you know the every 4 years of government puts out an environmental study that is done by I think 12 different departments in the government and it's considered the quintessential update on where the environment is internationally and that came out in November and it was damning about pollutants and the administration put it out on Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving at 3 in the morning and they buried it in it is everything about global warming you ever needed to know and they're no longer calling it global warming there are no longer calling it's no longer fossil fuel its freedom what is the new thing they're calling it something like that name of fossil fuels this is the trouble wow translate from Team America World Police type s*** and it's like people that deny global warming it's like the facts are there in a few wealthy anyways denying that the planets warming I think they're denying how much of an impact human beings having whether or not it's worth changing the way we do in Industry whether or not we need to impose more restrictions on exhaust fumes in factories how much your drip drop by factoring that pillowing smoke and how the f*** are we allowing that yeah there's places to this day will you drive there and you go oh this group gets to pollute the air that the babies breathe they do for his business whatever the f*** they're doing to make the tires they get to pollute the air what is the worst polluter like when you drive by a factory you see those smoke shooting in the sky with what the f*** are they doing dude cruise ships I think I rather than number one polluter we did a thing where we try to figure out was it with who was it with someone was explaining how much Devastation cruise ships do in terms of the amount of fuel did they burn and the impact that they have in the fact Autos Valentin Thomas was it her we were talking about like each cruise ship like how much actual fuel to burn off is preposterous I think I read their the biggest burners of fossil fuels in the world giant f****** metal thing in the water yeah you're trying to push a f****** rowboat it's a lot of work it's a lot of work were they built something like the Titanic metal you have to be on the side of the boat size of the Titanic even God can't sink a ship that that's a quote someone said an employee if I don't know if it was written on it was written 11 launch code who's 1911 quote rowing 1911 watch a cruise ship loot as much as 13 million cars in one day is what this video is called Trump zero Trump

		<div class="paragraph"> listen to me about music listening to music to in a plane while you're high to set an extra impact like headphones on a plane surrounded by all these people but no one's talking lion thousand feet above the Rock's music kicks in something about old music to for me like like lately I've been getting into a lot of like really old rock and roll just imagining what it would be like to like to be around those people own and I'll see Keith Richards and Mick Jagger in the 70s you don't see Little Richard to see James Brown by Hellyeah hard to really historically put into place cuz it wasn't anybody like them before that no no rock and roll Stars no rap stars maybe like 70 years old I keeps evolving to bother you feel like music in general my favorite genre is like pop music like I love anything that could be considered pop because it changes with the times but you have these megastars you know what I mean who just transcend like he's bigger than just music neither I mean like and you you become a legend like as time goes on but like to be a living legend like living in those times and to be around those people in a really here to music and experience them and s*** like that I feel like that s*** is crazy and it's like a it's a gift like for the fans it's a gift to be that person is responsibility as well but just like to be the one Night by Beyonce you know I mean like that s*** is crazy to me like to be the one we're going to play it anyway and they play Michael Jackson and we like wow performances a kid so he works his whole life to get to be what it will look like 30 or something like that when you I would have loved to have seen him live before the controversy Rhino just to just experienced him as an artist. Have anything attached to it is what he did or didn't do I don't know what he did right you know I've no idea right doesn't look good right I would have loved to have seen him without the burden of that show me I must have been insane like he was like a different word for work you know because sometimes not work right price for just it's way better than work he's a different version of a different word for a star yet cuz he was like a supernova some rare thing yeah yeah yeah I feel like every musician has a choice like if they want to go there with it right like the Elton John's in like even my prince and s*** like that they stay true to exactly who they were not that Michael Jackson didn't they truly was but he put himself into a purse up out there for the world he did everything he had cartoon sneakers f****** dude on other people's music but like yeah hell yeah he was doing I just think there's no roadmap for the poor guy right you know when you're living in that fantasy world and nobody else can understand right and there's no one before you and then you everywhere you go people screaming he never had a break crazy. What's up I wonder if that would that would be like until like if Michael Jackson came around today and didn't exist before he would for sure be a huge star but I wonder if it would be as crazy because there's so many more stars now then there were back that because of the internet because I have just more venues now that's for musicians form for basically everyone for comedians for everyone has more Outlets let's for musicians phone for basically everyone for comedians for everyone has more Outlets I wonder if he would be as it would be as insane because back when he was that famous wasn't like anyone that was parallel not even close</div>

I'll be happy to support them but you're pretending that that's a woman and it's not it's a male who is transitioning woman you have an XY chromosome it's a different thing you know I'm a hundred percent if a woman says I want to fight a transgender woman okay that's fine but like four leagues to recognize that this is the same thing and like to sit like it how would you feel if all of the UFC weight classes in the women's division were dominated by transgender women I'm going to get caught up saying something then we talked for you f****** b******* it's f****** b******* right yeah you have to say anything and that's how girls feel right now when there is sports being dominated in track and field that's how I've always been a female and a male dominant sport I've always like when I go into the gym my teammates look at me as a fighter like they don't look at me as a female fighter or anything like that they look at me as their teammate you didn't mean in and I appreciate that appreciate that they tried to treat me as an athlete and and and all of that good stuff but I feel like like at the end of the day like girls need to fight girls and guys need to Five Guys wheat like we have different strengths than the guys doing the guys have different strengths in the girls doing and it's nice for us to have a place so that we can showcase yes I agree I think the only problem that I have with that transitioning thing is physical competition that's it physical competition against the gender that you supposedly aligned with can't do it but here's what you don't see what you don't see you don't see a lot of transgender men who want to fight men you don't see a lot of women who are taking hormones to become a man who want to fight men yeah good luck with that lady's good luck stop this is crazy like this idea that you just magically become a woman are you just magically become a man it's just not true and athletes recognize it and rational people recognize it but there's so much pushback from Progressive people who it's like what percentage of population we've been talking about here it's not even 1% it's it's a very strange thing that it's it's taking over the conversation with bathrooms and competition and sports and so many different things I'm offering inclusive nest fast forward of being open-minded and leg many people do you need some like a false sense of confidence Pete against women that's it's that simple it's really simple and it has to be something deeper where they you know and to me I think it goes back to like that mental like a mental block where you were you need some like a false sense of confidence</div>

In just trillions of dots of all these other galaxies through the known universe I never seen anybody show it that way and one of things he talked about was that the rate of time is not the same for each person even on earth like depending on where you go and what you do what speed you travel at you and I were born on the exact same day we both got to watch and that watch is perfectly calibrated and you put your watch on my put on my watch on the we met when were 80 if I watches are still working the time would be different cuz we've lived through different time and it might be only income or your tiny increment like a second or a couple seconds but enough so that in the whole universe as f*** so while they're watching this thing the whole thing if anybody gets a chance if you that's just one galaxy to the showing those what's up one Galaxy colliding with another galaxy it's f****** spectacular to get in space documentaries so I'm reliable Sports Source you tell me like the good okay spaceship any Neil deGrasse Tyson ones Lawrence Krauss has got some good stuff he's got good audiobooks to that Brian Cox guys as good as the guys he's a genius musician band who's got Robin in and they did they have this like stage show and you know he comes out and talks about things that explains things but explain when he explained that time thing to me that if we live the same life that are watches would be different what is a mate a good thing to see too cuz it's so different than anything else you go to say I'm always at comedy clubs I'm always you know either in the audience around staying so the be there at this place in the audience of this weird kind of like show / science seminar amazing as crazy as f*** to learn and laugh that will help my music isn't a real thoughts come out kids and then we realized there's no getting away if you if you know that paranoid feeling that you get sometimes you get too high if you have that paranoid feeling combined with a science documentary on space and then he realized exactly space if you have that paranoid feeling combined with a science documentary on space and then he realized yeah very insignificant exactly you seem extra high cuz you're high watching space</div>

How many years so you go back 23 24 years maybe at my imagine if you could see what the f*** 24 years from now is it's crazy I relayed it to like when I was younger in the 90s cuz I was a baby in the nineties wasn't even a teenager so 20 years from Deb was the 70s set for that to be the same timeframe like that s*** is crazy to me you really want to know how crazy this man get yourself into like a 1970 Plymouth and drive that thing and realize that in 1970 that's how people drove they drive a Cygnet like it barely knows where it where you're at those cars were terrible as that was just a few years ago in terms of human history if you look at a block of time in history like if you looked a different screen 1820-1840 and our head it's like that's the same s*** 1820-1840 what the f*** was different doing nothing different but if you look at our generation 40 years ago is crazy is crazy have you driven a Tesla not have it break the Preposterous so Preposterous car what's the deal with them then that's so fast it doesn't make sense every other car you drive afterwards will feel stupid zero noise this makes noise rap music video Entourage style girls are under Warehouse is dancing bottle of champagne girl in my house Tesla's oh yeah yeah it's a spaceship its next level if you think that they're holding back anything in the automotive World Drive that thing and you lie so that's the thing I feel like all cars are going to look a like in a girl look like Tesla's so I can have the super fast one for like the elite motherfuking but they don't have like regular ones and then we're all going to have the same card we're all going to have the same phone while going to have the same watch and we'll all cuz it controls everything like they control your house so it's like everything is integrated TV the Xbox looks like you all wanted in one so the only way to do that is for everything to be the same so like if the test was that a lie never drove driven one but if it's that it'll I don't see why people wouldn't be into it like it's just a pain in the ass is it takes a long time to charge all kind it is I mean even if you have a Tesla Supercharger thing like I have one of the wall mounted charger that's it's like more ant bite it's nice but it still takes a few hours to charge if it's almost dead whereas you can get gas in like 5 minutes exactly do portable chargers no power I don't like auto drive so I f*** they got those tracks on the side so that I can look how fast that should drink Wick especially when it's in ludicrous mode that's what they call it now they have ludicrous plus I don't even want to turn that s*** on I don't need that what kind of assholes are unhappy with ludicrous mode Xanax before it don't you think there's some car company trying to beat them right Tesla sports car looking spaceship that goes 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds it's a spaceship suspension that's the Tesla Roadster I like that it's a dope looking little car the roof comes off too that's real demon that thing is a demon that cause hahaha I just seen you seem like the future but it died again that one's going to be interesting cuz it at 600 miles if I think without 317 the ones they have now are like 3:17 smashing smashing if you one of those people that makes those things like that's your jaw feel like this like really a process like scientific like you know cuz you don't want nobody to hurt themselves I mean you know what I mean so you have to get it just right short was like what's the process of that like what are the f*** are they doing like with technology in and electricity in a car it's going to be so fast guy have health and safety Jesus Christ and I have these things if it seemed like a futuristic moving and you get them right now it's crazy up like it's insane because people like okay where we going to be without transportation we got to go somewhere right we got to get there somehow what is this Jimmy I thought I saw something about a Lamborghini electric car but this fell into this whole of the terzo millennio some new it is electric car by Lamborghini that sell feels it has some sort of carbon fiber technology that allows it to itself if it cracks wants dry I don't know if we go it's a f****** Transformers there we go if you'd want to go on a long trip in a Lamborghini you're out of your f****** mind that thing will leave you in the middle of desert thinking bee play The Wheels on that thing what the f*** is with those real wow that's crazy and Italian spaceship your cars are getting closer and closer to

		<div class="paragraph"> is that right now I am worried that people are eventually going to all be living in some sort of a VR world yeah I mean I feel like it's designed to move that way like you know what I'm saying like you give people something and they're going to use it Sofia Tiaras awesome do you ever do that there's a thing outside of Disneyland where you does a VR game you go through go to episode of they have a like a giant room and the room set up for the the void void VR Star Wars one and there's a wreck it Ralph one okay I mean and while you're doing it you like this is just step one exactly this is going to be is saying it is one of those pieces bits and pieces like they already have more you think that really really yeah it's the best again that's in competition is getting better and better all the time but that's the way to look at it because they put it up I just think these people are very competitive the money is in getting the best s*** out the quickest okay and they're all competing with each other so they're putting out by the bootleg version and letting somebody smarter test it work it and make the better version and they'll come back and do that later well that definitely happens to I mean that's what China does better than anybody alright it might be so f****** dangerous that they don't know like how it wasn't out exactly so it's like they give us like little bits and pieces of it cuz like lettuce need only spoon feed it to us so you don't kill us just go crazy and it's like you know what I mean like and just give them that like you said give them this version of it you know what I mean by for like this more well I think when they when you really don't know what the f*** is going on that's what military stuff I think military stuff like weapons and you know space ships and aircrafts at the developing we don't know what the f*** have no idea but I think with things like consumer electronics like technology I think what you see yet I think this is as good as they can do anything now they're working on the newest best s*** but you know that's coming around there was there always constantly development other there's no way they would hold anything back really think so happened quick right they have that is in my opinion they just don't give it to us that all that stuff I can see your argument because it's you're in a war they might have better batteries or cut the military develop some new kind of battery that's possible but there's so much money in batteries like there's so much money they had a better way of doing it if Samsung came out with a phone charge 100% in 30 seconds and Apple would have to do it after figure out how to compete with the right they would have that out and hold onto that I think no one would hold on to that cuz that would just dominate the powerful right the sound the sound and f*** you know to look at music what is this the R17 Pro which accompanies latest the fastest charging smartphone the world it advertises that 35 minutes is all it takes entirely fill up a dead battery I was 7 months ago so all phones out there that can charge in 5 minutes there's not a million where I heard they can't source that much more than they might have a hundred of them around the military that were talking about right right bro like car still move off of gas like that shouldn't like the Stone Age bro like schitt's movie going electric you know what I'm saying like that's awesome spaceship s*** so they mean like at the end of the day like they have this s*** they just can't give it to you because they they're killing people testing it's like it's like food before it comes out it just crashed into the wall if you know what I mean if somebody died in in there like what we can put this on the streets yet this like all that s*** energy like what you think they have a car that's so fast I can't put on the street they had I just feel like transportation in general technology or whole experience technology technological the f****** word is it was like you used to have to have the service to pet Two-Face on now everybody can FaceTime you know what I mean it's like people don't even call each other no more they just FaceTime so we feel like a man we came up this is this is Mama by like we feel good about that we feel excellent about it but there's more I feel like I just feel like they're just sitting on it you know what I mean you're waiting to give it to us I don't think companies have any reason to do that they're the only reason to do that would be to get rid of stock of the stuff that's already selling they'll be the only reason cuz sometimes our companies announced a new product common people stop by an old product like Corvette is having a problem with that right now okay cuz the Corvette a lot of people don't want to buy them because then there's a new Corvette coming out in like a year right that's a mid-engine total read new designed I want to be stuck with the old one got you get weird might be holding out on what they're about to be able to do but like we saw that foldable phone at Samsung tried to come out with and then they had to take it back because it was so defective so many of them were breaking Rajan embarrassment and they pulled the whole thing right now they're trying to rework it and figure out what to do with it that that's like only have something like that happen and that's the number to smart phone company in the world are number one right Samsung's number one wildways number to Apple number three number one cell phone manufacturer in the world and they got that kind of a f****** his know what they're not holding back anything I don't think so I think they're trying to sell the best s*** they have right now and then they're in development with the nextlevelshit right now but as far as like what they can bring to Market and then they have is what they bring them didn't used to be able to do that now they can just touch the glass and it reads it I'll hatch it is like they just trying to get it dialed in to the point where they could sell it to enough people and doesn't break like like that stupid folding did you see that folding screen bike like you said there's like the people who just freaked out about whatever is new right right and then there's like s*** that really moves the imps and like like really changes s*** you know what I mean and there's a huge difference between those like you got the people who just want the new shitt and then you got motherfukers who's actually like doing s*** that changes things forever like streaming change music forever you know what I'm saying so it's like me discs and all that other stupid s*** that people are trying to do to change music it didn't work you know what I mean and it didn't exist was like the one thing that stands out and changes things forever that's what mother f****** remember I don't know if they're holding it or not it is what it is but like there's some smart motherfukers who designed this s*** for us you know what I'm saying and at the end of the day like do you have people who just consume it and they're just do you have people who just consumed it and there's an old man I'm here for whatever whatever let you know what I mean and then I feel like there's a lot of people who understand it and know how to play off of you know what I mean those people's emotions and then that's where you get like and I mean what we have now</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now people get to Cielo Caleb Jon Jones is out for all that time for other problems and then for the drug problems like this is a lot of money that got lost from you probably like tempered him I still have this gift of incredible Talent natural-born fighter he just knows how to fight some guys they have all the technique all the talent but they don't know how to put it together Sean knows how to put it together that could be the building to be getting bombed and it wouldn't matter he just beyond the bag working on his technique in the sport and our error it was like Anderson Silva Mighty Mouse Jon Jones rise up and it's he just it's almost like he had cheat codes like you to see what they were doing I'm just like okay well I'm going to do this and I know you going to do that and pop there goes and he just figures out wonderful to watch though because opened up like a door for all of the rest of us fighting I feel like with any good fighter when you wash them fight it opens up a door in your own mind like oh like that's possible and so feel like what Anderson Silva did that a lot with his movement with his head movement with his variety of of punches and kicks and the angle that would sit came in from you know and I don't know I feel like Anderson Silva did I feel like Rhonda did that with her Judo feel like when she did that with his karate and then you know I can go down the list of list of everybody but I feel like it's kind of like goes in cycles and watch them and I can implemented things I feel like that's why I've been able to be in the game for so long and then still continue to grow and evolve because I get to watch other people and the things that they do in like add that to my to my to list you know nobody move better than the sky like he doesn't get hit hope he gets hit he is rare like every three or four fight someone catches and like John Moraga caught him with a good straight punch like that that's like that was the last I remembered I'd like to see him run it back with the ones like couldn't be a nicer guy like if you didn't know that he was one of the best fighters that's ever walked the face of the planet you go out of this friendly guy seems he's so nice and normally talks like he's articulate it doesn't talk I mean person who's just it's a great it's a great example of like something is contrary to the stereotypes of people think of when they think of cage fighters like something is contrary to the stereotypes of people think of when they think of cage fighters</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> exactly what about and Rajan and Rose I was scared I was scared really bad landing landing on her neck like that was terrifying like way to cheer until I see she's okay cuz that can impact you seen the photograph of the landing itself I mean it's it's one of the worst way to get over land she's essentially head-first with a neck sideways and drop she doesn't Lisa leg and she holds on the Camorra switch you just can't do just can't do it got to let it go and what she she's she's held on a things before and you know and caught armbars and triangles and one of those things you make mistake Entourage that was crazy I feel like Styles make fights and it was the perfect fight for and Josh to Showcase her knockout power because KK is a pressure fighter and she instinctively will go forward and throw when she is in danger and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't you know and she throws hard obviously a couple times she's dangerous but yeah I think Styles make fights and that's that's what happened with her and that situation what do you think and Elevate roads that way and drop on your head when you think about how strong you have to be to do that you know the division is actually probably good cuz it's exciting cuz it makes things up a bit you have you wanna who is the dominant Champion for so long rose comes on to Pete's her and then Jessica dumps Rose in her head beats her and a fight that she was losing me is like it's a hotbed of talent that 115-pound women's division is amazing right now really is completely trained and we get better I feel like what's going to beat on Josh's Rose had Rose was doing exactly what she's doing I think that Rose actually kind of got up a bit just a little bit complacent and like she's even said it herself it was a moment of of laziness the legs when she's attacking the Camorra she was elevated and dumped and and and I'm sure for a lot of for Camp she's she was able to do that with with her teammates and it probably pop off good submission you know but in the moment of a fight for a championship belts in your hometown against person that's bread-and-butter is Apollo Drive you know it's just like Stacks up against you for sure how to find someone as strong as is her outside of maybe Valentino who she does train with I mean but Jessica Andrade is probably one of the strongest women in a hundred fifty pound division she's so damn strong so good luck trying to find someone to replicate that and training don't train that strong woman hairstyles different to the counter fighter and she picks and chooses when she wants to go and if she holds you down are not on Jaws of takedowns take her down and you know in a lot of ways you want to also showed how to beat Jessica and Rodger you know she's going to be there a difference with your mana and roses that Rose because this is just my opinion because roles has it has shown to have more variety in her in her toolbox she's a really good grappling in this not that I don't think she's as she's not set of hesitant to go to the ground I feel like if if the situation allowed it she would go to the ground and even get a submission Anand Raj whereas with you wanna she knows what she has to do to win and she'll be stubborn in that sense and do that for 5 minutes for 5 rounds consistently you know what I mean and I feel like with rose she's she will she'll take rest and and a lot of times that does work for her you know sometimes it just doesn't yeah that was just one of those times to see her talk about fighting. That she doesn't know if she has that in her anymore just to be mean to a person to hurt a person I thought that was really interesting looks like right well now I know that I can and it's kind of like well I've already I've already accomplished what I wanted to accomplish I don't know maybe that's just me thinking out loud of what maybe she might be going through what might be going on in her mind you know you have more motivation to defend it the champ and I want to say two fights ago we started implementing visualisations of me being a champ and defending about and how that would look like you know and higher my for psychologist and yeah so that that makes the mountain higher you know it's like it's not the end</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> there are there's quite a few women's MMA fighters now but it's still small in comparison to men when you meet young girls that look up to do recognize that the you have you have a very is a very critical and it's a very small role there's an in small in terms of small amount of people providing that role as Role Models two young kids that are thinking about fighting when I girl meet you at the karate hottie like is it is it weird to like what is that feeling like to you when you meet a young girl and say oh my God this is me when I was 16 that I've touched people's lives you know my parents you know that are happy that I'm pursuing what what I'm pursuing even being a mom you know so I think that's really cool just because I feel like when I was pregnant and I had my first fight back when I was 10 months old and I was still breastfeeding I like breastfed her I was 25 when I had when I was pregnant but yeah I just remember being pregnant and being everybody talks about like postpartum depression but I was really depressed during my pregnancy I mean don't get me wrong I loved being pregnant and there was a lot of memories that I had with her being in my belly and me feeling her and all of this and that that those moments II treasure forever but I was depressed like I couldn't do what I wanted to do it's not like I could go out at 8 and I felt feeling bad I couldn't just do the gloves on and go out and Spartan and hit somebody in the face and everybody and I watched everybody progress and and fight and you know it ain't me alive and I just there was just so much uncertainty and so much unknown with my body going to be the same you know what I don't even want it was I going to have time to do it there was just so much that I didn't know inside was that was really down then and I get a lot of moms that approached me and they tell me that because I went back and continue to pursue my dream that they did too and I think that that's cool amount of time to rebound from giving birth then get yourself back in shape then get yourself into fighting shape where you like I'm ready to take a fight and then trained for the fight and that is incredible process to go through in 10 months and and my games like 50 lbs I gained a lot like I looked like the blueberry on Willy Wonka the Chocolate Factory but that I had her and I just wanted to be a mom I just wanted to be with her and I wanted to nurture her and enjoy my time with her and I think it was after three months where I was like I want to be supportive and so I'm coming to the gym and you know my diaper bag in one hand and my gym bag in the other and my car seat and I had come into the gym and I set it all down and I'd get wrapped up and should be in the car seat which allowed and start to cry coach wink or a coach Jackson would pick her up and then you know they'd let me Spar and you know she needs to get she needed to eat I would go to the room and feed her and then come back and and and we made it work because my joints and my bones were like all spread apart you know I don't know like all the the science behind it but they just say that in order to like have the baby like everything kind of separates from each other your bones like loosen and you're like more agile and loose and stuff like that and so instead of running I would swim for my cardio and that helped me hard on my joints or anything like that and can help me get back into shape and he kind of just you kind of just go with the flow and figure it out as you go it was really hard I was worried that I was worried that because I got back into sparring and this net that I would go dry like my milk would go dry but I didn't it just my body just figured okay this is what what you do and I I still produce milk and everything and it was really sensitive first to get hit and and then I just got used to the pain and then memories I would only produce as much as she needed as well as cool now when you fought incredible for your daughter to only seen you fighting that's got to be crazy to write and you can't remember when you weren't fighting my mom kicks ass they're normal to her. You know she she sees John and Holly and you know that's that's Auntie Holly to her it's so like you know her expectations for for what she can be in life I think her way higher you know and I think because she's surrounded by people like that that and that's why I like to keep around because you know my dad used to always tell me that we learn through our actions are parents you know you walk the walk you don't talk to Talking so I think the best teacher can be my actions for her to see it through her own eyes I can tell her this this in this all day but but it's a different story when she comes to a fight with me and I am the champion of the 105 champion and I'm defending my belt and you know I bust my eye open to the point where you can't see it anymore and I lose my belt and for her to see that and for her to see that mommy's okay and that failure is a part of life and that I still love what I do and I'm going to still go after you know my set of Dreams because failure is a part of your journey no giant stage in front of all these people in the crowd and television that's amazing for her aren't you afraid that she's going to see you get better than this and that but why would you want to Shield them from that stuff I know I know it's it's hard it's a hard pill to swallow you don't want your children to see you her and this and that but I'd rather her see it and be prepared for it you know because life isn't fair life isn't sunshine and rainbows all the time it's a hard pill to swallow you don't want her children to see her in this and that but I'd rather her see it and be prepared for it you know because life isn't fair life isn't sunshine and rainbows all the time</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I think it's important to have fairness and this this is why I'm So Pro Utada I love what they're doing I love the fact that they're testing the s*** out of people that show up at people's house at 6 in the morning hey wake up time for a test is it the same in every country here in the States but in another states is it a strict because it is US anti-doping agency that's you Sada take care of the rest but for me to stress about it is just time wasted I think for myself well I do know of a case where there was a fighter who told me that there was a guy who was openly dirty as far as what everybody knew and he knew that he was going to piss hot so he went and did some seminars in another country were there and the gentleman who told me soul is Matt he's ducking drug test that's what he's doing over there yeah for sure because it's legacies tainted but if you got away with it is it worth it to me how many people got away with it here's the question how many people retired and we never got to see their drug test from 2006-2008 equally taken on like back when they used to have those silly wait drug test for their chest to at the Wayans which is basically intelligence test did the testing today is so much more sophisticated that's why people getting popped for EPO and a bunch of things that we're hard too hard to find the thresholds like this is a Jon Jones tank with a pica grams what the the the insignificant amount in terms of like a performance-enhancing aspect of it that is in his system like how can they detect that what they can detect a because the machines are way more sophisticated the drug testing if he had tested the tested two years ago he would have tested clean but now it's just they're just way better to tell you something even if you're taking creatine and that creatine is painted which is a lot of it with these guys Tim Means that was his deal he was taking a supplement that was painted quite a few guys have legitimately just take an over-the-counter supplement that they thought were clean then they got something just something that doesn't have any effect on their performance but it shows up and I'll show up weeks in John's case like here's been showing up for like a year and a half times on and off and when you're cutting weight that's what it seems to come back that's what it seems to show because your body you losing fat you losing losing body fat stored in fat they think it's very confusing for them there to try to figure it all out and then any all these f****** people online or to rant and Rave about Pica grams in this like a big picture science experts and I think it's I think it's all bulshit that John will have the fight he should be banned for life it's all bulshit the John's allowed to fight you should be banned for life and like you know you're not listening like he tested negative and then he tested positive a week later and they tested negative a week after that like What's Happening Here something weird happening</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> are you from military background my dad my dad wasn't so that's how my parents met my dad was stationed in Germany my mom was fleeing Thailand to her her first husband was like physically abusive to her so she was leaving Thailand and she came to Germany to find her a GI and then found my dad Ryan at the time and my dad was in the hospital and so my mom was taking care of them and get them food and fall in love really long pregnancy just weird this kind of weird I don't know why but then we move to Colorado and I was born a little bit when I was younger and then back to Colorado and I grew up in Aurora Colorado gymnastics as a kid and my parents just we just couldn't afford it was really expensive and so my brother found a little karate spot at the church just across the street and it was a community like a community karate thing and so it's something that all three of us could do and so yeah we jumped into it and I fell in love with it I just it just took over my life and changed my life and I first it's funny because it first so I would do like the the karate tournaments and so there's points buying and then there's the cottages and I thought the cottage were Silly and I remember going in and doing Point sparring and getting knocked on my butt and I like I think I want to do some cottage then I want to bring some trophies home but all the way up until I was 18 and so I did a lot of the flight the flashy like extreme martial arts katas with the like the flips and stuff like that but I always I always came back to sparring because I wasn't good at it that I wasn't good at it and then I found my Niche it cuz it's starting to get to two points to the head for kicks to the head so I would just sit back and let him come and just kick him in the head when the fight so how did you go from that did you go from that to kickboxing or did you go right into MMA like when did you when did you start training MMA karate and then didn't wish you and then I get a little bit Campo and and they kind of do a little bit into kickboxing and so it kind of just happened pretty Strangely I was in college I was working at Hooters and I was doing the Aldi's like little side jobs like doing photo shoes for this and that and I was a ring girl for a m m a shell anime and I remember just walking around the cage and thinking man I want to be like on the inside I thought that was that looks classic I could do it cuz it was mixed martial arts you know and I remember talking to her motor and he kind of laughed me off and was just like whatever you know your ring girl and it was a smaller local show Donald Cerrone was actually fighting on that show and he told me yeah and so he came to my work at Hooters and I wasn't there and he was just like let me know you're serious about fighting get your ass in the gym in Colorado like at that point when I was still in college and I just was not happy in college I was kind of wandering around aimlessly is really successful in high school and you know it it just didn't transfer over to college I still have I got good grades of 3.8 you know I was going to do you but I wasn't happy I just there was something missing and it was it was the martial arts a big part of my life do something physical to probably right I would imagine it's someone growing up doing martial arts as long as you did you like the thrill of using your body and moving around like that it's so important like once once you do now and you compete and it's becomes a part of you the idea of like sitting in the classroom all day and then eventually sitting in the job all day was probably not not that compelling I was going to school so is double majoring in theater and Sport Science so it's majoring in theater cuz I got a scholarship for it and I was doing sports eyes I wanted to be like physical therapist for like a sports team or something like that or even a martial arts team but yeah so I decided to take it like a little bit like a break from that and my mom my grandma was sick in Thailand so then I was like I told my mom I just go with her for the summer in and went to visit my Thailand and all those out there I went to stick your tongue moytie camp and I absolutely fell in love with it they made fun of me cuz of my my Karate kicks and my feet are blistering up from kicking over and over and over on the concrete but I loved it I fell in love with it it kicked my butt and I found out with it and I came back and I dropped out of college and I decided to pursue fighting so where'd you learn training at a school in Vail and so I would I would go to I would I would work on the weekends and then drive up to Vail and train my grappling in all of it like this like all of the anime and so I figured okay is my my my protege Burn It was supposed to be a mature but the girl that are supposed to fight fell through and the only girl that they had available was already Pro she's like to know Pro and of course you know how Donald it was like whatever f*** it just do it you would have grappling nights when we would do grappling but it wasn't anything like substantial so yeah 4 weeks of grappling training and I figured okay you know I'll just use my stand-up to to win the fight and she was swinging from from way back here and trying to take my head off so I ended up taking her down like six or seven times and then winning the fight by taking down and ground pounding did you say why you were doing it like wow this is so weird that I'm doing this it was I wasn't thinking at all I was just in the moment having the time of my life were you thinking that this was what you're going to wind up doing like professionally or we just figured I can't believe I'm doing this those changed names so much fun but never in my life I thought I would would be a top UFC Contender never and on your way your goals be the first Mommy Adam in the ranking explained that I don't

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> really impressive woodchuck handle that lost did you see the way Chuck talked about on Instagram he just basically said you know hey man you know you put yourself out there you go out there you said goals you know you you try and if you fail it doesn't doesn't mean you quit you get back on your horse and yeah I'm get right back to it and I try not to be so judgmental let go of all the hate on all the b******* and I like Chucky light heavyweights he's he was a f****** man-made win-win he to find the early days of the UFC 1 of things about the UFC was like this crazy thing was like cage fighting and he's just got with painted toenails in a mohawk on his head tattoo and he's just marking people Merkin people like was like the first pig big star in a sport to have commercials with an automotive commercial where do you stay at one interview that he did when he was on something guys fight two very good question. If your Dana White what do you do at the end of the physically yeah man he passed the f****** physical so we got let him fight but at the end of the day if they don't have a resource or job from the head man if they are called DJ or truck just like you did Chuckie's and I'm not giving you up and you to find out it's not happening so I went I wonder at what point if your day now that you're doing at what point do you tell these guys stop fighting although I don't remember him that way New Generation remembered for being this guy for BJ the new generation only knows him as losing we known as one of the greats is capable of competing at the level that he's competing at right now he's losing to these guys I don't know if he has because it doesn't seem like he's capable of it yeah and if I look at the BJ that I saw games Ryan Hall up until the time of his legs locked f****** great life but after that happened fast little bro I'm saying he looks like he's fit top fighter but he almost needs to fight a young guy coming up so we can see when he fights clay Guida or you fight someone like that it's almost lose it and then I feel like I don't know I'm going a mail do you think I just saw you can't fight her anymore and now they might go on to other organizations but it's not the UFC so they can go on there and compete but you're not going to tarnish your legacy at the highest level here in the UFC not under my watch know she did a can either could you be like a dude no more we're done what have to be friends of them are girls friends with you yeah you know I mean when when yair Rodriguez 360 roundhouse kick you in the face that should have been the end I mean that will that was you saw that and compared to BJ when bjb Sean Sherk like you looking at a this is a severely different fighter whose family and friends I don't think you should be competing at the highest level the sport but if you still want to compete but who's to say can't who's to say can't go to a small organization and fight for them who's to say I mean he's not parked out you know I mean he's still conscious he's not he's getting beat but he's not getting crushed and not all the fights at least I mean to Ryan Hall one is probably the most he's a phenomenal Grappler and it's super super intelligent guy to but that was probably the the kindest way for him to lose his get tapped real quick rather just get a black belt beat up like Frankie Edgar did to him but I guess it may have a tough job cuz like physically who's Jabba Tota Roy Jones don't go to rush and get knocked out you know I don't know her that's so old repeats itself over and over and over. That's what makes me story show great when they're in their Prime and you're watching on the come-up and so special that's also what makes this sport so f****** heartbreaking to know who does do that the NFL in the NBA they tell you know they tell you now that's it and it's very black and white that the UFC doesn't know who does the best job in that position until they set you up with somebody when they see over and over and over again then we stopped but it gets the artist but the argument is he's not getting crushed it's not getting spark touts not getting knocked out if he's just not as good as they used to be is right now to respect is it out of respect like what is it what he's done for the game he's earned the right to go out on his own note8 the stakes are so high in fighting is different than basketball I don't know whose job is done I don't have the answer. I wish I did I don't know it's just it's the most heartbreaking thing in sports I think I agree and I think with BJ if he would have found and I don't know BJ well enough but if he would have found a passion like I do with stand up for podcasting or something else and I would have been out never come back maybe but the three multiple time world champion the thrill of BJ when he was in his prime was probably Indescribable like what brings Nate Diaz Bakula is Money in the Bank what's going to bring Connor back yeah that money that's what makes it so I don't know stop fighting altogether walking the we find the bump into each other's the other deal that would be cool I mean it's there's a real argument for that right like this is a small window to his life lose the UFC where you just get caught three was signed in paper thing no but man when you've lost to which I did that third one Joe Silverwood tell your man and he told my manager like me next week magazine cover this one you know what's pi over one more like if you lost your done when you've lost to which I did that third one Joe Silverwood tell your man and he told my manager like me Lex McMahon is going to win this one you know it's spray over one more and you knew that was like that was just shot if you lost your done by decision I wouldn't tell you</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> take him downtown and John easily could be 240 lb easily I think what he's doing is just he's going to clean out light heavyweight there's really no one there forms and clean that out and then go to heavyweight maybe or maybe just a light heavyweight and just goes down as the goat and just keeps beating up until I know eBay which is a big F DC connected with that beautiful punch in the clinch but steep a has had over a year to Stew on that it's been driving him f*** increasing good thing I think it's good think I'm not worried at all about the Google psychotic supper fight for DC look if Donald Cerrone was taking a year plus off and then we're going to fight for the title block who I'd like Donald get a fight in kind of wish you would do that you and I are off on this f****** break and not fight Tony and a three days notice so I would take a break in three weeks but when Donald fight a lot as long as it doesn't that's what he wants he just likes to get in the groove he likes to stay active I think for Steve baby Champion do that though name song is done it Go by measurements the most like the most like active I think John is trying to be really active I mean think about whole divisions and dip out and leave them like the f****** Queen of the dragons Okay George St-Pierre fought 15 title bouts for the record of the fights that's crazy Mighty Mouse right onto that with 14 Anderson 13 the differences with all those guys you know I mean that's all different eras different division in garam eat everything because I think what John is doing the current air is more impressive not Randy or George or any Anderson did on right now you don't Johnny Walker he's so far removed right now he has to get by maybe three more guys for we start me like I might be a threat but he does is crazy start start Khalil Rountree with an elbow and the clinch remember that yeah that crazy this kind of elbow one of them bad boys the dishes Kayo's him with that and then Kos Misha cirkunov with a flying knee right to the f****** freak he's a freak but he hasn't done it like John has to Shogun Hua to phone you know there's no comparison to anyone who's ever fought in the light heavyweight Division and John Jones right now there's no comparison dedicated in discipline with his diet have DC fight against EPA and says they fight happen is a July July okay so what if DC says okay August September let's let's plan for New Year's Eve with Jon Jones that weekend and he takes a week off those two f****** Mardi Gras whatever f****** want to do or drink some drink some beer serious diet with a real good nutritionist she's going to check his macros make sure he's eating healthy food you think that's wise not being John know but I'm saying where he could get down to 205 healthy where doesn't have any eat look Daniel Cormier if his anything's ever held him back he's he's not the best at his diet and incredible I don't know that's some people say think about that thing about the most shredded guys in the UFC 205 with no problems where he could go to war for five rounds of the Godlike Jon Jones without weakening him I don't know if that's possible you might be right I don't know if it's in his DNA the powers there did the the I still think he'll be an underdog but it did that Gap Narrows that had waiting at light heavyweight it doesn't switch at his age I think it's even further apart now. John's being more active while maybe want to do that to prove point cuz you repeat that. On heavyweight light heavyweight at heavyweight dude you're the champ John if you want to have that likes to fight that rubber match go to even though he's to do there and let's see what happens if CSI DC dude if you beat John at heavyweight and ride off in the sunset game-set-match best of all time to ever do it right like how about this Tito Ortiz right now owns Chuck Liddell right Chuck Liddell smashes him two times when they're in their Prime but then Tito knocked him out and Chuck look terrible t Okay owed him it looked really bad and talk will never fight again and Tito will always sleep at night knowing he just f***** Chuck Liddell up you don't even think about it you got it back you got it back in a big way you see what I did back to where you wanted to write up some of the right hand and put his lights out and then punch him a couple times when he's out and that's a rally in for DC it's like he even after the John lost you went on dip f****** heavyweight Knockouts some can argue with the best UFC heavyweight and for DC it's like he even after the John loss you went on the f****** heavyweight Knockouts to pay some can argue with the best UFC heavyweight what time you want on the beat Derrick Lewis do so dangerous yeah and then you pay for a second time what the f*** you do you know what I was really impressed with</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so was there some other good fights that happen this weekend I'll do half El dos anjos vs Kevin Lee yeah I think Heavenly should go to Faraz zahabi that's my advice or Jackson slow the reason why he is cuz Kevin Lee Steele said is very similar to George Saint Pierre turn of the takedowns no one knows how to coach that better than fry sign because I do not bad at all so incredible mental coach call as soon as very close for them to shame amazing amazing guy until he passed away and then it was like he was like I'll just stay here in this together this kind of ragtag group and we'll figure it out and do you have seen such a high-level to compete with the guys he's compete with you got to have a good camp man like a legit Ya Head Coach leaders no disrespect to any of small camps or small gyms a little bit by Kevin is 26 right so he's got 10 years has lost what's 3 hours last for not good with that chin before that guys and pretty spectacular fashion right Robert Foles his death had a tremendous impact on him as a fighter as a person and then he fought really great Fighters 2 on top of that you know and a like whentomanage me from the job of that fire from the baguette going to get in without spinning backfist you let him know like this is that you're in a dogfight a dog fight a dog fight these guys have dog fights and when the Tony Ferguson fight he had a staph infection clear 100% And you look good. get no other. They antibiotics just like you said they do but so does this staff especially ones that bad and he's got a f****** a giant squirrel growing out of his tit ever that we can hltc not Sandy do you talk about the guy who do stuff that anyone that goddamn Irina got here it's season wrestling coach listen we would be doing a massive disservice to the viewing public we didn't meant that it was staff it's a far as part of the drama part of what makes a fight interesting but my take on Kevin Lee is he's a great guy I really don't have money games and come out against her the best he's a great person I like talking to me cuz I put them on the food truck. visit the defining moment in a Fighter's career when they realize they need to make changes they're not doing things the way they should be doing them and they need to make some changes. But I think one of the reasons why you care and I care especially with Kevin if it was somebody else some other guys won't mention names with Kevin I go when he can be chance to change a few things well as a skills sign me up is it good person to it when a person talk to me Beaver feel it. He's just got to make some changes and he needs a maestro he needs a f****** conductor he needs a great job</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> always amazing though Holly when he was going to fight that bare-knuckle I want to look at a rent on my main poly or closed when I went on a rant house and I don't think you should do it and if I feel like he's punching down he's one of those commentators is a job so many people want then chorus me probably work together so we're breaking down the Wilder Brazil fight in New York and there was this weird buzzing his I felt like there was this weird kind of course I mean you're telling him not to do something yeah I know so you resisting is idea but if I was doing something you don't want me to do if you're doing something right and we have an open conversation we just don't weird like dude and I want you to tell me if you thought I was talking about but it was a bad idea but I think that the guy like him you know this is. I don't know what kind of options he has no business beating down his door to fight him you know that I know that Connor didn't want to fight him he wasn't interested in that and I don't know other what other options he's got him but also somewhat then that's why I'm in the game boxing fight like this. There's got to be a financial motive for that I would hope that the only thing that makes sense that that's a financial motive Yeah man so it's like to do that you know you would get the payday like automate I think 50,000 for the last fight so it's mostly they paying triple this a pain quadruple say was that f****** $250,000 then enough to do a bare-knuckle fight when you're making six figures you know you could get your face f***** up to that's the reality those Knuckles man I'm I'm I'm changing my tune a little bit but not all the way get caught up more in bare-knuckle boxing but you're also not kicking or using takedowns or anyting else in bare-knuckle boxing I think it'd be way more brutal if their steak down and kicks because what they be I don't think the best guy wins also and Paulie has way more fighting space in art tissue so if there's a guy with a tongue Scar Tissue your face opens up like that looks like a murder scene Charles Manson Murders Holly has way more fighting space in art of rights as yet more Scar Tissue so if there's a guy with a tongue Scar Tissue your face opens up like that looks like a murder scene saying Charles Manson murder say because of the knuckles yeah you might Land seven shots to his two but your face is f***** up</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how about you boys Sage Northcutt yeah Cosmo Alexandre guy he's a beast did he is still in the hospital 17 fractures in his face yeah I know he still alive completely different level but I guess because it was an MMA fight he was going to take it but they did what they fought stand upper management Sage took that karate stance in the dude circled off to his right and landed at f****** right hand and it was on the Bizet the hardest right hand I've ever seen I was just up from a war with Iran and he's circling into the bright and it's like a f****** strong and Cosmos a beast of a man and he's a big thick dude I mean a big thick dude with multiple World titles to his name to let him fight that guy because that because the the kickboxing stand up like him have they do know he's he's very good but these these kind of losses are terrible for a few brews future the mismanagement losses in my opinion I think 22 like look at that punim plans I mean that is Rochas, world-class try not to laugh Full Blast 2 that is a full blast. You can't you can't get hit cleaner than that ultimate in MMA stages and even he shouldn't be in the same ring well, why would I bring this American Star who looks like Ryan from Street Fighter and go pee first fight here's the most World Class Wreckin we on the roster because they want them to be tested and I think that if I was you I would be looking at it like this when a guy like Eddie Alvarez gets ko'd or god-like Sage Northcutt gets ko'd or guy like Mighty Mouse tagged and has a real fight on his hands then we you're showing the whole world like hey these guys that are coming over here they're world-class Fighters they're fighting world-class Fighters getting knocked out I get that on the other it's a great thing for him I think he should be fighting hall-of-famer Bellator champ UFC champ f****** passed him Northcutt you're investing his future he's not ready for the one kind of f***** am an American Market but Cosmos on MMA fighter that's the thing this is Cosmos first MMA fight would have stayed just take some down smashes and that would have been great but I mean that could have happened to see when you would cause. timer for staging like he's older man for like you're invested in that now it just doesn't make sense to me with two giant results over the last two months that one has world-class Talent there and I think it makes people more attention to one not me it put me off of them is a f****** Muay Thai Fighter and that's his bread-and-butter in fights Muay Thai stand-up Cosmo goes and fights in an MMA fight you would think at least one error is going to be at a disadvantage if States age chooses to have a stand-up fight with a world-class identify her that's just bad strategy that states game but he's a mixed martial arts fighter than he should become a kickboxer if that's his game is just a stand-up infrastructure people to just stay a kickboxer because if you're going to listen that if you're going to fight in MMA in MMA what do you want to do in his fight don't you want to win okay good I want you to win his how you win you don't stand with one of the best bucking Strikers in the world how old is he 22 you keep that side stance that's fine bait him in but then shoot and get just get the clenched and drop that m*********** to the ground with where I'm at now I'm with you when she's never done any fight ever has taken got down before manager she's broken 17 places near your crib probably not going well the trajectories off the rails sconce that's true it's just if you look at the way boxing is always done it and it's been often criticized but there's some real good points to add about developing a fighter you give a guy fighter it difficult why do you think that he has the advantage in but it's an advantage that will teach him some things like the guy fight to them was Jimmy Cosmos he set it on his his his what the f*** is Instagram post about it snowed in nose in fight MMA skin knocks out Cosmo Alexandre that just shows you how many levels there are dividend Nikki holzken just lost to read Universal just lost a hand with Annie It's so interesting man when you see levels of pain levels of pain levels and you don't necessarily know that these levels even exist unless your balls deep in the f****** sport like you see a guy like Nicki for her principal Nikki's like one of the best body punchers in kickboxing ever fight as opposed to a Muay Thai fight as well so no elbows limited clenching and you can only hold for like 3 seconds when you throw a knee you can only like you can only hold while you're like stink one need a timer so I thought they have weird rules you know I think the fact that Cosmo Alexandre went toe-to-toe with Nikki Holton Joseph valtellini fight were knocked him out in the last round yeah he's a he's a beast man super super attack title and It's just tough as s*** just the way these guys just check and everything Perfect Defense always holds can also fought Cosmo Alexandre and knocked him out in one FC this is this is It's Showtime and Amsterdam's quite a few years ago it's showtime was the s*** managed to get it on Access TV back when Access TV was hdnet do that Mark Cuban's are Cubans</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> ringside when Deontay Wilder knocked out Brazil I was with my brother bro dude bro dude. Guy it's been a lot of pain inside I've been knocked out I've been at UFC fights reduce get knocked out I have never in my life heard so we get knocked out like that my brother goes oh my God my brothers are brought to do my God oh my God I didn't say I wouldn't care anyway but I was just like oh my God and that's the funniest part is Brian Daly at Showtime to do in between rounds 2 and 3 Jim Gray is going to come in interview about your Showtime special you tell me the day before but I try get out of here huh trying to get out of here I'm telling you man be something special so special man such a good dude you never get Persona God do don't do that I can paint you into that box I believe that's going to just go away but I went to his performance is so spectacular I think it goes away but I think it's also you know I mean that guy if you listen to my podcast when I interviewed talked about how we got into boxing because of his daughter just do it on yours as well talk about that that's insane man you got to imagine he was Bach if using a year-and-a-half a boxing and he's entered into Olympics he's going to be having matches against guys who have 10 years experience easy hundreds of fights 100 and he's not like the slickest guy in the world either so you have to be able to take a shot but he's got two giant advantages huge reach and ridiculous power and I think lettuce isn't because fact that he's not a big heavyweight I don't think it's as tired as they do I agree to 23% how that f****** crowd must have felt I felt so bad for Brazil cuz we're Nexus family I'ma keep such an underdog he's going to get knocked out feeling I think we're going to see that with Deontay Wilder I think Deontay Wilder's a new like Tyson hundred percent I think he's the new independent contractor you know so just don't offer them hundreds of millions of dollars same as they offer Josh when can help he turned it down you know why he wants he wants to fight Joshua win his fight the fury ghostwolf I'm with them that's going to limit me fighting Fury of Joshua from independent I can fight Joshua I can fight Wilder if I was terrified right now. Wilder Fury Joshua fewer I be terrified of that that mindset f****** 12-round when he cracks Tyson Fury drop some like that you look in the 12th round he still has his ridiculous power and he's only getting better but what happened is it's more likely special looking at the way promoters work you didn't get Joshua vs. Wilder before you get Fury do I think so to the Legacy boxing fight each other well it's one of those rare moments in the heavyweight division where you have three unbelievably compelling guys and then one of them was a former champion who by the way the last fight was a draw and I thought he should have been a decision so if you look at it I thought he should have went to decision but I agree with the results to this is why it's real squirrelly Creech because the way Wilder. Heard him dropped him and then knocked him down and almost had him Flatline in the 12th and if you go over the actual count the actual ten count from 1 to 10 from the time he dropped which not with Tyson's sure his job is Tyson Fury's job to get up in the referee says 9 and he did that he did that but if you go by an actual 11 or 12 Deontay Wilder has a real argument that she should have won by knockout his a thing that's why I like to drop every corner of the fight is there should be a clock and then once someone go someone else not the referee hit that button let's go second take extra time to rub the gloves on his chatrak ask him a couple questions you could you walk towards me what's today's date</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I know I am with you that I had to nightclubs at one time but I never bothered with the money part at all I just worried about the stage and in the mic was working and in Vancouver hey tell me when the club the guy want to give you a call and back in the day in a steakhouse in the basement when you can do they want to get someone in the building but that you get it get it go and see you soon as we start being successful because we're paying $500 a month rent so he got you going to meet we may have money in there and that's where I I got the bands you know it's right skills as a musician and singer and all that and then I got offered another cup because it was going under and it was kind of dance club in Chinatown and I thought I'd make a great strip club and so so when you bleed took it over the shame that junk turned it into a strip club Vancouver's first strip club and then you were the proprietor of Vancouver's first eversource on strip club but not stripping she cannot close I know she danced so that's appropriate shows well when I got fired from Old Town because I had to get a green card and not nobody at Motown new with a green card was and so I had to miss a gig at 2 to get my green card I got the green card and I came back and I got fired and so did Berry Gordy found out about you're not fired I said I think I'll stay fired I'm going to be at Berry Gordy I don't work for one and so that I can look out to LA and try to live on the beach and be a songwriter but then my clubs were calling me cuz they needed help so I went back and I turn the strip club into an improvisational Club so we're doing naked Improv actresses they were not cheaper and their lot more beautiful than to talk than they did skits and then they would take off the clothes when they had to you know it within within the script and that's where I'm at teach cuz we had a straight guy and that straight guys wife found out what he was doing and hauled him away and then she came on board as a straight guy and then when whenever like I write yeah he was up there in case of Vietcong attack from the Alaska and so he was hiding in the draft that's why I'm so blessed to know because everything universe and it was from one of the guitar player is getting back then and my reading was Perfection you're going to be everything's perfect you're going to really do well and then Cheech and Chong and all that stuff happened how long between again when you guys get back together 0808 11 years 11 years ago you how old are you there 20 Bobby Taylor and the Vancouver's MIT Jimi Hendrix low and changed our lives this way we looked when we went over there and we can back long hair everybody wore different clothes while I went from this to Comedy like how did you make that leap well nobody really knew that I could talk and I was in a black band so everybody else to know guitar players who I had nothing to say other than that owned the club and no one knew that I was always a backup guitar player when I got into comedy walls was doing what happened I had hired when I turn the strip club into a improper improvisation Club I hired the fact we already had which was a black tap dancer named caps Harris and Jeannie a black singer band until the first get I had tapped the Frisk it was about a pajama party that all the strippers were having at their house after and that's how they always change into their pajamas and in their little nighties and that was very sexy and then capsicums comes by after the show that Universal called in and they say tabs to that number that you did the first time you ever tap dance because usually was just an MC so he did his tap dance and then and it was so good that everybody wanted on car so they made him do it oh okay and so we became Dave was my first partner and so we started we had long hair we're like hippies and so we we we we we did a lot of hippies and DNA jokes and and then funny funny funny guy and so we wrote a Skittle where we were tortured the audience they're all biker mostly bikers going to come to strip bar in the bikers in it and so the First Act we had it because when we turned it

		<div class="paragraph"> anybody anybody with the gun that's a whole thing you know if you have a gun you're not very intelligent because you're paranoid if you have a gun you're not intelligent because you're paranoid having a gun means that you're afraid that someone's going to come and attack you and in so that having a gun is armed teachers got some kind of crazy that that is so stupid and is so dumb just like the ones that know about guns like the cops that didn't go into the school that guy's got a AK you have something that's worth someone else's life then you were ignorant I don't necessarily think that's what they think they don't think that the gun is worth someone else's life they think they don't want to get their life taken by a home addition which does happen did you see that video of the guy that had a raccoon on his boat William self kicking the raccoon off the boat into the ocean into the ocean he filmed it and then posted it because he had no idea how ignorant that was had no idea was a raccoon dangerous was trying to fight yeah you do but this guy right away you freaked out music off my boat look at those the overall this did they have all your pie chart of gun violence in this country and then unfortunately large number is suicides and I start talking about how many people died unfortunately large number suicide by gun and I feel like if people are going to kill themselves the gun that probably kill him a little pills or anything else if they had that as well right and then there's justifiable homicides by the police there's there's people that are protecting their house there's a bunch of different his gang is a bunch of things get lumped in we talk about gun violence but a certain percentage of them are people that are protecting their house or their help their their family from someone is trying to hurt them. I got an application with business with it was a pilot from Vietnam and he has his house but it would be useless because it's so locked away and so hidden by the time anything happened by the time you got to that gun and got up found it and maybe or maybe you keep it right by his bed or something coming in at late at night and you mistake her for you open your mouth and say something and also go shooting into the dark or what if you have Tendencies and and what you're up in Calgary Alberta Canada the gun culture in in in Calgary and it turn me off because I think kids they would take a stray dog and bring them up to the field in time to a tree or something or a post and then shoot him and it got bored waiting for the Ducks to come and so here comes up on your phone picks up the Muskrat as a duck's flew over top of us just stupidity rifle anyway it but when we go shooting we would have to first while we never got the weapon and until we March down into firing position then we're Hannah the weapon and one bullet and then we put the bullet in the Target another bullet shoot to Target and then when we're finished casings and give them back and if so anything was missing left until they found that missing bullet and that's gun safety then the gun was taken from us and put it in an Armory it's only used when you're going to use it you know I just like walking around a skill saw you know if you can have license to carry Skilsaw but you don't have it are Target's well-to-do that your Target in last yeah it's like the bikers Hells Angels and Mongols and I know that appetize recognition yeah that's right Mass Shooters that's what they do it for the name in the paper and look what I did look at you so sanh me about Mass Shooters as it's not guns been around for a long time but this is not a thing has been around for a long time this is a fairly recent thing that keeps erupting over and over and over again I don't know you were too young to remember but when I was a kid the crime Comics were banned you're banned they were banned because you're a bad they showed violence comic books comic books wow and they were people that are up in arms about comic books and now you got video games she's a Superhero name of the movie peppermint start people how can you tell I seen it so many times it wasn't looking for everything we're kids that used to get put under the Christmas tree Six Guns and wear when we're little guys we are we are three or four years old I had six guns strapped to my yourself it'll because Cowboys way Rogers and Gene Autry and that was a big deal you know you had your sister I should have but you never shot anybody you just shot the gun out of their hand in the old days</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and that's why I could turn prison into a religious retreat because it's like a monk going into Hiatus for 9 months you just had a thought in your head that you're going to treat it like a religious retreat and you'd learn about yourself and educate yourself read all the books to take advantage of your Solitude because that's very important when you get a chance to be alone man that's very important time because that's when you connect with do do do do spiritual your spiritual teacher how much they must have felt so good to be released though a lot of sadness a barber cutting my hair perfect oh that's the best trick that you've ever had everything was perfect we exercising I had a little area where I had my own private Studio it was a entrance to the pool hall and not sit in their the echo was perfect you guys had a pool hall tennis courts I got you it was sad you was crying did he have it in there crying anyway I suppose he gets released next month and he was a junkie and he knew that soon as he hit the street he was going to die news going to die and he did as soon as you get this treated over easy or sunny-side up whenever you get all action should be the first guy in mine and you kind of getting ready to sue the doors open man he do said you couldn't run you had a lock until you learn to talk last real fast and he was but when he got released he took his own life Sam just couldn't help himself once cuz I want to see you know everybody's worried about socialism American socialist country in the world there are more people in jail than anywhere else in the world and what's it what is it what happens in jail cradle-to-grave here fed your clothes you told me to wear your Toga to win do prisoners that would go to jail so they get their open heart surgery because the federal law mandates that if you have something wrong with you they have to fix it and so there were prisoners that would break the law so they can get in to get there open heart surgery wow they had a it was weird they had a thing about they would take covers off magazines and you know the subscription cards they would take that up with the acid LSD and ship the the books in there and then next thing you know half a door would be tripping on acid and they're eating pieces of the subservient and that that kind of stuff always went on but as far as how you can read whatever you want it basically you know I read a lot of books in it and I helped a lot of people I would do the itching you know that you changed or I would do these it's some sort of like future reading thing it works first time I did it and anything in-between 67689 I think this somebody that anyway each number tells you what line is you're going to read and you said three times and you write down and then you get a sort of like a plan of what page was supposed to look at and then when you get to page then it tells you you know but what you're asking is because you got to ask the teaching for Watford something you know for instance I threw mine when I did it I to it in the first line said you are in jail for a reason Bible how does it say that it just said it and it says it how is it what are you trying to write it you read it it's been written that book for centuries that line is was in there in that book for centuries three thousand years and that was the first thing you are in jail for recent gels are corrective institutions that will correct your behavior that's what he changed on you but what they did the updated they updated it to the modern time you know it's Armstrong is the girls at that there's a couple of girls who wrote it's a big stick put on their head another guy on bike Chicago he saw me he thought was a game so he's all set for the game and what would you playing me to do so I did his and is very polite not to read the readings of the other guy and let him read it first and so I did the numbers in the end I give it to him and you read it and just hand me the book and you sat on his bunk and he just stared and so then I read what I wanted when it said and he months before he lost his wife and child in the car accident they were coming out to visit him and the eching said you suffered a great misfortune dead r y n d chingos en Italia you know what to do and you know this is the next month is going to be tough and just wants to go to be good you know and receive hope for you is like astrology it's almost the same Italia Ricci board you know sometimes if you do the Ouija board it takes a knee and if you start making it a game you know that's asked if they're so sad to get that who's going to win the race tomorrow in that and and right away the chain catch his ass and knows your real feelings and it tells you what do you think way of communicating us remembering ghost where Patrick Swayze had to learn how to move a coin remember that the spirits especially is spiritual people there around us until you give him a chance to communicate with you because they know all they will communicate and Saudi chain gives it the spirits a chance to Salinas recording they know what what what heads or tails or what whatever it is the number that you need to talk to you Ryan and that's that's my theory because I do know that many people have used it to try to figure out what their life is about what they're doing with their life and the weirdest thing about it is that they seem to find some real answers in it yeah but the idea that I had heard that made the most sense was that the way the world works is not as simple and as easy as one plus one equals two left right left right walk down the road but that there's intention and thought that also helps formulate our universe with the iching does is it somehow clarifies intention and thought and it clarifies like the the ACT your actual the actual process is going on in your mind and it it quantifies it and puts it into like a waiter you can read your effect on life and life's effect on you in this and it reads it somehow or another email doesn't make any sense that we already use artificial intelligence in our lives everyday like Alexa Universe wants us to Spirits they want us to be enlightened because more enlightened we are the more we can enjoy but we won't work but we've inherited because we were born into this world look at look look what we got now going for us. And how much effort did I take you know it was like being part of a team and and so when you're ready for me that you're you're pushed out in front your their name it so you know our duty as as as student is to learn everything we can learn and to teach whatever we can teach in her and that's why there should be no paranoid because we're not here long enough. so that being rich being poor makes any kind of a difference you know because you know yourself what do you really need in this life we need water and food companionship love difference you know because you know yourself what do you really need in this life Ryan what do you really need water and food companionship love</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how do you feel about animals I love him to sleep when I love chocolate I got you is what my wife and I both use oh yeah wake up in the middle of the night instead of fighting the best and you just sleep not only I slept last night but I had a couple of them pivot epiphanies now that just blew my mind what is going to save the world art is considered the world and what happens when you when you have big huge pieces like that and it's not war so you're not fighting you're creating it's the people that that care for the animals people that have to feed the the the mass of people that have to work on getting those rocks carving was Rodger creates employment and it and it also creates terrorism and so when you have a piece of art everybody wants to come look at it and so that's what we need in the world today you see and we not only need art but we need functional art because that's what were you were functional in a lot of people say it was the astronauts you known aliens really in town which could very well be somewhere in the world Earth is the only planet in this universe and the reason I believe that is that there are countless universes like space is endless and so spaces in this why why wouldn't we have our own Universe okay so you think that Earth is the only planet in this universe yes but what about Mars there's multiple universes are infinite numbers of universe each Universe probably has Unearthed or 242 but you think this whole universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies with hundreds of billions of solar systems could be there's only one planet why can't it be the other way why couldn't we be the only ones we could be trouble with people that are afraid of artificial intelligence because when you capture something you do you capture their problems are problems with sucking all the fish out of the sea. The skies filled with carbon artificial life can be like no one real problems is God damn people their dirty little litterers to choke and squirrels and see that's the paranoid look at it look at the what's the positive physical Universe okay for every action there's a reaction so for every good there's a bad nothing explains Trump more than for every Obama there's a trump okay so there's no limit to how you can be and there's no limit to how smart you can be there's no limit and so when you go map to scale to intelligence scale then then you realize that there's no reason for it to be paranoid about anyting because if it's all written out and do all the holy books written in the Bible the Bible has been misconstrued by so many people because what they do they take it to what's going to suit their purposes and that but it would too really interpret the Bible is written in code it's written it it's a secret code the Bible has this metaphysical terms it's not physical terms of metaphysical terms what do you know about the buy one coat look when there's a writer called him at Fox should get into him he deciphers the whole Bible the ancient Hebrew version the Bible or Greek version the Bible Latin ancient Hebrew the letters also doubles numbers. There's another Mystic that I read a lot of stick check about a really really enjoy it because what he maintains it it's all like I say in the Bible eternity there's no beginning and no end that explains everything to me because if there's no beginning to no end what can what can happen will happen you know because this is it again this is my my my theory it's in the physical world we have to learn everything that's why everything's physical like the first thing when you're born you have to learn how to breathe you have to learn how to walk I have to learn how to eat you don't release your saw your spirit and the body the body stays but it's just the vehicle and so because of Eternity just goes on and on and on and on forever and never stops what we do as humans we're learning we're creatures we're all students whether we want to be or not you know I was trying to explain this to my mom's side because my younger son is a bit musician and I understand that he's a musician and it'll musicians aren't that entrepreneurial as as some people would like him to be but anyway everybody sure to learn a certain task and some of us are blessed and to-the-point like me I'm blessed and very blessed because I've been given the ability to to to because I've been given the ability to to to to do what I do and to see what I see and say what I say you know it doesn't come from me it comes from you know the source when I called the source</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> could be better I'll be 81 Friday wow that's amazing it is it sounds crazy to say that sounds crazy that's it that's all it is drink out of the Fountain of Youth and you'll live forever really play Bob Hope man in the game and the reboot but in the way you go again but if you keep this body healthy it it feels that there's no need to to leave because the in usage obviously still got more s*** to do you still enjoying it old folks sex the whole thing about Tango is it's so intricate it was the original Tango was amazing dance from Africa and what they would do that young kids will get together and dance and flirt with their feet and so when the slaves got taken you know from Africa and put on the boats in that they ended up crashing the foot dance Adagio French dance the dance of the brothels and so is that so then they ended up with the music or a dance called tangle which was the combination is a word that means small drum it's an African drum just like Bumble it's an African word that means Story County untangle so anyway Tango like I go to Argentina with my wife a lot and it's very tough dance to dance with your wife you have to dance with a stranger and she has to dance with a stranger you're too intimate to personal you know each other too well if you're a stranger then all you can respond to is the dance signals like but he has to leave him situated that it that you can't see him being you can't pull her around. He suggest suggested moving then the girl partner will understand that move in then she can do a couple of steps and that certain way ochos that remains back and forth and in the end out of those combinations once the guy gets the girl that going into the ochos Frances then you can move on to another. Her with his foot and then you move on to another series of moves and they're all designed and but the stranger you know the woman has to really listen to the the moves if she's dance with a stranger or a teacher and that's how I roll and then it has to be close to embrace and the woman has to be that cuddled up against a guy not always but for the most part so you're not looking at your feet at all and it's all about feel it so you have to feel the other person's body and it can get so intimate man if that you really found after good dance with a good Tangled teacher you really feel like you're having a cigarette you studied us if you like to climb I got turned onto it in Paris I was teaching Edward finishing up the Corsican Brothers and I was as we got offered to do The Cisco Kid and they sent me the script and in the script said tango dancers and so there were my girlfriend at the time but wife not used to drive by this place that to tangle and neon lights and so we stopped in and took our first tango lesson from this George and Rosie and George was too old to get out of bed he was in the butt is in his nineties or something he was in bed Rosie came and met us and leave and she showed us the first little bit of Tango on my wife Shelby who was she's been studying dance to ever since I can remember I found out about that nice had to learn salsa but then we started learning Tangled together and then she went on to really learn how to dance dance with the pros me I'm still struggling to be a pro and it's very hard fighting and so when I when we go down to the video operator cuz I didn't know how to that well lessons almost twenty years but it still don't have the skills to to be a professional like like like that but yeah so I went down and videotaped her and then I came back and I made about Isis this is embarrassing because people know me from years ago and I still can't to learn tango and I wouldn't give up golf I got a 36 handicap something like that but but I gave up coffee cuz it's too much energy was taken too much energy to walk around all the time that the Tango dancing on the movement footwork it actually make you more steady and stable balance better so probably your golf game better I would get better comedy has someone asked me about the secret of confidence is supplies and in the tangle supplies to be waiting waiting in silence you know before you say something to give people time to formulate their own thoughts about what you're doing or to concentrate on what you're going to say next in the end that says same same thing with Tango yeah waiting and using that that that silence you know before you say something you give people time to formulate their own thoughts about what you're doing or to concentrate on what you're going to say next in the end that's the same same thing with Tango</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah just like it when you when you're over here and you look at UDC it a differently from looking at it the look at looking at the situation over there and how crazy Mexico is from America like how ignorant Americans are to how bad it really is yeah I mean I've been up here for four years now as a resident and I came up here at the weirdest I'm probably and in the u.s. history as far as that's going through my immigration process Trump got elected so it was pretty interesting you know and helping pull to the both sides of the political Spectrum in on you and seeing how people would talk about Mexico and ways that were at your realistic or just weird things that you would hear is like that's on how it is you know that's not how it happened it was a big misconception u.s. to know they're out there everywhere outside the border the Border thing is like that's a border but they're both on both sides and now there's definitely cartel year in the u.s. is it so then most Americans thinking thinking of it is a foreign problem if you live far from the border maybe you know where that is text itself that's a lot of they also hear that now they should fix their own s*** yeah but they're only let me know this problems on therapy on stem from firearms and money coming from up here and the big drug market and the money going into some crop hands down there at times and then basically them burning the manual every six years I just starting a new on their fight and the cars anybody else say this other than you has anybody say that politically over there I don't know there's a few people there's a few people I was actually in charge of the governor of Baja security detail towards for two years to almost three years I was put there because he was a very good friend of Philly because other one we was always Compadre and he was very high-level and now there's a lot of threats in his life and again he was heading up the tip of the spear for the counter cartel operations in the whole of Mexico and he banana plant in TJ That Was Then replicated throughout the country and he would be very vocal in his encounter cartel rhetoric and how we could do better and how we should all work together he developed these groups called boom groups basically Army Municipal Police State Police all of them working together these operations group than just going out there and it's the jurisdiction of everybody here to do whatever we need to do and he was pretty and I instrumental his name was a una Manana and he's out of politics now and he had a lot of threats and it was pretty interesting working with him he's one of those people think that all politicians corrupt on their side true there's some good ones he was one definitely on that work directly with him and I and I could tell you that he was a used one of those good ones and lieutenant-colonel he's all out who's now running for mayor if you want he's one of those vocal guys there's a reason why he's been trying to kill him nine times he saying something you know he's he's representing something right there are good people down there willing to fight it's just that there's a lot of more bad people going to kill you must have seen some horrific s*** over the course of your career yeah yes yes a bodies the brutality of torture people working down there is a closest thing to the wild west you have currently it's basically and when the people say third world country as there's a lot of Cosmopolitan places just crossed the border that aren't necessarily alien to americanize now imagine all this you know crazy things happening down there like there was a famous firefight in Tijuana which is basically there was a Big Cartel stronghold inside of this Castle type thing and I had a big giant Dome on top of it La cupola and when you went that happened basically a bunch of everybody responded to this thing and it was next to a school and kids were being evacuated from it is pretty horrific a lot of the people on the inside that they had a lot of people abducted on the inside and they basically executed all of them and some of the people on the inside with the cartel guys would put zip ties on themselves and kneel kneel down the ground so they would you would think it was them and that you saw that uniformed police officers inside of their shooting outside two uniformed police officer so you would see how the crazy corruption and you know La shootout happens bank robbery two guys with AK-47 North Hollywood that one militarize the whole policing in the United States that type of thing happens and tea in Macon Mexican Mexico every day and nothing happens nothing changes you know that's that's that's crazy part and I'm how how somehow that just is part of the normal now down there no no adjustments no adjustments I know Evolution now these guys used to roll around dressed as cops with killing vehicles and now they roll around in taxicabs and are more discreet and how they move these guys used to use drugs meals and Drug tunnel Sally use unmanned drones and other means to cross a drive cuz they're always kind of evolving in the jousting

		<div class="paragraph"> did you have any involvement has barely related but did you have any involvement to know anybody that had any involvement with those Mormon Cults they're down there yes I'd like to know people that in the horrors region that some of the Mitt Romney's family members in that region area yeah I knew some federal I know some federal police guys and Military guys that were curious about Mana Firearms at these guys have because they had some they've basically fought the cartels off well it's you know it's pretty it's pretty interesting being there and finding a white guy that speaks amazing English and it was born in Mexico and he and there are Mormons are Mormons and they they have to get like a visa to travel to us. People don't know that like Mitt Romney's dad the reason why Mitt Romney's dad never ran for president cuz he was born in Mexico another word meaning of people that Canelo Louis CK yeah Lewis CK anybody that's Irish ancestry if you go into a bar in Mexico some bars in Mexico you can probably get some free drinks if you tell me where Irish because the Irish betrayed the Americans in the last Mexican-American War yeah the that they did the Mormon community in that area basically a few other members got abducted and the cartels for you know wanted to do more against them in these guys apparently got them high power to long range rifles and they were shooting at these people from afar and they set up this whole security apparatus around her down and The Mexican government and basically look the other way can I said it's fine just don't get out don't be get too crazy with it and there was some sort of interaction as far as them trying to appease things with them you know realistically they the town that there that they made out there as a paradise I mean amongst other towns in that area it's a beautiful place really the beautiful plates very organized. Is it called This is Jamie does that are Mormon little town what kind of military did they have that protects this town are your Dave Dave made their own military so I actually got to do a few reconnaissance things there just this is passing by and what I saw that they had were a bunch of basically Machine Gun Nest on some of the hilltops and they little they limited the amount of access points to that little down totally had the affair basically they're one of them got killed to kill other people and then there was there was this whole thing they went to the government for help and they didn't say anything so somehow they procured Firearms down there so they start defending their own what a strange story that is because they left the United States when polygamy was illegal illegal in Utah over here but it isn't nice I mean it again it's a weird American like town in the middle of Juarez and then how many people really yeah there's a lot of family names are in that region they're kind of famous you know why the Barons or one of those but it's only this one town it's it's one of set there's a list of you out there cuz if you have their speed Mormon communities out there while it's all the same sort of deal alarm to the tits discreetly armed you know that if I don't know if it's it's open as it was but it's back then when it was really Rowdy they were they were openly doing things to keep people from not coming to their town full on Mexican citizens Mexican citizens yes but there but they speak English but they don't need to be out of it so you know it's a weird place that's f****** really weird</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and correct me if I'm wrong but they they do make an effort to not go into tourist areas until resort areas in the car till I tell while this is the thing because they own it or they have investments in it that's why so like if you go to Punta Mita or something like that you think they have investment late late late that it's in their best interests of have things you know quite a lot of people at so I do a lot of training as far as do a lot of classes Suffolk. Travel safety things and people are amazed some of the cases that I bring out for that they think they're going to get abducted or drug by the cartels and some discotech somewhere down there and it's usually American the Americans traveling down there doing their thing down there against other Americans isn't coming back up perfectly I'm crying really yeah that's why I did not happen with a guy who killed his girlfriend down there the cartel got her I miss her so much man down there during the spring break type that type of timeframe it's always Americans against Americans kind of doing that. I think it's of the cartels are drugging people now it's sometimes it's Americans taken advantage of the whole being in the foreign land type thing I was staying with my family in Punta Mita at the Four Seasons and we golf carts take the golf carts out of the resort and then I like you we can we take the golf carts to the town to lecture go ahead we leave the resort the first thing you see is military vehicle armored with soldiers standing at the border of the f****** Four Seasons with machine guns on the roof of this thing standing there ready to rock in case anything goes down legitimize our business is your nearest back so a lot of the money in those in those Resorts probably probably trace it back to cardiologist why so it's just deep it goes it permeates the entire culture yes it's it's it's it's part of the business my model and the whole lot of money moves around down there a relationship with Jesus Christ man it's got a feel for you for a guy like you who gave your Blood Sweat and Tears and was apart of stop this it must feel so strange to watch this nightmare sort of play out so being up here and most of my friends for some reason I have distracted so many black Marines to my life but I don't know why you know a lot I have a few seal friends and most mostly just crazy marine guys and I've been learning about what post-conflict is post-conflict or being a veteran the combat Marines is through them y'all things like post-traumatic stress disorder in and esophagitis TBI are things that I didn't even know where thing till they come up here no one talks about in Mexico that doesn't exist it's not now not discussed not you if you go into a situation and you do something somewhere you get a few days off you know that's about it and come back to work while and medical wise guy I've been discovering all these issues I have from that experience down there and it's like what kind of shoes and my nose is pretty as pretty as Ben's pretty substantially destroyed and my might have a few head injuries and now I didn't know what they were you know I just it stress you know where on the body it's my age I'm 36 I shouldn't be feeling like this you know and do them they kind of pointing me in like you probably have this because this is what I had because I was in Iraq Iraq might as well been the wreck now that's that's the thing that does it and also you guys recognize your veterans you know enough not enough somebody one of my a****** friends gave me a the Mexican drug war veteran hat because all those guys had their own hats you know so I could drug war veteran hat and had an eagle y'all being strangled by a snake and it was pretty funny but it made me realize how there's a bunch of guys down in Mexico the amazing things and they're getting the recognition because it's a war that they didn't I Rise as there's nothing happens no war happening but there's no war you know even the current president said you know what this is the end that they didn't I Rise is there something happen is no war happening this is Circuit of the cartels and there's no war you know even the current president said you know what this is the end of the drug war because I said so kind of thing anymore okay because why is over</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what could be done to radically curved this what we going to do first off legalizing some of some of the substances will probably help that would help a lot that's a pretty good question but even some substances that are legal like fentanyls essentially legal because you can get a prescription for it but you're never going to have like fentanyl just over the counter says to deadly you know another thing that you know I think about and that's a very good question I wish I can answer I think everybody wishes they can answer it and everyone just sort of like shrugs and so they need the cartels aren't just a drug-filled business they also have money that is in property and alleged legitimize businesses they work in the human trafficking like the actual used to be you can cross that border and go to the desert and cross it yourself and now you have to pay a toll protection rackets Croft on both sides of the other border sex trafficking piracy like you name it they have they have an essentially took that drug money and just different other night a crime business Diversified now they've been Diversified for a long time like there was a reason to lie to 33 cartel members from Sinaloa in Malaysia released out of all places so you think about that to Sinaloa cartel Guys Somewhere in Malaysia got caught somewhere and now they've been releasing and they got like a hero's welcome in Mexico to get a hero's welcome. I got the funny thing is that the Mexican Government was involved in their release and then they send it back and heroes welcome what were they doing all the way over there and then that part of the world is fine so no one has a real plan here goes Malaysia pardons three Mexicans on death row all they were on death row so there's a lot of Romanticism Romanticism it's religion there's definitely some some occultism involved in a lot of the higher up to these cartels remember when I found out about the Narco music is one of those songs called I Corridos the folk songs there's a lot of them you know theirs and they are all them have a secret language in them sometimes or or they're all like three of something to happen and you pay somebody done to test 222 make one for you or somebody makes it for you and then if you do a good Correo song for somebody and the arrivals will send some of the kill you and I was like even even the musicians are on either side of the cartel can I group things as well it's pretty weird but it's wow so if you're if you're for the wrong cartel you make a song you kind of have to like doing the hiding or orange do not play any in any places where they why do cartels go territories are Jesus Christ will they come to your territory to come get you if you had been a few high-level in the wrong place cultism the cartels have as well even with the pretty interesting thing things like talk to Mark that they that the death called that is kind of different parts of Mexico it's like a think about a very dark Freemasonry type thing is certain levels you have people that are apart of the part of that called from the cops to the military to the cartels it's kind of two prostitutes and drug dealers it's interesting how that that kind of also has an influence on on on the way some people go into very risky business is like being cops or mother or cartel guys and how they wear them power themselves by some of these occult iconography if you don't like it or or there's that the Trinity is golden Peach turn into a saint now there's a giant Church to him into hell out with a bunch of money stuck to the walls and and pictures of guys in the US would like a F-150 like thank you Mom I'm living the dream now because of you to roadside altars with with a statue of the Virgin Mary and then you look behind her in this Reaper behind it because it's swine and they do that till so the military doesn't destroy them because they have standing orders to destroy these things which shouldn't be but you know that's kind of religious persecution but they actually do that it's so it's so different in the United States and in a lot of ways it is I mean I don't think we understand like all the stuff I think the average person has no idea about the songs no idea about the culture of it all they have no idea of the depth How Deeply it's connected and Society down there I mean the the death cult worship is I think you could probably trace it back to the Aztec Days by it so there's definitely when you see all these highly graph highly violent bloody cartel executions and and and things like that I don't know I mean I think there's some sort of genetic memory from that it's not abnormal physically for some of these people do that type of thing ripping somebody's heart trees of the videos of that stuff out there remember getting contacted by people that I knew on this side of the Border in the US they were very curious of why all these people from the Middle East were looking at all these cartel execution videos and then a few years later you had Isis doing some high production execution videos men were inspired by the cartels you know wow so we think about I can walk there and you can walk there it's not Olivia it's near lohoya gorgeous view and everyone's driving Ferraris and Porsches 20 minutes drive your in Tijuana on the planet right now what a juxtaposition how crazy is that this is the border to Mexico and it's all military San Diego's fill with f****** seals and Rangers and Marines and bases and all military down there since so military influence and it's right next to the most violent dangerous city on planet Earth more than Karachi Pakistan we were we were insured by MetLife and the MetLife agent something along those lines like you're better off going to Afghanistan or Iraq then working here basically numbers-wise and I was like. Thank you for that you know that's felt that feels like a good plan on the back fused with regular person so so you get cartel on cartel crime and then they finish each other off and then they realize that will now what do we do so they start abducting people extortion to store money just extortion comes out and into play Dino Pet protection rackets process died and now they're very bold that now they're at the party somewhere and somebody look something funny so they come back and they shoot up the whole party I like your daughter she's pretty hot I'm going to steal her and if you do something I'll kill you and your your daughter again that's how it starts you know that's that's how it starts kind of growing just bold Brazen rule that's how you get it and Hosea Pathak that's how you got to get to that point and then again I experienced it back in the 2006 era and I saw it get into all the way to win the whole of the Municipal Police were they basically Army surrounded the Municipal Police office of David the police if you wanna and they took out a gun and a few of them were taking on a plane ride to Mexico City and there for a few weeks there was no armed police in decline in the municipal on police imagine somebody and somebody disarming the whole lapl all of the LAPD and just having the Army in there instead you know wow so you would see you would see these events and then things calming down the only success story as far as us as far as the city coming back from the break what they want 244 all that. Like the Raging drug war went down Lieutenant Colonel is all of the guy that I used to work with he took numbers down like everybody down in Lexing the heat got hired then on to go to RS to try and replicate his success the only success is where they are because he basically treated the problems account Insurgency probably not a policeman problem attempts on his life the last one took the use of his legs and he's currently currently running for mayor of Tijuana believe it or not and he's not he's in a wheelchair but he still I wouldn't want to mess with that guy that much myself and some members of my family are actually helping out with his campaign that he's you know they got a is one of the campaign offices shut up recently is there any plans or the is there any push to try to treat the entire problem as a counterinsurgency problem and keep the success that they had in Tijuana know it's a cat that was a solution brought in by the right side of the political Spectrum in the in Mexico so it's it's a no-go right now because everything still left just got just got an office he's he's up he's has a few months and so yeah just got into office so so you got five and a half more years of this dude wearing for a ride that's why I'm say yeah kindness doesn't seem to work when you're dealing with cartels it seems like now you give him my hand it'll take your feet that's that was that said Mexican say man for you to have been in that business and to sort of be connected to about side of it now it did it seem like there's a team I mean must be incredibly frustrating but also must feel futile like you've wasted time cuz not there's no no progress is ever going to be made I have a you don't have a weird experience that I had a burned about 2 Acres of pot somewhere about her way towards the end of my career and then things happened politically a bunch of shakes about Jacob's over the office I got called in and the director at that of the institution that was in there that time was up Shady character and I decided to six I want my my my my mom had just passed away and that kind of affected me a little bit a lot of the hell out of bed you know and starting a family and stuff like that and you don't set you know what this is this is not worth it so I left quit my job had everything in people were suspicious about why I did it you know what I mean probably found a million-dollar somewhere near so I have to leave in a hurry got a few threats gladly to leave in hurry and I got a few threats gladly gladly I luckily I had some great people on this side of the Border friendship that I developed for a long while and they help me out you know</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and also would also what happened is that you do a lot of these people is something that people Americans kind of don't don't get yet this isn't a Mexican problem any more specifically as far as the cartel violence going on a lot of these people had their kids up here in the US in the 90s allows cartel guys you know Chapo has kids had kids in the US and a lot of these people are now coming of age you know so cartel influence in the US is a thing you're going to start seeing if you're already seeing it but you're going to see more of it because a lot of these people are actually american-born the u.s. citizens now working in tandem with any sort of Interest down there so that's going to be the new shift you know and you know people are some fun kind of horrified by some of the stuff that. Some of the cases down there people can look up the Los pelillos gang in in Southern California they were actual cartel group that would kidnap people in the US dresses federal agents in the US and drag them back down to Mexico now this happened if you'd look almost I think I might nine years back but this is happening to you when you ask now it's not something foreign anymore you know a lot of people want to think that you work you can build a wall and keep all that down. Don't get me wrong Build That Wall I have nothing against it but selling it as a security thing it's just I don't I don't think it makes that much sense in a lot of in lot of parts words it is up violence is rapping on both sides but if the argument would be that if the wall didn't exist then it would be too easy to come back and forth at all spots yeah I get it I get it and I think I guess I'm not against the wall build the wall other I interviewed a guy I do articles for a few magazines and I interviewed a guy who's the kyote move people from the border and he said this about the board was asked in the interview about the border wall he said good for business and I know you'll make something seem like it's harder when it isn't as good for business 3075 tighter or flying to Canada they walk down which is that was his one of his one of his new favorite methods so Northern United States easy to know where the border is like just get across here and be fine snow Mexicans really strange while I mean it's the daily the amount of creativity and then problem solving that goes on on the criminal side you know if your best plan is the wall of a secure wall these guys have been working against that best plan for the past 20 years so they are there already way ahead of the Curve there's interesting time in drunk and puking look this up drone technology had had enough surgeon and innovation in Tijuana out of all places in the world for a time like why that's funny Wonder drunk and puking up his iPad drone technology had had enough surgeon and innovation in Tijuana out of all places in the world for a time like why that's funny</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it seems like it's very loose like there's a lot of room for fuckary Bush Administration era there was a lot of that was a lot of stuff going on Obama administration error after the whole Fast and Furious thing the things kind of went dark for a while to the cartel under the guys that this is the track the gun yes it seems so fishy of I learned about it from CNN and I view my friends were killed with some of those guns down there which is you know everybody talks about the the u.s. agent that was a Mexican was killed by some of these guns but there was a lot of Mexican agents and people civilians killed by these guns as well so they were very specific types of guns you imagine somebody giving you a shopping list Papa John's you want right routing these lists were 50 cal Barrett Barrett rifles and fn57 which are very upset it's a pistol with a very high velocity around that good goes to soft armor like the type of stuff that was issued to us right so all the sudden we're seeing these space best tools in the hands of the cartels and very specific parts of the country or like what a Preposterous idea that they're going to sell it to the cartel that sounds like horseshit to me that sounds like someone's trying to make money and they said I will just say we're selling it to them to track it felt that the suspicious part is that all of them went to one specific Cartel de Sinaloa cartel so it sounds like such horseshit the fact it mean who went to jail for that Eric Holder didn't go to jail where in the Baja a little girl blocked her arm an agent that was a friend of mine got killed and it the wife got killed with fn57 that directly related to that whole thing so you can go to jail for tax evasion that I just got can get away with that the idea that you would run that by people and they would go yeah good idea I was happening way before all I know is that when that happened nobody told us and there was definitely some weird resentment on part of the the government down there and say people down there as far as you know and and there was some weird conspiracy theories going on as well down there idea the main thing you would hear his people want them fast and furious executive privilege lawsuit between doj and house wrapped up within the last two weeks I guess really is images of the ones we found they were buried in somebody's our backyard inside of a water barrel and all of them were obviously us origin guns and like what do you mean all of them had very specific accessories on them that nobody else in the world puts these accessories on their guns at the us because they're pretty ridiculous 6 see you in hell type things on them in America Punisher skulls with a big one and a cartoon skull from a Marvel comic book has become a part of it is it is pretty well the main rumor down there like with conspiracy theory yeah that's that's about it so you crazy crazy things main thing was that the US was planning an invasion you know their business is there to stabilize in the region so they can put boots on the ground the invading Mexico how f****** crazy with that babe well you know as far as a reaction on the side of Mexico people aren't getting this again does pure leaf population in and that you were rumors that I would hear people were planning to do poison drug loads on that side to create a Health crisis and in the US as a reaction that was pretty like when I heard it's like little league who's talking about this yet you know and so will full-out War almost disrespected right that the cartels would poison the drugs to punish the Americans for the military invading the country to create a Health crisis in the US so they wouldn't have to go back wow groomers over numbers we never got told attendees got a number nearly 2,000 Firearms were illegally purchased for one point Vermilion according to the doj Inspector General report f*** hundreds of guns really to recover United States of Mexico 50 cows were so they did intelligent equation with the cartels right so we they would get AK-47s and we would get German mangy three that were safe around the same caliber and we could fight back night and then all of our leadership start rolling around in armored vehicle so look at 50 calcium make holes in the vehicle so it's always been an escalation now getting 50 cal so you could shoot holes in the armored vehicles that yeah both so the cartels were getting them first then then then we had to get them because they were rolling around in our vehicle so that Mad Max hype armored vehicles they would make they would first first they would make them like homemade Mad Max armored vehicles find somewhere one of them was called La Bestia which is like a giant that they all do that all that was messing with the guy with the guitar on the back of it you don't make it right back and it would be easy to roll into town in like have how would you fight that and then we had to get a 50 cal get the military to shoot them from the sky Checkmate Checkmate government against the cartel but then you realize that the cartels like the new generation Cartel de Guadalajara at actually down helicopters in Guadalajara military helicopters because they have anti-aircraft capabilities Jesus Christ now you're like Checkmate cartels that's that's how killing and death is not at the Industrial Level that it's that is being done in Mexico not just killing but you do disappearing bodies making body disappear I was at I was I was around when they got the the stewmaker the stewmaker was a guy that worked for the Sinaloa cartel in Tijuana and he would get rid of bodies using caustic soda night so he would get bodies every night and he got these basically this Industrial Level just barrels and it just goes caustic soda that's a chemical mixture you can get most of the components that hardware store basically dissolves bodies and I know he would get get some of this and make sure he he said and interviews that he got trained by Israelis that how to do that so who knows if that's true or not I but in the night he said he would get rid of the funeral dozens of bodies and just get rid of everything bone everything so there's a lot of families on Mexico that are looking for the kids for years then there's just no way of getting them body and the amount of you that goes into cartel working just gets you don't kill their that's just that's the whole generations and whole towns of women and old men and they're out which is the cold in relationships small towns were like they looked at me like you say you know young man just like so it's rare at some places it is because the men are all getting killed all getting God. God in the in the cartel operations and killed or recruited forcefully recruited or voluntarily recruited but get them pulled Generations just wiped out young man looks like this was rare at some places it is because the men are all getting killed all getting got God in the in the cartel operations and killed or recruited forcefully recruited or voluntarily withdrew it but you don't pull generation</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> for you to have your life on the line over there and see all this chaos and obviously the lack of organization or outright corruption it must be insanely frustrated yeah I mean where the putting people in little clearly guilty of things you know and then semen come out or the legal system down there then I got with that I had to endure you know you would have to go and do a face-to-face with all these people tonight don't your federal courthouse leave your Firearms behind could do a face-to-face with these people inside that you just got got that you just got for our many tons of cocaine or pot whatever and then go outside and it outside now now now I know you are you know there's no anonymity in that and in that regard so you would have to sign things you know and then seeing some of the people that were with you working on your side and seeing how some of them would fall into corruption charges and then sue the government and then get your job back but now you have somebody is compromised within your own unit wow night so they did did try a few things to try and clean out fleas horses one of them with a plan they called the C3 plan it was like a like a filter for police officers down there it's still it's still an action but you know it's questionable if it's effective or not I saw a lot of people go through it and then later on they would turn out to be cartel guys basically it would do a background check FBI background check polygraph exam drug testing all the all of these things to see that you were you know clean to work on these police horses the problem is that the polygraphs turn out to be unconstitutional to fire somebody over them so a lot of these people got hired back after they would fail poly basic polygraph exam so a lot of attempts to clean it up you know and you would be on the level and all these people won't be on the level but they were still there so you wouldn't what percentage of people are not on the level she had a gas roughly that bad I mean I would depend I'd say 30% probably that's a lot but I got my experience of the people that I worked at 3% when you must cherish the 70 know when somebody people wearing off and I will because you don't have his running joke that I have I went in with the same card that I drove out of the office with Hello Kitty truck that I had that I bought that I bought when I know about my own dime first truck first car and I drove out of the office when it quits when I quit the job that same day in the life by Jolie I drove out of the office and I truck but a lot of these guys would come in with her you know how much is in each shoes and just weird cars like it wait a minute we are working the same off is why do you why do you have a three-story house so obvious though you know yeah but the obviousness of it you're driving a nice car living in the big house and everybody else is like what kind or we going to go over here and you would have to turn around and look around see who was listening you know you wouldn't trust a lot of these people so how are we going to power you enjoy job if we can't trust the people that working with us who was it that recently called for decriminalization and it got was it your present to call for decriminalization of all drugs in America to go along with Mexico and so it was yeah realizing marijuana in in Mexico right now cuz there's been a few landmark cases and you know it's gold rush type situation right now there's a lot of companies down there if that get that have had experience up here that want to go down there and Ryan so the culture is ready for it I think do you think that would help I don't know when it comes to legalizing pot up here it hasn't held down there as far as blowing things actually made things kind of worse how's it made things worse they changed they changed the they changes what they were producing so that doesn't when you left the reason why there's a heroin heroin epidemic up here and Fentanyl epidemic up here I think has some relationship with how things that legalized up here until they just switched product down there so lighter-colored heroin is coming down from Mexico and I've seen up at bedtime work with law enforcement up here in the US doing classes and kind of the send me things like and I have seen that lighter-colored heroin pop up in places as far off as you caught up to you and so you know it's because of the color the color of the smell consistency you can kind of tell if it's Asian or how it looks like has a different strain like it's probably a different strain it's also the amount of Sunny gets in the region where could being grown high altitude so it's lighter color not a stinky I don't know but I think it's a relation that that kind of relates to the legalization shoot down there they didn't affect them in the pockets they just switched product it's got to be in such a strange relationship because the reason why these drug cartels have someone Powers bisek because they're selling drugs to the United States so it's like you have this connection to this country that has a great big wall that it wants to build and on one side everybody's buying up all the illegal drugs and the other side everyone's killing everybody to try to make and sell these illegal drugs yeah I mean there's a lot of holes small Nano drones on technology anyting the walls already been up there for a few years part of it and 10th in place I think one would you like one of the British Rock wild rice on the planet and it's the drugs they caught the same you know it's the same it's like the ocean in one large submarine in my time working military science like like scientific size of the f*** to somebody by a submarine a line apparently really yeah you can buy a submarine by a small submarine for a small amount of money I think the main part of the submarine ownership is that mean take maintenance that was the reason we found it is that it wasn't properly maintained so it sunk it does it actually don't actually floated couldn't sing and it had a bunch of things summaries of s*** out of me can't see where you going well so yeah boxing submarines drones like a squadron of drones with a bunch of loads on it in awhile how heavy can a drone can still fly on it so just fly in the coke over the top were you around when that CIA drug plane crashed in Mexico with tons of cocaine on it wasn't there but I was aware of that situation what the f*** is that about I mean realistically there's there's a lot of America's running around in Mexico yeah that's that's that that's in the Cowboys right yeah lot of people to listen we just make this one run sucks good day every now and then you know when this is this is this isn't a secret every now and then you would see a dude out there that's blonde tall and has a bunch of tattoos that don't belong down there working on the military side of things in Mexico or some dudes doing something with some place in your land you that you will get a call you know they're fine just you know just leave him alone like one attend since I have a pretty good spoken English I would get I will get sent places for training or for the Azran work with some people that would go down there and I would never know what the hell some of these people were from so I'm usually we will get to up

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what is the plan in terms of the government meet there if they can take out a guy like El Chapo what is the plans to eradicate all this and is there really a plan to eradicate it or is it one of those things where it's sort of a plan on paper but realistically they sort of accept the fact and everything to get rid of these people so I have a like I have a thing like that like basic ketchup bottle was a feathered serpent and I have a image of a feathered serpent biting its tail Mexico has a problem with amnesia 6 year cycle of Amnesia every person comes in has all these plans to eradicate the cartels president goes out nobody likes him anymore new guy comes in and says well I have a better plan you know and that's the cycle we always go through and it was a big issue in Mexico yeah and current currently we have a leftist president that doesn't want to have anything to do with the past administrations are mortar on the right of the spectrum his name is Andres Manuel Lopez obrador amlo vocally supporting Venezuela up apparently he has a good relationship with the with Trump that's that's what people say but his whole thing was amnesty for the cartel that's a campaign promise amnesty yes that mean exactly nobody knows what that means operations throughout the country that the military is not as active as it used to be well some of the cartels are growing influence because of a mistake could be you know I've been basically I don't see the efforts that were there when I was active down there things change you know so I don't know I truly think that the Absurd because we're we're on Route 202 having the most violent year in Mexico as far as a drug cartel related deaths right when I got out do you want to have been on the top most dangerous cities on the planet list and I actually work there when it was on the top and through efforts both for the from the government and then through people like that Lieutenant Colonel leyzaola Tijuana was gone off the list of most dangerous cities in the world and now it's again at number one like yeah you sent me was pretty shocked because you don't hear about that here it's 6 murders at night you know I was down there two days ago and it was it's basically cartel on cartel so they're cleaning each other out and just bodies the pier in the morning you know that bridge is hung from bridge has tortured you know that's you know but again the nobody's doing anything about it that she right now but going to turn find I in a lot of ways and so with this left as president this guy with who has this idea of an estate the people that are in charge of handling the cartel the the military and the police officers they've got to feel like a little abandoned yeah or maybe some of them have a business plan and they're working a one side so that's a problem to yasso so do people did not know where you know we have a separate parasound the Army constitutionally shouldn't be engaging in combating the cartels they should be engaging police roles but there was some amendments done to the Constitution and the laws passed but you have to realize that some of these people that are fighting the cartels in the policing type roll from military some of them can't read my or some of them comfortable parts of Mexico that shouldn't they shouldn't be doing that type of activity so you get a lot of you know a lot of failures on that side of the moon events we do have some high-level SF community members in in Mexico that are doing the work but they're few and far between and then you have the federal place which has gone through about 4-5 name changes in the past you know 10 years because every time though not going to call him that and change uniform because they're all corrupt but now they're now they're this fleece right so I just change appearance they change the name you know but like the refresh the public opinion of it there's a famous you know my investigation federal investigation police called the a fee and they were like modern investigative federal police it's going to go after them and they were corrupt this how you know and they all they did was going to get a name change and all these guys got shuffled around and look around like yeah I know you like what what you know but they're still the same person so those are the federal guys rides currently they they want to do like a national National police force and you like they're going to get new people they're going to be natural resource know the same God's James uniform to Dad so that's on the federal side are you wanting their Stateside each state has their own police force investigation police force and a preventative typeforce and these are politicized because each state government may be opposed politicized because each state government may be opposed to the federal government so there's up isn't static there now and each municipality has its own police force and they meet might be completely different politically than the state and federal so</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is gold guns big giveaway all gold answer you know that's how you know yeah this is amazing websites that document all the different stuff that the cartel has but they love gold guns yeah that's Chapo got like a gold very special gold gun when he was when he was named one of the top earners in Fords of the fourth list I think he got his number on a gun and everything the second to last time he got caught because he got caught a lot of times and escaped somebody somebody in the military that got them took it you know oh nothing it ended up in the museum I think it's I think it's in a museum somewhere in Mexico City where a lot of these golden that's up that's War trophy for those guys right of the museum price on his Escape I was like this is hilarious the fact this guy goes to the toilet and then open the door and poopies in a tunnel and on an electric scooter and goes a mile pops up on the other side and they had everything set up for him with electricity like I mean you know what I think the thing that people kind of don't understand about the corruption is it's not just corruption because people are greedy it's all good it's also fear-based corruption so if you don't do what I say we're going to kill everybody in your family even your dog. Type of thing so after will Chapo got it escaped that last time you know all of these staff at the jail got no put in prison and so they were all part of it there's rumors that they were now some some some things that should have been controlled weren't patrolled it was a pretty good well-made tunnel for what it was really well-made so a lot of the people that tell Chapel actually use for these tunnel operation because the same people that use for the tunnels in the Border region all the active tunnels are somewhere you no longer border all those guys were pulled in from from the silver mining companies that used to operate a little Mexico I kind of went looking for jobs in WoW get El Chapo outs good job that's when you saw all that s*** go down with Sean Penn and Sean Penn visiting El Chapo and Sean Penn writing an article for Rolling Stone like that's where you like what in the f*** is going on here yes for a lot of reasons that might not be you know mainly was why are they giving him why are you giving him the Celebrity Status there's a lot of glorification in lot of people been reading some of these people down there and I when they do a lot of harm you know so they know basically giving a voice to somebody it would be the equivalent of somebody up here giving a voice to somebody that was responsible for a lot of damage done to the US pan one of our biggest movie stars who are the biggest drug dealers ever I mean he is El Chapo down it because I've been touching LOL and I've done classes are which was pretty surreal he is he's a folk hero he's he's a piece of Robinhood basically to these people and like when it's a real moment that I had down there driving along this bad bumpy ride Highway and also turn into an ice pack on a highway and the guys that I was with told me oh yeah this is the cartel and made this highway in the back part of it that's a government the part of the highway cuz if you know schools careers lawyers doctors all their careers paid for playing the cartel immigration processes of people that want to come over here sponsorships on type of stuff on both sides night so the span of influence you know that's how he kind of got to where he was he was always helping people and he was investing in people and these people this is these Investments would pay later on you know it sounds like he he benefitted or benefited some aspects of the human shield around them in all these towns old you know schools hospitals every year instead of Christmas Town that they celebrate the Day of the Kings you know so he will get presents Mother's Day they would all get presents that type of thing so why would we want to help the military come in here and then Kelly Chapo if you weren't doing this type of stuff you know that's in that is the same all over Mexico with some of the cartels you know that they they hearts and mind carton Minds type of protein is what makes up with these groups have long lived how much of an effort is there to Raticate the cartel because if you can get a garlic El Chapo who at least in terms of like popularities of is he at the top of the list already at the top of the list as far as popularity but as far as the actual drug dealers is he at the top of the list or are there more several folks that hide underground yeah there's rumors of of people above them that are still out there somewhere that's what everybody like that's the great conspiracy El Chapo's basically the bank manager but you know there's he has a El Compadre Compadre somebody that if you're the daughter if you're the Godfather of my my kid you're my compadre train so he has a Compadre out there myosin bother and he is still out there right band The the extent of how he works and where he worked is a no-sew he's more slick exactly just a more low-key well there's some people get sick with the fame I want to go outside once that the TV show narcos came on then there's a lot of people who did not realize how crazy life of Pablo Escobar was and what really went down in Columbia yeah it's crazy I wish there was a single you know that he was a phenomenon his time and age but he was one man how imagine replicating that type of insanity over the span of Mexico and it's about eight or nine guys you know that was the 90s early 2000s because these guys were in a Legion of Doom type thing where they would be enemies but they would have reunions and they would meet up and kind of agree on certain times did at times because if things are currently after El Chapo you know things going to shift and change what happened well main thing is a power vacuum and with a power vacuum and legalization on this side of certain substances substances like marijuana the the the pot fields are now poppy fields and and new new things like become like them now dedicate themselves to Carol instead of instead of the weed was mysteriously there still weed feels down there for some reason you guys are way better at making it then there but for some reason they're still there with meth precursors being brought in from China and to Mexico or now being made in Mexico like industrial metal stuff right and I knew new upsurging cartel down there that is trying to overtake the Sinaloa cartel of the new generation cartel is coming out of Walla Hara and they're kind of really militarized kind of wing of a cartel activities that are flying to know take control over the whole thing surging cartel down there that is trying to overtake the Sinaloa cartel of the new generation cartel is coming out of Walla Hara and they're kind of really militarized kind of wing of the cartel activities that are fine to know take control over the whole thing</div>

Oh here's a Glock 17 here you two magazines here's your Mossberg 500 and you see all those cars over there we don't ask them for anything let them pass that's so you know we don't do anything wild by Nature see members of the military as well kind of go the other way. Situation 2000-2004 do you think that this was just to avoid conflict or what was it because of corruption it's a it's always corruption I mean it always levels I don't know at all those types of levels down there during this time there's a lot of corruption things change but anyway and some levels are always the same there's definitely some sort of backed going on some sort of fear base packed what time and when not to leave it called the wrong and finally said you know enough is enough we're going to declare war he basically militarized a lot of the, narcotics efforts in Mexico so the military went from being you know when they're in their bases or Manning stations out there to actually actively going out and looking for cartel thousand trying to eliminate so basically Army on the street and another thing he did was basically all of the police chief a lot of the police sheets around the country were being treated out for former military officials old military guys officers one of them was Lieutenant Colonel lizaola I don't know if you're ready to come up here he's very famous lieutenant colonel from Mexico has a documentary on them called Mexico's most bravest man he was the one that headed us up he directed us at the start of this these operations against the dark out and he basically said you know this is this in the policing problem this is a counterinsurgency problem so we're going to basically and after that he kind of took control everything everything in the in in the change you know they're one of the cartels witches of work as they were so they started going underground when you join you expected it to be regular law enforcement when it became this counterinsurgency militarized effort against the cartels was there every time you were you like this job is too dangerous My Generation I was part of this seventh generation of officers going through this this program policing and out of my generation the first year we had two of them jail for corruption charges and three dead and I was just proud of how many out of 23 guys so I was 23 guys 2105 gone 5 gone two of them very dramatic that's two of them were kind of the origins of how I got into the whole counter reduction type thing to my guys got to pick up out of a hotel on the downtown Tijuana and bye-bye cartel members dresses federal police officers did the whole nine yards to the uniforms the car everything cloned they got they got us for the papers outside and got put into a van they found them a day later you know horribly mutilated and tortured tortured you know and that kind of busy this is real this is real and I should probably have a few No Escape Plan and but it wasn't I didn't know anything else basically so it wasn't like I had something to fall back on and it was good pay for what it was and you have a fear that bathroom fear got the stress must be insane yeah it's your always on it said there's no vacation Go Get Your Gun to go on vacation course now it was pretty insane now have you ever been confronted yeah yes of course that mean there's no other there's there's no it's not I have a lot of friends over military up here in the US and it's not like it's not like them to go out overseas and they do something in a different country with different people with don't speak the same language I was doing all this Iraq right so I knew some of these people at times you know every now and then I would say I was a kid or we were in school together and now has a plate carrier with a tan naked 47 and a gold gun on his band's right and like whoa all right so I knew some of these people at times you know every now and then I was saying that I got from when I was a kid or we were in school together and now has a plate carrier with an AK-47 and a gold gun on his band's right and it's like whoa</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when you were talking about how everyone with a six-year plan it's not going to work it's never going to work it seems to me that with the Romanticism of the Colts and the way that it's ingrained in a culture and that they did look at these people like folk Heroes that this is a generational problem with many generations before it changes and comes down and I would struggle to think of what would be the thing that could cause it to come down like what what could be the Catalyst for and in more so than things kind of things are getting even more complicated now with Mike migrant Caravans going through to Mexico now and now you have all these displaced people from South America now adding on to the problem of an already existing like from Fox News talks about Alexa to publicly say that they were going to go to the first cabins going to go straight to Tijuana everybody was not other not going to go straight there that's just too far off they should just go to Texas and they went straight to Tijuana and they were about 3,000 strong when they got there and maybe a bit more and a bunch of memes came up because of it as they were going through all the Mexico most of the people were pretty welcoming because they going to stay and I'll never like you know he was a water like what I was doing a job or run a marathon water bottle in you good riddance you finally got the TJ and TJ is very conservative political he's very conservative place and they met with a wall of protesters wearing make Tijuana great again hats yes and all the sudden you see the marijuana with a makeup make the Iguana great again hat on his head wow and the reason why they were so adverse of these guys coming in is that they were a lot of them gang members you know 14th Street gang members the reason why didn't the other route is because they would have two crossed Los Zetas territory was a cartel that has problem with the 49 so they were curtailing that they were complaining about the food they were getting at the shelters to sit third world country triple migrants and we were feeding them tortillas and beans and there's a famous lady that was like I'm not going to eat this is pig with big me u.s. come down and volunteer groups who hippies with sending all their donations to these people in some of these compare Caravan camps they will grab the donations turn around and sell it on the backside you know all these things they would sell them back side so we we we we had just absorbed about 2,000 or 3,000 Haitian immigrants after the earthquake in Tijuana no problems at all they're interested into the culture of a sudden now we have Haitians in the culture and I don't know but these guys came in they were really kind of disruptive in that late night so I helped you think it was because it's all the attention they were getting yeah that's what they wanted you know they wanted to create some sort of situation on the border so they Rush The Border a few times I was I was around there when they at the famous picture of the lady with the kids running2win border happen if they were throwing rocks at the border patrols they put border patrol guys and that's the only got the gas and then and that's when she was running away yeah and they haven't had to go there throwing rocks yeah that they threw rocks conflict that was our thing and it's funny how a photo can give you a totally different perspective that again anybody this down any of this totality iguana and I have to be from Tijuana to 20 people did not want those people there they saw the most disruptive crime went up at one of the encampments that they had was next to a school the school had to be shut down because of all the needles and stuff that was depending getting found out that has a playground the school it was a massive night and then we'll see it on the news and it was like flowers and under the narrow that we have a narrative was like I don't know what these guys are talking about such a polarizing figure that would be anti-immigration like that again antimatter they just don't want to hear it but they'd be out of the DMV weird thing is how subtle are people Mexicans like Trump do you need a whole artboard I'm going to defend our people type thing that's that it like that yeah I remember most Mexicans are very conservative Catholic guys so it kind of but now again we're divided as well as you guys are politically so there's a lot of a lot of till left type leading people down there so they again narrative you know divide and conquer what did the people in the left what is their perspective on the migrant Caravan supported you know let him three. Boots-on-the-ground their cities are not the ones that are hosting all these people right right right they're not right there yeah it's going down to don't have a realistic perspective so it's just it's a narrative so imagine the TJ and affected the businesses do cross-border and tourism business of all the people that live there was to disrupt and paid at the international scene which is what exactly what they did so do they plan on actually trying to get across or date date date they were planning on jumping the fence and claiming Asylum outside on the other side and the famous lady Frijoles that I kind of made famous on my Instagram account she jumped the fence clean the sign went to Texas and then her and her sister assaulted somebody somewhere and then she got arrested got deported probably so you know that's kind of story of these people and then you would get track some of these people on social media so they would be all poor in the migrant Caravan videos they would have on the news and then you would see him on their social media accounts for back home that Louis Vuitton bags and stuff like that you know maybe a fake one but still you know they're fun to get flossing weird dynamic on the border and as far as I think it's being utilized in a lot of ways as a political type thing at is currently because of the Sunday would be on poor in the migrant Caravan videos they would have on the news and then you would see him on their social Media Cows from back home that Louis Vuitton bags and stuff like that you know maybe a fake one but still you know they're fun to get flossing you know it's a weird dynamic on the border and as far as I think it's being utilized in a lot of ways as a political type thing at is currently because of the president guys have up here</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what is the physical training company that you're doing you're doing something is PTI what is that xpt is described it as a kind of a it's a lifestyle program that evolved out of what how we live what we what we do and so we started an experiential thing where people can come for like two and a half days and go through this you know get exposed to speakers and they do heat and ice and we do pool training and breathwork and Saudi conference isn't there supposed to speakers like what you mean well with owl invite you know I would invite you to come and speak for an hour or I'd invite Apple check or we have somebody speak on longevity or somebody has begun Yost during the during the the experience will have a couple speakers talk on you know nutrition and Fitness Wellness career whenever just another piece of the of the element and then and then like I said we have pool training and then we try and we've been certifying trainers down to kind of help people go through the the process is well into its you know it's it's really about rest and recovery and breathing it's more based on on that part is not just another training thing of like hey how weak you know how we can Hammer you and his rent I think that's overplayed I think the ways we can train and and how we're training is really overplayed I think we're we're not creating enough things that nurture system you know and really look at trying to to support people in there in there in there already you know hammering life they're already just beating themselves down inside the red eye and then we'll go to the gym and we'll Hammer ourselves there and then we'll stay up all day and you know and I think we'd they need some support so breathwork is a big part of it knowing how to move correctly I think that's a big part of it has plenty of people hurt themselves especially in the gym deep without you know it without some knowledge of movement and form and then I have a pool training system I developed which is the Gabby was tell me where I think we have is it's a marriage between the gym in the in the pool cuz I despise swimming that's the item said he wouldn't take these masks in the spins and we're going to swim this Coastline where the waves are breaking on the rocks and we're going to go for the five miles I mean like I said hey go down there and and and and wear some swim goggles where you can't even see and swimming some murky water where you don't know what's in it and where to swim a mile down there and you can do that every day that I'd rather step on a rusty nail to do that I mean it's like that's so because of my my disdain swimming. Kind of swimming I mean it's if it's in the surfing the wave that's a different that's a different game that's a whole different you kill me I'm going to die. I would rather privation cuz you're obviously into doing this stuff yourself why create a foundation or well the reason why we started it was because an opportunity to expose yourself and share with more people we were doing it ourselves naturally and then we have friends, and they were like this sucks awesome and then can I invite my friend and then we were we realize that that if we really wanted to expose it to more people ensure we were going to be a limitation if everybody had to come to my house Expedia Expedia life.com and xpt stands for will my my concept is it is exploration and performance training I'd appreciate his I have this whole the first of all there's a bunch of things that happened in the water right which one of the things that happens is when you're underwater the compression of the water allows the blood to flow through your lymphatic system which normally takes about a 24-hour. It happens in one hour so imagine compression tights like if you were in it really helps the blood flow the ultimate compression the water is right spiders because of the psychology of what we can do because you deal a lot with stress and so we're able to implement stress in a very controlled environment and then and then and then like for example in Grant Hill at one point in his career but I have left friend Joakim Noah who's a basketball player and we were doing these we're doing these in the water we're doing these dunking drills last summer so he try train with him and get a bunch of stuff cuz you can do a lot of Highly explosive heavy loaded movement with protection me about momentum which is which way to pull your shoulder out to the free app is going to hurt your knee where I could take a basketball player and I can run him through thousands of jumps thousands which at the end of if I did that on land he'll be broke and he's already jumping too much in his season he doesn't need to jump more right so I could load him up and and make him do these Dynamic movements but now he's protected cuz he's because we taking gravity out so we're so it's it's like it's like saying reading outer space but it's in my backyard what kind of results of these athletes with him and his career at and I don't know how many years he's been in the NBA he came back after doing this dunking job is using this as an example and it had the most dunks per minute that he's had his entire career Grant Hill was talking about he game 3 in in the last year of his career after playing in the NBA for 20 years old city jumping 3 in tire but yeah yeah so I mean we're getting kind of tangible stuff that I'm that I'm that I'm getting just the there's a lot more things a lot of it has to do with breath because in the water is all controlled breathing patterns so everything is controlled because you can't breathe until you get to the top so if you're doing a drover you're jumping and most of the things we do are leg driven swimming is mostly arms part of the reason why only use her arms is cuz you use five times the oxygen with your legs as you do with your arms so the legs are very inefficient for swimming but yet they create a lot of load on your heart which that can boost your breath holding it so there's a bunch of other other things that happened but a lot of it is just that environment is very protective so for Recovery to for like when somebody's got a hurt knee hurt hip hurt ankle you can go in there and start moving dynamically early before you would ever do it land and be protected so there's a bunch of you know and then we can just ratcheted up I can make you know if I truly believe if you gave you said you know I'll get Phelps is going to come to your house and you're going to have Phelps for three months I could make Phelps faster other game a whole nother game now did you invent this protocol this whole thing of jumping and doing in the water with what motivated you where I came originally concept came out of the drilled not a drill thing we used to do in the summer when we were kids that's a Hawaiian kind of waterman drill where you run on the bottom of stones Sophie and then when when you go up he swims down grab didn't and he goes along as far as he can and you swim and you just go back and forth until neither one of you can do it so his base kind of on that concept and then but I wanted to expand that because that's kind of limiting you just swim and you run and you can't isolate movements and you're not working a like you can with domed out so now I ship dumbbells into the water and and I have all different weight so depending on your skill level you know everything we do and that's one thing about everything that I ball dance is it usually has to have a spec he has to be able to be enough for everybody to do it it has to be old people and kids in my mind that it's not viable unless it's it it it you can appeal to everybody that you need you need to kids need to go to do an old person be able to really be valid to really have legitimacy you know it's like okay the coffee it has to be there has to be things that the kids can can have that creamer I have it it's got to get it can't just be specialized I think the specialization of some of this stuff is creates the lack of validity I don't think that it's valid if it's specialized and so I could take a little kid like my daughter does a bunch of the pool training stuff right I have an older older guys that they come and do a bunch of the pool training stuff you know that it's really right because then it's like this is real like the kids can do it the old people can do it through the top guys can do at the bottom guys can do it everybody can do it that the you know that that something that's that's I just think that that's do you know what what what is real how many years even doing this xpt well-developed 10 to 12 years about 12 years now in the pool with any evolved it so you can hold off with a couple ideas diaper boy had like a velcro weight jacket where you don't grow like a little scary and now can you get up till that wasn't that wasn't that wasn't doing a jump so you you and your jumping on the slope so your curl pressing and jumping with with with Dino 60 70 pound dumbbells depending on your side with swimming with 50 lb 60 lb dumbbells When jumping off the bottom with 15-pound dumbbells that depends on the exercise so it's all depends on the person skilled what the drill is but we I have a whole I have all the weights next to the pool so we have everything from 70 225 lb the jump press like doing some sort oh yeah it's all you'd love it it's crazy I called the gorilla curl sew to squat curl press jump and then you when you come out of water just let the weights Dropped In The Water catches at me you could never do that I landed in the water so I have I have a about a 11 foot deep end and then I have a slope so you can choose every depth all the way and then I have what you saw in that last video it's about a three and a half shallow in self this is the first pool and trying to build a couple I'm trying to build one in Hawaii right now that's it's going to fall from what I learned from this pool so this point I just kind of built it with you know with the hopes of Designing a program and then out of it came all the all this stuff what are you an altar I'm in a create multiple depth so I'm going to do like an area that has 12 foot then we're going to ship back to feet and have a 10-foot and then another flat area of 8 and then another flatter a 6-foot and then I have the magic with is about somewhere between 35 to 40 feet wide and that's like if you're trying to swim a heavy dumb don't know we do a lot of individual limbs stuff so that you isolate each limb so we'll do pistol squats and Russians lunge squats and a bunch of other you know and movements that you can you be very vulnerable if you did that in the gym you keep the Jets are you can hear yourself but because you have that stability and Anna it totally support you so you can you can be and go into ranges emotions that you don't have like you know you might not be able to go sync all the way down into a deep lunge on one leg and press out with dumbbells in your hand on land but in the water you can and handle water actually makes it lighter so you have to boost the weight and stuff there's a bunch of great stuff that comes out of it that sounds very attracted to people that have had injuries beautiful and what But the irony is it it kind of get a little bit like what comes out of rehab where you actually get better performance to like like you know a lot of a lot of rehab exercises become performance driving exercises only when you get hurt you like website yeah I actually was a thing that we have the thing we have right now is probably the most the most kind of traveling one more thing that's happening as soon as we have a breathing out coming out so we have a breathing out that has almost every different modality of breathwork and so there's some pretty cool stuff in there where you can go choose a before I go to sleep or before my workout after my workout you know during my thing so we have a bunch of little pretty cool breathing app that that were working on it as well we have the the thing we have right now is probably the most the most kind of prevalent OneNote thing that's happening as soon as we have a breathing out coming out so we have a breathing out that has almost every different modality of breathwork and so there's some pretty cool stuff in there where you can go Tuesday before I go to sleep or before my workout after my workout you know during my thing so we have a bunch of for the

		<div class="paragraph"> how long you been living in Hawaii with my mom took me from San Francisco and I was six month old low it was only a technicality that I wasn't born there which actually worked against me because you know when you're not born then when you're not born there then you're not from there we missed you bro your mother here in this in the state but my mom took me a few months old I have a theory about people from Hawaii there's a groundedness that they seem to exhibit that is universal it's almost at you you very rarely find completely frivolous do people that live in Hawaii that they're not them I'm not that smart but there's a groundedness there is so many of them have because they're on a volcano about what is that right and we have a couple terms one of them is Mana which is a power from the land another one is Aloha which is our kind of a spirit of how people act from Hawaii but I believe it has a lot to do with Islanders I think Islanders have that Anna and it has a lot to do with it has a lot to do with the ocean being around the ocean that the oceans surrounding you and the ocean is the most conductive substance on Earth soap elec electrically and there's all this thing so you get influenced by this you know and I think energetically the nature is so powerful I think it puts us into a there's a certain kind of humility that you have when you're in that you're next to a volcano that's fourteen thousand foot and you got a 2000 foot waterfall in you got a giant wave I mean this is stuff that kind so yeah we're just Lance we're just little specks and we don't tumbling but it's also would Spire energy plan and energizing gives you power in the ocean have you ever seen that book called The Blue mind on the guy's pretty interesting and does the study of why we gravitate towards being on the beach while expensive real estate is beachfront and it's something about when we stare at the ocean they did all these studies were the it just totally lights to bring up that are whole something about the Horizon and about the ocean itself that that affects our whole well-being and and part of it we don't even know why but we're just drawn like white you know why is why are we drawn there why do we you know and it has it has an effect on her system I wonder if that's because we evolved rising and about the ocean itself that that affects our whole well-being and in part of it we don't even know why but we're just drawn like white you know why is why are we drawn there why do we you know and it has it has an effect on her system I wonder if that's because we evolved to be close to the water because that's where the Bounty is as we can get fish and while we evolved from the one that's true tattoo</div>

Guys the most ripped and shredded knocked out Hawaiian guy he's not like shredded obviously but he looks more like a swimmer yeah you might find that his breathing might he might have better air volume because at the end of the day Define abyss and got it. But when you look at real breathwork and how the diaphragm works and how the ribs expand hear you realizes like were none of us are really doing it right you know and you can actually create more volume you know you said you liked cordycep mushrooms yes will do those are actually a vasodilator goes help help you absorb oxygen udo's can up your vo2max I just want a couple things that you can how to increase your VO2 max but cordyceps one of them peaches Beach another one you can create more volume by so by opening the rib cage and creating more room. Can create and promote your vo2max breathwork folks who have never done anything like that they don't they really don't understand what you're saying like what do you mean by breathwork like give us an example of like a protocol they have it in apnea there's a thing called holotropic breathwork really is is when you isolate the breathing system in and you know the simplest way and that's Jim says hey I don't give a s*** how you breathe just breathe right yeah yeah so you don't like we'll do a breath routine will sit somebody down and we'll see okay breed like you're running read that you're running and we'll talk to slow run buddy like. Like you're running like anytime right the system and you're not doing it because of inactivity the fact is it when you use that system and you work it and you're not detracting from it by doing an exercise if you're doing the assault bike where your arms are working in your legs are working so all the oxygen that you're absorbing is going into your arms and legs when you're isolating you just do the breathing alone now. Oxygen is going into that system in that system is going to develop and get better then when you do your assault bike after you develop that system will isolate breathwork and we'll just do it alone will whether we're doing you know whether we're doing breath-hold we're doing some kind of apnea breathwork which is you know we can do a pattern where you're doing like you eat you hold for 30 seconds and then you breathe in for 15 and then you read out for 15 then you hold again then you go in and out and hold in and out and hold that's one pattern another pattern is in hold out hold in hold out old in hole. like to know again those are there you know and then there's pranayama apnea holotropic there's just Subway your oxygen the system where you know like winds would be how are you just get that rhythm going for 5 minutes so again in life like not thinking about breathing that's the beginning of breathwork Jimmy awareness up hey I need to know I need to need to breathe in and out a big one with martial arts in Jiu-Jitsu with beginners when they first start sparring for the first time they panic and they have shallow breath and breathe they can't get a deep breath hyperventilate you put somebody in the eye conscious mind protecting the organ organisms like your body intuitively knows this is dangerous environment get out and so that reaction is to get you to get out when you when you make a conscious effort to not leave that environment than the body goes okay you're not going to get out okay we'll no organized I'll bring the blood to the organs and adjust everything I'll boost your hormones and then pretty soon you don't get that response who's the hormone spring all the blood now or against you know that but that child that's that's a similar thing to the way you talk about Jiu-Jitsu where people are the stress on the system next rest until they are involuntarily you know and that's why your flight one thing you can really do the, like, kid down this is the way you get yourself in the parasympathetic where you bring your thing down is when you extend your breath for seven seconds on the inhale and exhale that reduce that'll bring everything down like if you want to come down are your kids straight your kid just all can you get them to just freed in for 7 seconds and I will think about it Psy learn about the breath which is amazing I think the reason why the breath is always been so important to me is because of the ocean shore as you know growing up when you almost drowned you know a thousand times you are as important you get to appreciate like there's none down there and it's all up there and so be cool down there so when you say you can get pack well I've learned because of Hixon Gracie do you know him but you know what does that what is it called that that's the Yeah Yeah Yeahs anytime you're in the stress if you can control your breath that can deal with your heart rate ever do 30 seconds in 30 seconds out they were do that yeah just slow down what's interesting cuz you know Williams done like some record-breaking stuff and you have that free diving stuff work with a scrub oxygen you know what they hyperventilate and scrub the CO2 and get that real low but you have to be careful about shallow water blackout so we don't really practice any of that stuff we do more like assault bike jump in the pool and see how long you can hold your breath and then he was like that's big-time 15 seconds you like wow that was amazing at maximum heart rate how long can you hold your heart I mean how long can you hold your breath that's him that's a challenge right next to the pool</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what are the things you do besides the curl pressed jump think like what other it was the tops exercise you doing in the pool. We're doing we're doing you know like single dumbbell single-arm dumbbell and then stroke get a breath free fall so you're doing single arm jumping okay and then we're doing swapping single-arm swimming swimming it's called an ammo box if you like if you had an ammo box against from across the river like that's kind of the concept we have cell phone we have the Yuki we have we have on you keep going into the water swim with your hand out of like a Russian pistol squat jump lunges a bunch of a bunch of drop-down you were on the bottom with two dumbbells to the other side you set one dumbbell up you jump up you bring one dumbbell out you go back down grab the other one bring that one out then pull both of them out and come back down and run back out we go down fast break basketball courts rundown you jump up twice run back jump up Price Funeral and then we have Spider-Man we have you carry a dumbbell and you descend into one end you jump up you grab you get a breath you descend into the other end and then and then all these exercises were able to wee-wee to make them harder will do them on an Excel so you can do ramp up you know we can either increase weight we can create increase distance or we can do it do it on an Excel so when you developed all the stuff did you run all this down from your own practice from all trial-and-error like how did you develop this well at some of them came from failure so you know you try to do one move and then you'd fail friends that I was working out with it would so we'll try this and then we modify it so someone came for my daughter I watch my daughter my one daughter swim down one day of gravel weight and then try to swim up with it I'm like that's a great moving we know so we we we some of it came out of necessity for movement like certain Dynamic movements at the basketball guy you know one of my friends needed or and then so it didn't naturally all the movements kind of naturally that's why they're all so great and there's an isolation to each limb so we have an isolation so you can really see if the dexterity of your right arm versus your left arm and how strong it is versus the other one how strong one leg is next to the other one the ranges of motion in the mobilityware we're doing we can do backflips and frontflips multiple so you jump up and get a breath and then do multiple flips and and and extend work time extend breathwork where you'll do you know like three or four moves in one on one breath so we have a bunch of ways to to ramp it up as realvolve cuz you know how it is it's like in any exercise you get proficient and you're like what I make it harder while you're taking longer to make it faster you make it heavier I mean he's because you're in the water we always have the breath-holding element and then we have the distance element and then we had to wait because we have wait so we have to wait elements are with those are different ways that we can ramp it one on one breath so we have a bunch of ways to to ramp it up as we evolve cuz you know how it is it's like in any exercise you get proficient and you're like what I make it harder while you're taking longer to make it faster you make it heavier I mean these because you're in the water we always have the breath-holding element and then we have the distance element and then we have to wait because we have wait so we have to wait on it so with those are different ways that we can ramp it you know ramp it up</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> explain nose breathing to me out there now nose breathing is better better for you because of well first of all you were designed to breed your sinuses in your nose were designed for breathing and so you actually admitted gas in your sinuses from my understanding that gas called the nitric oxide which is a vasodilator helps you absorb oxygen so by breathing through your nose plus you reduce the amount of intake that you have and not get you CO2 tolerance so Can you view breeding less volume in you know from the fight game with soon as a guy goes to mouth-breathing you like toast do you know that right that's your first giveaway so your ability to deal with stress and breathe through nose coming everybody should be breathing through their nose in their sleep walking around and somehow we became mouth-breathers in the last 200 years and they're not sure why there's a great book called the oxygen Advantage by Patrick me Google that she's on her board of xbt but he you know kind of realize that our issues really stem from mouth breathing chronic mouth breathing which is scrubbing are CO2 and keeping her CO2 levels down which is the marker to absorb oxygen levels are down you don't ignore the oxygen from your bloodstream the cells don't take it as soon as the CO2 goes up then the then the body starts to pull it out of the blood oxygen will keep your tolerance but definitely get your phone up but the smaller volume helps your body become more tolerant of higher levels of CO2 but then no the sinuses themselves a Minit gas that helps the long absorb the oxygen is and that's what you know that's what I've been led to understand I had a broken nose until it's 40 my nose was useless I couldn't get anything out of it it would have been broken like and when I got it fixed it was like the world change it was like I couldn't do that I just couldn't breathe out of my nose and I would go to yoga class and tell me to breathe out of my nose when I don't have one I could smell farts yeah that's a smell gas and gasoline has to be rough for me to smell it not a lot of people I mean it I'm not saying that you have that but a lot of people actually will gain volume after a few weeks of forcing himself to know Street do actually start to open up all of that that system that makes sense so you know Tina nose breath you your you have another gear because then you go to mouth it's like you got up it's like having a you know blower in your car or something you open up that you know you open up the air and it's a whole new game so by being able to sustain a high output of nose breathing then it's all about the tolerance for CO2 is how much you know like that's why altitude screw people up cuz it's your Two Jacks up and they don't have a tolerance and then you get all wonky and you feel like crap have another gear when you go to mouth it's like you got up it's like having a you know blower in your car or something you open up that you know you open up the air and it's a whole new game so by being able to sustain a high output of nose breathing then it's all about the tolerance for CO2 you know like that's why altitude screw people up cuz it's your Two Jacks up and they don't have a tolerance and then you get all wonky and you feel like crap</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I really believe that the truly be to have Optimum performance and to be in to be Optimum that you have to have the holes every spoken the tire that you need every single spoke that you have to have a good relationship with your family you got to have loved and you got to have good things with the kids and you got to have friends and you got to have your health and you got to sleep well and you got to be hydrated you got to work out and you got and you got to have a you know your business thing and you got to have I think you just have to have all things to really have balance that I think if you get one of the spokes isn't tight that there's a bump in the wheel and you're just not going to I don't truly believe that you you're performing at your Optimum cuz you need your head needs to be clear when you go into your performance whatever that looks like that makes a lot of sense. all the spokes good and I know that the how that feels and I know when it's good you're you're clear your good have that be real clean we're meant to have that there be some balance I was I went to SpaceX one time and I pulled him inside he was standing out of a you know you got to take care of this for my hand by just go take care of this but you got to take care of you getting workout who sings imagine imagine like if they can do what they're doing you no burn it on both ends imagine what they could do fully balanced why don't think he'd want to do any more than what he's doing I just think he's so obsessed with getting Tesla to run correctly when he was sleeping on the floor of the Tesla Factory and working 17 hours a day I mean that's that is doesn't same person when he was just there all day long trying to make more in the obviously it does work there amazing car it's beneficial that this drive that he has but I agree with you like for overall enjoyment of life that's not the way to go but I can't pull back and look at it from a distance you and you're in it I think you get too detailed and then you can't you know you can't be I think you I think you could be better because of that I think of you maybe I'll be profitable I mean you're you're competing against you know the big boys yeah but what's interesting is loyal even though they are doing that they've managed to that he's managed to make something that's so different than anything else you have one but now I don't f****** either crazy when an Audi and you see all the companies going that way now you cannot see I mean we were cuz my buddy while Ben and I were into electric stuff and and we went and there was a guy that has electric dragster and we went down and with this electric razor and it just smoked any Top Fuel dragster like Beyond and but it didn't make noise so no one wanted to watch it so no smell no flames yeah I know pollution told people like that's no fun so yeah but when you drive a Tesla Like the Model S p100d I think it's called when you drive it it's effortless like everything you just use go where you want to go I'd like to go over there like a video game get there get all that delay like 8 it's like AC vs. DC what are normal cars are like a c a little gap between the power and when you get that you know it's it's the body has to get used to the I'm still not totally okay with not looking where you're going and just flipping it on autopilot but why I just like I said I think you need a person who's this obsessed as Elon Musk has to make something like that but I agree with you if if you want to enjoy his life I'll just live longer because of his amazing by by making you like be healthier yourself so you can be around longer and maybe do more great things right so is it just you know I'm just speaking personally but when you try to look at optimization right like you're here you only get so long you know what are you doing and and are you really optimizing it bye-bye you know Burn by by taxing the system and not at not getting all of it that out of it that you know but I guess in a way it's kind of like unhappiness you know people use that as a workout so that's a little that makes you tired and hungry and you know yeah there's always that choices you make right look sometimes you just get stuck in the momentum of the choice that you made and it's very difficult to like take that pause and go okay might want us a right way maybe I need to reset and we need to just take some time to really consider if this is making me happy and how many years are going to be able to do this and sustain it yeah well that's a tricky thing shelf you know analyzing yourself okay might want us a right way they do I need to reset and we need to do is take some time to really consider if this is making me happy and how many years are going to be able to do this and sustain it yeah well that's a tricky thing that's it that's a shelf shelf you know analyzing yourself and putting that up is I think it's easier just to keep going</div>

They can't they can go see out and knock you out like that without that stuff lingering and you know how long it take to when you get a hangover I mean supposed to do like an epidural block on your epidural block yeah it's so good that they could just isolate the left the left hip they did that to me when I had my first ACL surgery I wanted to see it yeah cuz I was like I want to see this turns out I had three of them barely walk I mean I could still serve but I get to land knives hobbling around like you know wound and Maynard from Tool you know the band Tool Maynard is he's a Jiu-Jitsu Enthusiast and he had to get his hip done and he parked his hip hop from stomping on stage now cuz there was a stomping with a blue but I know the brakes the brakes in the other in the left ankle and left foot and how many I had and that I was always on it I know that attributed to lock is this this this right leg carry the load for that thing for your left leg fixed my ankle ankle to take X-ray they just want to see to have no metal in there there's no screws there's no nothing I just let it you know I'm just so every time won't you just let it sort of heal itself up yeah so it's nap time you just walk around laughing pretty much cut the cast off the first timer The Arches ankle was so Cal so bonded that when I broke it I actually broke my Arch that was the probably the most painful that was the most painful break down in that area your body or blow your ankles what really 75% lines of numbers numbers above your feet your feet have like half the bones of your entire body I never thought of that that's crazy but it makes a lot of s*** down there a lot going on don't swim in the elbows knees and stuff you know</div>

It'll fit so it's a meat-based a non-meat bass Burger it supposed to taste pretty similar to meet I haven't had one of those what do I'm saying is now they figured out how to take out cells and replicate it actually is meat no animals being killed which is the ideal paleo Whole Foods situation of Noah if you're going to act in a certain way towards your food know what you're doing what are you willing to kill you know why my friend Chris Pratt hell yes he's got a farm quick nap no idea what's going to happen and then they just died instantly and he made this like really detailed post on Instagram about it people got super upset with them you know that that he talked about this as a peaceful thing and that he has his animals that he loves and cares for and do you see pictures of him like touching them and holding them and then later their packaged up as me and my foot but you saw just a steak you wouldn't have a problem with it because someone said cook the steak you get a lot of people at school that looks good but it's like I killed this animal and now I'm going to cook it people you're a monster everyone has two other than that getting hit by car sending people to put down their dogs and the cats so maybe this is not and that lamb is being bred for that purpose and it's being done painlessly that's the important thing and I had a good life and it wasn't a factory crowded shoulder-to-shoulder existence of torture situation Lambs baby Nature's about us eating babies I haven't had mutton I haven't had like a sheep sheep you know that such a British thing and it's always like an old story books you can read but like now I don't think she's getting their hair wild sheep backstrap was very good some while sheep that he killed but while I'm here I'm going to try hagfish have you heard that's weird f****** slimy thing yeah it's by the ocean how do they cook that I Korean barbecue place here that has any I like legit Korean BBQ yeah yeah yeah faceless we are

that I had a bologna that was really that was not that a lot of times it's a credit cards have LOL it wasn't until I've had a bologna before and I liked it I like it I don't I don't love it it's expensive to me so I just found the issue seems to be a protein which is what is used to make these burgers and daughter found about what you were saying is The Impossible Burger actually tested 11 times higher when tested for glyphosate than the meat burger with just there's two different versions IAT protein protein chips everyday is that a problem so what is an article for the pretty it's a very Harley find a clean pea protein Source anywhere Jesus Christ all got glyphosate glyphosate does glyphosate and please Google this because the argument was glyphosate is great because it just kills the weeds and bacteria and it doesn't kill people and actually drink it with a problem you're saying is no no no you have bacteria in your body so if you're taking in glyphosate you're killing them . everybody might not kill you sure it's not good for you and it f**** up your system okay this is the argument I guess that they use to present in court they must have used this to get the jury to wore them 2 billion dollars in damage cancer did this is what the problem first of all I'm a moron I don't know anything about any of the science behind us when I read this I see two different cancer just like so many other things I see people saying there's no evidence this is just there all hysteria but is that the people that work for bear is that like their PR firm that's putting this out there to try to look like alleviate people's concerns and stop some lawsuits in their tracks they trying to influence public opinion on this or is it real science it shows that this stuff is very

grass-fed meat I don't know if there's more protein that doesn't seem to make sense but if you look at like it could be more protein cuz they might be like that. yeah the same amount of ounces yeah but there's also a bunch of other s*** and towards and essential fatty acids exist and grass-fed meat good stuff other than what you're saying over and over the protein is helping your games or

He's a very smart guy I think it's smart enough to admit that he f***** up for him and I'm like he owned that he played it wrong thanks one doing a remote show sure we from your in Los Angeles during the UK show where you know he was talking to him like he wasn't there the British guy was cuz he wasn't really the right and then the other part is that short time format you did you don't have enough time you never have time to have a conversation is just talk and then knows this is to vintage super fast and he's smarter than you he's very smart and articulate and he talks back to doing the rose to prominence when he was on Piers Morgan that's your line and Benton store-bought futuristic no I just think when I cover the comes usurpations that it's very important citizen have admitted and also to be like I'm popular and I've never heard of you admit this is of no relevance to their validity what they're doing</div>

That's not real break their nose not going to kill them but I got the easiest self-defense ahead but has hitting them with the Palm I thought you going to say when I said that there was one where kids it was like I do karate movie with hit the Palm up to the nose the nose bone would go in the brain would kill someone and never break your hand a person throwing a punch you have a real good chance of breaking your hand I'll give you crack them in the forehead most likely going to break your hand with your palms will speed up and they would smack each other with their hands so they're kicking punching do submission techniques fairly crude in comparison to today's MMA hour but we got to see a lot of leg locks back then and there was some fishy fights too but my point is like Bas Rutten was the first guy figured out how to really f*** people out with palm strikes and what he did as he has really flexible wrist he's a badass Striker so he learned how to pull his hands way back you just throw them like punches he would just do the same motions that he would do a punch but just guys with his with his palms and he was lighting people up like a Christmas tree in a tank race with that is horrific to what he f***** with a bunch of people with bombs Bas Rutten KO put put bathroom tbsp Aki uko Moonachie who is like an elite MMA fighter who is Hicks and Gracie's last opponent in Hixson now I was fighting MMA getting started out in pancreas and Bas Rutten KO them in the way KO them was like like like a punch but he was doing it with his palms just smashing people just like your hand but there's a lot of things you think wouldn't work clothes lines one of them that should work okay that's my point how about the DDT hear it so here's Bonicelli that Nico Stryker that we saw an MMA will you like woah like this is what can happen like when he was kicking people and pancreas everybody's like woah like this is this guy can f****** kick like you seen a lot of guys were kicking the kind of like karate be maybe they didn't have as much power but he was Dutch kickboxing I ever I think in my recollection to win a title off of his back by from strikes he fought Kevin Randleman Kim around him as a badass wrestler kept taking them down and boss was beating the s*** out of him from the bottom throwin elbows by any gave him a decision which a lot of people disagree with rose like man you look at the volume of strikes landed boss man shyt way more in my recollection to win a title off of his back by from strikes he fought Kevin Randleman can random as a badass wrestler kept taking them down and boss was beating the s*** out of him from the bottom throwin elbows by and they gave him a decision which a lot of people disagree with those like man you look at the volume of strikes landed Boston</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you think about the future at least me the one we talked about my concern I'm worried that rich people are going to get a hold of Technology quick and they're going to have massive unfair advantages in terms of intellect in terms of physical athletic ability I mean we we really can have a grossly imbalance the world radically quickly if this happens fast when we don't understand exact with the consequences of his actions are until it's too late and try to play catch-up with rules and regulations and laws that's a very very real danger and that's why but in this book that's why I'm out speaking every day about this topic because we need to recognize that if we have if we approach these revolutionary Technologies using the same values that we experienced today where you were here and very comfortable with just down the road there people who are just too or living without many opportunities there people in parts of the world like Central African Republic Warzone kids are born malnourished if those are our values today we can expect that when these future Technologies arrive will use those those same value so it's real and right now we have an opportunity to say I these Technologies are coming whatever we do these Technologies are coming there's a better possible future and a worst possible future and how can we Infuse our best values into the process to optimize the good stuff and minimize about 7 certainly what you're saying is arresting what happened when European countries had slightly better weapons slightly better ships than everybody else they took over the world dominated everybody and so yeah that's it's very real that's the government's need to play a role in ensuring broad access and in regulating these these Technologies to make sure we don't get to that kind of dystopian snare that you've lay down what's also in terms of government regulating things like why are they qualified who are they just people that are either elected or that you know where some sort of a monarchy or you're dealing with either kings and queens and cheeks or you're dealing with presidents and it we've seen in this country that sometimes our presents don't know what the f*** they're talkin about right so who are they to just drop science just to disrupt this natural flow technology we need somebody to do it we need some representation of our Collective will be to avoid some of the things like you know like you just mentioned that that's the reason why humans banded together and made these kind of credit governments and the reason for democracy especially if you have more functioning democracy is is that your government in some ways reflects the will of the people in the government does things that individuals can't do and I do there a letter a Libertarian arguments why don't you just like he want a little road in front of your house either go build the road and somebody but there are two things in that modeled it won't get done there a lot of kind of big National even global concerns that you need some kind of Regulation because what we're talking about is the future of life and life on Earth and there have to be some kind of guard rails and that's why what I'm arguing for so we really need a bottom-up reading every person and that's why I'm so thrilled to be here with you today Joe every person needs to really understand these revolutionary Technologies like genetics like Ai and all of our yki and all of our responsibilities and opportunities to say hey this is really important here are the values that I think that I cherish and just like you said I don't want it to be that the wealthiest people those are the ones who have kids with higher IQs and live longer and healthier than than everybody else and so we have to raise our voice and it needs to be a bottom-up process and it in a top-down process and it's real it's really hard</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> platforming think it's fascinating because the way the stuff works folks is it when people 2D platformer the first people that will get deplatformed are people that you agree with getting deplatformed people like you know I'll go real Nazi like someone who's an avowed white supremacy like this guy had a guy with thinks it's okay to be white on a shelf and then it gets it gets more as it gets more more Progressive to get some more Preposterous but it really is great once you accept 1 grade then you drop below in a little bit more Preposterous and then that's acceptable and then a little bit more and then that becomes except that it's a double standard between people who are Orthodox and people who are unorthodox Barbara Walters with Castro she sat down with Kadafi who's killed how many people send out the murderous dictator if your Kadafi if you sit down with someone on a podcast with someone who has Allpoint views that is somehow different what's a new thing the right is a platforming and deplatforming and you put a put in the sky on your platform like all this disk this kind of communication is very new I just didn't exist don't know was saying that to Mike Wallace interviewed Milo am I gay conservative provocateur now are you what they're trying to do is social media they no longer have a monopoly Orthodox off any left-wing or right-wing Orthodox. No longer has a monopoly on the microphone and that's very dangerous if you want to basically set the boundaries of what acceptable discourse is something with forget politics nitin if you want to say these are you should have lyrics like this people should dance like this they shouldn't you know dress a certain way this is what they would like I mean back in the 90s you remember they had the warning labels on CDs and said this has explicit lyrics that way Walmart could with Clean Hands say we're not being vow politics we're following the rules so that's what I'm giving you target whatever company in excuse these are the people you don't need to deal with and then they could say we're looking at this from an external point of view and also my perspective on it is it there certain subjects I think that we can all agree we need to cover and we need to deal with in terms of laws and in terms of the way the government is run but a lot of these disagreements aren't on that allow these disagreements seem to be just on political ideologies and liberal vs conservative ideologies and people think differently they have different styles behavior and thinking this is why like if you had a station to put hip-hop and all the sudden you just got a bunch of Aerosmith songs play look what the f*** is this is not what I want get this off the station except for Walk This Way that's the one with run of how a lot of people seem to be approaching conservative versus Progressive thinking as it's like once you have this mindset you don't want to hear other pin is if they're going to influence you or if you don't like the way they sound you don't like what they do and you want to get them off the channel and this is what it seems like is happening with social media platform right is that the social media platforms are like we're country station we don't play Heavy Metal get that s*** off our Network like we are a progressive Network we don't play conservative get that stuff off if they had said that we're Progressive would be honest and fair but the claim is no we are Banning people two arguing X Y and Z this is really important s*** this is going to decide how we listen to didn't exist before okay and now it does now we have is unbelievable and I'm enjoying it right now talking to you we're all enjoying it to Divya tweeting about this writing comments about this but it's if this really branches off until one side get to do it and one side doesn't we're going to have a f****** tremendous problem in this country if you think that this problem that we have right now and it's it's just starting to be an issue over the last couple years. This is what this could escalate almost like it's it's absolutely reasonable to think that violence could come out of the Trump presidency if it was okay and a lot of people in that building and said you wanted legitimacy okay I'm voting for Donald Trump for president and now he's in the white house for you to say that people to say that these ideas you know are evil and should be discussed as a separate Concepts cuz even if you think they're evil it from your point of view it's in the White House are you going to pretend this isn't a problem in the world it is a contradiction there but one thing's progressivism offers many people is this idea of Truth and Sergey knowing you're one of the good guys and knowing you're in the majority at 1 year that is not always true I think I caused some cognitive stress you know I know I would absolutely agree with that I just think there's a real problem that's happening now with some of the accounts that I'm seeing getting banned without reason without reason for things that are like parody accounts them so I dropped you he's the one who made this great meme during the State of Union what he had President Trump and all the piece of footage from the state of the union of the Democrats looking pissed and he put it over the Everybody Hurts right this 2-minute video a joke they got a copyright strike cuz it's like you're on the right to use the music trump and retweeted it he put on another one he just got suspended for a week he did the video for my book so they don't here's the thing if someone is a name you can say hey delete this tweet and violates our guidelines Ryukin warnings you can call their manager they don't do that you're just vanished overnight and there's something very Soviet about this because when they vanished you your entire archive get managed to and it's like waiting with this person is bad and dangerous don't you want to show other people is an example of what to avoid like this will get you banned so you can modify your behavior accordingly or what they want apparently we will looks like what they want is for everyone to be self-censoring to be afraid and that way it's like instead of saying we're censorious it's like you made that decision on your own vanished overnight and there's something very Soviet about this because when they vanished you your entire archives get banished to and it's acquainted with this person is bad and dangerous don't you want to show other people is an example of what to avoid like this will get you banned so you can modify your behavior accordingly but what they want apparently we will looks like what they want is for everyone to be self-censoring had to be afraid and that way it's like instead of saying we're so short yes it's like you made that decision on your own</div>

The dog whistle that the dog was a cover so there's a guy named Ben Garrison and he was a regular conservative artist right and he would have drawings about Ben Bernanke or Hillary whatever the Nazis took his are replaced all of his drawings with juice so instead of the great wizard of that being the FED it was a Jewish caricature and they did it perfectly and they also invented this whole back story about that he was a closet Nazi and this poor guy in Montana if you Google him it's like not to any sick why is this happening to me and a Photoshop work is perfect So eventually they come down and you know he now he's kind of like a regular cartoonist in the story got out but that's his artwork so the people is poor guy who was stalking victim of Nazis it's very rare nowadays to have a new victim of Nazis and he's actually one of them well meme culture oh yeah there's a lot of dirt bags a really profited off of other people's me more to automatic my friend on he's terrible haven't even otherwise he works from the inside yeah some of them just flat-out steal and sell them steal and then they'll a tribute under different account but then these people that they make these giant sites with all other people's work and they curate them and they make millions yep do something there's a bunch of things that Eddie Bravo hilarious ones all the time he'll send me a funny meme and then I'll send it to Brendan Schaub and I'm not asking who made that me so it but the joke Brandi doesn't think that I made it myself so it's not like I'm stealing right but I'm definitely not crediting the original Creator cuz I don't know who the f*** it is right around so but that's all with in good faith the person with in bad faith. website and inserts profiting off of it they find a loophole and they make deals with Comedy Central and they also have people who actually steal stand-up bits and turn those bit in the memes and they put those bits on their they're meme pages may do the same s*** they'll do it what they just their content Kneaders they need content their horse parasites yes so they just they'll hire people to do it they in the people that they hire they'll they'll steal people's jokes and tournament to me and it's real Ennis Texas I mean a dynastic become a joke because the people like I like this is a rare Pepe right as cuz I please say it isn't like being replicated a lawsuit out of court so they're going to go to court they're going to figure out whether or not you can use Pepe the Frog but I talked about this in the context of it's like if King Andy Warhol Campbell Soup can it's the same thing it's like it's yes someone creates it but if someone is using it in it kind of a broader satirical contact what it doesn't do because Andy probably couldn't do that today corporations had more power back then unless accountability cuz that was social media flavors of Soup cans right put some up in a gallery Campbell's is like what the f*** is this like they don't know what to do right and they didn't know what to call this is unprecedented so they had a storefront and they had to cancel the window to go why pay a hundred grand you could get here for a dollar and they try to own it and their own way that's smart this is not used different things be different things different people and if you're using it in one context as any other context aren't legitimate that's how I fart and images work I mean that's almost like what happened with Sky Montana right now is work and then turns into Nazi stuff and I'll send he becomes not right with Pepe the Frog first thing so they took all his other characters and made them full-blown Nazis the Heinrich who's the wolf instead of having Reflections in a sunglasses had the SS Solaris said he thought he could just kill it off that's like deplatforming it does going 2D platformer Pepe Paul Bunyan so they said all his first name is Heinrich land wolf and the Sunday to pull up in the glasses of old baby should have any amateur here but I am supposed to what SkyWars does that mean opted as a meme like when you said like feelsbadman like it was like this is so low blood sugar</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what's happening with ARA something happened up there the price The Purge nothing tour first taking out the grid the best books no more serious this is my response to people on the far right and I'm using that term accurately it is a great book by Arthur Herman call the idea of decline in Western history and he talks about every 20 years it's a different group on the left on the right in there like the world's going to end and he brings the receipts and it never ends up happening cuz people are smart some and we have a huge asymmetry in wanted the idea that the last of my apocalypse Wattpad The Black Plague I would say would be the last apocalypse we were doing so good so far the evidence of the black you don't die from it anymore oh you can definitely die from it but they died in 2020s I thought it's still a maybe other people died this year from the Black Plague that ate the liver kidney yeah yeah these people hated they didn't want of dying from a plate was the point had a point about end of world are we worried about the plant lips yeah you know that idea that people have always worried about the end of the world and it never happens sure that's like saying I've always worried about dying but I never have I'm not going to die I'm not going to die I'm only going to be there but I'm not going to be there how do you know but I mean that's a diamonds are you you not going to be there we are. I know you're not going to die right. So don't even worry about it cuz one of those over you won't be here so who cares I would say for so who cares but I mean if your entire life is focusing on avoiding death has a very bad myself yeah that's for sure would you describe the overwhelming evidence of something pretty severe happened to the human race run 12800 years ago most likely common impact or something along those lines other other people think that was actually a solar mass coronal ejection that made lightning storms like rain storm. Lightning was coming down like rain all over the world and just kill everything and this thing Could Happen easily at any time not easily oh yeah common impact or asteroid impact easily easily or not easily because it would happen easily turn the likelihood he would have happened by now know there's a lot of evidence has happened it's just we're dealing with a small timeline the ideas could could you get lucky and it won't happen in the next 60 years or so while you're alive. I could have an orchid it tomorrow that could happen to okay I'll take that back it's good that that mean it's good to look your perspective is good good to not we're dealing with a small timeline the ideas could could you get lucky and it won't happen in the next 60 years or so while you're alive yet I could have an orchid it tomorrow that could happen to okay I'll take that back it's a good bet that mean it's good to look your perspective is good good to not worry so to not look at it like a power</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> excited talk to you I'm super excited talk to you about several subjects but this one thank you very much for this first edition copy of your area 51 an uncensored history of America's top secret military base book I'm super excited about this do you think there's any alien stuff out there running spy plane programs right so interesting Lee my new book is about ground Branch guys on the ground that's about are Branch what we were doing and it was this idea that we should spy on the anime OK and but if you go back in time why Area 51 really started you learned that it was a base hidden inside of a base nuclear weapons and it was all about beating Stalin at his black propaganda campaign so I write the book to hopes Americans in the War of the Worlds types and where buy little men who look like aliens would get out of an aircraft and the government would go crazy about it and then stalling would say look we have not only do we have technology but better than you but we have a better propaganda Department than you rude that Joe you got to read the whole book 50d just hired short people I really do all right I'm going to make you save that imma make you earn that I'm sweating of area 50 phenomenal in its own way because it speaks so much to power to morality to information to you know people's desire to know what's going on and me and the government's desire to keep things hidden so this topic is always coming up because a lot of people want to believe that there were aliens in that craft and my source who I write about in the book told me otherwise that they were Jeanette you know that they will be stopping over there cuz when you save that crap what you mean is the supposed UFO wreckage of crashed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 that's what you mean right but that was never supposed to be taken to Area 51 or supposed to be taken to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base the legend has it that Truman flew there to meet them and receiving that crafts at Area 51 in 1951 which is why the base is called Area 51 and that inside the craft were humans who had been altered surgically altered to look like aliens in a plan for Stalin to sort of twist Truman's arm because at that time we had the atomic bomb when Roswell have the atomic bomb and the Soviets did not when you say humans that were surgically altered to look like aliens does D mean so this is 1951 so you're talkin about four years after the supposed crash so what but it did really impact a lot of my a lot of my thinking and working on on you know government secrecy project because it makes you really consider what a hoax meet and what it means to a population of people and how the government begins to work with disinformation versus cover stories and all of that but going back to answer your question that is what I was told by the source that reliable this is a very incendiary idea to rely upon one individual's recollection of it which is why the book went through the roof and terms of people being upset about it I mean oh my God I spy Pilots Engineers I mean it's right there's also there's accounts that it was some sort of a test vehicle and that there were actually just dummies inside their Crash Test Dummies that they used there's been a bunch of different versions of it but the most compelling version of the area 51 alien meth to me is Bob Lazar did you get into that when do people it was it was common folklore but there was no definitive proof that there was something going on over there other than some weird VHS footage of things flying around the desert that seem to be behaving in a way that modern aircrafts are not totally capable of at least modern piloted aircraft and I totally capable of which brings me to another kind of Technology we have at whole department for that reason called DARPA which looks at weapon systems 25 years out so the idea that you and I don't know what the military is capable of in the air under water wherever it may be is because we're not thinking 25 years out and they are and they're developing Weapons Systems the great weapon systems of the future that's what they call them systems 25 years out so the idea that you and I don't know what the military is capable of in the air under water wherever it may be is because we're not thinking 25 years out and they are and they're developing Weapons Systems the great weapon systems of the future that's what they call them</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> see I don't have a desired outcome I mean I would love it if aliens were real but when someone starts talkin about disinformation and propaganda campaigns but they want you to believe them right but don't listen I'm here telling you the truth I'm here telling you the truth already they would aliens you think well of I mean maybe you are neutral I don't know I know I'm neutral I mean after the book published I would go and visit him wait in the Chinese restaurant and eat and talk and I would try to get a droplet of information out of him it was him okay and I went out to Las Vegas and sat there in a room with the source and his wife and she said tell me this isn't true tell me you made this all up to her husband and he said it's the truth that's a triangular version of getting at the truth but again reiterate I believe he believes what he told me was the truth that was the truth he was told especially when they're talking about secret information that they were sworn to protect and then all the sudden they want to talk to someone that they don't even know on the sneak tip let's meet at a diner I'm going to tell you everything was interviewing nuclear weapons Engineers who were setting off nuclear bombs in Area 51 in the Nevada Test Site Area you've got to talk to the top engineer of all this weapon rate give me his name and we talked for days now is about nuclear weapons and then in one conversation he began to cry and told me this story that I was like what was grown in our version of the human experiments because what the Russians do we do it look Everett a small program in 1951 where we wanted to see how the Russians did what they did how they made human beings look like this with my mind so he's altered handicapped children when you say handicapped me like down syndrome or something like that and they made them look like aliens and then killed them like what how did they what do they do with this is when we get into drops of information with me but what I can say is he had a grandchild that was born that way and and the grandchild did not live long the grandchild died and it made him feel so guilty about what he had done that he felt to come to confess if you will and I remember thinking why are you telling me this why don't you tell a priest and he said a priest would judge me and I can tell you won't well I guess that's why I'm a born journalist joke really try not to judge people I mean my new book surprise kill vanish it's about assassins it's about people who work for the CIA who do what needs to be done on the ground in the name of national parody I don't judge them this is why you know what's really at issue here is morality right I mean can I tell you how I got the idea for this book with alien spacecraft you probably saw something that the government had an extension of the program and he didn't know I was speculative we didn't talk about that I mean you know other than inference he was very limited in his in the information that he would get out but I mean I used 79 sources in that book that all went on the record in name and he was the one anonymous source because but like I said you know he told me after he died that I could tell the whole story I might come back if you give me a break and back off the subject I might come back and tell you and your audience his name's your book but it's it's like it's an astonishing story and I think the best line of all is that people that read about that in the very end of what we did they go I wish they were aliens Stalin created some sort of a craft that mimics something that looked like it would be for another planet there was a Mothership in a drone with attached to it was jettisoned off okay so in those days well in 1947-48 right then like aircraft and then the Drone is like a small aircraft under it and it gets jettisoned off and that was what the crap was it was jettisons off so that the stolen actually according to the source invaded our which was the Deep embarrassment to Truman so we invaded our airspace and then let this drone crash land on the ground with these things that turned out to be human they look like aliens but it turned out to be humans that were manipulated surgically look like out you want the Russians to be able to get there you know I mean was interesting is that area 51 weed then went out and mimicked all of those one of our early drones was a mimicry of that it was the deed there was a M21 which was the mothership in a D21 which was the daughter ship so at Area 51 with their air branch you know the technology they're always ahead of technology that you are, or what Bob Lazar did film that was really shocking was the film the filming of these drones flying around and Performing these really you've seen those videos of Shoreline in the 80s science involves in a bit by bit and then there's these great breakthrough is because what the government is always looking for is called a revolution in military Affairs and that's really what drone technology did later on as drones became developed after the Vietnam War so in the 1980s when Bob was always filming all the stuff you think this was similar to the technology that we see publicly described today in terms of like what drones are capable of I mean something like that but they're all in a win when the F-117 was revealed during the first Gulf War that aircraft was being developed for 20-25 years out at Area 51 actually had Area 52 was where they had it set up to develop that stealth technology I think about and what was amazing talked about keeping secrets they had something like 10,000 people working on that no one knew about it that story was never broken by the Press not by anyone it just suddenly appeared in the Gulf War and took out Saddam Hussein's you know facilities that's a revolution in military Affairs what becomes interesting is then it becomes obsolete because now everybody knows about and everybody's going to mimic that and now you have to have a new weapon system and that's the military industrial complex so was this drone aircraft that was released from the mothership was his capable autonomous flight or was it just they just threw it out there and let it crash at the ladder and remember that information I am very limited too that's why it's wrong patients if you know the source gave me these little bits of information which I felt I felt was important to include because it speaks to the big issue why is Area 51 classified now it's not President Obama was the first president to actually say Area 51 publicly some people say it because of Maybach right meaning it without the secret was out but before that I went through 10,000 pages of documents from the National Archives and every place you see the word Area 51 was actually redacted right why would you keep that so secret I mean all the guys that I was interviewing say they could call it you know Groom Lake they could call it the test facility they could call it Paradise Ranch but they couldn't say Area 51 Y and the source said will because we did this horrible program out there on the government doesn't want anyone to know about that however I mean their stories of like somebody asking Bill Clinton you know about Area 51 him going white I mean human experiments who wants to be part of those horrible experiments were limited to this mimicry of the Russian experiments where they're trying to get people to look like aliens or there's something else going on how many different human experiments were going on around nuclear weapons okay horrible experiments where they were subjecting people to radiation because they wanted to know they felt was more important to know what happens to people then to not know and so they would take groups of people that they had cancer or something and test them so there's no doubt that the government has experimented on humans it's just is that something that is wise to make public and you know they two sides of the coin on that I mean you you when you reveal these kind of things me right about them I mean people get really upset and you know vilify the government partially with good reason and partially it's like bad for National Security so I think that's the justification on the part of the defense department to keep things secret maybe where I'll do it hey man you got problems aliens are coming and there was if people it's hard for people that live in 2019 especially if you're young to really imagine a world. Only without the internet but with two television channels right and radio which was where people got all the information from me one or two channels how many channels were they in 1947 maybe three mostly radio and newspapers and that's where people getting their information and there was a mass hysteria where people were absolutely terrified that we're going to be invaded which is why when Orson Welles war of Worlds which when they released it when they did it on the air they were very clear that this is going to be a reading of Orson Welles War worlds book or that I itchy welts using War walking Orson Welles Reddit when they were talking about this on the radio a lot of people missed that part right and so as the radio went on as the broadcast went on a people artounian later in the day it erupted in Mass hysteria people are freaking out hundreds of thousands of people really did think that it was and it was also something that was recreated in other countries I don't know if you know that they did that another countries in different languages when they saw how cute it worked in America and so you see a lot of time at first it sounds absurd and then and that's why I was sweating because it's like when you think it through and I challenge you to read the whole book because you start piecing together these various ideas and this information becomes less vague and more specific and that's how it works and you begin to see people's perception and how they are easily manipulated factors into National Security just like you just ask Stalin knew about that he was a master he was the master of propaganda he invented it I mean he didn't invent it but he invented it in a you know on the political stage to be used to mess with another country's perception of things think of what he did with brainwashing right okay so like in the fifties and this is journalist Tina said so there was a journalist who was putting out stories about brainwashing and there was this idea which is well taken that to town Korean government's brainwash people this became a big codeword it was introduced into the American lexicon in 1950 will then we're in the Korean War our pilot start getting shot down there put on TV by the communist saying terrible things about America that American pilots and suddenly was like they've been brainwashed it was very convenient to have that story so these things were part and parcel and you've got all kinds of smart people behind the scenes knowing this look examining it and using it to their advantage to stay where in the pole position that's the goal of the US government so the propaganda we did that sort of copied stall and we're kind of playing catch-up in that sense I mean we're playing catch-up then we're behind the ground was a bunch of people that you cut up to look like aliens did he say specifically what kind of modification they made people that made them look like aliens everything and I would try to squeeze out just like you're trying to squeeze out of me and not something read it because I literally tell you everything that there is I think what's most interesting about the source and why I might come back and talk to you about it and tell you who he is on your show is because because of his backstory right why he did what he did how he wound up in the Manhattan Project</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what if any research have you done on artificial intelligence and Robotics and autonomous weapons and the the future of warfare with a lot of people think it's going to be like what we're seeing now in Yemen with drones that we're going to be seeing that with robots on the ground and that this will be the future for the book called The pentagon's Brain really impactful moment was going to Los Alamos when I went there too DARPA scientist who was working on an artificial brain for DARPA I mean this stuff is way trying to create a system you know a free-thinking system and what his name is Garrett Canyon what he told me was just utterly fascinating cuz again that human thing I'm always offers like what are you doing the science you had lots of guys on here I'll talk to you about the high-technology limits but I'm interested in who is doing that who's creating at science and he said to me this is like like we're artificial intelligence is right now with Scientists were really looking into this it's like Magellan you know like will discover the new world but on the on the idea of frightening artificial intelligence he told me an interesting story about his daughter and he said people seem to think like you do facial recognition software is like telling us that were one step away from AI true AI and he said if he was he showed me on his iPhone this is a couple years ago and how much trouble the iPhone had recognizing him like if he put a hat on or if he made a funny face and he said my daughter can recognize me from across a baseball field you know if I have a hat on just by the way I walk right and he said if she if she couldn't there would be something really wrong with her and other words her human recognition abilities are truly intelligent and that is a system of systems of biological system of systems that no scientist has you know the algorithm for which no one has ever been able to figure out yet and he believes that were far away from that but the defense department on the other hand is moving Us in that direction and absolutely wants autonomous weapons to be fighting worth look there was a program that said I put this in the book it says the battle place is no place for humans so drones are the way of the future used to kill people and which also means that the enemy is creating drones that horse and pretty soon that's going to be a big a big issue troma Machines of course they do and they probably can't I mean they've already got cursors that people can move around their paraplegic they can move them around with her mind and their eyes yeah I think there's going to be quite a few of those things what is rhodium a distance is called the synapse this is machine technology that scales to biological levels or simply stated is that build a new kind of computer with similar Form and Function to the mammalian brain such artificial brain to be used to build robots whose intelligence matches that of mice and cats Jesus Christ robot cats robot cats coming to get us they created something called the roborock that was the first biohybrid right so biohybrid is when you mix a animal and a machine and. was doing that right before 9/11 and people freaked out they were like you cannot put brain chips and rats and make them move through a maze by in a remote control which is what they were doing and I interviewed the guys who are all working on this program before 9/11 and so the the the morality of the citizenry was like no then 9/11 happened and suddenly all this got pumped into DARPA to do anything they wanted the morality of she went out the window and they started creating all kinds of Bio hybrids as I write in the pentagon's brain so they put think they now have pigeons that are mixed you know animal and machine they created something called there's a moth so there's a Medicus X tomorrow that's what it's called a large moth and DARPA scientists put brain chips into the law okay so that when it cocooned and became a flying moth it had that the chip built into its system making it easier to integrate and they could fly the moth around the lap and that was a huge step in this is now four years ago that I was interviewing a scientist was a trip and this is all what we going on there while they were just cutting limbs off of salamanders and watching the limbs grow back right and examining that and saying will if it salamander can do this so can we one day and I said to the boy that's impossible you know and I said well it's not actually because humans have they broke I love scientist who break it down into terms I can understand it's like what Elon Musk didn't know you were once a single in your mother's womb and then you were too and then you were in it right so you can regenerate and that's their premise mean either the Topps not the world's top scientists and regeneration what is being stimulated by Electric so the stimulation of the electro currents they can cause it to go left or right Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone did he was reading something he went that time I start typing mile hybrid stuff in this is the first thing that popped up was this article Olympic themed events for the development of micro to milli insect scale robotic technology shrimp where develop will develop okay so shrimp is the will develop and demonstrate through a series of Olympic themed events multifunctional m m to CM scale robotic platforms so I guess that's millimeter to centimeter scale robotic platforms with a focus on untethered Mobility maneuverability and dexterity to achieve this goal shrimp will also provide foundational research in the area of micro actual actuator materials and energy energy efficient power system for extremely swap capital letter s copper level W lowercase a capital P constrained microbiotic systems expected such advances will be enabling for applications including search and rescue in disaster relief help people killing motherfukers with a evil nuclear B that goes in your mouth and blows up f*** that's crazy and you need to all kinds of planning for the future sort of be no way in which to present DARPA as doing all this great stuff I interviewed DARPA scientist who said look and he was able to send robots into Fukushima to twist the core far from the only thing he needs your trip you want to hear I mean it gets there are rabbit holes there because I sourced all these documents and also interview generals at the Pentagon her like we don't like AI we want like we want this we want our guys on the ground you know we they believe in the human the warrior that concept and so that the generals were very opposed with the the DARPA took a vote and I was like no AI I want humans in the next and so what did DARPA start doing and they all the generals they said why don't you why can't we go more autonomous and the answer was we don't trust the machines okay so right around that same time what a DARPA start doing it started looking into and hiring scientist who were working with how trust works in the brain specifically with what is called the moral molecule and it's this molecule in the brain that cement when they're breastfeeding okay oxytocin yes so think about that and I mean that's like the ultimate going way back biology like you have to have a mother a trusting mother to breastfeed in you know prehistory or otherwise you'd be eaten by a TV like this is a bad idea I'm stopping to do this I'm going to die right so they examined that molecule the brains more a molecule and they began a program to work with that be able to give that to soldiers so that their that they trusted AI machines and that's where I think you're getting into really spooky dark multi levels of manipulation about what humans want versus what the panda, the worry about trusting the machine scares the s*** out of me because that's what everyone's worried about when it comes to AI Elon Musk keeps warning people about these things are going to have super human capabilities and they're going to be sentient and it's a matter of when wait a minute if the generals at the Pentagon and yeah that's at the euphemism meaning that the actual operation of the guys that are in charge here don't want that who does want this and where my research took me to was the group that wants that is what's called the defense science board and those are the individuals who are counseling the Pentagon in the mail which they should proceed and now those individuals are all sitting on the boards of the defense contractors so you can really see how money drives the rubric the generals don't want it the humans don't want it but guess who does the people who stand to make the money creating autonomous systems and that's exactly what Eisenhower warned us of his farewell speech and of the military-industrial complex and the other part of that which which people don't don't know as well is that what he said his antidote Eisenhower said that the antidote to the military industrial complex is an alert and knowledgeable citizenry it's why I write my books because an alert and knowledgeable citizenry has the ability to kind of push back and go but we don't want that or think we're worried about is Pandora's Box and we're worried that first of all open at 9 obviously their Technologies super super advanced mean their electronic technology particular their cell phones are cutting in between Apple and all these other companies are struggling to try to keep up with Huawei in these one FC one big company that they just release some Dave just hired Robert Downey jr. to the gave him millions of dollars to 111 + 7 they have this new phone that doesn't have a front facing camera problem letting it slide out of the top to figure out a way to make it the entire phone all screen they're incredibly advanced in terms of electronics we we deeply are concerned that they're going to be the ones that Implement military autonomous sentient robotics before we do cuz then you can essentially you can launch them with no physical human cost on your side and I mean they they they're literally weapons of mass destruction if you have robots can go over there and just kill people and and what they need for that is the world's fastest supercomputer right and what's interesting is that we just we America just overtook the Chinese in having again having the world's fastest supercomputer but they had it for a couple years and think about that okay cuz you were saying hard to believe the Nazis were only you know not even like Justin Justin our grandfather's age right so go back in time so then listen to this about this really freaked me out in terms of progress right after the war guy called John Von Neumann got a grant from the atomic energy commission to essentially build the world's first computer I mean they existed but he built the first computer that could actually do calculations okay before that calculations were done with like by calculators computers were humans but there's this amazing story of Von Neumann in the basement of the Princeton Institute for advanced study weary built this computer with government funds and he cuz he was a brilliant polymath he could add faster than anyone around him okay he's also the guy who calculated at what level the atomic bomb should explode over Hiroshima for the most blast okay cuz it didn't hit the ground it wouldn't kill as many people's print so this is how his mind works so he's a faster than the computer he has a pen and paper in front of him and he can outperform the world's fastest computer with his own brain 2 and 1/2 years wouldn't like 1949 the computer beats him and he made a statement then it said one day artificially intelligent machines will be the ruin of man I'm going to paraphrasing the propagators where they were the ones who we're going to make that baby and then we're going to die most likely both going to be the new living things Marshall mcluhan Letitia Wright which is if man has always been a warring animal right why do we look so down upon the throat you know the knife to the throat and why do we as a society accept drone strikes cuz that's the whole question I asked and surprise kill vanish and I'm not sure I answered it to my own satisfaction because it's such a comp the question one of them is very personal the other one is like a video game you know what it to stab someone to look them in the eye and and shove a knife to the ribs that's six different kind of person we don't think we want that person around us one of them is throwing a rock at someone that's nowhere near you the other one is beating a guy to death when he's right in front of you it's very personal we see someone struggling and we don't like to think that someone can put that aside and still twist that blade we don't want that we don't want that on our side we don't want our people to be Noble and Justin but meanwhile when it comes to civilian casualties drones are one of the worst invention ever in human history if we really want to examine ourselves in terms of advocacy and the moral High Ground Rules of Engagement launching missiles at apartment building cuz you found metadata in there that indicates that most likely an Al-Qaeda operative has a cell phone in that building like that that's some s*** that people have done me that has been done and the casualty rate for civilians when it comes to drone strikes for innocent civilians is stunning I think it's in the high 80% I think that's we've done it write a between I think it's some it's it's a disturbing I might be conservative by saying it's in the 80s it might be in the nineties it's a disturbingly high number of people who died who were not the intended target which would which would be an argument might die where you're driving is that what that's what this says that's Horsham who released that maybe 3% accuracy but no I know there was there's been some serious questions among Scholars about this that's not true whatever you read that can't be right now it's one operation huge CIA using either ground operators or drones defense department I read the statistic the other day 7200 and change bombs dropped on Afghanistan last year when people don't even realize we're still other attacks on terrorist targets outside of War s*** information now but pull up 2017 for the government he's he looks at all the statistics and by the way this Administration just cancelled his job so we will no longer have that information but he's the one that is in charge of reporting that cuz it's called the Reconstruction effort right but that number of bombs really makes you think long at least me about you know the big footprint versus the small operation and I can't I think this is why most people don't want to talk about this cuz it's a dark Rabbit Hole to go down you know people prefer to believe that we're just safe and sound here and not not at risk and then mean that's that's the endless question of our are these are these threats real and must they be dealt with most people don't want to talk about this cuz it's a dark Rabbit Hole to go down you know people prefer to believe that we're just safe and sound here and not not at risk and I mean that's that's the endless question of our are these are these threats real and must they be dealt with</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you are done with the paperclip book and you know you've published and you have to live with all the information that you had to gather and and run through your mind did that book was that the book did that change you that book like was it the most altering of this different subjects that you covered each book has a huge impact for different reasons but when I think of paperclip I think of this one saying that was over the gates at buchenwald it's at the bottom designer and what that means is everyone gets what they deserve and that was horrible and I still think about that because it's such a piece of Nazi propaganda is like saying to the Jews you guys deserve this and so I know much of my reporting and my general just way of being as a human is there is no such thing as what you deserve right there is what there is what happens there's what you do there's what you're responsible for and there's what you can change but there's that ideas reprehensible for some reason that really stuck with me as the as just the worst possible thing that I could think of it because it's the psychology behind why they did what they did back then but 1945 is not that long ago it's just not people just read and read and read about World War for good reason and everything I write starts it all goes back to the Nazis and every book The Trail the paper trail to National Archives or individual University libraries in people's papers where I go they all refer back to that because it was so remarkable that the Nazis lead and weapons technology and they almost took over the world because of it right and that is the premise of all of it I mean in Surprise kill vanish it's like these are the guys on the ground in the pentagon's brain it's this is the technology in the sky but we must we the government's position whether it's Pentagon CIA is always we have to stay ahead because the next Nazi Germany right around the corner and that's it that's really something to think about is that alarmist history repeats itself if we went and stopped and looked at all the instances throughout history of people being evil dictators there's quite a few and there's North Korea right now I mean that straight up messaging right which is another thing I think is interesting about the CIA paramilitary program it's all meant to remain plausibly deniable it's supposed to be secret like we're not supposed to be giving out the message that we have these teams you know that go after high value targets they're just supposed to disappear left the vanished part of the so that as someone who is really interested in transparency and people being educated and having information that always puts me in conflict with you know the government in a sense because I'm I'm like we should know but then you think about it while the whole thing is you are not supposed to know because it's supposed to be just The Hidden Hand the president Hidden Hand they call are often the failures because those are the ones that get reported in the Press there is a sense undergirding this narrative which I really liked and I'm interested in and intrigued by is that the the successful operations you don't hear about because they are plausibly tonight and your kids will think about protecting us something like another Nazi Germany that's when people are willing to give up some of their freedoms they're willing to give up surveillance or willing to give up on nessus with this were things get real slippery right I mean also when you think about Russia because all of this cold war science technology operations all of that was to beat back the Russians okay then the Russians go away now they're back you know the Russians are the master assassins and they do it through poisoning look at the group alright alright in the book about a Defector who came over in the fifties and said I was an assassin for the KGB and gave us all kinds of information it's fast and this is how it worked is how it worked you know 60 years ago and then you kind of see Echoes of that of Howard that is how it's working today and you can only imagine the defectors or those who come over from the other side who we learn from and they just disappear into em and they disappear as one of the cia's version of Witness Protection</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I mean I wrote a book about Operation Paperclip and my God talk about a rabbit's hole you know I don't know what we're talkin about Operation Paperclip was when after World War II the United States gathered up a ton of scientist from Nazi Germany brought them over to America and even Wernher von Braun they had Wernher von Braun run NASA he was a Nazi like 100% Nazi Granite Berlin rocket Factory where they hung the five slowest Jews they would hang them out front so everybody would know like this is what happens when you work slow will hang you mean the Simon wiesenthal Center said that if one of them was alive today they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity and I was ahead of naphtha we were willing to put a lot of really dark things hide in order to gather out the best scientist of the Soviet Union couldn't get them all and they got a few of them as well but we got how many more than a thousand right but I would not be surprised if you know the story changes and they were more right it's me I'm a nice person. I love juice you know that we got the good Germans will know we didn't we got the we got the top Germans and who do you think the top Germans were they were coveted by Hitler Himmler Goering you know I mean these guys were in there were guys that we grabbed out of the docks at Nuremberg literally to come be part of our program you know Warlords from the other side and capture I'm going to listen to come over here bro ideology aside I'm super smart and I want that to be now that's good that's that's a competitor right I mean you can't you cannot be the best rocket designer in the world and not want those talents you know demonstrated that's worn around Brown story that's the story of all of them shocking writing that book because it's like wow you know huge amount of talent but how far will the competitor go to see their baby come to fruition what were they willing to put aside did you pay any attention to the other places were Nazis went when they escaped Germany like Argentina in particular German towns down in Argentina are they wear Lederhosen they they drink out of Steins it's crazy they speak German and you'll like what the f*** is this like my friend Tim Kennedy went down there and he said he was literally talking to people interviewing people and they had photos of ss soldiers on their wall and they would talk about how grandfather was a hero in life like you are you are the descendants of escaped Nazis and they put together a town down there I mean the wave and these were able to flee is X I can't read enough of that I mean oh my God I mean they're so you know the ones that we there was a famous guy that we got he was the Surgeon General of the Third Reich I mean think about that okay dr. Walter driver I mean he was such a bad dude he was in charge of the vaccine program I mean you just put those words together and your mind goes really dark right but we wanted him because he was an expert in vaccines and we brought him to the United States he was the only Nazi I found of the ones the paperclip sign to his sister came here that it was actually out it right he was outed as a Nazi and that's because one of the investigators at the Nuremberg trials recognized him and he's the only one we we got out of here and guess where we went tell the rest of his life there the show was called finding Hitler there they were trying to find evidence of Hitler somehow escaped is really a b******* promised the show but what was interesting is that there were thousands and thousands of Nazis that made it to Argentina and set up shop South America kind of weird because and people like is Hitler really dead you know it's f****** pretty rare yeah so Operation Paperclip was not even publicly acknowledged until what was like the 90s like when did they when did it become public nothing was for the Freedom of Information Act and she had it really hard because she did a Freedom of Information Act request got all these documents that no one had ever seen and then the government sent her a bill for $125,000 and she had to spend a lot of time this is what this what I understand I never interviewed her but xeroxing face we had to give it to you but now here's your bill imagine if the government's coming down on you 425 Grand and because of he was a wall trainer and trained orcas and then he's showing it wasn't blacklist at SeaWorld SeaWorld is actually the way he says it's a day in the park compared to Marineland real answer or riffic place in Canada and anyway they have been trying to squash and with legal Beats by dragging out his legal fees by dragging his case but we set up GoFundMe and all his legal bills get paid for from people that want him to win the good fight this is a this is an option today that wasn't available to Linda when she was exposing this $25,000 do you assholes like she should sue them for misappropriation of funds like it does it cost you really a hundred $25,000 a print those things out of it does you guys should be in jail like that's like with like those $10,000 Hammers If they have in the Pentagon so she gets all this information does the government immediately acknowledge that the important she wrote the first book and it was just stunning and and you know it was this late 80s early 90s and you know Ben Moore gets revealed because they gave her a certain amount I mean I filed a bunch of boys there was releases I went to Germany for your moon PhD who had you no real access to stop and was able to translate for me while we were there looking at the stuff I interviewed a lot of grandchildren of Nazis and children of Nazis and you know I mean this one extraordinary oh my God there's a guy I told you about Shriver right I'm on the narrative level humans acting I'm so interested in rivalry in competition right as a concept because this is what America does be the best and also as humans right because people are like that they're built like that so that the Nazis had Rivals amongst themselves and schreiber's rival was dr. Blum who is in charge of the biological weapons program for Hitler okay and Mom had a son and run was prosecuted at Nuremberg you can see a picture of him with a big dueling scar you know he was a bad dude. among the Nazis they would they would do with one another when they were younger students and then they would pack the wound with horsehair to make it even more pronounced because it looked ferocious babies who was the director of our JFK Center he was part he was gnosis Von Brown's number two he had a huge dueling Scar and yet when you look at their is right there knowing what we know now it's like come on that you're trying to tell me that guy is not a hardcore Nazi so those girls are dueling scars on their face to get poked in the ass I guess that was the gentleman's rule for how do you fart loosen you going for the cheeky hit the I like that happens all the time when I must have got a lot of eyeballs out I haven't seen any photographs of missing eyeballs but there's a lot right on the cheek so maybe that was the whole point was actually just a bit for show I wanted to have the scars that was so what they were ones with tips wow wow doing cops Cults that is a crazy when you consider like the people people did not know about that and then you got these Germans walking around America as part of our space program in our Science Program since these are the good Germans I mean now you really have to save yourself, and God my super OG yeah it's crazy how can I go to interview. Sometimes you as a journalist you can get an amazing information from oh my God weapons to piece together the story the right I can't tell you others can write some time to find out more about the Nazis I went to Germany and sought out some children of these top top Nazis to see if maybe they didn't have journals or anything they might share with me and one of them was dr. Blum his son I track down I found him and he said yes you may come visit it was such a remarkable Journey was like he lived in the Black Forest I take like a taxi through the mountains up over the hill down through the valley you know into a courtyard behind a church to doctor blum's house so he's a junior to his father who was this horrific Nazi I mean a top Nazi had favor of the fear or what was called the Golden party badge right Hitler gave out these little buttons plums was I believe number 6 so that's how favorite he was and his son dr. Kurt blome where's the father was in charge of the biological weapons program so his plan was to you know murder people with biological weapons from nature right the sun had been a medical doctor but had left profession to cure people with flowers go Bach flower therapy so he was very interesting individual who would never given an interview before and he agreed to let me come I'm so I go on that journey I go to his house and he was remarkable I mean he was so interesting talk about the sins of the father you know I mean my God what he what he had what he had as a burden right and he and I asked him to tell me everything you could about his father and he did and then he asked me to tell me what I knew about his father I had information from the German archives about his father that he did not have looked like that his father had given something I just come from this are found these documents dr. Blum ordered that 6000 tubercular Jews be given Sundar be handling that's the German word what does that mean special treatment there's a euphemism for you I was kill those 6,000 tubercular juice and he worked closely with him and they just decided to kill talking to this man tell him about his father at his request was remarkable and then he's telling me what he knows and then as I'm getting ready to leave he says to me I'd like you to have these and he takes down from his incredible bookshelf he himself had written a books right and it takes on his books and he hands them to me and they're in these rappers and I can see that they have Nuremberg nomenclature on them and what they are there is father's documents from his Nuremberg Trial any and I'm like I can't take the time I thought you meant take them back to my hotel room look at them and then going to bring them back the next morning when we're doing the next interview he said no no I want you to have them and I was like I can't have them any said I don't want them and you should have them and it gave them to me so I had to stack my trip home it was so perplexing because I threw all of my clothes I was like screw the clothes I mean I just carry I've travel with a carry-on bag right so I in my carry-on back all I have is this Nazi paraphernalia I'm at the airport and I realized suddenly oh my God swastikas like this is it illegal if they go through my bag I'm going to be arrested I'm caring Eminem carrying these incendiary got home I have the mail but it is in Germany you may not have any Nazi paraphernalia whatsoever and back my paperclip book which has a swastika on it had to be redesigned the cover for the German publication and it just has like broken up images of the Nazis because you cannot reproduce that image in Germany I'm not pro swastika but it's so strange that we've given so much power to this design that you can't even see it it used to be there's a there's a Temple out here that I think is I believe it's a Hindu temple and it was a part of Hinduism that the swastika predates World War II it predates the Nazis predates there they're sort of reclaiming of it and that this building that was built out here in the 19th the 1920s cuz I know there's a big black explaining why the swastika is on it but I mean talk about branding right I mean my God that was in the Nazis were you know Kings of that I mean they were all killed think about it that way they don't think about the dueling scars being a Nazi thing no no that's what I find a remarkable Lyndon Johnson Curt Davis sitting at you note for a launch a moon launch and there's Davis with his huge Duluth car and I'm like and their position was oh he's one of the good German culture was ruthlessness mean was even the good ones there is never asked that question before Annie well they will know what when you really stop and think about the horrific nature of what the Nazis did I mean how inhuman it was how how crazy was like that had to permeate the entire culture there is no good Nazis there was not done even one of them it was looped into the had to be responsible for some awful awful s*** I mean Einstein said it the best when he said you know you could have left like people who could have laughed should have left right and he's you know he created a smell built into it so that would warn you you using this pesticide and then the Nazis turned into zyklon-b where they remove that element that added the smell and just as odorless horrific poisonous gas that these the gas the Jews and he was a Jew Radiolab podcast I think it's called the bad show but anyway what essentially says is that he was winning he was up for the Nobel Prize at the same time he was wanted for crimes against humanity cuz he was up for the Nobel Prize for creating the harbor method of extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere which was used for fertilizer which to this day they say 50% of nitrogen in human bodies with created by the harbor method so what you get from food from vegetables like that nitrogen 50% of is coming from this guy's method who was a scientist who was a Jew who was working in Germany before it became Nazi Germany and then was the guy who figured out how to use gas on people it's a dark making way too far right and that's what's remarkable that the Pentagon was like okay but we can learn from this and there is there are elements that are dark in that also comes out of the devastation of World War 1 write the economic Devastation that defeat the Germans are in this terrible State overall in terms of their morale and then Along Comes This charismatic psychopath that is really good at screaming to this day I don't speak German watch that guy scream and yell at all those people and see them respond to gives you chills like that kind of Charisma that kind of influence it someone has where they can do that in front of thousands and thousands of people and everyone's goose-stepping and so rude to seat and we are very fortunate there's not something like that right now in our forefathers and our grandparents and whoever fought in World War II if it wasn't for them who knows where this world would be right now because that was a literal evil empire China Star Wars man that was like the Sith Lord they ain't they were they really were they were human beings who were doing some of the most evil s*** that you almost demonic if you really stopped and thought about it if there was demons pretending to be people who do the same thing I mean that's why I think it's a rabbit hole because it's so hard to comprehend that a culture of educated individuals moment in time that you talk about between World War World War 1 and World War II could could completely become malevolent there were so many of these people that they did extractor Operation Paperclip brilliant engineers and scientists that were also evil I'd like those two things are very uncomfortable for us we like to think of our scientists as being the people that are out there trying to solve the mysteries of rivers and provide us with the technology to make our life better here on Earth not the Nazis they were trying to figure out how to kill people better they were trying to figure out how to use Rockets to shoot them at Europe and blow people up and it is up it's one of the more telling and horrific times in our history when you cuz it's it's one of the one of the more horrific ones that we have footage of cuz we don't have footage of Genghis Khan we don't have footage of Alexander the Great we don't we have stories and Tales of Napoleon and some photographs and drawings of dictators past and present that we have a lot of footage from Vietnam we have a lot of footage from World War II we have a lot of footage from Modern Wars and out of all of them the one that scares us the most thought about what they had done or they were able to convince themselves that they were the good Germans that they were part of it cuz I never saw a single bit of remorse ever like no one ever acknowledged what they had done so it made me wonder the ones who've been caught who been prosecuted and has been chased down and if they've got one fairly recently the caught a Nazi like just a few months ago so I'm the last ones he's in his nineties I believe the ones who survived they all tell different stories and some of them say they just was following orders and you know some of them say that they didn't do it they're being name that they all have different stories it's it's you know you write a book about that and or you think about it and you kind of have to go down the rabbit hole and then you have to you have to ask yourself what is this mean or you kind of it's too dark right and then so I asked that question to a couch fit Survivor okay who I wrote about in the book his name is Gerhard murkowski and he the reason he was he survived Auschwitz was because he was taking over to the labor camp which was called Buna so it was a rubber Factory and it was led by this truly evil man named Otto Ambrose who became part of Operation Paperclip okay after being tried at Nuremberg and being convicted of mass murder and genocide right we got him out and he work for us it's just astonishing Auto Ambrose chemist oh my God but he was so so Gerhard was at Buna this Factory this Rubber Factory and he lived and I did an interview with him because I was asking him you know what the flip side of of all of that in his whole family was killed at Auschwitz and I said to him what is any of you we went through all these questions to try to get some closure to this or some meaning and I said and then I'll appeal and I said you know we couldn't we couldn't answer what is this mean right I mean for today couldn't answer so when I asked him what matters about all this he went like this he lifted up his sleeve and he showed me his tattoo and he said that matters and I have that image seared in my mind I had never seen a tattoo from Auschwitz before and I have not sent and it also made me think cuz I thought he's going to die soon and he has died since what is gone to all you have is the exchange of information and people talking about the eyewitnesses. How did they get that guy out of Nuremberg how did they get them to release him so there was a bunch of Trials and so I went to the prison I saw his cell I mean in Germany with intent lands were present and then we could we were sort of policing Nazi Germany after it was not at you after the war was over policing Germany and then Kate and a guy named McCoy was in charge was kind of like the governor general of Germany and the Germans wanted Germany back and they were like we're tired of you guys policing us the threat from the Russians was very real and so deals were made I'm going to write about all this in paperclip you know based on the documents and one of the provisions was we want our guys out of prison we want them back in society and that was arranged and again even know these things you know they're like I even gave him his money back that was on the Family bill has this Villa in Switzerland I believe or maybe it's the the Bavarian Alps that have been in the family which is money from you know from Nazi Germany and I I called up the sound to interview him he was not as forthright as dr. Blum son and you know he hung up on me and said if you if you ever contact me again all in a very serious privacy laws in Germany I thought about going and knocking on his front door my lawyer was like Annie do not do that that very Germany privacy yes even if he didn't he shouldn't be responsible for his father did plantations in America and who benefited from that like go several Generations from there you could get weird with with war reparations drawer you know I was operating Operation Paperclip one of the most everyone's for you I mean that was so dark my husband is amazing he's Norwegian right and the north Norway was occupied by the Nazis for five years people kind of forget that but he he grew up there and his mom you know was a grade-schooler and was really impacted like didn't go to school for five years while the Nazis were there they were going to breed with the Norwegians cuz they were such a lovely Aryan people right so my husband having a Norwegian mom was like when I was writing paper clip would be so dark sometimes I would be like down in my office I could can't you do honey I can't you be down there with a sandwich or another nausea under the bus and I would say Yes means they keep typing right and then I realize we'll wait a minute the neutral journalist has to really make sure that she's not just throwing Nazis under the bus without really good reason and so when I was in Germany at The Archives I went to Dachau the concentration I asked the lead archivist if I could come and see the worst possible photographs that no one wants to see and he said absolutely and I didn't write about them in the book because I didn't want to subject people to that kind of horror but I looked at them and I watched I saw with my own eyes people moments before they were killed you know and then the bodies afterwards and he's are in a human experiments to you know to see whether or not Pilots could survive simulated different things and Chambers at high altitude or speed and I saw I saw photographs of you freezing people to death right because they were trying to develop programs where they would they wanted to see at what temperature humans actually died right and so they experimented on to these are the cities are some of the doctors that came on our program and I looked at those that evidence and I was that blew me away and then I knew when I left there okay I can I can throw these 800 bus it's such a crazy time in history will you really stop and think about all the different experiments they did do it's almost like they just opened up the Vault of evil that said listen we have an opportunity these people aren't people to do whatever we want like they're fake people it's like like they were an invention I mean the perception really played into it so gross so scary to think about that you know like they were an invention I mean the perception really played into it so gross so scary to think about that humans just you know generation or two away or capable of doing that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I think of fate and Circumstance are giant the fortune is giant there's no question about it some children get shot in drive-by you know that's just horrible horrible locking unfortunate circumstance. A lot of lot of it is fortunate fate absolutely most people that are talking about being psychic or full of s*** but I do think that there is a strange connection that we have with each other that's intangible and I think that some people have better connections and others just like some people more intelligent like we were talking before the podcast about Elon Musk and it's painfully aware when you talk to him what a champ you are the he's so f****** smart and his brain is it just it's built different just like people of defective Hearts some people have a heart like Lance Armstrong's too credible huge an anomaly some people have giant hands so big heart they don't know whether or not that's from training or steroids and or whether or not something was born with they really don't know but yeah he has an unusually sized hard would usually large but those my point psychics psychics that's why I don't think that most of the people that can tell you the future full of s*** most the people that are I think people get feelings I think sometimes you think about someone they call you and I don't know what that is I don't know what if that's just complete Fortune like how many times you think about a person when they don't call you that's the argument against it but how many times you thinking about that person they don't call you but they're thinking about you as well how many mean how how often is that was star-crossed lovers they find each other years later and they tell each other to been thinking about each other all the time and I can't believe it that's that's the end when you get that text from someone maybe I should someone prone to action but maybe there is some sort of a connection some sort of quantum entanglement between you and somebody spent time with our shared energy with it's possible it's possible the problem is you have these mediums and psychics and those people are just assholes and I have a friend named banachek and he runs a Las Vegas Mentalist show where he shows you how he does will tell you absolutely these are he's been on the podcast brilliant brilliant man that he'll tell you these are tricks I'm showing you how I do this this I mean I'm not going to tell you this to give you the how I do it but I'm going to tell you while I'm doing it this is a trick but he's pulling all this information out of people about their past or childhood he's guessing people's ages he's guessing where they grew up mean it's it's all will sneaky s*** you know it's the way they do it's it's a skill as much as anything and so when you see these people that are Chandler's or you know psychics or telling you about someone in your past trying to contact you get con artist almost exclusively I mean maybe there's like one lady in Tibet that has a broken Jean and she can tune in to the next Dimension and and pull some extract some information from it but in my experience the vast majority of those people that I've talked to that claim to have psych ability will also at least partially full of s*** they had weird ego problems that were glaring that they didn't notice you know like I could see it that this is a gross way to behave and they don't see it their interpersonal relationships the way they communicate with people was like an agent like a fake Hollywood person or something of something bullshiting about them and people who lie a lot I think if you lie a lot it's very difficult for you to tell what a lie is yeah I think you lose your connection I think when you when you bulshit I think you also bulshit yourself and I'll think these psychics are a hundred percent honest even with themselves I don't think that's why I'm going to f*** this lady over stinks got to talk to her husband or some nonsense money I think some of them actually believe they're getting information you know my grandmother used to believe that my grandmother was a very eccentric lady and old Sicilian lady and she would tell you about the like old Italian ladies all I want to play the lottery they all have numbers there and she was playing the numbers wasn't even a lottery was like the organized crime numbers Racket and she would always thought I was going to pick this number and I just add up the last minute I changed the number one you know what the first one came in and she was so mad I'd like it's like you were really psychic you would have better instincts like this is just this inclination that people have to do something special about their perceptions and that their psychic and it's always has really wacky people that believe their psychics in my my experience I mean it's also about what some scientific all the self-fulfilling prophecy you know that if you believe this things happen manifest themselves and you can convince yourself that you believe this but premium super interested in people who really believe in psychics right like that and the military for example and you know the most the most interesting of all was the astronaut Ed Mitchell and he was so so I'm interested in the psychology behind what are you looking for in that I saw that I was doing some research in an archive and I came across a photo of what turned out to be Ed Mitchell on the moon reading a piece of paper okay it's just extraordinary image cuz you're like wait a minute he's on the moon and he's reading a document what is that document I found out the document was a map of the Moon okay Mitchell got lost on the moon and literally pulled map out it's like okay. I'm you trying to get to a certain crater and they had a very limited amount libraries are there okay there is well I mean the most advanced technology of the time and then who's who's been here come on man city maps folded up in their in their pockets in case they got lost there on the way to the crater and in that crater they were going to find allegedly rock that we're going to solve the mystery of the moon's creation the origin story they couldn't find it the heart rates up the guy that used to like you got to turn back your heart rate's going crazy 240,000 miles to only to get lost they missed the crater by like you know 900 feet or something what he told me was a psychic change right he his his Consciousness left and he became convinced that psychic powers were real and that is really the beginning of his Forum in Mitchell I'm a huge proponent of psychic Warfare of you know the the the idea behind what you're talkin about that we spoke of his being sort of charlatanism he told me the story of when they were in quarantine after they came back from the Moon right he and Sheppard were sitting there eating breakfast waiting and Shepherd the story a story broke that Mitchell had done some ESP experiments on the way back from the Moon and Shepherd said to him like look at this nonsense the newspapers will do anything to make a buck and Mitchell said I I did that I actually did that and what experiments he had a psychic in Chicago a Swedish psychic that he was sending messages to like he was an old Swedish man reminder older anyway sorry so Ed Mitchell was talking to this hot chick in old man in the story broke because the Swedish like it could not resist telling you know leaking to the press that he had on these experiments train on these little cards called zener cards right to like you have a different symbols on them and you know one one person that's how they decide whether or not they're being so like there'd be a Avail between us and I would say what are you seeing right and you would call it out cuz like a control system and Mitchell had these items with him on the way to the moon and did these experiments to try to see whether you could have a psychic connection with someone back on Earth I mean that was you know would like water stains on it that actually went to the moon I was like wow this is really something else I mean it was one of those moments in time where you're just like I don't know there was a feel there was a feeling of sadness around all of it with Ed Mitchell sitting there in his some you know his chair and talking to me about what it was like to be an Apollo astronaut on the walls I'm up with a lot of these purses with like incredible amounts of awards on the walls but what does that mean after time passes right his experiments didn't work but he still believed inside your power him up in the people who gave him a lot of encouragement had sort of more radical ideas as he grew older and I think they theorist who really kind of used him because he was an Apollo astronaut so he was so much more famous than any of them would ever be and they really took advantage of him I think so you think they're manipulated him with information and tried to get him more and more enthusiastic about their Salty's thinking about things clearly really obsessed with extraterrestrial life because he claimed that he had seen something while he was up and space people helped him make that claim that was my understanding of it of reporting and I stayed away from some of the crazier speculative things about him but what I was really interested in when I was writing that book with how is Authority and power allowed the program to get funding right so much of this is it's like who's funding this stuff and why and it really does come down to Authority which is always at which is always a narrative that I find fascinating right how do people get the authority to say go on these programs or you know we should do that I mean the question you asked of like how does who's in charge right you know we should do that I mean the question you asked of like how does who's in charge right and in all of this what I learned more than anything is that the Office of the President has a lot more power than I think any of us are aware</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> looks like the Pink Floyd line you know living life of quiet desperation I mean that just terrifies it's the road quote that most men live lives of quiet desperation for my favorite quotes ever because it's true and I've been that guy you just you're just in this world where you just can't wait to just run away and how do people get stuck there how do you think they get stuck their bills at least you have a wife that you have to feed you have a child you have to raise you have to you have your mortgage you have you this you have your that and that's where it all comes from opportunity Place into that well the opportunity to exploit usually when you're young and you don't have any responsibility though that's when you have your options will your options are severely limited the more you gather responsibilities like if I had to as a fifty-one-year-old father-of-three married man pays taxes as a house in the mortgage in a business and all that jazz if I had to quit everything now and struggle the way I struggled as a stand-up comedian it would never work but the only way I could be this person now is if I took that chance when I was 21 when I was dead broke and had my car is repossessed and all that stuff that's the only way you you ever get where you want to go you have to have to take a path it's dangerous most people want to take the safe path in the safe path leaves you stuck in quiet desperation almost every time it's hell is hell you selling insurance or some other s*** that care zero about the can people just make that change out the window and then you have to have a plan and you have to spend all your waking hours outside of whatever s*** job you planning your escape and you have to come to the realization very clear that you f***** up and you got yourself stuck so whatever you're doing you have to do it like your life depends on it and whether it is you're trying to be an author and you going to you're going to if you're going to try to be an author and you're working 8 hours a day plus commuting plus family responsibilities or whatever else you have whatever time that you have you have to attack like you're trying to save the world to turn us you don't want to drown that one and a half hours a day that you have to write goddamn you better be caffeinated and motivated you got to go you got to get after it and you got to have discipline that's most people don't have those things most people don't understand what it's like to really go for something and didn't know that the consequences of not doing that or he'll riffic and I always right I mean people in these military environments that I write about and in these intelligence World environment fate and Circumstance plays a big part because they too can even get complacent you know but when your life is on the line write a lot of times they have these experiences where they're like I must change and that's what I find really interesting in people you can even get complacent you know but when your life is on the line write a lot of times they have these experiences where they're like I must change and that's what I find really interesting in people</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and he's also probably some concerned about other countries getting ahead of us so you have to do what you have to do if your if your job is to protect the American people that keep the military strong you just have to operate with that premise that there's a bunch of other people out there that are doing the same thing for their country and trying to take down the United States and we got to stay ahead of the curve and make human eating robots that can shoot missiles what scientist were working on limb regeneration right right or working oh my God they can regenerate their limbs and so human their idea they're down at UC Irvine have this incredible lab and they're funded by DARPA cuz it's worth the money that comes from right and their idea is that humans should be able to regenerate their limbs and then 50 years out will be doing that and they're working on the science well that's the same science that allows for cloning and so in our discussions cuz that's how I try to report is like really ask people what they think about future consequences and they said to me your exact question which is Will Annie what if one day we wake up and we find out that China has clone the first human or a dark horse like Saudi Arabia you know the American people are going to freak out and go where the hell was DARPA why don't we ahead of the Curve so is that there's a chicken in the egg problem with that I'd like we have to stay ahead we're we're on top we want to be on. I mean everything I write about his terrifying why I think what you do with your podcast is awesome because people can really get into the thinking about things right they can really and they can move away from their own preconceptions their own biases they're bringing into it and they're stopping for a minute and they're going what do I really think about that into really think about something you need information and information can be boring unless it's interesting they presented through conversation will you know uncomfortable conversation also uncompromised have a certain time. They have to smush something into like a 4 minutes segment on CNN or something complex very nuanced subjected to trying to discuss and you known as another person people do understand but you have to reiterate it and it has to be kind of drill in your head when you're pressuring someone in and you're yelling back and forth you're not even going to get a good version of whatever this person's argument is like you should have the best version I want like if I'm going to have a disagreement someone I want the best version of their their point and I want them to get it out is with no pressure want to help them get it out I'd like to reiterate with them I like to give them plenty of time I want to know how you think we know what you're thinking about I would love to talk to these guys I would love to love to put the thing is like they can't tell you a lot of this this mean for national security reasons does a lot of reasons not sure if they want to keep their jobs stay alive they have to have to shut the f****** they can't just talk about what they do and how they do it and how and decisions that maybe they made that were uncomfortable with a kilt they didn't think maybe needed to die but that's the reporter's job or is my. So another words so I go to visit Billy Wadd is home and I knew I heard stories about he's this legendary operator right and he's also what's called a Singleton so he works alone and when I was at work Almost Famous Angleton right which is like he's got one guy giving him orders here's this guy he's in he's in Vietnam and he's part of what was called macv-sog right and they're doing cross-border missions until house and it's so dangerous it's like it's me at the CIA program that SOG stands for studies and observations group, supposed to sound like a bunch of guys in an Ivy League Tower with bow ties right but the guys on the ground called it suicide on the ground that's how dangerous I want of the people had casualties right Billy wall has nine Purple Hearts from the work he did nine okay I mean they get shot they bandaged themselves up there you know they're up in an aircraft because they're limping instead of on the ground you know viewing the mission the warrant everybody's furious with the government with the military there's no room for special operators I mean everything it's called the time of Troubles by the Pennywise working in the post office and he gets his knock you know when it's like he's back in the CIA now in 1977 was out for what like I've ever been afraid and that was in the post office cuz he was getting back into it probably would like recycled his mind and put himself in a place I'm just a civilian now that being with us old guys drinking beer at the end of the bar talking about the war right and instead he gets called up by the CIA and Libya in 1977 and his cover is that he's training qaddafi's paramilitary guys in paramilitary tactics Minister beginning of his career and it goes on all the way until we were in Cuba I think with an actually some kind of a mission cuz like what are we doing here in Cuba doing infiltration and exfiltration techniques allegedly with Che Guevara son but in any event you know when I went to visit Billy wall the first time he's got this certificates and awards and medals all over the walls of his home but there's one framed item that I'm looking at and it's a knife and there is a seal from the CIA and it says in appreciation to the Assassin and I said Billy tell me about that and he said you know I can't talk about that so you know stayed with him for two years now I'm instead we conversed we traveled interview him you know hundreds of hours and I kept asking him not that award and he kept saying you know I can't talk about that but as I write in the book he couldn't talk about it but others did so that's how a reporter works you get introduced to enough of his friends enough of the others who are involved you make sure they're a legitimate source and you begin to find out what he can't talk about and that's what I report in the book and that is very explosive because President Bush right after 9-11 created call the stalker team and ironically you know people have this idea that we've been you know sending a team of Assassins around the world in NATO partner countries and that what I learned had never happened until right after 11 with his soccer team 12 men and actually one or two women the Femme Fatale and they would go after bad guys and they adopted the term from the Reagan are so preemptive neutralization who was who are the women there's always one woman on the team that's what I was told by the guy who is in charge of the soccer team and well he gave me this great example I don't report in the book but I'll Tell You Right Said So women have a different presentation and this like he told me a story of a woman sitting on a bench you know in embracing a man right and no one thought anything of it and it allowed her to spy on someone in a manner that would a man would it would have drawn attention and then the soccer team could go see what their job would be is to conduct surveillance of a Target and they call it making book that the make book on that individual so they know exactly where the guy is and they're waiting on the present borders whether or not they should take action and you know that's where the that's where the information stops right then what happens well like to live like that cloak-and-dagger got to be so exciting like it's I would take that over a cubicle everyday of the week I really would we might get killed my dying that damn cubicle to Raiders staying at long did you ever see the television show The Showtime show with the house it called with the fox that show called that the Homeland Landing in you know Behind Enemy Lines and then your work begins and then how to get out that's why surprise kill vanish I mean you got a surprise your way in kill them and then get out and give you a plaque and give you a plaque Jamie I'm going to get you a knife appreciation of the Assassin you're a killer but you know I'll take that over a boring life I would take that over boring like everyday of the week</div>

	<div> <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stqC8cA-ksQ"> Joe Rogan | The Morality of CIA Assassins w/Annie Jacobsen </a>
		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> morality talk to me about morality talk about why we can't talk about certain things and when you're playing the ultimate game which this war you have to be very careful about what you reveal what you don't reveal and this is where the conversation about surprise kill vanish comes in because the CIA using these covert operations to make people on whether or not that should be allowed or not allowed whether it's good or bad weather it's necessary whether it's like if you want people to be safe over here there certain people you got to take out and sometimes you just can't follow the rules and why why are we not supposed to know about that should be know about that I'm at my house in 2009 a source is you know calls me Abby says I'm on my way back from the Middle East going to pop by the house and say hi he brings me a challenge coin that says Kabul Afghanistan State Department I'm thinking okay he is not a diplomat I mean he's weapons trained at the time my boys were young there lots of GI Joes in the garden and they had little weapons right and the source is showing them about the weapons and they're like so into it cuz I know he's military trained and then he says if it's okay with your mom and dad I'll show you some weapons boys are like please so he sets up the sniper rifle in the living room and I up in the hills and you can look across the canyon through this scope he set up and I can see the veins on a leaf across the canyon and I thought okay so now I know what he was doing in Kabul Afghanistan he's taking out Al-Qaeda with this there's another case on the ground that he never opens and when the boys go off I say to him what's in that and he said he opened it up and inside there's a knife and it's serrated and I said what 4 immediately realizing you know my naivete and he says to me sometimes a job requires quiet so why that became interesting to me was because of my own thoughts and perceptions about what he told me in other words I could I could deal with him with a sniper rifle I couldn't be like okay that's what he does but the knife gave me pause I was like these slitting someone's throat is it in the ribs and I thought why is it that I am willing except sort of the clinical nature of a of a sniper rifle but I can't I'm uncomfortable with that close-up hand-to-hand killing and that led me to surprise kill vanish because that was the motto of the precursor agency of the CIA was called the oss the office of strategic Services their model was surprised kill vanish because they would jump out of aircraft work with their French partners and kill Nazis with a you know a knife to throat and I thought okay that's considered okay because they were Nazis right but we can't we're not supposed to do that anymore in this world we live in Wawa and I spent the whole this whole book researching and Reporting is about that sort of conundrum if you will that moral puzzle you know why do we why do we differentiate yeah and who are they willing to do that to where do they draw that line like I'm sure you're aware of the story of Jamal khashoggi the journalist who was assassinated by someone or some group of people on that date he entered into the Turkish Embassy and they they whacked him and chopped him up and carried him out and boxes and it's an international is was a huge in write this supposedly was ordered by who was it supposed to buy the head of Saudi Arabia cuz he's a journalist and he's delivering information to people but the government of Saudi Arabia disagree like that information is our information he's a threat by releasing it he's a threat to our livelihood assassination program Health alteration I mean literally in the declassify documents he had a health alteration committee and executive action committee they're burying the information and they keep switching around the they switch around who has authority to you no say yes let's go ahead and put this guy in the kill list I mean that was fascinating I interviewed a guy named John Rizzo who is a decades-long CIA attorney I was stunned that he was willing to talk to me and he explained to me how a presidential finding also called a memorandum notification works that gives the president the authority to put an individual on the kill list that job is then given to the CIA paramilitary Army on operator or their assassins because the CIA Works under a code called title 50 of so it makes it legal where is the defense department works under what code title 10 so another words and they can't their Rules of Engagement are totally different the misnomer is like oh the seals killed Bin Laden while they were seals trained but that was a CIA Mission because Pakistan is a Sovereign Nation and the military can't kill people in countries were not at war with so those guys all became essentially CIA operators for the night and if you look at photographs as I have seen you'll notice that they have no markings on their outfits so that if the job went South to be like I don't know who these guys are and if you look back at Vietnam photos of the macv sog teams which I also write about in Surprise kill vanish cuz that's the precursor of that you see no markings right then that way you can go into you can go Behind Enemy Lines you can go into Laos in the Vietnam or you can go now you can go in the back what I learned report in this book is were in 134 countries doing title 50 operations think about that government wants that to be kept secret so in all those countries they're doing things that don't fall under the normal letter of the law to research to understand I talked 42 guys who have direct access to this who are in this world you know from the knuckle draggers on the ground as they call themselves to the lawyer at CIA senior intelligence staff at the equivalent of a general at the CIA those guys explaining to me Annie this is how it works you know and again to your question will why why does someone get to know that and why does the government want why do they allow that cremation out a super interesting and I believe that has to do with a certain climate we're in right now about military might write another words what the CIA does a Kia Optima it's the third option you've got the first option is diplomacy second option is war so if diplomacy is not working and war is unwise you go to the third option which is the CIA paramilitary how many times 434 or if you wonder why the military budget so big that's what is Fox going to feed those folks want to work would be fascinated by the kind of training they do and what they do I mean so many of these infiltration techniques are mind-boggling you know they've got Halo jumping what you know about right where they high altitude low opening so they jump out that you know free fall down terminal velocity pull the ripcord really low not detected by radar and then they meet up with the team on the ground and go do what they do and they also have Heigh-Ho which is high altitude high opening and that way you can fly over airspace where we're allowed and float into let's say a country like Iran and land gather your team and do what you have to do but like so much of what I report I get information like that and then I asked a million questions like you've asking me and it's can talk about that. Classified you don't your journals so you're trying not to judge but is it your belief that this is a good thing for America meaning in the prologue after I tell that story about the source with a knife I say I wanted to know and that exact question like is this a good thing and my answer at the end after it's complex not to be vague but it is really complex is also that well if you're going to take that pole position you must accept rivalry right and also after talk do I think it's a good thing after talking to a lot 20 year old soldiers who come back from the war theater missing a limb with intense PTSD and who essentially serve as cannon fodder I would say my opinion right for the Pentagon that's the second option or the 42 guys that I interviewed you know they're like send me they are professional they are Tier 1 operators there Green Berets there seals they retired they join the CIA so they're like professionals at what they do and they're saying I want someone has to do this job we've been doing this since the end of World War II I want to do it so do I think it's better I mean I think that that concept speaks to choice right because I'm not so sure that the 20 year olds know what they're in for 40 year olds know what they're in for and are willing to do it so that it will also the difference between a specialized trained individual with very specific task versus someone who is sort of following orders and at the front of the line I know they talked about movies that they see whether it's Saving Private and or Black Hawk Down even right where the outcome is not necessarily great but they talk about the romanticization of war and of camaraderie in a Brotherhood that comes from that and then they have their experience and some of that does give them at sense but not always where is The Operators are much more about you know getting the job done that's what I was fascinated by having these guys are real clear their their competitors there like top-tier competitors they have a job they do it they get it done and they ask for the next job so is the oversight when it comes to choosing whether or not this operation takes place or not is it do they have moral guidelines they have ethical or moral guidelines what they say like this is this the president is requesting that this person get taken out the Chiefs whoever this is me do they have to make a an ethical distinction Heating and I like healing nicely like don't make it over there do they decide what business makes sense or like what if the president is like Rosie O'Donnell she been talking s*** take her out like you know I'm saying well I mean that's what I try to write a report in surprised that the people we take out maybe our bad guys one one guy right about his Che Guevara okay because Jay is often portrayed in the press as you know this amazing hero and that he and you know I don't know if you know but he was he was killed by the Bolivian Rangers but it was a CIA operation and I interview the man in charge of that operation Enterprise CoVantage his name was Felix Rodriguez okay long-serving CIA paramilitary officer so also report why the president to your question wanted Che Guevara did you know he was really advocating for nuclear war and I and I show them you know if if we have to have an atomic war the Cuban from paraphrasing the Cuban people will be happy to have sacrificed themselves that is also J killed anyone who betrayed him he killed he writes about it is Diaries as I write in the book right so but on the morality question who decides I don't have that answer but I will tell you what I did I went with my MainSource Billy wall who is it 89 now and he was he's been with the CIA for 60 years okay I mean went and he and I went to Cuba for him to do a Halo jump with Che Guevara son so we were a guest of the man who is father was killed by the CIA and we had this really interesting discussion in the cigar club where Che and Castro you know smoke cigars and plotted the downfall of the United States and that's what I try to give readers a sense of the long lens of History how time changes all things and maybe leave with them then with this idea which they can come to their own conclusions about what you asked me of is it right or is it wrong because really what you might ask is it necessary right I mean I could moralize right wrong but it would just be my opinion but when you see I went really well and I also trout travel to Vietnam because he was supposed to kill he was tasked to kill the top commander of the North Vietnamese Army and I named General drop and why didn't kill drop and we had this incredibly this terrible mission that went awry that I write about in the book in the Vietnam War so 50 years later while and I go to visit the son of General drop are sitting there and dropped home talking about the same issues right and my conclusion of that again is not is it right or wrong but is it necessary we have these wars we keep having these wars isn't as a yeah what do you think well I mean my opinion is that the defense department is far too concerned with vast weapon systems of the future which is its mission statement of its science department and so you create what's on at the Pentagon call a self-licking ice cream cone or the military-industrial complex and there's a lot built into that there's a lot to be said about that vast weapon systems of the future which is its mission statement of its science department and so you create what's on at the Pentagon call a self-licking ice cream cone or the military-industrial complex and there's a lot built into that there's a lot to be said about that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I'm super excited talk to you about several subjects but this one thank you very much for this first edition copy of your area 51 an uncensored history of America's top secret military base book I'm super excited about this yeah do you think there's any alien stuff out there running spy plane programs right so interesting Lee my new book is about ground Branch guys on the ground that's about are Branch what we were doing in the air and it was this idea that we should spy on the anime OK and but if you go back in time why Area 51 really started you learned that it was a base hidden inside of a base nuclear weapons and it was all about beating Stalin at his black propaganda campaign so I write the book to Hoke's Americans in the War of the Worlds type scenario where little men who look like aliens would get out of an aircraft and the government would go crazy about it and then stalling with a look we have not only do we have technology but better than you but we have a better propaganda Department than you rude. Joe you got to read the whole book are people really do all right I'm going to make you save that imma make you earn that right now right off the bat of Area 51 because it speaks so much to power to morality to information to you know people's desire to know what's going on and me and the government's desire to keep things hidden so this topic is always coming up because a lot of people want to believe that there were aliens in that craft and my source who I write about in the book told me otherwise that they were genetically did they really stop you right there cuz when you save that crap what you mean is the supposed UFO wreckage of crashed in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 that's what you mean right but that was never supposed to be taken to Area 51 was supposed to be taken to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base the legend has it that Truman flew there to meet them and that craft at Area 51 in 1951 which is why the base is called Area 51 and that inside the craft were humans who had been altered surgically altered to look like aliens in a plan for Stalin to sort of twist Truman's arm because at that time we had the atomic bomb on Roswell happened we have the atomic bomb and Soviets did not when you say humans were surgically altered to look like aliens demean so this is 1951 so you're talkin about four years after the supposed crash so what we have left but it did really impact a lot of my a lot of my thinking and working on on you know government secrecy project because it makes you really consider what a hoax meet and what it means to a population of people and how the government begins to work with disinformation versus cover stories and all of that but going back to answer your question that is what I was told by the source that a reliable source incendiary idea to rely upon one individual's recollection of it which is why the book went through the roof in terms of people being upset about it I mean oh my God I interviewed 79 CIA guys Air Force guys spy Pilots Engineers I mean conspiracy theory accounts that it was some sort of a test vehicle and that there were actually just dummies inside their Crash Test Dummies that they used there's been a bunch of different versions of it but the most compelling version of the area 51 alien meth to me is Bob Lazar did you get into that it was common folklore but there was no definitive proof that there was something going on over there other than some weird VHS footage of things flying around the desert that seem to be behaving in a way that modern aircrafts are not totally capable of at least modern piloted aircraft and I totally capable of which brings me to another book called The pentagon's Brain which kind of technology is the government capable of apartment for that reason called DARPA which looks at weapon systems 25 years out so the idea that you and I don't know what the military is capable of in the air under water wherever it may be is because we're not thinking 25 years out and they are and they're developing Weapons Systems the great weapon systems of the future that's what they call them what do you think about those are stork's Baba's our story what's it really there's some fascinating aspects to it but won the most fascinating of some of the things that he's sad that people said was horseshit is told has been proven to be true like one of them's the the biometric reader that measure the length of the bones in your hand and that they are unique as unique as a fingerprint and you're like what are you talking about then they actually found out of this was something they really did Have and Have photos of this thing that this is something he talked about claimed it was Science Fiction it's fascinating when someone touches upon a subject that the government does not want known about for any reason and there is a campaign to discredit that person and no doubt that that happened to him I mean it was remarkable and I write about him in the book because if you follow the logic that my source told me that these were you know modified human beings as part of a hoax and the reason that I trust thesaurus is because Joe he told me that he also worked on the pro so he had like a burden to unload right and so if you follow that logic through then the Bob Lazar story is that Bob when Bob Lazar said I saw an alien it looked like this it was small head big eyes it's yes those religion not genetically aminos where they surgically modified humans that the government was doing experimental quote was he walked by window and looked in the saw two agents that were it look there looking down at something it was very small and look humanoid but he didn't know it was a dummy or anything and he wasn't even supposed to be looking in there and it was a brief like one second look that he is bounced around in his head back and forth has it ever occurred to you that maybe the guy who gave that information did work there but is also feeding you horseshit a major player in the Manhattan Project he went on and work in the atomic energy commission I mean there's a wing of a museum named after him his accolades his awards were so extraordinary it would behoove them absolutely at you know with a Q clearance that's what you have when you have access to nuclear secrets so if someone has a q clearance for decades and they're full of garbage you really have to ask my God to this guy have a Q clearance I mean that's a reverse engineering his credibility but I think you should read the whole book because you know it's shocking what he says but it does make sense if you can get through 400 pages of the cia's idea about information disinformation why we need to cover things up why that's why I'm asking you Freddy Krueger when I was writing another book called phenomena which dealt with the CIA and the pentagon's use of Psychics okay over decades I'm in this goes back everything all right about pretty much goes back to post World War when the government US government takes Pole Position after World War and we now need to always be ahead of the car if we must bleed we can never get beaten by the Russians now it's trying to okay so the psychic program had a lot of people who really believe in aliens or you know other until intelligence from other worlds and when I was writing the phenomena book I learned a whole bunch of new information about how upset they were with my story because they believed and they all knew the source by the way they knew the source and they believe that he was fed misinformation so these are two sides of the coin which are Super interesting if you can look at them with your own biased turned off and not have a desired outcome I want to believe that I don't want to believe that you're speaking of I want to believe you know who's working on a project with Chris Carter the who is the X-Files Creator and the one person I took the source but I wanted to meet the source was Chris Carter and I we went out there together and sat with him and met him it was well because the stores have never even heard of files it was like I know about baseball you know I don't have a desired outcome I mean I would love it if aliens were real but when someone starts talkin about disinformation and propaganda campaigns but they want you to believe them right but don't listen I'm here telling you the truth I'm here telling you the truth let's wait for our 3 because it's too explosive people have such a horse in the race already they I mean maybe you are neutral I don't know I know I'm neutral these guys look like I mean what did they do to them to describe what kind of surgical alteration I stayed with a source I mean after the book published I would go and visit him wait in the Chinese restaurant and eat and talk and I would try to get a droplet of information out of him and I went out to Las Vegas and sat there in a row but the source and his wife and she said tell me this isn't true tell me you made this all up to her husband and he said it's the truth that's a triangular version of getting at the truth but again reiterate I believe he believes what he told me was the truth that was the truth he was told see when they're talking about secret information that they were sworn to protect and then all the sudden they want to talk to someone that they don't even know on the sneak tip let's meet at Diner I'm going to tell you everything in Area 51 to me you've got to talk to the top engineer of all this weaponry and they gave me his name and we talked for days and hours about nuclear weapons and then in one conversation he began to cry and told me this story that I was like what our version of the human experiments because what the and still we do it look I've written about the altered people to make them look like alien according to him we had a small program in 1951 where we wanted to see how the Russians did what they did how they made human beings look like this tell her wife is 65 years I lost my mind so he's saying that he participated in something that altered handicapped children when you say handicapped me like down syndrome or something like that and they made them look like aliens and then killed them like what how did they what do they do with this information and and the grandchild did not live grandchild. And it made him feel so guilty about what he had done that he felt compelled to to confess if he will and I remember seeing him why are you telling me this why don't you tell a priest and he said a priest would judge me and I can tell you won't people who work for the CIA who do what needs to be done on the ground in the name of National Security I don't judge them this is why you know what's really at issue here is morality right I mean can I tell you how I got the idea for this book David aliens he could have cared less he didn't watch The X-Files what was his Pig on Bob Lazar he probably saw something that the government had an extension of the program and he didn't know I would speculate that we didn't talk about that I mean you know other than inference he was very limited in his in the information that he would get out but I mean I used 79 sources in that book it all went on the record in name and he was the one anonymous source because I like I said you know he told me after he died that I could tell the whole story story and I think the best balls that people that read about that in the very end of what we did they go I wish they were aliens so Stalin created some sort of a craft that mimic are going to rain at found something that looked like it would be for another planet is that what they do in those days drones were there was a Mothership in the Drone with attached to it was jettisoned off okay so 1947-48 right under it and it gets jettisoned off and that was what the craft was it was jettisoned off so that the stolen actually and according to the source invaded our airspace which was the Deep embarrassment to Truman so we invaded our airspace and then let this drone crash land on the ground with these things that turned out to be human they look like aliens but it turned out to be humans that were manipulated surgically look like out how close to a nuclear weapons days to our White Sands military base I mean this is like not a place you want the Russians to be able to get near you know I mean was interesting is that area 51 we then went out and mimicked all of those one of our early drones was a mimicry of that it was. There was a M21 which was the mothership in a D21 which was the daughter ship so kind of Let It Go and it flew off I mean there's incredible stories about that CIA was able to do out there at Area 51 with their air branch you know the technology they're always ahead of technology that Bob Lazar good film that was really shocking was the film the filming of these drones flying around and Performing these really have you seen those videos of sore right in the 80s but I mean why I like looking at history is cuz you can see the progression you know you see how science involved in a bit by bit and then there's these great breakthrough is because what the government is always looking for is called a revolution in military Affairs and that's certainly what drone technology did later on as drones became developed after the Vietnam War so in the 1980s when Bob was always filming all the stuff you think this was similar to the technology we see publicly described today in terms of like what drones are capable of when the F-117 was revealed during the first Gulf War that aircraft was being developed for 20-25 years out at Area 51 actually at Area 52 was where they had it set up to develop that stealth technology I think about amazing talk about keeping secrets they had something like 10,000 people working on that no one knew about it that story was never broken by the Press not by anyone it just suddenly appeared in the Gulf War and took out Saddam Hussein's you know facilities that's a revolution in military Affairs what becomes interesting is then it becomes obsolete because now everybody knows about it and everybody is going to mimic that and now you have to have a new weapon system and that's military industrial complex so was this drone aircraft that was released from the mothership was this capable of autonomous flight or was it just they just threw it out there and let it crash the ladder and remember that information I am very limited too that's why it's wrong patience thesaurus gave me these little bits of information which I felt I felt was important to include because it speaks to the big issue why is Area 51 now it's not President Obama was the first president to actually say Area 51 publicly and people say it because of my book right meaning it without the secret was out but before that I went through ten thousand pages of documents from the National Archives and every place you see the word Area 51 was actually redacted right why would you keep that so secret I mean all the guys that I was interviewing they could call it but they couldn't say Area 51 Y and the source said will because we did this horrible program out there and the government doesn't want anyone to know about that however I'm in their stories of like somebody asking Bill Clinton you know about Area 51 him going white I mean human experiments who wants to be part of those horrible experiments were limited to the mimicry of the Russian experiments where they're trying to get people to aliens were there something else going on my goodness I mean you read now the Declassified documents tell us how many different human experiments were going on around nuclear weapons okay horrible experiments where they were subjecting people to radiation because they wanted to know they felt was more important to know what happens to people than to not know and so they would take groups of people that they had cancer or something and test them so there's no doubt that the government has experienced human it's just is that something that is wise to make public and you know there's two sides of the coin on that I mean you you when you reveal these kind of things me right about them I mean people get really upset and you know vilify the government partially with good reason and partially it's like bad for National Security so I think that's the justification on the part of the defense department to keep things secret Sonic before but if I was stalling and I was trying to air quotes f*** with the Americans maybe where I'll do it hey man you got problems aliens are coming and there was if people it's hard for people that live in 2019 especially if you're young to really imagine a world. Only without the internet but with two television channels right and radio which was where people got all the information from me whether two channels how many channels are in 19 maybe three maybe there was a mass hysteria where people were absolutely terrified that we're going to be invaded which is why when Orson Welles war of Worlds which when they released it when they did it on the air they were very clear that this is going to be a reading of Orson war of Worlds book or that I itchy welts he's me and Orson Welles Reddit when they were talking about this on the radio a lot of people missed that part right and so as the radio went on as the broadcast went on a people are tuna and later in the day it erupted in Mass hysteria people are freaking out hundreds of thousands of people really did think that it was and it was also something that was recreated in other I don't know if you know that they did that another countries in different languages when they saw how cute it works in America and information becomes less vague and more specific adoption and how they are easily manipulated factors International Security just like you just described Stalin knew about that he was a master he was the master of propaganda he invented it I mean he didn't invent it but he invented it in a Uno on the political stage to be used to mess with another country's perception of things think of what he did with brainwashing right okay so like in the fifties and this is journalist Tina said so there was a who is putting out stories about brainwashing and there was this idea which is well taken that totalitarian governments brainwash people this became a big codeword it was introduced into the American lexicon in 1950 will then were in the Korean War our pilot start getting shot down there put on TV by the Communists saying terrible things about America that American pilots and suddenly was like they've been brainwashed it was very convenient to have that story things were part and parcel and you got all kinds of smart people behind the scenes knowing this looking at it examining it and using it to their advantage to stay where in the pole position that's the goal of the US government so the propaganda we did that sort of copied Stalin's we're kind of playing catch-up in that sense I mean crazy thing to do to make a fake spaceship and just Let It Slam into the ground with a bunch of people that you cut up to look like aliens did he say specifically what kind of modifications they made people that made him look like aliens squeeze out just like you're trying to squeeze out of me and that's all I'm saying read it because I literally tell you everything that there is I think what's most interesting about the source and why I might come back and talk to you about it and tell you who he is on your show is because because of his backstory right why he did what he did how he wound up in the Manhattan Project because because of his backstory right why he did what he did how he wound up in the Manhattan Project</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it's one of the reasons why I bring people on that I don't agree with I think it's important have conversations with people with her on the left or the right you don't agree with just to find out who they are and what they think yeah and just to have discussions like it has thin your own feelings about hundred lifetimes just like okay that's alright I still feel their best argument or a very cogent argument for their side and go yep I think that I think the the thing that is lost in are in one of the things that's lost now is because of a partially because we entered entered problogger whatever where you have to be 100% in every belief and it's like I'm not a hundred percent in any belief like I'm like there are some beliefs where I say I'm 50 and then I'm 51% and but that still wins 51% is still the thing I tell you where people can't believe you either got to be 100% or is it you're a cuck or you're a f****** stud like and there's no like yeah what portions of perfect example we were both like I'm for it but but pretty brutal or it's pretty it's a severe thing or whatever the button you're not allowed to have a butt anymore by having measured point of view and it's took the vote in my head and it's 73 not any change your mind somewhere that's bad that's my hell is someone said I'm not just one person many people said you flip flop on things like no I I consider things when politicians do it it's because they it's politically in that can work in the favor you do it because you thought more about it more you heard the right argument at the right time and thanks I don't need them made of my opinions are just ideas in my mind or something that should be explored and there's certain ideas that I just holds said that don't rape don't murder people don't steal all the obvious why is the flag of tribal obediencia what are we doing when we're discussing these things and a lot of that is what ruins dysport and this is what I think I have a real big problem with deplatforming restart deplatforming people and censoring people you don't just want to not hear them you want no one to hear them and this is where I have a problem that's cuz who the f*** are you like why are you the one who gets to say you have the wrong you let everybody pick it up if it's information that's the Pizza Gator one of the air like the Alex Jones thing works like what the f*** are you doing is a good example right because people get ramped up in it. Like what and there was that guy Ben Swann who is a journalist who had all these he was he had at this video that he put out that showed like all the different connections with conspiracy theory or with pizzagate and various conspiracies and pedophilia and it was a it was a real weird one Jeep because he's things are the similar it doesn't mean there's a pedophile ring going on there like right is that what exactly is happening there there are pedophiles and there are pedophiles in the pizza place in the basement and that they should be stopped and they're mostly and I at my bed at I don't think none of them are powerful in that but I don't think that there is a I just don't really buy into conspiracy just generally cuz there's some of them that are provable or some of them that it really did happen when you go Jesus Christ it really did that oh yeah I mean like would like men in like third world countries werble f*** with elections like 7 the s*** like that like that is yeah like that's not even conspiracy that's just like a poorly Told part of History probably the most disturbing one because I want signed by The Joint Chiefs of Staff they were going to organize a bunch of attacks on America and blame the Cuban so that we could go to war with Cuba and have them attack Guantanamo Bay they were going to blow up a jetliner and blame it on Cuba they had all these plans news at 9 by The Joint Chiefs of Staff and then vetoed by Kennedy was like what the f*** are you Jackie trying to blow up airplane and the thing is it's this is something that didn't fly but we found out about how many of these things we didn't find out about that actually did happen yeah and that we think are legitimate instances in the news or real attacks and a drop in the bucket I think it's less than 1% compared to actual real failure a lot of the time like we say a lot in, look will you can't make it unless you guys being warm and you like I right now and I don't know yet I hate that f****** that perspective is so crazy it's like listen if you're killing people going to see you if you kill a lot people go to see you a lot yeah that's him you can't fake it is a meritocracy it really is there are certainly like some quote of stuff in the margins but not no one's making it earliest like yard there are certainly like some quote of stuff in the margins but not no one's making it known sooner Arenas because of the quote you can't pull there's nothing you can do to get into Arena</div>

Like I just started it I we used to the pockets made most of this park has got a chance is great and and now I just started one like a month ago called and how many on-field look for it in the look of things am I trying I did at the pilot like a year ago for a network and they gave me notes and I was like oh I forgot about notes I forgot that they were going to give me notes like like I don't just let me that was the other thing to me and Dave got to Central and they finally left us alone after like 6 I was like let us show it to the audience and let them know we don't want a bum we want a bum less than you guys do trust me you never met two people who want to buy molasses right then me and him and today be like what we don't let show to the crowd if they like it then great and if they don't then and we did we did this real world sketch and they didn't they're like we just think it's a bunch of fun funny sayings back-to-back and we're like let's just go to the crowd and then we show dad killed in there like we don't know where talk about they literally said we don't know where talk about so do whatever you want all those people but that's the I get that they feel like they have to do something but we're comedians are willing to like all our skins in the game it's alright it's all of our it's our hide every time so why do you feel the need to like correct us or I don't mind if if like a executive is like the first audience do not remain or like Angry search f***** it whatever like like a minor stuff but it's like otherwise most of you are not good at divining what's special about somebody or what's an Innovative segment or ambitious people who are just like working away at the thing and I like is it my turn yet to put my stamp on it now yeah I add something even if it's irrelevant like bi had a joke when we are doing and I said today I got we should do a thing at the end where we should just say hey let us do whatever we want and then the end will pass a hat around and you guys can take credit for something but let us just let us do the thing if you're like you just been telling me down the pike has almost 10 years yeah every 10 years in December big Network show about in Danvers every 10 years in December big Network show about special ham radio</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I know it's complicated and it's getting well that's the thing of like it feels like the level of danger and difficulty in the world it's getting deeper no I thought they needed an article to 84° I mean it will look like in 70 years what it will do to the art like man I'm not talking about just Miami's gone that's like incredibly like crazy to think about those Miami people they're going to move other places and ruined that's probably the biggest that's my biggest worry let it get that another country that's attached to Florida yeah it's like Europe if I was saying it's like people Niecy like Italian people like in Beverly Hills or Miami and there I was saying my friend those are people that were too douchey for 8 but you think about like like not like 28 Days Later but like like she was like scary scary especially cuz we're going to be near dead and no disrespect your nakamun the same shape you're in now and you're not you I mean people make give you respect that but like it's going to be great we have to move the mountain where would you move the van somebody Sam what's Karen's friend Sam Fighters mine Sam Cedar Sam the Fighter's mind he wrote go to the marina so I live in Venice he's like go to the marina and basically just get I need to go on a boat or just be like I will be at the hard part is how do I qualify to like I can help you right cuz I get seasick here's what I have going for me away from people and you can if there's a attacker you can see them you assume that they're not going to be like you know SEAL Teams coming out of your boat attackers crazy could it get how do you get their good call closed Spurs got the helicopter but he's distant he's got to go to get it that's his Escape I probably move somewhere that was if I could get just go to a place if I knew I just had to get to a place I would go to a place that is sustainable like whether it's Alaska Minnesota or Michigan somewhere there's a lot of animals and there's Wild and you have cold of water you have a lot like cold is better than heat because cold you can make a fire like if you have a shelter and you can make a fire in the cold you can live I have a counter argument which is I don't like the cold kills more people than heat but that's just because you know people are unprepared for it you can prepare for cold with clothing you can't really prepare for heat with clothing with heat you need air conditioning and you need water does Italy yeah you need something if you live at like there's people that have lived in very cold climates as long as they have a good house and they have a good Supply would they're fine if you live in the desert man you kind of f***** your kind of f***** is the power goes out you don't really have anything to keep you cool you have to stay in the shade and stay indoors but it's not good enough and 210 degrees inside it's a hundred I don't think you will just die from its from Heat mobile warming is going to be the things like Lakes lakes and streams are going to be less less water is dribbling down to the creek Creeks were going to dry up streams will dry up you have a hard time getting water if you're in a desert environment yep you have bite by the same token if you have enough what you've as much water as you have would obviously good it's not a one-to-one an LG cuz you can go get more wood easily like I hear your thought about getting cold but I don't know if I had shade I guess you don't I guess with cold you don't have to have electricity you don't have to have electricity with cold and also you have more of an opportunity to find animals you'll find more animals in cold climates and you're going to for delicious animals are more things to eat but you might easily starve to death like the idea that it's easy to go out there and shoot a bunch of animal eat them all the time not most places most places you don't have an abundant enough Supply Wildlife you're also a guy who does archery bow and arrow how many hours do I have I would have to make sure that I have enough arrows I mean things I don't really need to practice that much of my rifles on off I can have good Trigger Discipline I'll pull to the shot I'll try not to Flinch and I'm not related to those sweet things I've no dummy rounds so he has reggae Thornton and four bullets which is not real bullets goes like bang bang bang quick and then he has to get rid of that that bullet but he least he knows if he was flinching because if you Flinch and you'll see this movement with right no no gun goes off the boat doesn't go off but you make that weird cuz you're anticipating the shot that's the way to train yourself out of it yeah you have to do something like that you have to put your finger on the trigger but also the way you squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze and let the shot go out by surprise and not react to it the same thing with a bow and arrow you have to have a surprise shot you want you wanted to just do want to concentrate in the Target Zone it in and which feels like you kind of can't even be there meaning like you just have to be like I'm doing a thing like you can't think about the release you just think about the target that's very astute of you there's actually courses is a guy named Joel Turner who has this whole course called IQ he's a teaches First Responders like SWAT teams and Trigger Discipline and about how to how to shoot properly under pressure and he works with people with our troop this with the same thing cuz it's a it's a psychological thing to be able to but my point is with a bow and arrow your kind of f***** you need a lot of goddamn arrows you need to make sure that Bozeman stay okay with only animal to like like a deer with your beer bear would be like the most do you want a bear Pure Barre you can eat that mother f***** for a long time and you can take that fat and you can render the fat down use it for cooking and use it for you know you could do a lot of things with it and that meat is a lot of meat anyting big he want a big animal because you want to be able to dry it out make jerky you want to have something that's going to sustain you for a few days or weeks until you find another animal you don't want to dig a hole in the ground to make some sort of Cold Storage you want to get below like the frost line depth to protect it from a lot of things and you're probably not going to make enough food it sounds harsh it's the hardest every time I go on a hunting trip I always think like imagine if this is the only way I can get for ya it's so goddamn hard of get close to an animal so hard yeah people see videos of it like on YouTube and there's a dear and you draw your bow back and you hit in the heart and the deers down Everybody celebrate from a live stream of the moment hunt start to the moment you're successful and you just sat through the whole thing like as a f****** games of thrones Marathon then you would understand it but it ain't even then you wouldn't really cuz you wouldn't be out there in the cold exhausted hiking uphill going thousands of feet up and down in elevation and then the wind shifts and the deer smells unit darts off and on but if I don't get a deer I'm going to live or go to a restaurant if your only option is deer that you catch and kill and find your daughter sick all my God and he got a f****** catch a deer watch them starve to death I'm going to live I'll go to a restaurant if your only option is deer that you catch and kill and find your daughter sick all my God and he got a f****** catch a deer that's when you wonder how am I going to watch them starve to death</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> oh my God yeah it's the that's how we would go to Comedy Cellar like it just like this f****** done standing here it would count as social justice Warrior infestation like they need to look spray the place battlefield of what Miss words like literally came and they were protesters and then I couldn't sit at the table and I did because it was like married I mean I don't think it's play try to find a new Stormy Daniels article doctor or the hater to keep quiet she didn't keep quiet what's the worst thing do we think he doesn't f*** yeah but different strains are like we knew we was gross no one cared the only way that we all think I was even raises taxes more than he loses base or you raise the taxes on Lower middle-class people and if he if he like doesn't stand by as abortion stuff but otherwise all the donors are sticking with them everyone sticking with what happened yesterday there was a new abortion ruling was it an Alabama yes that they literally I personally believe it's going to backfire that's always been true as Republicans against abortion and they would go like we and they never got to appeal it right but I think they're going to repeal it and if people going to go like woah woah woah but you can't change a law he's done a lot of times not even a plurality of of it like in general elections like in the general presidential election like it's not even the majority the country that elects the president now Father's Day past I just personally believe that I mean obviously hopeful but it's a bit like now that's too far it's a bit like when they made Clinton testify and people like that that was too that was like the the the tube too far up the line was crossed from a Clinton testify about sex life and it was like we don't like that we understand that you wanted to but don't make the Fred and I feel like I'm hoping and I believe it's true that it will be too far field for moderate people I hope you're right and it just it's very dangerous when you just decide that no one can do it anymore based on a few people's decision that is going to affect the millions of people that live in Alabama in is the reason Christians want to Outlaw it is because they think God is going to say what's with your vote on that I saw that you voted for abortion what mic do I kill baby yet so you want to kill babies like more but you voted for it's like they don't want to live in a country where that's legal having said that if you Google the worldwide rights of abortion it's not legal everywhere which surprised because I was like what is it and what is America's Where Do We Stand within the rest of the world and there are not a ton of countries but there's and theirs I think it's illegal in 1/4 of the well if not more abortion is one of those things where it's like okay when does it bother you doesn't bother me at all if your 2 days pregnant at all four months pregnant. You look really pregnant in abortions like what it would have what is that is that uppababy it would be viable the womb cuz it's one of those it's it's something that people just have a deep discomfort about when discussing even if you're a supporter of it if you just discuss the actual reality of what it is what the ACT is with this surgical procedure is and it makes you know it's not it's nothing like your bright ones everybody knows that some so far to go the other way I'm left the vix you do want to talk about that the presumption about you that when people talk about you can getting an abortion they are out they always whisper about it but I wouldn't are we got if I got a cyst removed I mean if that's the indication it's just a medical procedure and again pro-choice have at it I'm sure I've never I don't I haven't had any abortions that I know of but I don't I don't know what what point of view like about it about the taboo of discussing it though and impedes rational discourse and impede your ability to talk about things and communicate about them because you to have this very rigid opinion that you're always pro-abortion Pro women's rights woman's right to choose which I am it it but we're still talking about a real thing and that real thing is killing a thing that would grow up to be a person and that's why people freak out about into pretended otherwise yeah just disingenuous Louis was the first one I heard talk about it on stage and in a way that was funny we like it Louis was the first one I heard talk about that on staging in a way that was fine we like it I don't care</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> great slicing that's great I'm glad that people are visiting me Neal Brennan size with everyone will be a notary republic I wonder if they can live where they can listen to the sound your pan is making and figure out the lines are drawn you know they have technology now where when people are speaking in a room with a with a window we should get rid of the window now they know they can tune into the vibrations of the window from the sound of your voice and stop everything is being said in the room I heard that there's a Netflix you because before I mean Netflix doesn't give people ratings but there is a way that they're you can get they can gauge Reflections off of some weird f****** technology where and it's fairly accurate Reflections off of Windows yes I don't like oh wow yeah that was a monitoring I have no idea why the long range laser listening device the long range laser listening device laser microscope is highly sophisticated surveillance apparatus that utilizes an invisible infrared laser beam to eavesdrop on a Target is the most effective long range laser listening device in the world that allows the operator to conduct an undetectable surveillance operation and he targeted Stark Industries would least one window at an impressive distance of over 500 that is actually very impressive are that's far as s*** with the laser beam you just buy that like submarines have technology that can listen to basically like fish farting in the ocean if they if they wanted to they can hear sounds that quiet they can hear anything so if I like Lilia fish Parts they're like what was that was that was that a sub nope fish I would like the American Civil Engineer like non-government there like kind of work for the government tangentially to the Embassy there Apartments were above each other to several people and both of them it wasn't 60 Minutes like not long ago a likely Target of the rooms a dog whistle for people that yes innocence and it's like well what do you want me to do I guess you just leave I guess it is like a dog yeah there's probably a ton of Technology like that they were not aware of my friend Mike swick used to fight in UFC and before that the he did a brief spent stint rather in the military he was doing something some sort of secret service and he said that they had found listening devices that were so sophisticated that they were being powered by the natural way of the building with the wind so the wind it didn't need a power source the natural swing of the building in the wind was powering up this little microphone that was listening in on things and he said they were they were looking at this stuff like we don't know anything like that so yeah completely new stuff and then we found it in the building like I just don't kill me you don't even like the hope is we just both would they have their thing and we and it's just like mutually assured destruction like a arms race of technology to use the cloud yes my apps are backed up in the cloud recordings are backed up in the cloud sets sets of them yeah but there's like no photos or video kids f****** crazy I mean we're we're we're getting down to some very strange place with the cloud when stuff is in the air and the amount of trust it takes the presumption that will just never run out of energy and will never run out of the ability to tap into the cloud is like I'm not even like a doomsday person but I just feel like it's like the difference between how men dress and probably can have Women written like on a night out are wearing heels and guys are dressed in case that fight I'm still like we will do the thing in the mirror like how I feel with Wi-Fi door locks in my place and I live living like a townhouse thing and there's power outage the gate won't open and like there's no really are was a failed there was a release that somebody a better person than I figured got to pull the chain and it was like okay but it wasn't it wasn't easy but like you know it's the deals they think it's like well this guy something somewhere around 12800 years ago hit the earth and f***** up everything and probably reset civilization killed off the vast majority of us $12,000 corresponds to the end of the ice age is a lot of physical evidence for it and increasingly we're seeing more and more evidence in terms of ancient cultures that existed far before 12800 years ago they really didn't understand that they thought people just hunter-gatherers back then and now they're finding evidence of things like the place called Gobekli Tepe which is a giant these huge monolithic structures that are made out of stone carved like two huge columns that don't seem like they were made by Hatteras it seems like there's probably some sort of A Lost Civilization and they know that this all happened somewhere around that time somewhere around 12,000 years ago so it can happen again it does happen again our stuff is on digital now which is even weirder it's weirder than books right we have books but the vast majority of most of the data that we all keep and share we share on phones and computers and we can't read it we can't read it without program I don't know right we have books but the vast majority of most of the data that we all keep and share we share on phones and on computers and we can't read it we can't read it without

Stand up in 10 f****** months he's working it out but if you say that he's different now we're getting to see the real Louis like b**** you better go through his Libreria that's what he did Department there was like his knife most offensive joke we didn't know he was dead know him anything you assume what you believed what he fed or YouTube you wanted to believe I actually I have a theory that one of the reasons people like the New York Times and and and other media Outlets got brought the hammer down so hard on him is because they'd heard the rumors and ignore them so now they have to signal that like this is wrong cuz there were Rumours before and they were like we don't like They begged so now they have to overcompensate be like he is absolutely he's the face of democracy and evil the bad beachfront property oh my god this is my cock my cup here's what I want to talk with you cuz you're f****** good dude and have been a good dude for 27 years that I know of to me and now the next question becomes why do you have cracks on Earth would people would consider cranks on the showing you and I talked about this a little bit off the show explained because you are basically liberal yes but you believe in having hardcore right-wing people on because you like them personally or you like you believe it's worth some of them are like personally so it's worth having a conversation like Ben Shapiro was one that I had a long time he's one of the more controversial guys that a lot of people get upset at me and call me an outrider yeah he's been attacked by the alt right you know what the number one target for anti-semitic remarks in the entire world cuz he's riding a little bit of it where he was like he kind of didn't he kind of got a little lost well he had two different years like David Parkman had an interesting take on it packman said that if you look at his explanation to ask him a couple things I might be really believe that Moses parted the Red Sea and he said I would look for more naturalistic explanation for that but then when I talk to him about gay people gay thing he was an example of allusion in naturalistic explanation and you also wasn't interested in giving people the ability to do whatever they want he felt like you're not you're supposed to resist that and his take is that like you you have an urge to murder people but you don't do it because you're a good person and you should do the same thing with being gay on wow that's a crazy that's crazy mental gymnastics he believes them natural occurring thing his position is positions of God doesn't want you to do that it's in the Bible he doesn't do it maybe he goes hard yeah he doesn't use electricity in the Sabbath till the sun goes down the whole deal yeah and you know a lot of people like you know you giving this guy a platform like communicating with someone and I like him as a person he's a very nice guy I don't agree with him at all about that about the game you believe it's worth giving people a platform Lodi platform yeah I think that's inherently dangerous and I think that just stopping people from their ability to communicate just makes more pressure on their side it makes more people that are on the fence Port them cuz I see you as being a sensor and that's why I think we found out with Jack from Twitter Jack Dorsey when he came on and talk to me about it and when he brought the John who's the lawyer and you know like censoring one is answering all sort of it's not smart it's it's not good it it does the opposite of what send it to do it makes the other side magnified it makes whoever your censoring more popular makes him an underdog and also goes against core American values like the freedom of speech and I know that these are private institutions and I know that they are not necessarily forced to uphold what we determine is Free Speech in terms of like how it's written the Constitution the Bill of Rights I get I understand that but I think that the principles of human interaction on this play are largely dictated by our ability to discuss things even if you disagree agree with you that the I think like deplatforming and silencing and he's a bit correct right they're not even your thoughts they're just like headed your way and sometimes your stress levels yeah sometimes you just like you or you just don't have it in you like stop the same situation you'd be super calm and reasonable and maybe you could turn it around yeah if you eaten like the doctors are worse in the afternoon judges are worse for lunch it's just an easy way to dismiss me cuz I'm not right if you ask me my positions on things very left-wing yeah the only thing that I got very with the Orthodoxy is with the Second Amendment with gun rights I don't think it's that simple I know a lot of really good people that have guns and I know a lot of really good people that never shoot anybody that have guns protect himself into label everyone the same as just like labeling everyone who drives a car the same as those in cells that drove into people in Montreal or where that was at Toronto wherever they want it's we have a real problem labeling people and labeling people with is lazy and it's an attempt to marginalize or dismiss their positions and it also feels good to do it she feels good to like I guess what writing them off I'm superior I have a very clear more of you I'm taking out one of my moral paintbrushes you are that add paint brushes to you are that it's not a moral position even if it's like that Neal Brennan he's such a left-wing

feel too much but I can imagine, what percentage of women do you feel like you have to do that with the ones you don't know me what's a know me I'm pretty pretty nice like go to a venue you go to The Venue that you never been to there's a woman the backstage one of the works for Live Nation or she works then you'd like does she assume that you're not but I think that if someone has like a very staunch feminist perspective and then meet someone like me they might depending upon their perspective they might think that I'm the enemy that that's it that's a possibility that like right away they look at me like the enemy yeah you can tell when you're arguing with with people that are super dogmatic about whatever they believe in but they can you can watch them go into a line of logic that they know that they didn't realize I can't cuz that will like seed some ground to this person to go to and it's like I saw you start to go down at like a just a reason I'm not saying Stop Believing what you believe in have to be overwhelming just just don't it's dishonest and wet cuz they don't want to believe they don't want to have they don't have chicken around Marin turn logically yesterday me and Joe list were goofing around about Alyssa Milano sex strike again women would agree with you that they would just withhold sex from the person that they have with them a lot of thick Adam Alyssa Milano said you withhold sex because I'm f****** Georgia their limit abortion laws but the second thing is I like that you would assume that all men are responsible for this not even just the voters in Georgia but all men somehow I got a man in Minneapolis should be denied sex from his Progressive girl for that he's going to call like his friend Alabama like man cuz I'm not getting no p**** up here bro this f****** sex strike is for real bro this is hitting it's so delusional and such a dumb flag of virtue that they're throwing up and it's it's it's such stupid 2019 woke politics at that was by the way it's like based on lots of strutted like a old Greek play in Chicago I work nights and I don't think it's ever I don't know will you Google see what the ever been done girls just use that excuse to not f*** a guy they won't don't want to f*** so like most of them aren't f****** anyway it's like yeah like what are you going to like rocket that joke about like what you can't stop you're already not talking to hear women talk about not wanting their husbands and so I could such a depressing like it was listen this gal she was like wow you know wife don't want have sex their husbands like what you listening I like as a husband a bump you out or a human being humans that are in a situation about relationships but besides the fact you love someone you care if someone is having sex with somebody want to have sex with you it's great fun it's a fun time yeah yeah yeah yeah and then their attitudes that most women don't want that varies from wildly call a guy how long do you think he should wait to DM you cuz that's a guy on a girl's follow me and because I just do jokes on there I'm like I don't want to be like for the comedy also the answers were all over the place like 4 days 5 days 10 minutes and then I said but if he's cute it doesn't matter narrow nope yeah I just got out of Lights hope any dates an older woman is older than him like he's got he exercises what is it safe for the more sex drugs and didn't read it as a Chicago list in Kenya the Philippines Liberia thanks Nobel Prize winner Lima say that gbow healthy 10-day sex strike in 2006 to end gang fighting why it is a great idea they truly is like to if you want to fix change just get every other same to somebody last night like we all know like every somebody was asking me about cheating on and I was like I'm not a cheater but I was like every guy does what they do most team treatment is because they men wanted to get like like buildings electricity problem and unions just trust me if you got a great bargaining tool negotiation of a relationship is like we're girls got like women don't controls like they may not control it explicitly but I know if I do something that's going to get you in a bad mood you're not going to like me and legalized prostitution is one of the one of the best ways to combat any kind of sex drag and that is one reason why women f****** hate the idea of legalized prostitution they don't ever want that to not be negotiable don't ever want you to be able to go I'm an ass-whole yet I'm going for a drive is and you go right down to the store will you go to the sex store yet and yet you pay for a 10 and she's a bit like Jessica Rabbit and you but if you could have you had enough but it was legal in this country how much you think it would ship perceptions and it was the way what people I think it would I don't know cuz I was just in Singapore and apparently it's legal that by the way I went to like there's a I was in Singapore did some shows excellent and and there was a place called its Orchard Road and it's in the mall during the day and at night it becomes a mall for prostitutes a prostitute Mall Guess Road and the awful thing for his four floors of whores what should I do I just joking around yet cell but it died would solve the the the local guys were going there and I was like mold yeah I'm going to go also cuz I want to see this place cuz I read about it was a restaurant there debate in which is a whole other but it's like not like a Glendale Galleria Foresters Escalade in the middle of the next just basically like and there's just with prostitutes hookers issue called him out in the walkway into countless brothel bars I feel like I need to scrub myself like I was there about three minutes and I was like all right cuz the thing is there's a difference between legally legalized prostitution and anyone wanting to be a prostitute they don't want to be I mean they are being a part of sex trafficking said it wasn't true but there weren't they were just regular girls who want to jerk guys off for money right wasn't there's no one there on it I think it's a big word would voluntarily whatever they were threatening to release the film footage of him like him into submission and the fact that you can't stop that from happening drive-thru like boys I wish there was a better system this should be a better system setup this is a similar thing about like there's no release relief anywhere I was at a party recently in DiCaprio was there and there and there were a bunch it was just like a feud crazy party like crazy Hollywood party like you never go to misleading because everyone's there and DiCaprio's girl wanted to leave and he goes well the girls too tired so I got to leave the greatest party ever like he had the clicky bike even did Leonardo DiCaprio the King of Kings the girls are tired doesn't matter who I am you still at the window done yeah when they're when they're done ago but having said that we still all do it for some invisible Shangri-La but yet they're still he still kind I mean we're still doing it for some Primal like all the achievements and all that s*** it's still some what you want to be respected and loved and liked and you want people to desire you yes that's part of it right even if you're not going to take him up on it right like I told him I feel this week about the best compliment I ever got was doing a show in Vegas mine who shall remain nameless we get on the elevator at the end woman gets on and goes can I just say I'm married but I would f*** all you guys and we in it was great but it's like I do you get we feel accomplished we did a great job of the show you're attracted us 70 married and that's so nothing's ever going to happen but thank you for expressing your attraction us a wonder if she was saying even though married now she was saying it like just so you know if I weren't married wasn't Marriott at the same time either Anna and treated me at the same time either she was she was from everyone for a guy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let me touch on the Denville Dairy I think is he coming here on in May is that right thing podcast not that I know of someone has said to me electric fence around here was he probably one of his omigod he had a f****** brown bear at his house look at the size of that thing oh my God I'm getting anxiety did he ever see the f****** what was the where was in the movie The Bear was in a football movie was that movie with Will Ferrell basketball game was that the bear there was a bear that had been in movies and had done stunts movies and this guy at the videos awful because the guy is literally just standing there and the bear just goes up to him and just decide to attack and rips his throat out in a second minus the this can happen any freaking time alone you got 45 girls in the back scantily-clad do we think we could happen and what's really crazy is that that bear that killed that guy they went back to training them they're not going to kill an animal that has value is the same as the Orca that killed all the trainers like they're not going to kill him it's just not going to happen if they were trying to figure out whether or not he's going to do it again like Jesus Christ what are you up to today are going to be a bare a******* the people are bringing that that are trying to grab you interact with these animals like that they're relying on the animal shock Factor the shock and all the other animals in the close proximity to scare you and then that night I'm on the Phil DeFranco show. Me personally but he actually takes the comment because they don't got a lot of likes and stuff I said something to the effect of you know that's an abused animal Bubba but it's not since I'm going to smoke more weed by the way the guy who handles the animal he was sort of he was using some legal jargon with me as if he's maybe was talking about Los Lunas of f****** Sumi legal jargon in the history of wild animals when is a bear walk out today I'm going to be friends with someone as well they don't need to be card amount when they're a little cubs you know that course they starve than they abused or do they have to do that to train them I know there are people who claim to love bears that trained Bears to take care of beer and I guarantee they don't all do that says big No-No there's nothing fun about abusing a drug starved animal delete this and your penchant for analog sapote smoke more weed smoke more weed is like going to help that but it wasn't Phil DeFranco I smoke more weed before I was just there are people that have bears that raise and I'm not in any way shape or form endorsing keeping bears in captivity but what I see is people that have these sort of relationship to these really well-fed Bears they're big and happy and they feed them and they're getting the pool with them and it's it looks ridiculous but I don't think they're starving that bear I don't think they're abusing that pair I don't think you have to do that I don't think you couldn't automatically assume that a bear is starved and abused so I assume the star part I certainly can't say a fat bear well fed animal that's hungry for a week There's no question about that but it's not likely that that thing Star by definition of abuse is there's an electric fence around that f****** things which is there yeah you can see it about the ankle should I save it again I don't see how that wouldn't be what the hell does that serve acai berry is just a trip line otherwise for that's a well-fed bear those on a big ass if you want to hear something if you want it to be docile you have to train food deprivation is is in training is your most effective tool it just that you can find a healthy balanced right but food nation is you've talked about this particularly with dolphins experience of wild animals it is with marine mammals not work with bears are there are bears at Marineland it's a really disgusting display it's an archaic it looks like it's out of the 18 hundreds even I mean it really is a disgusting place but the practice was to starve them and what people do their they pay like I think it's a buck and they get like this this look cup full of Corn Pops the Bears are like waving historically there's been Bears there's nothing there's no more No Greater abomination of nature than I can imagine the solitary largely solitary animals so they can find to a bunch of them at the speed and then historically they have ripped each other apart in the house want to know it was a different time different times different things happening that's just that was the that was that was the norm starkly contrasting time to win real and start it so but the stories are like really it's jaw-dropping it's really jaw-dropping stuff but</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I know anything about what's going on the Pacific Northwest were there's pod of orcas that exist primarily on Chinook salmon and they're starving go that's the so in fact it's important I'm glad you mention that because just died yesterday and today a bunch of different protections are being announced for the southern resident killer whales which are in the Salish sea so it's going to impede sort of vessel needs to be grounded to put the system in and the Chinook are just dying they can't get through the flow is gone so they put the system in a long, long time ago so it's virtually overtimes been decimating this population is only really knew why but we're not the point now that we know that these workers exclusively Chinook and there's just not enough and where they used to be massive ones now they've got these two little tiny ones and you know there was a plate of the Southern mourn for a Nexus of like 40 days and carried around the Thunderhead the type of vigilante this was this captivated the world and you can't look at an animal capable of such suffering without being acutely aware of the damage you're doing when you separate them from their family the natural environment let me explain the difference when bears see their cubs Dad they eat them yeah that's a different the different kind of animal that's the thing that we're learning is the most notable aspect of these animals is there still has their emotional intelligence and capacity and I'm afraid of what it is the depth of which we going to find out that they're capable of a bond because who particularly if there's ever some sort of way of translating communication to figure out a way of breaking down those sounds and expressions into something that we can decipher we right now they don't I don't think they know much I've been on water with orcas and dolphins and I've heard them forget the can't even tell you the sounds I mean that they've got a wide array of sounds but you know I could you to the best of my abilities I could tell you when Anna was excited based on their sounds they were making like when was pushing me underwater to do a Rocket Ride which is when you jump off into the air to do this big Majestic jump you knew it was going to be a good one when she let out squawk at the bottom of the pool before pumping her tail and lots you just knew it man this she was on she's on fire then you just you just knew she wasn't into it and I know by the sound you can really determine underwater sound alone you could really get to know your enemy National Stadium mentioned in the Senate I mean people care about what is coming up just yet just a few days ago and Niagara MP if you could pull it up will be on my Twitter the MP local MP what it is my experience show me in the things that I know cuz if people know and I'll do better problem with the videos if we play that video gets claimed videos public Niagara region I can assure you this battle Justice will have no problem with you doing this I'm good friends with the soda can we allow check would just tell us where to get to it boots put that says Marineland an unfortunate place with horrible conditions in public policy to ever weigh to this subject now we got people all right saying like this place is a whole I mean well what what how far we've come in the last six and a half years the world is changing my friend very changing where the people like it or not and this is one that I think it's the time of avoidable this discussion in this resolution this this has to be we have to come to grips with what that is just this is all kinds of wrong man it's all kinds of wrong and fact they're still suing you I think it's working as if it's serving the many purpose and here I am again on the f****** JRE like are you kidding me dude you don't even know the favor you're doing me if you don't even know what you've done virtual Jamie who was it that was on the Castle was explaining the the processes in place of reintroduction into the wild or they were going to have two stages and Nets and stuff like that and he's big outdoor areas where they can transmit dolphins and orcas to who wants. To remember too many goddamn conversation was it discussing how there's places where they're going to have like intermediate steps absolutely maybe maybe you guys expanded I was someone else but knowing that serves as the basis of this project is and the good news is the whale Sanctuary project it mean this thing is going to happen it is the future if they're there their they're well into the process of finding a site consideration are being made for a Washington State's site of the Vancouver side. Appears as though they're settled on maybe Nova Scotia that Community there at large is looking to work with the wonderful that's wonderful news and I'll tell you something show once this law gets Royal Ascension becomes law what happens is Marineland is not able to export the animals unless the minister of the DFO Department of fisheries and oceans concurs that it's in The Animals best interests well if such a sight exists and Marie mind is Keen on getting rid of animals will have a place for them I told last time I was here that my dream is to save whales this might happen additionally if there's a real concerted effort a real effort to rescue those animals in Russia I may very well be a part of that team so we're six and a half years ago I was talking about crazy dream where there was no blueprint there was no Foundation I just I'd sort of threw myself into the universe and said I'm just going to hang my hat on a dream I'm watching in real-time as it's materializing and that's a little perspective humbling that is amazing this thing we were talking about with the Pacific Northwest there are is the resident population that has an issue because they only eat chin up salmon but then there isn't there a another pod that comes through as transients and they're thriving because they eat everything the transients are there they're giving birth to do quite well marine animal save marine animals and stuff when I was there the guy that was literally said can you smell that smell that seal is getting eating somewhere what their friends are why they have to be rude and what it is it's like they won't eat Chinese food Wok Chinese food do I want a burger but there's something called is superpod where's that Congregation of all the different families of orcas in into this event where they all think they congregate it's big social event and and there's a conference that happens every two years in Washington state called superpod which is organized by a good friend of mine Jeff ventures of it's an amazing event I look forward to being there again speaking I got to get another place for me to speak and and and roam about with experts and whatnot and learned a great deal of things but I was we were on the cusp of that almost happened because of the boats are rating to each other like family going the same direction to be crossing the border get real excited at the prospect of a superpower or conflict f*** you imagine the messages are quite clear and you've got a 15000 pound Bull male Orca Junior the bird that you can listen to f*** yeah the difference in the behavior between the transient Pods at 8 the marine mammals Behavior the ones that don't exist on salmon like maybe they have a different maybe they're like you know like Avatar like there's different different kinds of people up there might go to my go-to source is Ingrid Visser she is a Topsy the woman in New Zealand that swims with orcas rest Atop The Scientist should be the one to talk to if a passionate Advocate I'm very proud to have been some very very let's do good work with her I'd love to talk to her I want to have her on the show yeah I would love to talk to her I'm so curious about those things you would blow your mind but if there was a difference if it at all and behavior on the podcast you would get on the next flight from New Zealand and come here I can assure you that so I've always said that I'm in this is coming from a self-admitted Bigfoot to work I'm a Bigfoot dork I really wish Bigfoot was a real thinker but if Bigfoot was real thing wouldn't be nearly as cool and work if we found some big stupid stinky ape has been hiding from people forever and by wow that's cool but it isn't much cooler than a champ or grill at what just cuz it's bigger know what an orca is is really cool that is a super intelligent super kill that eats sharks Dell killer machine that developed that that has great white starfucking tail and running is f****** a great white shark like it has no business no business being in the OSHA the perfect weapon in their world I mean there's nothing that touches them they are literally a killer whale interpreters play but more often than not it's training the the young ones and how to jump a brutal thing I mean I don't love watching personally because I've worked as seals as well as I take team Orica all done Orca with a beach seal to seal he bitten it and toss it to the end the ceiling made its way to the shore and it was actually off the lands with a little bit of water and the Orca beached itself grabbed hold of Sealand just start smashing it in the water then you see the water just flood red with blood and then it hops back and wiggles itself back in the water and swims Wailord holyfuck crazy holyfuck we're Tinkers work is is really special that she do this is a crazy story I have a friend that I grew up with Matt Harrison he went on to the to be real involved in the Army's they can decades into the army now he was on a training mission in New Zealand they were doing this training on a beach and didn't they get called to the performance or correct he's just like Ingrid at this end of an orchid my friend Matt Harris from the same place as me a little town a while at the other end of the Orca and I'm like you got to be f****** kidding me and I got to reunite the two of them back in in Niagara Falls in the summer cuz Ingrid come down again and these are blessings that I couldn't even imagine blessings that I couldn't even ever imagine and yet here he wasn't didn't know he'd be the first to tell you when he came back to change this world it changed never again relent done whereas before it might have been the case he's part of this rescues changed man</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> one hand when you have children and you bring a child to the zoo on one hand it's really fascinating to watch this little person look at all these different animals and end in freak out and in and see how mazing is but that's the only Pro is introducing human beings like little human beings particular to these animals everything else is a con except for the animals that are like really endangered and they protect them and help dumb and then sometimes they were responsible for some reintroduction efforts but other than that it's an animal prison I don't take the position right against all I have to say that there's nothing more sad than seeing elephants cats bear that in katzman the cats when they're pacing back and forth me just get them out of there I don't know what the f*** is going on their head so we have no idea I think this is just maybe normal something right now getting the truth you start to see things for what they are I watch the video on YouTube some weeks ago and it was Marineland in the seventies and man was his place busy and the people were just I mean they were they were they were climbing over each other to be next to the pool at never seen anything like that worked at 12 years I've never seen the amount of people Alorica who's he spends the literal length of the pool that is in on the side with his it is dorsal fin over and he's literally staring at the wall not moving and then you got two other massive orcas that are in this pool that maybe five times the size of this room kind of thing and the people are celebrating like these people having knowing nothing about it just in the all the beauty the met the magistrate these animals at the Majestic nature these idle and yet we couldn't see for ourself whatsoever how abusive and gross this was its it was really weird and strange thing but that's the Legacy business they built so they built themselves on having people come and experience the shock and awe of these animals and very very well that time is long gone no longer I think we're going to come to a time in the future will people think the same way about zoos I think it's we're just we're going to realize like I get that you want to see them I get it I get you want to see them again I want to see them too but God damn we got to stop doing that like this is no way also for the problem is humans don't have any real experience with animals we have experience with dogs and cats which are these masticated weird little fluffy friends they are not animals we don't have much experience with real animals and even the animals that you have experience with their urbanized in a like pigeons that you can feed or squirrels it take peanuts from you he can out into the world in the world of the wild of forests and mountains and uuc actual real animals and it's almost psychedelic is like a weird like paradigm shift do we see a wild animal in the in the actual while I call this is where it supposed to be kind of feel weird because they are in their world or what because it's world that doesn't translated in captivity for instances like wait a second that thinking spring on me to climb year-and-a-half expired from my last job and I had the blessed that the gift of seeing dolphins in the wild I went down to the river what beach was but it was while I was in California and that was my first experience in fact again I'm from small place and then this year I was able to go to Washington State and see orcas in the wild. I jumped off orcas Rostrum into the air so high that you're looking down to Dixie cup to Lad that's pretty awesome but there's nothing like having seen f****** bull orca there's nothing like having seen f****** bull Orca with an 8-foot math on his back swimming next to his mother all the Never My Heart sunk into my stomach I've never seen anything more Majestic wow</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> breaking news just today Marineland had built this fence aptly-named Phil's fence around the park and just today we found out they blocked it all out with tarps because come this Saturday May 18th and certain am inviting everyone to come join me I'll be joining as an as a guest a big demonstration outside of Marineland and we're going to protest it as they're anticipating beak on account of my coming on the show they worked very hard to try to keep me from a coming be speaking of anything see certainly not promoting this event so I certainly hope that this event is it is it is a well it's probably trying to do that because we're litigation what happens at in litigation is you come to a point where you start to negotiate and so there's things that they want from me there's things they really want for me they want my silence the problem is they're never going to silence me it's not an option I've said it before and I'll say it again they can offer me $1000000 to shut up go away it's not going to happen I'm not going to delete my Twitter I'm not going to delete any of my tweets that have the word Marineland in them is as a request these this is layers and layers and there have been layers of requests they'd hoped that I wouldn't come here they hope something could be worked out in our litigation we have so now I chased Marine aquamarine lines owner was still alive I put forth a huge campaign to try to get him to be examined legally by my lawyer much like I submit myself to but as these lawsuits and litigation continues to reveal itself as just a perfect method of abuse you know that they're just the only solve these things appear to serve is to exhaust both parties and have them come together with a resolution. To six and a half years Green Line seems intent on a resolution they don't want to go to examination so while we were in so while I was there to be examined couple weeks ago my Larson take a walk and the two lawyers began their talks we put off the examination because we believe there could be some good faith that can be shown between parties it became quite evident that it was not the case and when we were to resume our examinations were supposed to be last week Marineland on account of the fact I was coming on this show through an absolute tirade and said we are not doing this no bear in mind this is a court-ordered examination date I've got a a trial coordinator who is trying to nudge this thing forward because I mean that something that's what that's a motion I have to win in the litigation itself is to try to get someone to look at this I can move forward let's get someone to manage it so we're we're in case management that case management judge has issued a very aggressive schedule it's in back in February we had a court date of which thank you very much I won a handedly reminder to pick up just a little more than $12,000 of my legal bill which is really can we have a case conference call next week now I don't know where the stands because now Marina has breached the court order so we went they didn't show. Examination I got a fourth what's called a certificate of non-attendance it means the person that was supposed to be examined that they didn't show up. Lines owner John holder who has now passed away didn't show up the tuna is examinations knowing full well that I have to pick up the Seventeen hundred bucks to be there to get this he's just not going to show up no big deal that doesn't seem to be any punitive damage at there and they there I mean we're almost seven years into this thing and they're still they brutalizing me but we're at a point where they're actually in a very uncomfortable position of having to keep this thing if you don't want this litigation to be on the public records and transcripts and evidence and everything you have stopped it seems to me the courts appear to facilitate resolutions of that sort they like settlements I would promise to try Monday want it's what kept me going there lying about me the lying about everything everything they're saying in the train exhaust you financially of course they are so that they couldn't merely dropped my my the lawsuit against me over a. Of time and then that just be it and that I would I would then have to actually file a motion to get some cost back I'll be lucky to get 50% everything in the early days my Larson I'm suing them for abuse of process there they're using the courts time resources they I mean even for that matter we can extend that to the police and other departments organizations they're exhausting these things in bad faith they're doing it because they just want to try to basically they want to take away my right to free expression which of the Canadian charted right I mean I'm protecting my own history Evanescence and I can't even believe that after six and a half years I'm still you're at risk of being silenced that the fact that I let me look full disclosure I'm out of money the last time I was on the show we raised I mean and again thank you so much 60 I'm leaving with 70000 a year and a half has gone I've spent my last penny last month it was a very aggressive last 3 months do you have a GoFundMe I have a GoFundMe account for the information please what is it to go to save smooshi. Com s a v e s m o o cam you can go there there's a small documentary it's a little dated now but on account of the fact that legislation nothing's really moved forward in the lawsuit and the legislation is only just wrapping up it's still very current so please spend the 14 minutes to sort of appreciate the story more I guess you'll get a better more context to others you know some some footage in there some back backstage doesn't play it all the time it's the thing I hate to do most is ask for help I really manly 12 your intentions are pure you know you really are a person who is going about this because you feel like you are uniquely qualified to talk about it you have the actual information you know what's wrong you know you know and you are part of the system you understand it better than anybody and they outside cuz they have my walrus and they have your walrus still we think and so when and so when in the litigation Milo says what he has prepared to offer I say to my lawyer more about the walrus and he says to me do we talked about this is crazy not getting a walrus and I said to Marineland I don't want no money not a penny I want the walrus just two left three have died in the last it's really a mere months secretly I find out what would you do with her really what I would like is I just want to transfer at this point to another facility I would love to see your transfer to the Vancouver Aquarium or there's a facility in Quebec as well I just want to be up pause I just want to possibly be in her life and if she needs me which one I mean there's a reason she didn't want to lose still alive if I would have, and listen would you move to Vancouver if suddenly Dan Bilzerian gets on the horses feel like Arctic beachfront home and absolutely years of her life play the music yes you're not without layers and layers and layers of compromise and but bear in mind not in the capacity that I see it more of a yeah maybe maybe we won't send her to China House that they will send her somewhere and not deter that facility from you visiting maybe we could do that for you that's what I mean it's it's really bad faith negotiated the problem with the thing that I have a hard time dealing with his look we're in litigation you have to exercise a certain amount of decorum and it's not exactly my strong point it's just not I find decorum to be just a thick layer of b******* I just do you want to hope that there's going to be some type of good faith negotiation I want that Marineland negotiates with additional hostilities and threats it's not worked for them in six and a half years what makes you think it's going to work now so here I think we're going down a path of possibly good at good-faith negotiations the villain of the story is gone he's out of the picture of the the new president who was the the Widow the wife is a wonderful woman I mean listen if I honestly and truly believe if the lawyer himself wasn't the controlling mind of the business now he's got sort of facilitating the transfer of of of the business as it was to just being sold off piste often and distribute the wealth of the the remaining family members I think that we could I think the story ends on a good note I have no hostility I have every reason in the world to despise the man who sued me and I don't I don't even think about him it was never about that they made every case in the world every argument that this was personal between me and him and that's cuz you look in the camera and say f*** you two people ice personal between me and Don play you bet your ass that's a different story but I'm saying right now I don't know next week we're having a case management the case manager is going to talk and we're going to see what becomes of Marineland once again skipped examination it's so hard to believe this is still going on to look into my phone then we're on the time you first came on the podcast and now that this is been just a scratch and Claw everyday of my life I live with this looming cloud of threat of like there's people out there that really want me physical threat did they play their games and I called everyone there Bluffs everywhere at every corner this thing but it was something about Lisa they play their games dontari I don't know that you're familiar with them in as soon not probably few people are unless you're an avid hockey fan because we have produced some pretty amazing NHL talent but not this population of like 50000 welinder I don't know any other end of a Frenchman I mean I don't know any other way to deal with things other than sword fight it out it's not going to work for them to continuously try to threaten me because I'm invested and I'm not talking money I mean it's like a hostage situation it's how it started my only interest is ending hostage situation that not my only interest feel like you're negotiating for a hostage in smooshy there they're using her as that type of Chip yeah that's their bark that's their bargaining chip that's what they got and they're keeping this constant pressure on you is constant Financial threats, like my lawyer in fact in this work is kind of weird because listen I don't understand he's supposed to be representing me the answer is no to everything fight fight fight I want to trial he is dead is coming listen this is not how litigation ends feel like you don't seem to understand how this ends you don't have a group of how litigation works I'm just like I'm glad that I don't pick my guess is representative 90% of population that don't know and it's important we find out I was promised a trial because they said I was this this this this this will let's get to that f****** try this what I've been doing this doesn't end with negotiations because I need to show that I need that I want that I want the truth at the wrong guy I hate to say it I'm the owner of all the lawsuits they've launched they locked in at 12 and threatened and end it's important to know I've been threatened and I'm constantly under threat of additional litigation I'm the only one left and the only lawsuit that's the only person who hasn't had to compromise their free expression it's too dirty secret about the legal business the dance is a loophole this is something people can do to people to sign on some just to drag them through hell for 6 years maybe 10 who knows how long it's goes right I mean this is a case manager I mean I had to fight in court at Great expenditure to get this case management and if you put this up to the general public and have them look at what the actual facts are and have them look at what these people what their business is what they're actually doing game over game over it's a real problem for them the real problem is it's an indefensible tivity having those animals in swimming pools for people's enjoyment like but the follow that up with trying to crush people I'd want a TV show called Wipeout and I had 50000 Canadian dollars tax-free in the bank which I sat on because I didn't know precisely what it is I was going to do it then I felt like there was the potential of a rainy day around the corner it took that in the first 6 months to 6 months to hire lawyers for everybody in a $5,000 retainer I only have it because I got on the show because of my relationship with the walrus so I'm in for a good chunk of change it's crazy the length of witch and the ability corporations have to destroy individuals the fact that the court is there to facilitate it is precisely why I want to go to trial I've been told the figures are and please don't quote me I'd love the facts but I've been told that something in the area like 90% of lawsuits get settled without going to Discovery I want to be I want to be the temperature or less I want it I want a resolution by the by the judge I can sleep at night if the judge says okay it ends with this Phil you get the $50,000 of your at this point in excess of 200,000 in legal bills and Marineland you lost so you got to eat the shame and walk away I would assume be more comfortable with that then if we're going then said here's $100,000 don't talk about the I mean just don't talk about the terms of the settlement but other than that you have no impeded speech you can just be free I would be more comfortable with the judge's decision then that hundred K because then at least I know exactly what it is that I went through world can find out what function these courts have and what their version of justices I mean I'm just still I'm trying not to be jaded because I was just a heavy load to carry as in your day-to-day it's been on the cusp of crazy I'm thankful for plant medicine keeping me grounded and keep me in the proper perspective but plant medicine listen to you happy but he's got and they've got your daughter that's a mess just try to put yourself in a perspective if they had your dog your neighbors got your dog and his unimpeded Lie by your definition abusing or neglecting their life and you're there to just watch silently and that's disgusting that's a disgusting scenera this is the poison that I live with I need I need a proper closure I'm relying on there being a level of justice of that one day I can live need a proper closure I'm relying on there being a level of justice so that one day I can live in this world without being just that old jaded dude look last time I was here was not nearly as f****** gray like starting to feel the effects of long-term litigation</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> again with the looming litigation I do get a little bit sort of tongue shy because this is just going to be a suit again man I had the bright side is it seems to me like Marineland is not going to be around for terribly a terribly long time once their dissolved you bet your ass I got lost talk about I mean I would love if I could speak of everything without having to sort of watch now I really do have to keep from saying a lot of stuff not on account of it being illegal but just on account of the fact that it will virtually guarantee me additional hostilities and yeah well if you're in that business right now you got to be looking at the future going we got to get out we got to get out for the take us out that's precisely what's happening with the speculation is Marineland lawyer is now the sole control in mine and heat that's precisely what his job is to transition this from we know that they sold property they sold the golf course they sold the campground we know now that they're they're all saying the word selling it might not be the right term because Marineland claims will be no Financial exchanges but you know that that's yet to be seen the other writings on the wall they're going to be gone I don't think the wife has any interest and she's she's pushing seventy something Frozen want to be a part of this she's never really had a heavy hand in it I mean she had she had she took care of the cash business aspect of it she had her role in it but it wasn't like a management position making decisions on Animals House importing exporting told is that Marineland owner in his final days there's a wish list this is what happens to the park this is what happens with this this what happens with this and you can bet your ass that there is something about a walrus and there's something about me in there what it is at least that I know of right now is obviously hostilities till the end I think that what's happening is the lawyer is fulfilling John holders wishes with me I think it's in the books that he can't just end this thing or I don't know it's Christmas time best of friends but man with that for their own sake they should stop for everyone is profiting off that you got to find an exit strategy and I don't just mean Marineland I mean anyone who understands my language that's the tearing my words you should stop this is not the future disses you can't do that anymore this is going this is going to look horrible just a few years from now or people who've seen Blackfish people who do understand what those things are the more we find out about dolphins and orcas the more we understand them it's going to be more and more it's not like we just did some tests like crap bro like you just eat them it's not going to happen man we're more and more impressed with them the more we study them I am more than happy to negotiate with Marineland that rather than signing any type of non-disparagement because I don't want my speech virtually locked in a in a legal document I'm a forgiving person I don't need I'm only responding in kind to their hostilities they come at me with War I bring it back I have to take it right back up to where they bring it then they do this I got to do this and they do this just dial it back I can be a happy smiley not tripping Marineland guy I don't have to beat I don't have to do that I've done what I've had to be where I am the man who was who created this scenario was gone we don't need the hostilities anymore so what is the lawyers motives exactly I don't know but I can assure you now that they blacked out the fence like they're doing everything they can to suppress our information they bought up all the Billboards in all the available Billboards in Niagara Falls so that they've got Marineland science because we have put out like as activist activist I put a billboard I want to purchase like rent the entrance of Marineland last year's a thing of beauty so they bought all these things up they really don't want that PR right now my guess is trying to get rid of the animals mitigate the pr losses because it's already a sound Foundation of it a bad PR and sell the prom get rid of it all and I think the other try to fast-track an accreditation so that they can facilitate animal movements and what not my greatest weapon right now unfortunately is that I can assure them a great deal of of Financial Risk I have and I certainly can and am right now they need to take that into consideration when you consider the price of a walrus and let's just use the number 100000 which is a grossly inflated number walrus and let's a Marineland where to say hypothetically walk why would we give you $100,000 asset when it's going to cost us less than that just to finish this litigation and we'll get 25 can't be an associate why why would we do that doesn't make sense and I say to them it's because I'm going to make that walrus cost you tens of millions consider that lose the hostilities I'll make you guys quiroz we can do that to the near this narrative doesn't have to continue The Narrative of War can end with with the dead owner it could have ended but well they're all invested in it in one of the things about lawsuits like people when they get started as a game going on trying to win you trying to win try to get the other side the cave main this is a lot of what this is all and obviously you've taken this very personal and this is all part of you now can I explain something really messed up I now because we're coming to an end the law but I've been advocating for is going to pass this lawsuit is going and the animals will that mean we're going to find out what's going to happen to them in the in the near future we already know it's what's becoming of some I don't know what it's going to be like to live without a lawsuit once the prospector. Nice bro going to be on the beach to feed up when the prospect came round of me not having one anymore that's not how I saw it it's a weird oddly connected to Rangeley addicted and married to a f****** lawsuit against you'll be passed it nice bro going to be on the beach to feed up when the prospect came round of me not having one anymore that's not how I saw it it's a weird oddly connected strangely addicted and married to a f****** lawsuit Ikea you'll be passed it will get you through</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we got to stop doing that with dolphins and orcas it's going to be thought of the same way we think about slavery today it's that it's horrific we can understand that we can't believe that compassionate human beings would be willing to isolate members of a super social highly intelligent animal species and just put them in swimming pools it's f****** barbaric it's crazy that Orchards is what's that here's you know what we're years removed from the documentary black yeah I know that was really impactful I mean arguably responsible for the paradigm shift that weird that we're experiencing here in North America and other places of course but maybe it's time for people to revisit it I know SeaWorld their stock is undervalued started going up now Grant to date you know they changed their number they see what they have free beer day they pump in numbers up you know they have all these different emotions whatever I mean everything that comes out of these these facilities these assumed it to be all bulshit by the way it's all bulshit but as we speak while we're missed sort of a paradigm shift here and I mean I can speak to it because I mean I'm very happy to say that we've very effectively decimated Marineland will talk more about that but over in China this is now a burgeoning a businessman and I did we discuss this a year-and-a-half ago and it's it's tenfold now it's happening very quickly and I'm sure you're familiar with the whale jail situation in Russia have you seen that they've got over a hundred wild card lugo's and orcas to the book 10 orcas if I'm not mistaken and some activists fluid drone over it this got worldwide attention outcry lot of Anger of course so what happened was Jimmy chill there right now and we're looking down at the wood looks like swimming pools with I guess those are belugas those are not been sold those are sold and red China but on account of the fact that the activist got this and who created a real world wide stink all the negative press that came of it they've now resolved that they want to try too hard considered releases the governor in the area signed a intent to release agreement with the world sank but with the whale Sanctuary project who sent a team to assess the animals health and what not and this is all in like 3 weeks ago is not alone have your sister all these animals should be released as a couple of issues there's a couple of things that that are becoming conflicting a it's going to require a lot cost if it's done responsibly be it appears guess what's happened is as we know Russia is not exactly a democratic environments only one person makes the decisions on account of What Becomes of these whales whereas there was some PR stunts to say hey we're going to we want to do this or mitigate the global outrage the captors have propagandize this entire effort to free these whales as a means for the West to undermine the rushes Russia's economy so the whale trade economy here's where Marineland comes into play in Athena Theory at this point but it has these very intense implications what we know but what Marineland is doing currently in their transition from least successful business to virtually decimated thank you is there shipping there whales out we know two are going out if it's not this week it'll be very soon I'll be shocked if they're not out I'm in La so I can't say that's happening right now I think it may be very well be happening this week they're going to Spain we know that five other permits have been requested to send these animals now to the states so was it they're liquidating their the intent. what the issue is if in fact Russia catches wind that Marineland sending their whales the let's use the worst case scenario to China invalidates the Russian captors propaganda and concern suddenly what were concerns going to happen is those animals suddenly Putin says forget it sell them ship them out that's that's a scenario but why would you do that because they can do the captains of propagandized the West wants to Cripple the Russia's economy there there wild whale sale economy so it's Marineland selling Wales to China from Canada than some of the captains have a point they'll say to Putin look they're they're selling Wales why is it such an outrage that Russia is doing it when Reliance doing it so there's that concern the other one and this just came up within the last twenty hours is it appears rather than go the most responsible route which we know is going to be a costly Endeavor but game and we're ready is there now considering just dropping the Nets and saying see you later and letting all the animals go here's what we suspect they're going to let the orcas go because they were captured illegally there's some gray area as to whether the beluga whales have been captured illegally or not so I think it'll probably start with the artists rather than move them to where they were at the same time of year when they were captured so that they can be next to their other Trends transient pause or they're there their they're pods they just want to drop this the snaps as she later response was I can get but that's crazy it's like making someone a slave for how many years or somewhere on the planet but imagine there hope you can imagine would be OC it didn't work on Jesus there's a lot of there's a big issue we're on it there's a there's a great team would it be accurate to say that maybe what these groups are doing right now is recognizing that there's probably going to be some radical changes in the way these things are permitted what's legal it's not legal and what people are tolerating is just not the same as it was 10 years ago catching up selling as fast as you can. I just get out while you can because it might come a point in time with not only could they not sell it but they might be responsible for doing exactly what you said and bring it back to the area where it's family be it did what you would be an incredible cars Incredible cost would be an undertaking unlike any other rescue that we know of and how much would something like that cost I can't even imagine I mean I would be the wrong person to ask I can't put a figure on it I just know that it would take a lot of time it'll be a lot of dedicated I mean we would need to figure it out freaking them out it's a whole thing but it's possible I mean that's the important part Rockman it's just one of those things that I really think his people were going to look back on and we're going to go man how did we in 2019 not know that that was insane cuz that is not a chicken and I'm saying when it's not like something you could just keep in a cage that's that it for well over four and a half years 5 years now I've been advocating for bill s-203 which is a band against I was just a national at kinnick Adelaide ban against the whale and dolphin a porpoise captivity so that would include no more breeding no more import or export any of that okay during these by the way is going down as the longest bill ever researched in Canadian history because it's been a lot of issues from opposition a11 Center in particular in fact if I can have a moment to just give Senator Don plett a big ol I win you piece of which camera do I look at 4 that I win you piece of s*** so I should be more humble but was that the other guy the lawyer on the inside the senator that has every possible Block in front of the passage of this bill he's tried to kill it silently for I mean this is an epic epic story we've had to as activist and the community-at-large and again I have to stress how much you had a hand in this is the server point of crashing it on a on a couple of instances where they were going to kill the builders silently through ass or procedure he's got his role is a senate whip so he's the actual yield a lot of influence and power he he creates the Committees were people do the studies everything he sets the the the dates for the committee's coming he had this thing study for like 17 straight month it was absurd longest tenure in the in Canadian legislative history of it appears but this guy was doing his is do you think that what do you think like why was he doing that he's one of these guys who looked at this bill and he sees it as a activist or the left-wing libertarian a liberal sort of fluffed Bill he doesn't see that it's necessary he went to Marineland as an invited guest he's very publicly declared his friendships for John holder I don't want to speculate as to whether there's been any money exchanges Brando he's certainly very interested in killing this bill and by virtue alone of activist pressuring and exposing all of his as efforts we actually save this built on a number of occasions the most notable of which was just a few weeks ago where in the House of Commons it appeared this bill is going to die and literally at the eleventh hour I packed up we drove to Ottawa I had a tweetstorm set up we put pressure on I tweeted individual senators are rather individual members of Parliament and I promised them and they know this is a sensitive time in Canadian politics for a Justin Trudeau leader of the liberal party as I promised them if this bill died on account of the fact that what was happening with the Liberals were going to propose amendments to the bill class II that would send it back to the senate for further review at which point we know Don plett was waiting in line to kill it there was nothing we could do at this point this was going to be his to kill the fact that this was being facilitated by show my ass down there I got them a student from Every Which one of them and I look them all in the eyes I'm just like I'm going to make you famous I'm going to make you famous and I'm going to make you famous how to make you famous and I don't want to speculate if that's what if that's what saved the day although it was mentioned in the House of Commons that special interest pressured them at the last second but in a in a lather illegal can you say that to someone going to make you famous I think it's it's like a scene from like the percent what is it was the cowboy movie with Val Kilmer played Doc Holliday member Tombstone yeah you know those cute guys in the it was in the 80s or 90s play did a western movie together gun it's from that will make you famous somewhere I think it's from that of the cowboy movies right is it the campiest today Alicia literally right before the meeting starts the entire committee stand up and leave the room where I work with are we prepared for this to die I'm there for a funeral they come back in the conservative members of the committee proposed are amendments the Liberals which outweigh the the conservatives are voting so they're just not going to propose I'd like to withdraw my Amendment no longer record sits down okay we'll go remember to I'd like to withdraw my Amendment sits down number three like to withdraw my men were like holyshit I'm looking back and I've got some we've got some people there that with the same interests as me and I don't even know exactly what's going on at this point I just know that their faces are indicative that we might win this thing and the 4th cyberpunk stand-up he withdraws the amendment and we save this thing in the last second and I absolutely know it was a pressure campaign because like I said I was going to come on this podcast already had this date written for some time and this was going to have political implications that I don't know that the Liberal Party could have sustained it's a really bad time I think this came from the top down where it came from the bottom up this came from the top down you're not killing that though I think people are understanding what dolphin captivity really it's what Orca captivity really is I think they're understanding that now I think it's just one of those things that exists because it's always existed but if it didn't exist now there's no f****** way anybody would ever let you do it if if there was no captive dolphins in orcas if someone just went around and kidnapped them with what scientists know now about their social structure and their Community do they're so complex the way they took that f****** dialects right it's their dialects orcas I have they have they share languages in different regions and actually have a different accent of sorts I mean it's so it's really remarkable stuff yeah right it would be a global outrage if today is day one that someone said hey and look at the same as put this in this box already Legacy businesses that have been around for a long time that look this is not good going so well if you can you can see it in all the advertising these days SeaWorld almost rarely shows any orcas in their commercials although it seems the industry is so switching to baby walruses in fact there their they're the new orcas they're sort of the new brand of a cute guy really is happening all over top of Vancouver Aquarium is running with it yeah and it's a nasty world if you go to their Twitter it's you know I can't say that present it's it's like literally the case today but yeah a lot of baby walrus stuff is work going it's just they know that they can run with that at least for the time being crazy and all of this is here this bill is passing that we know it's going to pass it says I should be bitching get Royal assent come second week of June shy of some some catastrophe this thing will become law that's why Marineland is trying to get rid of these whales as quickly as they can get him out of here at least now they can just about Salt Lake tattoo to export permits have been approved to their to beluga whales are going to Spain being facilitated through the Vancouver Aquarium this becomes an ugly mess here because these associations okay and Industry voices these places facilitate animal transfers one up to other member facilities it's really just a club and this club protects the interests of these parts and keeps any type of oversight locked Lobby groups basically threw the Vancouver Aquarium Marineland to Spain but they're claiming them to be Vancouver Aquarium whales which is not true they were never on these on inventory oh brother this facilities inventory list there's never been any knowledge of any of this but what happened is because Vancouver Aquarium is accredited and has an affiliation with the A's are they sold in Canada we call it Casa the Canadian Association of zoos and aquarium and Marina is in fact not they no longer have their accreditation they did they didn't have the best of relationships shortly after all of our Revelations it's all just right now it's just the industry as a whole is breaking all of its own rules to facilitate getting beluga whale has 51 of them okay there's five born every year but they always have 51 and they don't they haven't shipped in order to vote in nearly a decade at this point I mean you do the math that what's going on exactly so they're dying they always have 51 they don't ship them anywhere else I can attest that yes when I was there and in my experience you don't have to watch my words because I know Maryland's lawyer Andrew Burns is listening hi Andrew I'll see you next week in my experience as many animals are born you're just about losing his money so you lose two old ones you lose three young ones not all the ones that are boring to be successful just to a half are so so what's happening with the industry want that bloodline is 51 captive orcas. Might still be the case with Canada so actually the public might actually be consulted about the import of these five Beluga set reminder seeking permit for it to export so that's something that certainly is activist level I'll be I'll be helping to guide towards the proper resolution but it is a race right now to get rid of Marineland animals and inside the doors in the fences it's time for me to be on the outside because I've never outside because I've never in the last six and a half years of litigation because of my advocacy and being sort of it basically being engaged in war with Marineland I've never seen them work harder to suppress me into try to silence me that they are now</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and I wrote a piece of long time ago on my blog and I talked about it in one of my comedy specials that I had a crazy experience with dolphins once when I was really really high and I had this that means it sounds silly to even talk about but I almost feel like I I kind of understood that they are like us but they just don't alter their environment is like when they were playing with us when they were jumping by the bow and it was looking at you they're looking at you while they were jumping around with the boat and I was like they're playing and they're looking at you like a person would like a water per interacting they're almost a language at this point there's some level of bridge Gap in the location when you get to see that they're expressing themselves in interest in you and what not Inn and scoping you when you get really close and and establish a relationship with these animals that something stuck in real squirrelly because you start to find that happy medium language and now all the sudden you are starting to sort of speak so to say why I started getting really weird feelings about SeaWorld and then an animal captivity why do we need that in this day and age but this isn't the Dark Ages we shouldn't be putting whales and orcas and dolphins putting them in these tanks these f****** Water swimming pools swimming pools any of these things that are probably as smart as us and some different way we're so prejudiced in that we only think of intelligence is something that can manipulate its environment that's our problem like we like look at them there b**** ass World there any houses they can't write a letter they they're f****** stupid man stop it they're stupid but Dolphins apparently have a cerebal cortex is someone something around 40% larger than a human beings have super-complex languages their emotional intelligence has Siri and it appears that it's far beyond anything we ourselves can understand the same as orcas they've got that they've got another part of the brain in the front which is their its function in that the front of the cerebral cortex function is to expert communication and foreign for it and it didn't answer their emotional capacity to a point where we don't really know the depth of which they are of the power of their motion but we know that they stay with their families for their lifetimes the mail bore from from the mothers will rarely leave the mother's side quite literally the distance of an orca itself the only time that mail will go on is when it's matured it will go to procreate and then back to the mother and it will live its entire life is such a sad fact about that is in my experience working with male orcas from one of which cut from the wild a big bull Orca is he's a mama's boy you can see something was missing he was traumatized from something and of course even myself regarded whale expert in the capacity of working at a freaking place like Marineland even I would have never known this information when I start this is not information that was available to us back and I started 2008 makes sense now this animal traumatized from birth he's his will to live is just gone it's the mail it appears to me and in my experience the male sex of a well I've worked deals at work with sea lions at work with the walruses dolphins belugas and orcas all of them die younger the males die younger and I think I'll definitely work isn't it in the Dolphins cases is they just don't have that will to live without that strong maternal figure in their life disorder try to explain to people but don't see it and I think that the Dolphins get treated well with orcas get treated well this is what imagine if someone stole your son and put him in an air box at the bottom of the ocean and dolphins and whales and Fishes came by and stared at him imagine and he lives his life like that with no contact other than with his his dolphin handlers or whoever's taking care of him and he just lives in this box missing his family missing his loved ones missing his life infused lost and with with a language that is especially with orca dolphins have a language it's so complex we haven't been able to really decipher it we don't understand how it works it'll John Lilly spent date they spent I think decades working on trying to get dolphin to speak human noises had a bunch of studies that he did and he even had a crazy story of the woman who lived with the dolphin she should try to establish a relationship with the dolphin we're sheet they made an apartment half underwater but the dolphin always wanted a fuk so she just jerk the dolphin off and when she took the dogs out that was going to come to town and then she could do our work so for her it was just like a technicality I just got to church this dolphin off it's a in the animal it wants to be rubbed all the moral stuff it's attached that is all in my own head she's like I'm just going to be a scientist and they were like, get that Dolphins but I do know that they did some experiments with LSD and that John Lilly who was one of my personal Heroes he's the creator of the flotation tank this is all John Lilly stuff he was a Pioneer in interspecies communication who take acid and think that he was communicating with dolphins did you know you're on the cover of one of his books yes your face is I mean it's it's a spitting image on in one of his books I have to look this up Google travel s*** dude it's in there you are. I'm sorry I was at home with you here. Man that's weird I can't read that I didn't read that one really interesting is the one that also has diagrams on how to the tank who try to get people to build tanks he was like listen man I found some s*** out you got to try this the last time I was here the last time two times ago you actually sent me to crash and crash I have to crash the float lab scientist behind float lab that's why those things are so well engineered when I met him I was like what was like before that when I first got a tank in my 2002 somewhere around in 2002-2003 and it was it was great but it was like it would break things will go wrong it flooded my basement it was like those disasters wasn't and then my friend who was a tank mission is actually tank technicians he said listen. To get check out the sky in Venice so some mad scientist down there in Venice was just making me super over-engineered float tanks and because they look like walking meat lockers right now he's always good for him Elwes enhanced experience. He's always trying to make it better he's the front of the line and when I first started working with him like when I first start having on the podcast and and I hired him to build me a tank and I'll let you know like there was no tanks it was it was real rare that you'd find tank centers now they're f****** everywhere man they're everywhere I say this the experience I had in his tank was hands down a different really isolates you there with at least this was like a pod that they bought and installed in a room is super insulated so there's no f****** noise getting in that thing to her the whole backstage to arouse Outback to check it should I was like he was he's making this super high-end crazy f****** double-wall insulated tanks he get in there it's just something to think about and crazy f****** double-wall insulated tanks he get in there it's just think about the subject</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Mesa means as much to us as anybody but except for you well it's nice to see it this is my this is my happy place is my safe place for people don't know what this is all about I'll give everybody the backstory Phil used to work at Marineland is an orca trainer and he also trained walrus name smoochy-smoochy is still allegedly in captivity Marineland all those no photographic evidence but you pretty sure she still there I was told that she is still there and she's in good shape and I'm hanging on to that since you came on the podcast the first time which was how many years ago living this lawsuit life for 6 years trapped in a lawsuit with a gigantic Corporation with Incredible amounts of money that's been trying to crush him and they've made up stuff will tell me what's what's happened if you give give me your your perspective on how it all went back in 2012 I made I was forced to make a very difficult decision elected to speak out against the conditions of which Marineland animals were living in I did so knowing the risks knowing that Marine I was a litigious company but I did so on account of the fact that the animals were suffering incredibly before quitting I had an agreement with Marineland that look I'm leaving this is long before I spoke out that's poking out I'm leaving but yeah we have to establish that I can maintain this relationship with the walrus because I imprinted on her it's important stress that that she thinks I'm her mom if she was a baby she was a baby when she came in so she was wild caught imagine probably witnessed her mother get slaughtered that's the that's the method of collecting babies by the by the captors in Russia and so she comes in traumatic at the age of we estimate about 18 months of age which is pretty old in fact in our experience Fremont experience of acquiring these wild-caught baby walruses sort of traumatic experience with her that I was there with her this anomalous thing happened where her bra circuitry opened up and much like in the wild where in the case of herd animals the babies become familiar with the mothers sound Sans look everything all the senses are acute they're they're aware of who they where they are so that they can find each other and it's these thousands of animals will this happen to her so the brain circuitry opens suddenly I'm imprinted on her I wasn't prepared to leave Marineland unless it was of the understanding that I can continue to help her because historically my relationship with her you had everything to do with her health and well-being I quit with the understanding with Marineland this was to be the case I've been gone for a month I come back unannounced they don't want to let me in there hiding something I get in I see her she's in terrible shape I snap a few photos I leave now emits this week dry she hadn't eaten in my haven't been gone a month was the longest you've ever actually been physically part I've been trying to wean my presents off of her so that other trainers could be able to maintain a healthy healthy diet for healthy light allows but he was emaciated because she wasn't eating cuz I wasn't there for that month I can't say but you certainly not eating she's super skinny they had her on a bunch of drugs which includes psychotics Valium antidepressant when I saw her my jaw hit the floor it's important to note that during this some newspapers have been calling they wanted to know why I quit if we back up a little bit it should be noted that in 2007 my relationship with music or took off in the early sort of Internet viral days and whatnot we made front page of like a CNN and Jimmy Kimmel did a piece and so there was some of that backstory of the then I guess you would call it the fluff celebrity type thing but question I started feeling calls from this newspaper who's looking who's keen on doing an investigation of Marineland so I wasn't going to participate I had no interest again stressing Marineland litigious history and also look I've got this relationship with a walrus that I have to keep this relationship with Marineland healthy enough so once I realized I'm a first-time Mom it should be stressed so I basically called the newspapers my said you put my face my name doesn't matter just print it let's go let's get the story out story gets out well Marineland as expected start their lawsuits they'd it's like a it's almost like a scorched-earth they take a scorched-earth method in this was when the original owner was alive yes he is no longer alive he died in June in fact so years into this litigation so they sued me they sue me for a million five-issue my girlfriend they suit other activists they should newspapers they they're suing everybody mistake they made is in all of their absurd allegations that they've yet six and a half years into into litigation yet to prove any of it they cannot it's never going to happen it doesn't exist at the just lawsuit it's full of lies and b******* bottom lines the mistake they made as they stood me for plotting to steal Sushi that's where the headlines takeoff and they also called me the Kanye West of animal training you said they called you the Tweet was I said Joe. You just say when I book a flight to come to La I sent you the link to the to the store the headline was Kanye West of animal training being sued for plasma Stillwater you wrote they called you the what and then you live in the DM's and said that lasted you just say when</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so will you pissed off when the Lucy Kay recording got released in comics word announcing it f***** up and funny and funny because it's f***** up because you're not supposed to say it which is the exact thing he's done his whole career right and then ruin the material can he drop the bit cuz it's kind of like too much but hilarious line if you want people to forget about you jerking off make jokes about kids getting shot I put it on CBS so now they're hearing it before that there was just a hundred 80 people in Long Island hearing it and it was supposed to be as if you like comedy you can't release people s*** like that because you're never going to get good comedy because everyone's going to like every time Dave Chappelle do you know workouts at or anybody you're going to get these half cook bits and then you get a release them and ruin it for you it's going to ruin it for for the people that listen it's like for the people that are in the room that's for them if you're taken and there's been a lot of talk about Louis making this copyright thing saying that you know that they will take legal action if you print or you do anything to record or do anything to put the material online right and someone saying he can't do that like will buy candy do that the difference between that and music like if you go to hear someone sing a song and you the lyrics to all my God Gary Clark jr. has this amazing new song Here's the lyrics that doesn't ruin the song but if you say he's got this hilarious joke in the The Twist is he says this will you just f***** that bit up for everyone that's ever going to listen to read that yeah it's it's frustrating do you not know what a workout said is do you understand this guy was out of Comedy for almost a year do you know that this guy was doing a f****** hour after being out of commie for almost a year f*** you stop pretending that what you do is different stop about a mass shooting more about pulling your dick out in front of someone or about anything along those lines publicly shiting on Comics unfinished bits Comedy Central on Netflix quite a while I like to do a bit at least 3 months before it's somewhere figured out in the comics should people hate it's like worst case scenario like he block the door then block any doors do you know and they're laughing at people joking around like it became this traumatic thing years later talk about it after the fact but then on top of that it's like God do you think the guy has suffered enough like when when is he suffering enough UEC is lack of empathy with people where they don't even want to respect as a human being they don't they don't want to appreciate any of his old they don't want that they don't have anything that he could do that would make them just go all right well I know you're not going to do that again and you seem like a reasonable person's like we like you can't be your past you're not the guy was sitting at Sneaker write your Joe list today yeah wants to be remembered for the worst thing they did it's it's I think it's just a thing where they know it's an easy target I really do I think of a certain point in time people just decide that this is a guy you can take a free shot at and you can sit on them and you going to trivia things to him that aren't true you contribute tribute a bunch of things to him that are not accurate and it's easy like the like calling him all right or saying Lucy Kay showing his true colors now Jesus Christ Delon in x amount of time he would have crafted that into a great bit I'm sure of it yeah I agree that came out and we're talking trash about it I was like you guys should shut the f****** because this this whole art form is about trial and error this whole art form is about being with which one of the rare things that we need a crowd to in order to for these things to come alive take chances I just thought ironically with Louis I went we went and saw Apocalypse Now during the Tribeca film festival and Francis Ford Coppola was there he came out he spoke about the film beforehand and after and that Robert Duvall was also there and it came out and wait Charlie don't surf or put everything on the line to make the movie himself maybe this time but you have to take chances with our he's like there's no art without taking big chances and doing a joke put it out the public it's not for those with some people that bought the tickets but it's also in context of the experience of being in a comedy club having a couple drinks and watching a hilarious guy talk some s*** especially a guy coming back after a national Scandal that worldwide worldwide Scandal about them getting shot either but one of the things that made that bit work was that yes it was a horrible tragedy yes those kids went through that yesterday teenagers they're trying to figure out life and they're being interviewed on CNN and some of them were changing their opinions and they're developing growing as we speak but one of them broke f*** the patriarchy on his Twitter the other day like that was his tweet like in and not even as a joke like that's an 18 year old that's what kids do well you have to hear from them because their friends got shot me but you do know one obviously like that's not this is not a conversation this is stand-up comedy in art form and saying things that are funny that are f***** up that's part of the artform If you deny that he's either you that's not the kind of Comedy you like or you don't appreciate what comedy is might actually f****** do something I mean it's like they're making changes and I'm like power to the people God bless you but I can still laugh at a joke about it's still funny to me to see someone be like why are you and you can both things can exist you can have empathy for murder victims and even be like and here's the other thing like I don't think so I got to see him when you're in town if you can he's f****** hilarious he's a legitimate Mania Legend in Los Angeles for he was already there and really f****** funny but he pushed her car into the river or something bad kids because I heard they sat that close to the TV that ever put away that blocks it was spilling a f****** milk those those kids will not be missed normal thinks you talking about coming in your own face or someone is often cited or quoted as if it's a statement you know like he set this like on stage in a comedy club as a part of a big giant chunk about this and you take me out of context you doing in the worst possible way you put it in print of course it looks terrible it's like that has no relationship to the actual bill itself you're at the print version of it it's not it's at allies you go to jail for saying that's the joke you're a liar you're a liar you're defaming someone you're taking what they're doing and you ending the what they were saying is what they mean you know that's not what they mean that's like are rubber that in the movie Act we know it's a horrible tragedy that's why jokes work and they don't they don't work because you're mean didn't work because you're horrible at work because everyone knows you're joking if everybody really thought you were horrible person and you were happy that people get shot they wouldn't laugh at God damn thing you said right that's it's a it's a f****** weird art form so weird art form and for it to be dismantled and disrespected the way it is where people are with people break down people's bits and take them out of context like that it's it's so foolish and the fact that people don't stand up for it in the art form itself that drives me f****** crazy told me I was a bunch of people don't even talk to me more like I'm not talking to you anymore like this what you going to do if I do a bit the top cooked and in the UN talked about me right you're doing this for your own favor you're not doing this for the artform you're not doing you're not an empathetic person you're looking at him as a human being clear the guy f***** up he made some mistakes if you listen to that set that's a good set of Comedy for almost a year and then have to figure out whether or not they're willing to take a chance and put it on put it on YouTube as website yes I hope he does that you know I mean this is how I do that he should be punished for eternity so I can see what we Catholics like what's going on here but what is this you know what did he do I mean he did something that caused a lot of Crossing on 35 million dollars a massive public shame still to this day more than it was almost like 2 years later was like a year-and-a-half now 2017 senior in this idea that you're you know do you know I'm supposed to compare offenders you know that you're not supposed to make judgment calls off course you are that's why some people go to jail for life and some people go to jail for 2 years and this is the reason why we have lesser punishment for good for you thing to do but you're not Bill Cosby okay it did to say that you're not supposed to make these comparisons and like this is a load of subjective right we were talking about this and I see you're nervous I'm terrified long you think it's going to be before people just let go actually the group that are really upset about it I think it's probably like a quarter of a million people that's a lot of people it's a lot like 300 million people in the country but I mean the shows I mean on Twitter and stuff hang out and I'll just search his name to see that we went out to eat in New York and there was a kid hip streaky look similar to me 02 signaling attention NYU students does all caps Louis CK is in the neighborhood make him uncomfortable! We are like that's like psychotic but that's what I was talking about earlier that I think he's at Target and I think they just decided this is what they're going to do now in a real-world scenario you have an opportunity to say something if you really feel so compelled the guys right in front of you you don't say s*** and then you get online and tell other people to do it right other people to make them uncomfortable but for the most part yeah well we'll go around and it is to everything is different in person cuz you realized I like that nobody how many people get dirty looks and stuff here and there was just way more online then the not online but the shows are all selling out and there's a few people outside to be this evil person they should be protesting against but I think if you look at it on paper what he did was just not good it's like it's it's you know the worst that I had heard was at some people's careers it suffered because they were talking about it. Someone but I don't know how much of that is accurate I don't need to find out about that begrudge the women I think that two different people can have the same experience and take different things from it feel different ways and I understand sexuality is weird so like they could in the moment his perception my people they said yes and I think he kind of talked about this a little bit unsteady tell his we felt Sucka and pressure two people can have the same experience and have different perspectives so I don't hurt and feel mistreated maybe that's his thing probably gotten if she had blue eyes and maybe have to like push I would hate if you jerked off running yeah you can still see but they canceled the new one that he was going to do it to ya so it was a yes if he went out and talked about it extensively like I had a conversation about like they may be videotaped it or something and I don't know like if people had his take on it other than that little letter that he wrote right after it happened yeah maybe that would help yeah but that was a good apology a good statement I thought some people will never be happy and some people were happy with it in some people just felt like it wasn't enough that you know he didn't specifically say I am sorry you know I feel horrible I'm sorry I did this he basically said he did it and those stories are true and that he f***** up and he thought that they you know he talked about them saying yes that that was okay but meanwhile he took advantage of the fact they admired him and he's very empathetic and this is what I really got very angry about with the the leak of the recording my cat's name is best material from other comedians like do you how do you do this but if those friends feel awesome friends better off if you lost friends cuz of that like if that was re I would call him up like if there's a New York Times article about re jerking off front of people I'd be like bro I'm a little hurt never turns out in front of me butcher out there murdering kids or something for that like come on man what did you think it was a perfect person some Maniac where you can come up with these crazy as these guys who you know are Freaks and they're out of their f****** mind off stage but onstage they have like sort of a more squeaky-clean thing in there public thing is more squeaky clean and their judgmental about it like oh my God like please stop you're f****** crazy as anybody right have a good squeaky clean act so shut your hole anything in there public saying is more squeaky clean and they're judgmental about it like oh my God like please stop your f****** crazy is anybody have a good squeaky clean act so shut your hole wildest animals</div>

That is gross what is the impact those programs are having on the cities that send and the city that received them and what happens to these homeless people at the recent destination for the best example of that was that wild wild country documentary College it was like that yeah I was watching like a half hour and I was like I kind of him into this religion which one going clear HBO because obviously like way more in the depth about how crazy l.ron Hubbard was and what he essentially did and how he started this whole thing and he was self analyzing it was trying to heal himself because he was f****** crazy and along the way got really into psychology and self-help books then what was quoted saying if you want to make real money you start of religion and then start a religion yeah not wrong I saw the whole Graphics cuz we can at least crazy what is that burst is that burst from Southern California is San Francisco Texas doesn't give a f*** doesn't shoot you still shoot you have a hole for homeless people out in the desert why not like Wyoming they don't have enough people up there anyway to live up there they're just not interested in taking in your homeless you know when you bleed by time you get to be a certain age I guess you just have to accept the fact that this is just life this is the life you know yeah hard to live up there they're just not interested in taking in your homeless you know when you wake by time you get to be a certain age in your homeless I guess you just have to accept the fact that this is just life this is the life you know it seems unpleasant.</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> excellent actually you are working with me tonight at the Hollywood improv I appreciate it I'm excited hanging out with the people by the beach when it was night was down the airport my wife is here and I see what's going on in Manhattan Beach for lunch and we're enjoying ourselves so we got a hotel and made love and walked on the pillow you made love from all different time periods ancient toaster from like the 50s with all the patina on it and then you had modern toasters but I think he was trying too hard you know there's some dudes just wear bowling shoes and she said they just try too hard to be whacking what wasn't it was one of them squirrely deals or she was like so I'm so not interested in him I just want to go to this party for networking I was a young lad I just moved to Hollywood have did not know the ways of this goofy f****** town yet I hadn't had an exercise myself from Hollywood and protect me know before I was still doing the thing acting going on auditions and s*** so so I could that you when you first get here cuz everybody's trying to get a development deal everybody was trying to get a sitcom and it kind of like let you think that that was the only way right it's not something I'd be interested in doing but if you could do a sitcom with all stand up that would be the s*** that would be the s*** like a view you could do a sitcom with really good writers who were cool and all the people on the show or stand-ups that would be f****** monstrous yet not usually like that. get people in trouble they say things get people angry or someone calls up human resources and Joe list was talking about his deck yeah the crap service lady heard it and now there's a lawsuit I think with podcast now most of us comedians with podcasts have no chance of getting any corporate jobs that Comics fall into that are good writers they did get the sitcom writing gigs and it's a sweet gig you get paid thousands of dollars a week you build your bills are covered so you feel good right you're never going on the road you're you're in town all the time you just doing sets around town so you're pretending that you're still a comic right but you're really a sitcom writer who kind of like has a hobby and you never develop on the road and there's a bunch of guys you know Owen Smith I don't know walk-in hilarious one of the best comics in the world and he's just been spending so many years doing the sitcoms like I saw him one night at the, so I'm like how the f*** is this guy not gigantic like how did you not have a Netflix hour that everyone's talking about how is everybody not trying to book him places and just cuz he's been doing this this sitcom writer thing play the writing on a TV show but he's happy he likes got two kids that keeps them off the road but to me it's a bummer that, defax unlike I want to see the new hour but he still a little bit other than stand that can stand if I can write all day and then go do it that night or the writing like a movie or TV show I'm going to get paid to inspire to write it feels wasteful but I could be riding right jokes I do on stage you just get into that sort of thing where you just like what am I doing here and then it steals your thunder I feel that way all the time unrelated</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> unlike China the United States has at least in perception a cleared differentiation between business and government and with one of the concerns that I don't want to talk to experts in China and their electronics and their their technological innovation is at their inexorably connected to the government reform and that is one of the main reasons that makes him credit difficult to compete with them on a global Marketplace when you see the state department has told people to stop using Huawei devices cuz Huawei which is the number to provider of cell phones in this world now they're connected the Chinese government like how do you take that what what do you do about that situation and how can chat between private-sector and government here in particular with the competition what would it comes to data we were very concerned about people sharing data we've we've done it ourselves we spy don't we proven through the Edward Snowden case of our government's doing as well to us where were the Chinese are doing it to us when we're saying don't buy Chinese stuff they're going to steal your data and steal your information still your your business Secrets what can you do to stop that what can you do to mitigate what's already happened ultimately you can't stop every single individual with what they're purchasing I think that you know you can relate what is sold here in the United States I think there's a role that government can play especially as we were talking about artificial intelligence and that kind of Technology again first and understanding it and then playing being that responsible party to make sure that what is being developed is not something that's going to result in these unintended negative consequences so obviously our government isn't you know doesn't have ownership over private business in this country but we still do have sensible regulations and responsibly the government has to play in regulating what businesses can and can't do what's interesting to me is this competition aspect between dealing with essentially just the private sector here in America versus the private sector in China That's combined inexorably with the military and that they have much more in once over what gets done and how things get done what did you pay attention at all to the state Department's call for a boycott of Huawei products what did you think about that I understood it you know I think there is a concern about that technology being being used to to get our information you know so that that can be enforced within the federal government right so the state department is saying hey the federal government is not going to purchase any Huawei produce products for cell phones whatever the technology is and encourage other people in the private sector to to do the same what people are worried about over here is that what they're trying to do is stifle the development of this gigantic company and that what they're trying Huawei yeah of Warwick is Huawei went from having a tiny share of the marketplace about 5 years ago to being the number to cell phone provider in the world next to Samsung they just surpassed Apple this is a Chinese company and that because of Chinese companies connected to the Chinese government the worry is that they're making ungodly sums of money and it's enhancing the Chinese government's ability to perform surveillance or just to just compete now just financially compete on a global scale and Tech nerds seem to be siding with Huawei which is interesting to me I read a lot of tech blogs and people that are experts and they say that there's no evidence that these cell phones have anything in them doing anything but that there has been some evidence of network devices and it's somebody's network devices do have some sort of a third-party input or in the building to have some ability to extract information that shouldn't be there that's interesting situation where you're competing with a country that also controls these companies that are the biggest cell phone and electronics providers on the planet diplomacy with China like what we can see what's happening right now with Trump it's it's not working very well you know this trade war that that frankly President Trump is escalating I think is really really dangerous it's having a negative impact on domestic producers manufacturers Farmers a friend of mine is a small business owner and he saw the news this morning about China retaliating with Trump's escalation I think with with another increase there tariffs and how he's thinking like my gosh that's going to impact my small business I got I don't know probably less than 15 employees and trying to figure out how it's going to impact the pricing and production manufacturing and everything every step of the way what's so dangerous about what Trump is doing with this trade war that he is that he's escalating is that these trade and economic Wars can very easily turn into a hot war and were talking about a new clue armed country in China so while there are trade differences and issues that we've got to address with China and issues with intellectual property and other things the way that Trump is going about this I believe is very irresponsible and dangerous creating a huge amount of uncertainty for American businesses while increasing tensions with one of the biggest nuclear powers in the world the ramifications could lead to a nuclear war this trade War could lead to something military yes yes what is Trump's argument is his argument essentially is that China has been treating us unfairly and that the rates at we're getting there are there they're not they're not even that trade imbalance with China is is a real issue why does the trade imbalance exists trade policy on the is anyone single incident that has that has created that imbalance and that you know I'm in Iowa a lot these days and a lot of farmers have been struggling with that and would like to see it fixed a lot in the Tech Community would like to see these issues fix especially related to intellectual property but the way in which Trump is doing it is having a very negative effect on these American businesses and jobs that Trump is supposedly advocating for both in really in the uncertainty that that is being set where you know it looks like they're on the brink of a deal just the other day it looks like hey okay the United States and China they've been working through these issues they're on the brink of a deal and all of a sudden Trump sends out a tweet saying nope we're going to increase these tariffs from 10% to 25% and I'll China is left like okay I thought we were I thought we were close to working working things out and now left in a where they have no other recourse but to retaliate as they did this morning so you can see quickly how this thing is spiraling so out of control and increasing these tensions between our two countries not being done in a way that did that to me is strategic providing us with the certainty of that password to reach a specific objective of correcting this trade imbalance just how this whole thing began why would you make a sweet it is hard to explain doesn't make sense it doesn't actually serve us and our interests of our economic interest of meeting that objective I don't know if he thinks this is part of his masterful you no negotiation skills but it's it's got a very dangerous effect and and the fact that we have nuclear strategist in this country who remind us that we are at a greater risk of nuclear war now than ever before it's because of these kinds of things that are increasing tensions between United States and China other things that are increasing the tensions between the United States and Russia you know country that were we still have nuclear missiles pointed at each other that can be set off at a moment's notice literally leaving us as people with just minutes before a nuclear Holocaust a nuclear disaster nuclear war and you really think that this could be set off by these Financial negotiations and by Trump saying something like just changing his his offer in a tweet if you threaten the country's economy and their Economic Security where does that logically lead you threaten their ability to provide for their people you threaten their ability to provide that stable environment which China so much of what they do is just like a they they look for that stability what else what other recourse is there other than the threat of military force and this case when you're dealing with two nuclear-armed countries this is what's at risk and it's something you know it's hard for a lot of people to conceive of like okay my gosh nuclear war really I mean this is something that you know back during the the cold war with the the you know kids going under their desk these drills and and you know okay where do you go find a bunker but this is something that that's a reality that we're facing today and it's something that you know we in Hawaii in January of last went through with that missile alert that was a fake missile alert a nuclear weapons on his way missile inbound towards Hawaii seek immediate shelter this is not a drill that was the message that was blasted out to over a million phones all across our state on the radio scrolling across the television and people immediate like seek immediate shelter okay where do I go where do I take my kids where do I take my family at college kids renting across campus at the University of Hawaii trying to find Schultz that seek immediate shelter but the the stick Insanity of all of this is that they're there is no shelter there is no shelter nuclear bunkers really I mean and for four people in this Administration and politicians who are ratcheting up these tensions with these nuclear-armed countries bring us to this new Cold War they are not saying okay well because we're do we're going to invest not just trillions but hundreds of thousands of trillions of dollars to make sure that every single American in this country has a nuclear bunker within 10 minutes of their home or their place of work or their or their school because that's how much time we have that's what we would need in order to deal with the consequences of the decisions that they're making in the failed leadership that they're providing and so this is this is an issue that I'm raising awareness about because of what that r risk I mean this is this is the greatest threat that we face and it requires strong leadership to walk away from this brink of nuclear war to be able to to work with other countries based on cooperation rather than conflict deescalate these tensions work out our differences and and walk us back from walk us back from the brink stop this nuclear arms race that's making us in the world last day</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you were talking about Universal basic income earlier and you were saying it in regards to dealing with impoverished communities but one of the big issues that people think we're going to need Universal basic income for is automation platform we are in a situation where there was an article today about Amazon using bottom these I forget exactly how to describe it but essentially robots their packaging things and automation is going to start taking over many non skilled jobs and this is true with the travel industry with Trucking with moving thing shipping that we are going to see less and less of these unskilled jobs and we're going to see millions of people out of work and that Universal basic income may be the only way to bridge that gap between them finding it sort of Bible new source of income I mean if it's a strong argument we got to figure out how we pay for it and how it actually achieved that intended objective but also look at making that those kinds of investments in in how do you train a whole new Workforce and in what new areas so and you're taking people who are working and you know really tough tough Labor job you know these are all these stories about people are working at Amazon very long hours very stringent timelines and and so if they're now being replaced by automation or robots or whatever it is you know let's look at our economy and see how we can you know help train folks for for jobs that pay more money and and hopefully help offer a better quality of life and I think that's an overall when we look at this I didn't. that's the way that we should be addressing this is not just a job is a job is a job is a job but really looking at the quality of life of people in this country that a job does not equal happiness or fulfillment but really looking at you know parents who have a child and who want to be able to spend some time at home raising that child or you know someone who wants to start start a small business and work out of their home to be able to hang out with their kid or whatever the case may be I think as we look at this and how we make this transition in a positive way in this country that we've got to look at it from this comprehensive approach of the idea of these people that are working in these fulfillment centers being happy is pretty ridiculous backbreaking incredibly stressful positions where if you read the reports mineral how accurate their what the job is like but they literally run from one place to another their times and never breaks or time limits yeah part of the problem with the idea that companies are supposed to constantly make more and more money now cuz you get Ruth ruthlessly competitive people looking at the bottom line every single aspect of that business and one of the things that suffers is human human sacrifice satisfaction and their sacrifice has to be greater because they they have to find a way to justify their position in the company and so they get paid very little they work very hard and now they're going to replace window company like Amazon paying not only paying no taxes writing this is for the third year in a row and also getting I think this last year was over a hundred 25 million dollar tax credit that's on top of that is Jeff Bezos has how much the whole thing is ridiculous and it's what people who are lean socialist to when they talk about unchecked capitalism without any sort of Regulation that can stop something like that from happening and stop workers from being exploited in that Way Beyond just and people say hey you don't you don't have to have that job if you don't you know you don't want that job don't take it but no one should have to have a job how about that have time bathroom breaks and run from one place to another you should get paid a fuckload of money for that job that job should be something that it's it sucks all day long but dude I make $5,000 a week and people at what 8 hours a day which crazy I mean so that's why I think you know what is as an end this automation really changing our economy is something that I think we're behind the curve ball on because it's already happening but let's try to to see the opportunity in that wherever robots are going to start taking over those backbreaking jobs then then let's try to find you know new and innovative ways for people to work in to earn a living that's actually bringing value to them. Sounds awesome on paper yeah but how would one we've got to work out then and it's not I'm not saying the haters a government solution to this and snap your fingers and it's all done now that I mean this is government has a role and private-sector private business has a role and we've got a we've got to work together because this is all of our futures album imagined any potential any possibility any potential solution while I think there's pieces of it right I mean it's it's making sure that we close these these loopholes that tax loopholes that allow companies like Amazon to get away with paying no taxes and to get this much money back as a tax credit so complicated you know it has to do with the write-offs and how many years and depreciation and all of these different things that they planned for and they exploit in order to pay no taxes and to get money back in return Weasley it is and it's this crony capitalism that's really at the heart of this problem how do we how did they get that kind of sweet deal when you look at the tax code that's written me look at the tax bills that are passed who are the people who are helping influence and write those bills they're the big paid lobbyists that Amazon has in Washington or saying hey this is something that we want to see in there and working with lawmakers who their cozy with to get that legislation in there will this is one of the things that I have come out about Trump over the last week or two is that he lost a billion dollars over the course of x amount of years and that this is not really accurate but that this is how he set at framed his taxes the way he it turned out to be more than a billion dollars worth of losses over. Of something like a decade and you know people like what the hell is that tell you he was basically trying to say look this is something that I was telling you people about when I was running for president that the system is rigged I know because it was a part of the rig system and I pay these people off yeah it is rigged but how could you get in with a getting assassinated how do you get in and say hey all you billionaires that are making all this money you going to make less money now because of Tulsi president Tulsi is coming in as a new sheriff in town sheriff with an army of people in this country mobilizing saying this government was put in place to serve us to serve the people and as much money and I paid lobbyist as these guys have ultimately it is the people of this country who festivals and his olds ultimately the people in this country who have the power if we choose to use it if we choose to make sure that our voices are heard in that that is the way that we make this change so would you have to simplify the tax code would you have done anything heavily simplify the tax code and you know I'm working with my team we're doing our research to figure out exactly what that would look like but I think we do have to simplify the tax code because it is so many of these loopholes and massive corporate deductions that have brought us to the place where we are today where most folks are not getting any kind of meaningful deduction most folks certainly are not getting the kinds of tax breaks at these corporations are getting because it's these corporations are influencing our tax laws are written as written to benefit them the ultra-rich and the 1% and you know people who are working very hard every single day or are struggling they're still struggling just to get by what kind of dirty tricks do you think they will pull out against you if you try to fix the tax code and try to make corporations accountable and make sure that they have to pay if they're coming after you now and you just making waves and I don't underestimate the power of people that's what I tell them you know and they've been playing these dirty tricks for a long time there is more and more people I think in this country were paying attention and we're calling them out on it don't underestimate the power of the people you know what I think too I think it'd be better for them like Jeff Bezos you know you're f****** people over not paying taxes bro how is that because he has look he's figured out all of these holes in the tax system that he can benefit from to pay lower taxes when most people don't have that ability and as a business person who's also freely ethical you have to be perplexed looks like what do I do here do I just do the right thing and give give more money to charity now and balance it out or do I just take these Cuts where they are and let everybody know hey look how much money I paste broken the system is this is why I mean like ultimately what you're saying you know as business owners for their small business owners of these large corporations I mean look at is the large multinational corporations that are exploiting the system and exploiting the people and represent the worst of these crony capitalists policies and so when I talk about changing his culture of leadership at the top it's bringing these values of service above self this has to happen within our government but we as a society need to encourage ourselves bringing these values of service above self to our businesses to every sector of our community because just because you run a business and you make a profit doesn't mean that you can't be a servant leader and to think about hey how can I make a positive impact yes for my employees and for their families went on on Society on our community on our environment and I think for the people that are running these corporations would be there would be real value in appreciating the fact that we're all in this together and you probably if you're running a corporation you probably on death's door. Kids R kids who have kids is that if you force them to pay more taxes then there's going to be less jobs make katsu yeah but that's that seems like a ridiculous argument to me I said they want it's been there all along it's just you're used to it that's all it is you're used to these loopholes you're used to its you want to keep them there and if they take away those loopholes you going to punish other people cuz you don't want to be punished yourself financially that's what's really going on and you know and this is coming from memes a financial dummy I don't spend any time analyzing the financial situation this world used to its you want to keep them there and if they take away those loopholes you going to punish other people cuz you don't want to be punished yourself financially that's what's really going on and you know and this is coming from memes a financial dummy I don't spend any time analyzing the financial situation this world</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> last thing I want to ask you about was the opioid crisis yes and what are your thoughts on it this is an epidemic that is continuing to ravage the country and we are not doing enough our government is not doing enough right now to solve it and I buy .22 one very simple thing that could drastically help those who are dealing with opioid addiction and trying to walk down path towards recovery and that is ending the federal prohibition on marijuana there has been a correlation in states that have legalized either medical use or don't use of cannabis a direct correlation in a reduction of opioid addiction as well as opioid-related deaths this is one thing that Congress can do now to help make progress in dealing with this opioid epidemic another thing we've got to put a lot more resources towards treatment and on all of the things that need to happen after that detox that initial detox with folks who are dealing with opiate addiction and have lost everything in their lives then or at the place where okay will if they have gotten through that detox now they they've got no place to live they've got no place to work they've got no money and to be able to to provide that helping her end up as they start to put back the pieces of their life is something that we as a society need to do better at and the third thing I'll say is we've got to go after the culprits responsible for this and you look at companies like Purdue Pharma who have intentionally deceived and lied and cheated the American people into taking these opioids thing situation that we are in they are still not being held accountable in the way that they need to this this thing is the Sackler family has made tons of money off of selling these opioids that have ruined and devastated people's lives are legislation the opioid accountability act we introduced in the last Congress were going to be introducing again soon would provide our federal prosecutors with the tools they need to hold companies like Purdue Pharma and others responsible for proliferation of opioids criminally accountable and another thing that baffles me is this constant changing of the dosage is fentanyl a new thing that's even more powerful than fentanyl the fact that they're developing these incredibly potent opioid to FDA has approved like I don't understand why I don't understand why do you need them right what are they for their there they're toxic their fatal and Incredibly small doses Oxycontin codeine do we have all these pain medications like why are they insisting on letting these companies Patton these Superior and even more lethal versions of something we already have a problem with exactly right it makes no sense and I think it speaks to the huge influence the huge influence at these pharmaceutical companies have over regulators and lawmakers both so much of this comes back to money Joe do we have all these pain medication like why are they insisting on letting these companies Patton these Superior and even more lethal versions of something we already have a problem with exactly right it makes no sense and I think it speaks to the huge influence the huge influence at these pharmaceutical companies have over regulators and lawmakers both so much of this comes back to money Joe</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and when automation really kicks in the focus and you know however X many years when millions and millions of jobs go away we're going to be confronted with this new world and this is what a lot of people are very concerned with when they talk about the next couple of decades are very concerned with Automation and they're very concerned with oughterard artificial intelligence artificial intelligence and that it's not just going to take away skilled or unskilled labor but it's also going to take skilled there's going to be no one answering phones anymore it's all going to be computers they're very close to be able to do that right now where computer will have a legitimate conversation with you and you don't even know that you're talking to a computer to crazy crazy are you concerned with sentient artificial intelligence and in terms of its military applications in terms of theirs there's a lot of concerned that what we're experiencing now with this particular you wouldn't talk about Jama with drones with these piloted things that what you going to have is autonomous weapons in the future where you just going to be able to literally release Killer Robots I'm very concerned about artificial intelligence and how quickly this technology is evolving with very little oversight or even understanding at the highest levels of our government about both what the opportunities are that it presents and also the very real dangers of this technology being weaponized and how quickly that could spiral out of control what could we do to stop artificial intelligence from spiraling out of spiraling out of control in particular what could we do to stop autonomous weapons what a lot of people are really concerned with do you watch a show Black Mirror a great show on Netflix but it what is dystopian stories about the future and one of them called heavy metal and saw this woman being chased by these little intelligent robots are trying to kill her cuz this is something that could be implemented in the battlefield we could have if we don't do it first we could have a situation where our soldiers are in some sort of situation facing off against robot that sounds like a science fiction movie but it's not that far away from reality I think this is one of the things that have leaders in the global Community have to recognize that some some kind just just like with nuclear the nuclear arms race once you start on this race that mean there are no winners in it in a nuclear war everybody loses in that scenario and I think there's a similar approach that needs to be taken to the dangers of artificial intelligence being weaponized and coming together as a kind of a global Community to say hey this is something that ended could potentially if put in the wrong hands and danger all of us and find the best approach to deal with that because my concern is as we see with so many of these other weapon systems if it's just one country that's doing it then you have will my gosh if everyone else is weaponizing but we're the only ones who are doing the right thing then is that creating a situation where our national security is at risk for our troops are at setting it's one of those things that you know that this world is a small place and we would have a shared interest with leaders of other countries in the world to provide the right kinds of checks and balances on this technology so that it doesn't become something that's a danger to humanity and the real fear would be that someone would not think that at all you have to do would be whatever country figure out what the country has its own country black f*** you were going to do whatever we want country is it some country black f*** you were going to do whatever we want with you guys took over this world because of nuclear power we're going to take over this world because of autonomous weapons in artificial intelligence and we're going to design it to go kill Americans and I think that that's why it's important that we take that we take a global approach to this and because otherwise you end up with that scenario and where you just you know that this race begins and then there's no way to stop it and it's too late</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what is your take on Wikileaks and Julian Assange what happened with it with his arrest and all the stuff that just went down I think poses a great threat to our freedom of the press and to our freedom of speech we look at what happened under the previous administration under Obama you know they were trying to find ways to go after Assange and we But ultimately they chose not to seek to extradite him or charge him because they recognized what a slippery slope that begins when you have a government in a position to Levy criminal charges and consequences against someone who's publishing information or saying things that the government doesn't want you to say the government doesn't sharing information the government government doesn't want you to share and so the fact that the trumpet patient has chosen to ignore that fact to ignore how important it is that we have hold our freedoms freedom of the press and freedom of speech and go after him it has a very chilling effect on both journalists and Publishers and you can look to both those in the traditional media but also those in New Media and also on on every one of us as American it was it was kind of a warning call saying look what happened to this guy it could happen to you could have been any one of us was very transparent to cuz there's no real compelling crime for them to be going after him the way they are there's not one thing that stands out in the latest one is hacking and somewhat not even hacking at them. See you know charges it doesn't make any sense that they would spend that much time going after that guy for those charges now it's obvious and very transparent that there's another ulterior motive an ulterior motive is that he leaked a bunch of things were incredibly embarrassing and not only that but I think it was secretary Pompeo Secretary of State who said that they wanted to designate Wikileaks and assigned as a foreign intelligence agency so once you do that then you're talking about a whole different category so they're pushing out information once again that the government didn't want pushed out and if the government then says oh well now we're going to reclassify your the foreign intelligence agency then there's a whole different set of rules of engagement that apply there then you're no longer protected under you know the freedoms that we hold you the freedom of the press this is such a disgusting way of framing things like you know he's on a foreign intelligence agent he's he's a guy that got information and released it to the general public that the government wanted to keep private it's really that simple Edward Snowden was it similar situation similar situation I don't think I don't think we I remember the very day that I woke up in DC look at my phones are looking through the headlines and saw those headlines about how the NSA was mass surveilling all of us in collecting our phone records collecting our cell phone records and Verizon AT&amp;T T-Mobile and I was I was shocked so that was something that Snowden uncovered and released something that I don't know that even as members of Congress who would have been aware of so now that we were aware of it that hey we can take action to to close those loopholes to change those policies to protect our civil liberties to protect our fourth amendment constitutional rights as Americans but with the NSA going to disclose that information voluntarily on their own absolutely not and then we would have suspicions but then again there was a gentleman who is who left the NSA very early on a hill was that was his last name but he was one of the first ones to discuss this is post 911 they farted first started doing it but Snowden was the guy that really made it abundantly clear to everybody that not only are they doing that throws with mind about it and even Obama with Tahoe has collected data data do you not have reading messages you could do anything like this is just not an accurate assessment of what was going on now and it was outrageous now go and you had I think he was the director of the Department of National Intelligence at that time James Clapper who sat before a committee in the United States Senate and blatantly lied he was asked very directly are you collecting this information and he said no are you collecting information on American citizens and he said no and yet he's somebody who you see on TV almost everyday as an expert in this country without any consequence lying to the American people think that if you pull the American people and you asked us to vote on it you know I think it would be a gigantic Landslide victory for Edward Snowden to be exonerated and brought back to United States one thing that I think speaks to the Dane the dangerous nature of this culture that we're living in now the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer had done an interview on I don't know one of the major networks and I think he was talking about Trump when he said be careful you don't want to challenge the intelligence agencies basically putting out that but I don't know if you can pull that exact quote up but I was shot when I heard him say that because it basically makes out that these intelligence agencies are their own separate branch of government and that if anyone of us as Americans or elected leaders in this country dares to challenge your exercise oversight over them then we will suffer the consequences so as president I would change that culture of leadership that that leadership starts at the top and when you have people in positions of leadership who continue to perpetuate that culture of unaccountability of complete disrespect and disregard for the constitution of of not understanding that yes we need to keep our country safe we also need to protect our constitutional rights this is not a choice between the two which is so often how it's framed will if you want to protect us against terrorists you've got to give up all of your rights as Americans in your civil liberties and your privacy is in and just let these intelligence agencies Run Run free and run roughshod over and so that's the kind of of change in leadership that I'll bring there's a whole host of policies that that we can look at for example of the Patriot Act the Patriot Act is up for reauthorization in Congress this year there have been different sections of it that we have work to try to change and reform to make it so that agencies like the NSA cannot collect our private information as Americans without a warrant but there is far more that has to be done to undo the day that that we've already seen the abuse of our of our rights and privacy that we've already seen did you ever listen to the Kennedy speech about secret societies Kennedy had a fantastic speech before he was assassinated where he was discussing this very thing and he apparently had Notions of disbanding CIA and he was very concerned power people like Jagger Hoover course and that this was all happening while he was president and he felt like there were people that were involved in the secret societies and these secret meetings and that there was a lot of conspiracy going on and he thought the very idea was repugnant it's a fantastic speech the real concern that have that when you give someone the ability to surveil the general population you give that they what they're going to use some of that information to Aid in their allies into work against their enemies yeah that is unfortunately we've already seen this is what has been revealed by some of that information that was released by Snowden and how for example the fisa court as we have it now is a secret court that has Ben has been abused for that purpose allowing for that surveillance of Americans violating our civil liberties and privacy and that's something that we've got to fix that hole that whole fisa Court from top to bottom and how the different judges are appointed it's it's basically it's a it's a secret court that was appointed I believe they're created back in the 70s with the initial objective of providing oversight over the executive branch Mass surveillance that was happening at that time or illegal surveillance that was happening at that time unfortunately especially since 9/11 now you have this fisa court that is both used to approve surveillance and surveillance programs on foreign targets but also on Americans as well the one of the many problems with is it's a secret Court where you have a judge and you have someone representing the government whether it be one of the Intel agencies or the dod or whatever coming before this court making their case to try to get this warrant approved by the judge there is no Advocate there for the people there is no civil liberties or privacy Advocate there it's it's a one-sided conversation and the information being provided by the permit is the only information that's being given to the judge so this is one of the big problems there and then we've seen over decades now and especially since after 9/11 that there have been very very very few applications for these surveillance warrants that have been rejected by the judges so you know a rubber-stamping of these applications for warrants has is really what appears to be happening you know there's a few different that we're looking at trying to fix this there's some who are arguing to take away the fisa court completely one of the concerns about that is that if we do that then there has to be some other entity and place to exercise oversight over the Executive Branch and not allow them to conduct this surveillance you know willy nilly has as they pleased so it's figuring out exactly what what are the best reforms to meet that objective of providing that that over making it so that those warrants are given you know as needed and making sure that all in all the information is being presented and again that that fisa Court was initially put in place to go after to get warrants to conduct surveillance on foreign targets not Americans and that's been one of the biggest problems here with a lot of this Mass surveillance has its collecting our information as Americans illegally and unconstitutionally because you can't do that unless you go through this process and you actually get a warrant based on evidence what would you do about Julian Assange what would you do about Edward Snowden as far as what you do when I'm doing dropping the charges from Sweden in Julian's Hodges case and so Edwards know it would be the only one that you would be able to write Because unless you would influence the charges that the Haitian is exactly and it remains to be seen whether or not they will push for extradition there's another charge that was a thing was today the Sweden decided to go after him again for some sexual thing that they had decided to go after many many years ago Edward Snowden what he's doing right now is essentially living day-to-day hold up in Russia hiding and the charges against him stem from again this illegal operation that he in many ways is very patriotic me he let us know and it's a great cost ya so you would give him part and I think he did the things the way that he did them and hear the same thing from Chelsea Manning how there is not there's not an actual and hear the same thing from Chelsea Manning how there is not there's not an actual channel for whistleblowers like them to bring forward information that exposes egregious abuses of our constitutional rights and Liberties. Whether there was not a channel for that to happen in a real way and that's why they ended up taking the path that they did and suffering the consequences</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> happens when you become president what do you think happened why do these do you think that there are full of s*** and they're just saying what what we want to hear so they can get elected or do you think that there is something that happens them once they get into office do you think that it's possible that they're giving information that shows the through the real threats at the world has and there's things that the general public is just not privy to and these are what influences people to Asians to go against all the things they were saying when they're running for president look I haven't been with them in a bin those room so I won't speak for for for that which I do not know but what I do know is this is what happens when you have people who are elected to serve in this job as president whose most important responsibility is commander and chief and they lacked the experience and the understanding to be able to make the right kinds of decisions that serve the American people and end up even those going in with the best of intentions end up being very influenced whether it be by the military-industrial complex or the foreign policy establishment that as we've seen over decades has crossed both political parties both political parties in these areas often end up making the very same decisions about these wasteful regime-change Wars and acting as the world's police and therefore listening to them because they lacked that experience or that backbone and understanding themselves and then just continue the status quo you know Trump was somebody who during his campaign talked a lot about ending the stupid Wars talked about going after Saudi Arabia that they're the biggest supporters of terrorism in the world and you know what happened you know in his administration what he called draining the swamp he's turn that swamp into a cesspool you look at the people he surrounded himself by some of the biggest war hawks that our country is seeing guys like John Bolton people like Mike Pompeo people wanted to go to war against Iran for a very long time people who have been cozy with Saudi Arabia for a very long time you see who he's nominating to be Secretary of Defense long-time defense contract career man like over 30 years I think of working for Boeing you see the kinds of people who he surrounded himself by and so it's it's it doesn't take a lot to figure out how he has been influenced by them and continuing these regime change or this regime changes still going on in Syria now threatening regime change in Venezuela threatening regime change and disruption in Iran and that's the difference that's the difference quite bluntly between me and I people who are running for president is that experience and understanding that I bring to be able to walk into that office to do that job is commander-in-chief in on day one and two not succumb to The Establishment that that I have both felt the effects of as a soldier as well as seen in action as a member of Congress I'm going in with both both eyes wide open and understanding the situation as it really exists and most importantly standing who I work for that I work for the American people his position he's doing so because he's been influenced to change his position because he's been given more information or do you think they become compromised when they're on in office and they I scratch your back you scratch mine I don't know I don't imagine that there's probably some of both but if you're in if you don't have the strength of your convictions and your understanding about what kind of policies actually best serve the American people then you can see how easily you'd be swayed and influenced by others you know you saw trumps rhetoric on the campaign Trail about Saudi Arabia against Saudi Arabia against United States support for Saudi Arabia calling them out for what they are and now refusing to end US military support for this genocide of war in Yemen that Saudi Arabia is waging that's created the worst humanitarian crisis of Our Generation because he says what he doesn't want to risk a multibillion-dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia so you know you can see at least in that respect what he's really motivated by that he doesn't he would rather continue to support the senseless and devastating deaths of innocent people in Yemen and using our US military my brothers and sisters in the military to do that because he doesn't want to risk an is deal with Saudi Arabia Theocratic dictatorship that actually directly supports terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda it's hard for people to imagine if that's the case that it's an arms deal and they want to make sure that this deal goes through and that it continues to be financially productive for both Nations jobs building those weapons that were selling to Saudi that's what that risk my challenge to him and to the American people is if the best our president can do to help

		<div class="paragraph"> how old are you in terms of like someone is going to be president Donald Trump though so what he's in his mid-70s but his maturity is of an adolescent experience that I bring his is different from any other candidate after president serving as a soldier for 16 years of serving in Congress on these on these Committees of importance in National Security and I started this state legislature and the city council and look when you look back we talked about our founding fathers most of them who crafted the Constitution and who wrote the Declaration of Independence were under the age of forty many under the age of 30 we're talking about experiencing maturity here I know you're you're no you defending yourself I will fully support you I think you could be president 38 I really don't think it's a problem or 24 months older wiser you'll have a detailed but we do Wonder right like when has a person had enough life experience and what but then again the question is what is that life experience is it life expense like you said that leads you to be an image seven-year-old ours is a life experience of a someone who's served in combat and has been on in Congress for 6 years and someone understands how the government works and has a better perspective of human beings it is it is that experience and it's what you draw from it and the conclusions in the Judgment in the kind of leadership that you would exercise you know there were a lot of folks in 2016 who said Hillary Clinton was the most experienced candidate ever to run for president be because of the job she had held at the experience that she had had my problem was with her judgment and the kinds of decisions that she would make as commander-in-chief decisions that would continue to send people like me and my brothers and sisters in uniform to continue to fight in these wasteful regime-change Wars that actually dishonor the oath that we all take when we volunteer to serve to serve to protect and defend our country and the American people and instead sending these missions that are counter to that promise that undermine our national through that undermine the great sacrifice that our troops and their families make so it's that judgment it's the experience and the Judgment that I believe we need to look for in the next commander and chief it's what I bring to the table and it's what I challenge voters to ask the other candidates inside to hold them to account on both of those fronts would they be ready to walk into that Oval Office on day one and Nationals for the undermine the great sacrifice that our troops and their families make so it's that judgment it's the experience and the Judgment that I believe we need to look for in the next commander-in-chief it's what I bring to the table and it's what I challenge voters to ask the other candidates inside to hold them to account on both of those fronts would they be ready to walk into that Oval Office on day one and to serve our country as commander-in-chief</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> downtube political and social issues and it gets down to the heavy ones things like abortion in war and Rihanna freedom of religion in these these things I think are the ones where we should all just be communicating as calmly in his nose objectively as possible and we should discourage this this tribal perspective discourage this idea of being married to your own ideas and and trying to win these argument what you see in what you see in political campaigns what you see in television news is a f****** dumpster fire every single time they have the panel with a three people is just I can't watch it anymore. It's not talking points blurted and vomited out and attacks the news what's actually happening is completely lost and it's so it's it's so limited and this is how a lot of us are getting our view of the world and I feel like things are changing I think the world is a different place and it was even just 10 years ago I think getting so too I think humans are different and I think we just were not aware of how much all this conversation on all of our analyzing the world around us has shifted over the last deck some people are looking I feel like people are looking for for the fact they're looking for more information they are less likely to just accept at face value what they're seeing on TV or what they're hearing at which I think is is a positive thing and I think I think we do need to look at the leadership of this country to to set this culture for civil discourse for making it making it okay an encouraging actually those kinds of communications and that's where if you look at it if you watch C-SPAN one night when you can't fall asleep at you'll see in the Floor of Congress you've got the Democrats who are all sitting on one side you've got the Republicans all sitting on the other side and unfortunately not often enough do you see intermingling in conversation and people go into the other side of the island after getting getting to know people that was something that when I first got elected I was told look as a new member of Congress serving in the minority with Republicans in charge coming from a small state like Hawaii you will never get anything done so just accept it just accept that reality that you're not going to get anything done wait several years or whatever but one of the first things that I did was I got to get to know people I got to make friends so I might my mom and dad are small business owners and they have this macadamia nut toffee business and so I called home hey Mom can you make 434 boxes of your toffee for every single member of Congress all the Democrats all the Republicans and iCloud that's a great idea yeah sure I'd be happy to and then I said oh I got one more one more request can you make a bigger box of 435 bigger boxes of toffee for the staff of every member of Congress because they're the ones who makes it happen yes I think that's a great idea so I started writing handwritten notes to every one of my colleagues introducing myself and as we started delivering these little gifts of Aloha to their offices it was amazing how quickly I saw while on the house floor casting votes have Republican chairman of powerful committees making their way across from the Republican side of the democratic side saying thank you so much I really appreciate it was delicious I need to get more from you cuz I ate it all I got to take going to my wife for my husband and then saying tell me what's going on in Hawaii tell me what issues your constituents are worried about him the chairman of the transportation Committee of the agriculture committee or whatever it is let me know how we can work together just that one small Outreach of Aloha open the doors to these relationships that enabled me to be able to pass my first piece of legislation like my first six months as a member of Congress from a small state in the minority as a Democrat it's because just treating people with respect treating people with Aloha and saying yeah we can disagree even on nine out of ten things but on that 10 thing like hey let's talk let's get something done was that I opening for you and when did you at that moment I realized Oki Nunnally can I make an impact your I can do this the way I want to do it yet I can be a kind person and reach out and I don't have to listen to these people that are entrenched exactly it it did it directly disproved but we were told in those first day is as new members of Congress in Washington and further affirmed what I already knew both from what I learned from Senator akaka what I knew from growing up in Hawaii with the Aloha spirit that this this ability to transcend all of The Superficial divisiveness weather be based on politics like you said or religion or race or ethnicity or or any of these other things is what has the power to bring us together as a country hours of Congress in Washington and further affirmed what I already knew both from what I learned from Senator akaka what I knew from growing up in Hawaii with the Aloha spirit that this this ability to transcend all of The Superficial divisiveness weather be based on politics like you said or religion or race or ethnicity or or any of these other things is what has the power to bring us together as a country</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> your position on Syria is one that I think people misconstrued why don't want to tell me about having a nice that doesn't feel that you are a supporter I know that's not correct but is that one of those things where people just say that in order to sort of diffuse you to categorize you as a ridiculous person right off the bat where no one can take anything else you say seriously at the usual tactic of trying to smear or vilify mean and my campaign and and what I'm advocating for because they don't want to engage on the actual issue itself that I'm pointing out about how devastating and costly their policies are of continuing to wage these wasteful regime-change Wars of choosing to support terrorist groups like al-Qaeda in Syria directly in Syria because they are the most powerful force on the ground who's fighting to take out the regime government so they're so focused on toppling this government in Syria that they're willing to actually use taxpayer dollars to provide direct and indirect support to Al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria when you think about how crazy this is it it it it makes me angry I think it makes most people angry it's why I introduced legislation called the stop arming terrorists act why we would need to have such legislation is beyond me but it clearly we do make it so that we don't have any taxpayer dollars going directly to provide any kind of arms or supporter or anything to terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda but also to make it so that we are not providing support indirectly through countries like Saudi Arabia who are providing that support to terrorist groups so what has been said of you about a sod in your your position on the side that's just been an outright lie virtually everything I mean I'll just tell you happened I went to Syria to to meet with Syrian people to hear for myself from them about what was happening there while there I was offered the invitation to meet with the president of Syria and I took it because I think it's important for us to have the courage to meet with leaders whether they be friends or adversaries are potential adversaries if our focus is on National Security and on peace so I went I had that meeting and I asked some tough questions and heard from him his perspective on what was happening and what he was doing in his country and took the opportunity while there to meet with religious leaders college students members of the political opposition small business owners you know women who are working 2 to start their home business to empower other women she is Sony's Muslims Christians Catholics people of all different religions that it is because of that and that meeting and my staunch opposition to regime change Wars in Syria and in other countries that political opponents and others have chosen to try to smear me my reputation and my campaign and to label me as you said you know she's a supporter of this dictator will if that's true then anyone who opposed the Iraq war is a Saddam Hussein lover is a lover of dictators and love Saddam Hussein so if you challenge their logic you see how shallow it is and it's really none there and and what's exposed is their refusal to engage on the facts and to stand behind why they continue to put the American people through these costly regime-change Wars and why they continue to wage these words that are causing incredible suffering for people in different parts of the world it also when you're having these conversations which one credit incredibly important globally when you choose to distort people's positions like this you're not helping anybody now you're making the whole thing more confusing so for someone like me who's on the outside and then has to watch all this go down I have to go to why why why do you have reasonable people that make inaccurate statements about someone because they feel like if you do not if you don't refuse a meat there's something wrong with you write like to not want to be in the presence of this person yet yeah I mean there's so much hypocrisy around this you know a lot of these people are the same people who apply did President Obama when he first ran for president in 2008 when he I mean he did he cause some controversy at that time saying yes he would meet with the leader of Iran without preconditions that he would meet with leaders of other countries in that pursuit of security and peace so why the double standard here that okay so in order to keep our country safe in order to achieve peace we're only going to meet with our friends and people who we agree with that's not how you accomplish that mission that's not how you accomplished security and peace doesn't make sense or just social media version of running the world but he was eager to meet he was eager to be heard frankly to speak English very well really I think he was educated in Europe a dentist if I'm not mistaken in the meadow maybe he's an eye doctor is not in the medical field and he was you know he was open to to any and all questions that I had both about what was happening in Syria be no serious relationship or the lack thereof Israel a lot of the turmoil that we're seeing in different parts of the Middle East of of Sunni vs Shia you know chemical weapons being used in criminal acts being conducted a whole host of these issues how did how how the Syrian government is dealing with the the Kurdish population the northern part of the country what's going on in Turkey there was there's a number things that you know I've asked and he answered and then he shared his View and perspective in and really what what came out of that was he's he's very narrowly focused on his country and doesn't want other countries are other people coming in and and meddling in their country and what what what they're trying to accomplish which is actually the same thing that I heard from his political opposition when I met with them these are some of the leaders who who led the protest that that kind of began this whole conflict in 2011 people who are deeply opposed to the Syrian government some of whom have been held in captivity by the Syrian government and they said their constitutional changes we want to make yes we would like to see Assad removed from government that they don't want to see it done through military means or through other countries coming in and toppling their government what they want to see is that change coming the people of Syria saying hey this is the kind of leadership that we want for our future I can imagine so long we've seen this imperialistic mentality that still exist in our government where some feel like a well we should go and tell the country who should lead their government and tell them what kind of policies they should have but no other country should dare even attempt to do that to ours you well our positions that were the best and we're we're running this country the best way in this is the best country that ever existed ever that has the most freedoms got the most chaos it's got a lot of things going on that's not they're not good but overall we feel like we're The Shining Light of the world that's not accurate you know what maybe it's accurate in a lot of ways I need the problem the problem is begin when we go into other countries and try to create little mini America's and impose it on the people there whether they like it or not whether they're ready for it or not and and we end up seeing what we're seeing across the Middle East. I think we just look at the restaurant go I wouldn't tolerate that yeah daughters over there to go do that now if I put my tinfoil hat on Mount Gallant we the American people don't but this is the problem and this is this is something that I realized very quickly during my first deployment to Iraq where I was seeing firsthand the cost of were serving that medical unit every single day and I I wondered how many politicians in Washington who voted for advocated for a champion that warranty Rock were laying away at night awake at night thinking about my brothers and sisters who are getting killed in combat who are getting severely we're getting blown up by IEDs and I I I learned very quickly that they were not they weren't thinking about the real cost in the ramifications and the consequences of their decisions that the commander-in-chief they should probably the reason podcast what is the third decisions with the other day we're trying to say that we think that if you want to be the commander-in-chief they should probably have served who was that the reason podcast CT Fletcher yes I believe that it was him yeah it was a veterans well</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now one thing that exists now that really didn't exist when Obama was running for president is the impact of social media is tenfold what it used to be but with that also comes this reality that we're living in right now where there's only a few companies that are controlling the discourse in this country mean you really have essentially a Facebook Google YouTube Twitter and Facebook owns Instagram that's right and there's a couple other small ones but the bulk of our Disco what concern do you have about these private companies controlling the vast majority of communication between people on social media it's extremely dangerous it's extremely dangerous when you think about it there's a few things there's gosh with with Facebook and Google for that matter you know they they can set their algorithms Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook and set his algorithm to control what information is coming Star news feed in Facebook what are the stories that we're seeing Instagram same thing with Google they can control when you punch in something what are the first stories that you're going to see on the first page that pops up when you think about that kind of power of influence that has on the American people literally being held within the hands of a couple of people unchecked and without oversight or transparency it's incredibly dangerous talk about Free Speech there's just been news recently about Facebook banning certain individuals from having Facebook accounts because of their speech they disagree with the speech that they're they're using the things that they're talking with ideas that they're pushing forward unchecked First Amendment rights going completely out the window and yes but they're trying to get the best of both world the fact that that you know they're claiming to say hey this is a free space for open communication for everyone while at the same time going insane actually you know what you I don't like what you're saying about this so we're going to ban you and whoever your friends are from from this conversation I think that's that's a big problem it undermines it undermines our first amendment rights and you look at privacy the privacy concerns of all the information that they're collect Facebook from us all the information they're collecting from us with Google and how they're monetizing that and selling or sharing that information with other people with really without our our knowledge or agreement that's the part right the the agreement that most people didn't understand that your data is a huge commodity that's right and we signed up for these things are who who reads terms-of-service agreements have you ever read one yeah I've never read one of them I just say you okay we like the first paragraphs like okay ugly to you there is a South Park episode that that is specifically about the terms and conditions and I don't watch that a long time ago but every time I see one of those things pop up sign it turns I'm like a man I'm doing but wanting things are doing with this with your data they find out what you're interested in they find out what you're interested in engaging on for many people that's outrage so for many people it's the things that piss you off the most like if you have a real problem with Catholic priests getting away with having sex with little boys you will think that that's happening every minute of every day all across the world because it's going to be in your newsfeed consoling cuz I know that's what makes you engage righto your algorithm the algorithm your your feet is going to be very different than my feet cuz I engage on different things and you do the problem with that is even if they're not calculating if it's not on purpose they're not trying to get people outraged now they're trying to rabble-rousing but what they are doing is they because they have an ad-supported model they gravitate towards the the outrageous because that's what people get excited about and that's what people make multiple posts about that and that's how they make the revenue and get out of a bad ad model of an ad model that certainly supports outrage and it makes people think the world of the tribal boundaries between the two sides on these issues are more tense and you would think that discourse and the ability to freely communicate with kind of open that up and people would kind of understand each other better but it's not happening and I think Twitter is a garbage fire all day long it's a crazy thing that has happened that we gravitate towards the outrageous now I don't think that should be rewarded financially I think that's not it if this is just what people go to organically that's one thing but when you're cultivating feeds so that at least your algorithm a cultivating feeds so the people get pissed off you're making the country shittier place like you're literally like making things worse now the reasons why I think a couple of things should happen and and I think his name is Chris Hughes who co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg saw that article calling for Facebook to be broken up which is crazy about the person who founded it and he saying this is out of control and that's the point right now is is seeing how powerful as you said guys like Mark Zuckerberg have become and and how out-of-control things are just doesn't make sense like here's one they just banned Alex Jones not only did they ban Alex Jones but you can't talk about Alex Jones if you wrote Alex Jones might be nuts but damn is he cute if you wrote that it would you would get a message that says only you can see this message this message is stopped at the border from entering into the Facebook universe only say something if you're criticizing him right this is what they said telling you how to think which is f****** insane it isn't that's not just free violation free speed you're literally directing Spanish you're not even blocking people from doing something hateful or evil you're blocking people from saying something that you disagree with which is God bless Alex Jones and they said you can only see this message Facebook sends them a thing blocking that message wow that's f****** crazy I like the idea that you think you can do that that is nuts being able to ban anyone arbitrarily without any just violated terms of service what does that mean Riverdale I think what's happening is there was some serious concern that Facebook was used to influence the last election in whether against their knowledge or in a way where they were negligent about the type of filtering they use that stops people from posting propaganda and particularly stops these things like the IRA the internet research agency in Russia that literal create thousands of profiles and pages and they'll have a black lives matter page that's just designed to f*** with cops and then I have a Prokop page just designed to f*** with black lives matter all they want to do is create anger and they're doing this engineering these arguments with this is this is 100% proven fact Renee diresta on my podcast went over the details of how its setup and how they do it and the means and the means they create like this is an organized effort ID channel through Facebook in particular and then Instagram a couple of social media knowledge right I do not think she was a director for new knowledge they this company new knowledge that the DNC has tapped as one of their disinformation campaign experts and cyber experts was the very same company that created false accounts and pretended to be Russian bots in order to influence the u.s. senate election in Alabama yard heard that something that she was not a part of but if I don't know her is one that is often cited as a as a so-called expert and was a company that was cited to try to smear my campaign is somehow being an engine for the Russians or something like that Which Wich to me again just points to will it let's look at let's look at the so-called experts that your sighting in this company new knowledge and the kinds of actions that they've been taking the very same ones that they're criticizing others are doing it so. world out there that I mean I think you should be regulation like I mean I don't think you should be able to put c********* everywhere I don't think she will the docks piano but it's like where does that border stop yeah where does that regulation border stop yeah and I think it's very good question do you think that these social media platforms with Ritz Google or Twitter or whatever Facebook do you think that they should be treated as a public utility where everyone essentially has the right to use them you have the right to use water you don't have the right to take a hose and smash your neighbor's window and flood his house last night I do I do think that they should be regulated like that and they should be subject to the very same antitrust laws that have been used to make sure that we don't have other monopolies and other Industries or in other areas to tube to break them up and that was something that that Chris use outline in his article the furry First Step that could be taken is just to say hey you've got a you've got a Facebook needs to let go of Instagram and WhatsApp because that was some thought that acquisition created an even stronger Monopoly that really shouldn't have been allowed to take place in the beginning and so there are there are concerns about the kind of power being you know Consolidated into the hands of a very few people as well as how that's impacting any kind of competition and squashing that competition from coming up and saying hey you know you've got Facebook and then you've got this other new techno social media technology they've got better privacy standards and better service for the consumer and Facebook but anytime that that tries to happen you know they're quickly squashed by companies like Facebook or Google for that border or bought up exactly there's also be concerned that I have a big concern that there's a bunch of people that don't seem to understand the consequences of what they're calling deplatforming people with basically censoring taking people out of the public discussion and when when you do that and you create a bubble or you create a one-party leaning institution one-party leaning conglomeration human beings you're going to develop some real anger on the others and it it does the opposite of what you wanted to do what you want to do is make the world a better place let's take some of these angry voices out of the mixed and let's make the world a better place Anchorage encourage discourse courage these kinds of conversations where you can you can engage with people who might have a different view on an issue or might have a different experience that they bring to the conversation and to do so that actually helps increase the knowledge and understanding that we have board civil discourse yeah well I think we have to be kinder to each other we have to we have to be more upset at people that are acting like s*** heads online for no reason like you're just you think that it's just online what it what it is is communication and if you're interested in shity communication online you're just a shity communicated cuter and whitewash it it's not good are good for anybody and if people could figure out how to be less angry in their online lives and communicate about issues I think we'd find that we meet more in the middle than we think we do I think there's also a problem that people have become married to their ideas and they dig your heels in and they they support their ideology in the very rigid about it and that is only strengthened when you silence people it does the opposite of what your hope going to do it makes the world a worse place and makes look if people are saying things you don't like you don't have to read that but if you tell people that no one can read that don't they're going to go why do you get to decide who are you who are you you are regular person happens exactly human characteristics right that's right and that's that is where this path ends up this path that were on of this this hyper-partisanship this extreme divisiveness where it's either you're in my tribe or urine the other tribe in the arrows are pointed at each other without any willingness to once again just let's just have a conversation let me hear where you're coming from here where I'm coming from we can disagree without being disagreeable we can even have a heated conversation in a debate and I would the end of it patriotic this is Patriot and I think it's unpatriotic to be partisan cuz I think we're supposed to be on a team together yeah there's supposed to be a team America right what are you doing we're fighting over nonsense and mischaracterizing people positions to suit our own ideas and it's it's foolish that it's it's foolishness you said it's extremely dangerous and the American people are the ones who ultimately lose in all of this what are you doing we're fighting over nonsense and missile mischaracterizing people positions to suit our own ideas and it's it's foolish to it's it's foolishness you said it's extremely dangerous and the American people are the ones who ultimately lose in

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> if you'd become present when you become Perego sorry and you do get to change the way we spend money and stop spending money on these regime-change wars what would be the first thing you invested in in this country and how would you go about doing that question I think there is I'd want to give that some thought because there are a whole host of of challenges that we're facing you know I mean Healthcare is is among the top of the list and you know we've a little bit about that the last time I was here are crumbling infrastructure continues to be something that's not only just uncomfortable every time we're driving over potholes it's actually threatening people's lives and well beings I was in Iowa few weeks ago and we visited this a few communities that were completely inundated and devastated by the flooding that took place there. About three three four weeks ago now many of them have now unable to return to their homes we went and helped out one family we were tearing down drywall and ripping up the floors and underneath the wood and the floors are we still like tons of water in place and they were talking about how even with you know the aid from FEMA and SBA Loans that they they are unwilling to put a single dollar back into rebuilding their homes because they're hearing from the government and the Army Corps of Engineers that it may take two to four years to fix the levees that broke down and caused that flooding so why would they go and try to pour their life savings back into rebuilding their homes when they could get flooded again in a year or in two years cuz we're not making the kinds of investments in our infrastructure that we need to make so there's an education me there's a whole host of issues that I think we need to look at how we can best provide the resources that are necessary to prove those services to the American people and also look at how how we're doing business in and fixing the problems that exist within those different agencies there's always been call to help countries in need in the world and always been a call for the United States to step in and you know when in and do something but yet there's problems in this country that are never change there's bad communities in this country that are impoverished and crime-ridden that have been the same way for decades there was a former Baltimore Police Officer named Michael would have came on my podcast and he was talking to me about the time when he was in the Baltimore Police Department they found a piece of paper that was documenting various crimes from the 1970s for someone either one of the Year nineteen seventy something and it was the same exact crime in the same exact area that they were having problems with now weather is homicide whatever it was they were having the exact same issue in the exact same places and they realize like what this is there's no effort put to change this there's no if there's if you're talkin about decades and decades and decades why wasn't there money funneled into this community why isn't there some community centers that help children why isn't there an emphasis on better education why isn't there more police officers or at least some sort of Civilian present that help people and stop some of this crime and gives people a better place to live and then fix a lot of this what you're seeing decade after decade if we want to make America better the best way to do that is to fix the week is parts of the week is part of the people that are born in a s*** situation they don't get a good break big they got a bad break their born in a crime-ridden environment and they have to figure out how to be a better person while dealing with all this and then you got people that are aloof to this okay figure it out for yourself I did not like as if we all start from the same spot in this crazy game called five cuz we don't know those people are in the worst spot why can't we fix the worst spot seems like we could if we can help it Rock and we can invade Syria if we can do some of the things that people either want us to do or we have done why can't we do that exactly and that's that's what I often remind people is that right now today we spend 4 billion dollars every month in Afghanistan 4 billion dollars every month every single month imagine what could be done with those dollars in those resources in communities like Baltimore in communities Like Flint Michigan where people are still being poisoned by their water where they're being lied to and cheated by their leadership or the governor sent in these inspectors and clear the waters that hey everything's fine but he didn't tell people was that when those inspectors went in they turn the faucet let the water run for five minutes before they tested it to clean all the crap out of the pipes and create this false conclusion that somehow the water is clean when the people who live there know that it is still not safe to drink and for some folks they can't even take a shower in their own homes and so that's why you're not going to hear any other presidential candidates talking about the cost of war and where our money is going and how it is counter to our national security is making play safe counter to the interests of our people in the people in those countries but this is why I talked about this everywhere I go because it's Central it's Central to our ability to address these domestic challenges that we are facing we in this country are facing and communities across the country dealing with Health Care affordable housing there's a homeless crisis in both Urban cities and Rural communities people were not able to afford to put a roof over there if you were working full-time maybe one maybe two jobs even still can't afford to put a roof over their heads there's serious issues that we need to address here but to think that somehow we'll have the resources to do so without addressing where trillions of our dollars have been going now for the last several years is a lie it's just not true when you talk about people that are working full-time jobs and they still don't have enough money to get by what could you do to change that there's not one single action that can fix that you know I'm pushing for a living wage I think it's important that it's it's going to be different in different places you know I am a co-sponsor of the Congressional legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 at the federal level you know there has not been an increase in the federal minimum wage for a very long time and I think that's that's a step that can be taken but you know Los Angeles is like Hawaii where a $15 our job is not going to be enough to pay the rent You Got High Cost of Living so living wage is going to be hiring in communities like ours than it is in smaller communities or west what would you suggest for Los Angeles $20 an hour what the answer is here to be more or less people were somehow or another would be bad for business cost of living here is higher and so what we are paying the employees who work in these industries in the service jobs has to match that it has to correlate with that higher cost-of-living it cost more to go out to eat here then it does to go out to eat in the restaurant in I don't know Alabama programmable so I think we've got to we've got to recognize people who are doing the work that correlates with the higher cost-of-living that were seeing already I'm really looking at the universal basic income and seeing how that could be a tool help deal with a lot of these poverty-stricken communities in people who've been struggling and still unable to dig themselves out of a hole there and seeing how that potentially could replace a lot of the bureaucracy a lot of money that we're spending on bureaucracy in a lot of social welfare programs perhaps to both save money and to provide support directly to people who need it so I think that's an option that we've got to consider this it's it's not simple and so I'm doing the research and figuring out how exactly that would work and how exactly we pay for it but we also have to look at affordable housing I think not accepting the fact that the high cost of housing is what it is is is not the solution there's a lot of money that goes into our Housing and Urban Development Department but is it really having the effect that we needed to have to make it so that you know whether it's cops or teachers or firefighter people were working these public service jobs are able to afford to live in live in the community I were there working at we were in Malibu yesterday out of town hall there yesterday and took a tour with the mayor City Council Members Community leaders around a lot of the areas that were completely devastated by the fires and that was one of the things that they mentioned is that they pointed out a trailer park traditionally wear a lot of those First Responders live that's where the workforce in Malibu have lived in that trailer park and they said that it's not unheard of that one of those trailer homes go for a million bucks a million bucks and you don't even get to own the land that your trailer sits on and so this is a real problem that they're facing is people who are teaching in that area firefighters were working in that area they're not able to afford to live in the community that they serve how could that be first supply and demand things I mean in the private sector there's there's hotels in Hawaii for example we're recognizing that they can't attract workers to work in the hotels because they can't afford to live near where they work and they're starting to buy a property to actually provide that Workforce housing at an affordable cost to be able to attract those workers some communities are doing the same thing for for First Responders for firefighters and other so this is a problem that that a lot of you know City council's and local communities are trying to deal with stop letting it also points to a bigger problem that we have nationally that there is just not enough affordable truly affordable housing for working people in the country but a place like Malibu is always been this exclusive Community cuz there's just not that much Malibu right next to the water so it's more valuable yeah like is there a way to do anything that would change that so that's that's what I was asking the mayor about that was one of the things they said that has been me know people look at Malibu and they're like oh that's where a bunch of multi-millionaire rich people going by there beach homes but there has always been you know that the basis of that Community was really founded on those who works to build the community you know middle middle class middle class people who are increasingly being pushed out if you're not living in the home that you know your grandfather your great-grandfather built then you're not going to be able to afford to stay there so you know what he we didn't get into the the details on what they're looking at but this is something that the city council and the mayor are grappling with now to be able to attract workers who want to work in the area but who don't want to have to drive two hours or three hours just to get to their place to work with all those fat cats yeah and that's where a lot of I mean a lot of the folks we were talking to yesterday they live you know up on the mountain room or in the valley or it's a better spot anywhere the same thing about being by the beaches people can just kind of hang out in your backyard like right there right where your bedroom is hire private security yeah that's like trying to kick someone out of a park because you decide to have a picnic that's interrupt this beach is everybody exactly that charge you to go to the beach cruising so if I have no money in my pocket you're going to Bar me from going and putting my feet on the Sand &amp; Surf in the ocean it is wrong I mean I could see if you had a donation box to help people clean up the beach that's all I could say donations about the system that we have in place in America is that there's so much public land gas and people don't understand that they've never been to other countries where that's just not the case everything is private and in many many countries you can't just go camping I can't just take a raft and go down the river you can't just do that and what happens when those public spaces are are lost when their loss or lost forever when you came over then when you develop them you know when your beach has become trash with pollution and other like that's at the treasure the treasure that's lost while we have our forefathers to thank for their foresight yeah like the Theodore Roosevelt saw this in advance and met with great resistance from a lot of big businesses that just wanted to put apartments up everywhere and start building factories yeah and we created this incredible system of public land in this country that unprecedented Australia's Got a lot of public land to but it's just it there's other countries that have it but it's amazing what we have here and in terms of our diversity of of scenery and and where you could go to that with me and you could go to the desert or you could go to Idaho and you know gorgona volcano in Hawaii</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> who's the veterans well that's one thing that you have over them for sure is that you understand from first-hand experience and sacrifice what it means to actually be in war and Endymion Kombat I mean over I still serving Army National Guard now over over 16 years to play twice in the Middle East and coupled with my experience in in Congress serving over six years on the Foreign Affairs and the armed services committee is working in Beyond these issues related to National Security and our foreign policy meeting with leaders of different countries in the world it is these experiences in the understanding that I've gained from them that best equip me to walk in the door walk into the Oval Office on day one ready to do the job of President and most importantly commander-in-chief what hurdles are you encountering that you didn't expect you know a lot of WhatsApp are things that that that we kind of did expect you know the the smear campaigns the the misinformation campaigns that someone's doing this on purpose or do you think this is team mentality and action were people supporting particular candidate and they look at you as being competition that candidate with what do you think I think it's probably a combination you know I'm challenging The Establishment challenging the status quo challenge The Establishment in challenging the political establishment in calling things as I see them calling it straight and and speaking the truth whether that be calling out leaders within my own party or leaders of the other political party and you know I think that that strikes fear in a lot of people who are uncomfortable with it at a minimum and who are concerned because when you know we the people rise up and say hey what's really going on we're calling out self-serving politicians in Washington from both political parties were putting their own political interest or the interests of their party ahead of the interests of the people or they're putting the interests of you know whatever greedy Corporation in their lobbyists is riding the biggest checks to their campaigns ahead of the interests of the people so the more this awareness comes out the more people stand up and speak out so hey this is unacceptable this is unacceptable then it's threatening that free Power base that they have thrived and then lived off of for far too long we should talk about how you're fun to do to some people understand your position contributions every single dollar that comes to my campaign for president is coming from Individual people across this country whether it's a dollar or $1,000 people who are giving whatever they can and joining this movement there's a great joke I think it's from Dennis Miller I hope I'm not misquoting it but it's he was talking about how politicians wear patches and their jackets like NASCAR drivers thing that is foreign policy Wars and and regime-change Wars the the tinfoil-hat thanks military industrial complex people being asked or forced into making decisions that benefit these giant corporations that makes make weapons and profit off of War case scenario in terms of conspiracy theories the idea that someone wants War so they can make money and they don't care if people died even needlessly this is our number one conspiracy fear right if you had to think about of all the things that you hope are not true about the way the world works that would probably be number one you can take your tinfoil hat because the military industrial complex is a real thing this is something that President Eisenhower talked about which is an amazing speed amazing speeches his last speech as president United States of all the things that he could talk about he chose to focus on the military industrial complex and how it is and one thing that has been done to Sri a really interesting is the word conspiracy has become a dirty word and that dirty word or a word that it it's it's easy to make something silly by calling it a conspiracy now even though there are times where people conspire to do things that's right I mean that's why that word exist it's not like people don't make plans to do things that are illegal of course they do that's why the FBI's but this is from the archives in this was Eisenhower's speech as he was leaving office and farewell 1961 son of a b**** I'm sure there's an actual version of here we go January 17th 1961 Century that has witnessed four major Wars among the great Nations speech said Congressional military industrial complex and somewhere between the draft and the speech that was the he took out that word Congressional but he was directly connecting those dots that some may say all that's just a conspiracy theory but he was connecting those dots with the influence that the military industrial complex has on leaders in Congress who are making decisions about how our money is spent and where our troops are sent off into battle rational Congressional military industrial complex wow I need extra oil get you a new box couldn't keep the camera steady back then either do not know of any of my predecessors in pizza or indeed by the Fighting Man of World War II or Korea until the latest of our world conflict the United States had no Armament in the tree American makers of plowshares could with time and as required make starred as well but we can no longer we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of back support three and a Half Men in the American Experience economic political even spiritual is velden every city every state house every Office of the federal government we recognize the imperative mean in the councils of government we guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether thought Orlando by the military-industrial complex the potential for the B312 online but it's very chilling yes cuz this is the sitting president leaving office and this is what he wants to tell people he's a guy who had military experience he's a guy who saw firsthand wearing the uniform and then serving as commander-in-chief and this was his final warning to the nation the military companies are like most companies they always want to grow company seek infinite grow through the constantly seek their better quarters every year they want to make last year that's what they're doing there they're in the business of making money and not just in the business of creating things they they're creating things for a profit and they're going to have a little wiggle room especially with politicians politicians that are in their pocket and they've spent millions of dollars helping them along the way and you know they're going to be going to help each other and this long history of helping each other that's right that's how you see that very directly through Traditions that are being made to politicians by different defense contractors and the corresponding votes that are then taken but you also see this corruption that's happening before our very eyes happening within places like the Pentagon or you either have people in uniform or civilians who are working in Contracting for example in the Pentagon laying the groundwork for writing up these contracts major multibillion-dollar contracts with these big defense contractors and then lay down the uniform or you retire from service either the civilian or in the military and then you turn around and leave that door and walk into another door working for the very same contractor that you just wrote the contract for this is happening this is what this is what we need to change and we're talking about both campaign Finance reform but also reforming this kind of corruption in this revolving what's happening in different parts of our government easy happening in Wall Street to SEC Regulators people are supposed to be regulating wall shooter coming from Wall Street and then going back to Wall Street to work for the very same company that they were supposedly just charged to regulate this is a big problem that we've got it fixed very regulations that they helped put into place that's right and it's happening with foreign policy as well when you look at who who are the main people who go and testify in front of Congress coming from think tanks very well-known think tanks Global think tanks that specialize in foreign policy they don't have a placard on on their desk when they're testifying before Congress saying we receive funding from Saudi Arabia from Qatar United Arab Emirates from all these different countries who are spending a lot funny funding this thing takes it then come forward and push policies or push ideas to leaders in Congress that not coincidentally benefit the countries that are funding them what what could be done to stop that other than someone like you getting into Power well and what could you do once you get in there to two things I mean obviously has as president and commander-in-chief you set the tone for the kind of get that we have in this country that will put service above self and that this is what what I will bring as present bring those soldiers values of putting service above self putting service to the American people in your country first and foremost ahead of everything else of head of the interest of a political party or Corporation or or a foreign country for that matter and work to pass legislation in Congress that would close these revolving doors that would require this transparency when you're talking about who is funding who and where is this money coming from I think members of Congress should not be taking Pat contribution should be relying solely on contributions from people in this country so they know exactly who is funding their campaigns. Really seems like a no-brainer are calling for this kind of Reform and saying hey look if you want my vote then I expect you to not accept those contributions and to run a people-powered campaign how many people are doing up so two there's a couple who are running for president there is a slowly growing number of people who have run for and got gotten elected to congress but look it's it's it's in the margins compared to where we need to be camping how many people are doing episode 2 there's a couple who are running for president there is a slowly growing number of people who have run for and got gotten elected to congress but look it's it's it's in the margins compared to where we need to be</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we're back what's up coriander back I'll be back here when you first came here you were thinking about running for president now you're out there where all in is happening yes I know this is weird now I feel like this is like Destiny running for president but being out and connecting with people all across this country bringing this really a vending these wasteful destructive foreign policies that have been so costly on the American people for so long coffee on our troops coffee on our veterans ending these wasteful regime-change Wars ending this new Cold War and nuclear arms race and taking the trillions of dollars that we've been spending on these programs and that we will continue to spend if the status quo is allowed to continue and investing those dollars biking to serving the people in our communities serving the people of this country things like Health Care education infrastructure protecting our environment clean water there's so much that we need to do with that limited resources to accomplish that these are my favorite things you talk about my question is always though why do we spend so much time and money and a tattoo Titanic human cost for these reefs regime-change War. What do you think is the cause other than the obvious if we you have a dictator that's in place there's an obvious outcry like Saddam Hussein post 9/11 other than that what it what is the reason why we invest so much time and energy into regime-change war so much so that we've just accepted that this is a part of our gross economy like if we're going to take all the money that the United States earns and all the money that goes to taxes we just automatically put a jacket trunk of that into investing in these wars in other countries blindly why is he almost without any kind of real accountability 6 to 8 trillion dollars is what estimated that's been spent since 9/11 alone on these regime-change wars without even taking into account what the cost will continue to be to take care of our veterans those who have gone in and fought in these wars and if come home dealing with no visible visible ones that that they'll have to live with for the rest of their lives let's start back you mentioned Saddam Hussein I don't think it was necessarily an obvious outcry Saddam Hussein and the toppling of his regime was done for oil right it was done for financial reasons and The Architects of that Iraq war sold it in the guise of hey Saddam Hussein is working with Al-Qaeda those terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and he's going to give I'm his weapons of mass destruction both of which turned out to be false false intelligence and lies that were sold to the American people sold to soldiers people like me who who believed what they said you know I enlisted after 9/11 like so many people in this country to go after the terrorists who had attacked us on that day killing thousands of Americans and they sold this lie for financial game for oil you look at some of the architect Iraq war guys like John Bolton who today is President Trump's National Security Council director and you look at what's happening in Venezuela almost a very same Playbook being used where they're selling this this regime change effort threatening to use US military force to go in and topple a regime under the guise of humanitarianism when in fact in Bolton has said this on National Television that what we really want to make sure that American oil companies are able to go in an access. Oil-rich country in Venezuela country right now this battle over regime change because of the fact they want to control the oil I think that the u.s. coming in and trying to insert itself into what is happening in Venezuela is what is what is the problem so they're doing that through very very heavy sanctions they're doing that through various means and threatening to use our military to go in and top of the regime there rather than taking the approach that I would take US president which is to recognize that the people of Venezuela like people in other countries in the world need to be the ones to determine their governance and their future just like we wouldn't want any other country to come in and threatened to use their military to topple our government to tell us who should or shouldn't be the leaders in our country we shouldn't be doing that in their country there are serious issues that are causing a suffering for the Venezuelan people if we really want to be helpful we should be a force to help move towards reconciliation and peace rather than what this Administration is doing which is throwing fuel on the Flames of a civil war that will be devastating devastated with the current government in Venezuela and there is the opposition do they have differences on what kind of future what kind of governance and who should lead that government going forward rather than threatening to use the United States United States coming in and trying to act once again is the world's police which by the way throughout history has not had good results not for the people in those countries what to speak of the cost that we the American people pay rather than saying hey let's let's work towards peace try to push diplomacy and find what are the conditions that would make some form of reconciliation going forward is there an argument I really don't know the answer this but is there an argument that these regime-change wars although terrible we would be way worse off if those were no place I think that's an argument that proponents for regime-change Wars try to make but history shows and proves that the very opposite is true look at a rock can look at Libya can look at Siri that you can look at Guatemala and Ecuador you can look at other countries of Iran were in the past we have either overtly or covertly through the CIA gone in and toppled leaders of countries or dictators are regimes and the result has been more suffering for the people in those countries their lives have been made worse off not only in the short-term but in the long-term and the cost once again to the American people has also Anatole as we see more and more of our hard-earned taxpayer dollars going to pay for these wars these regime change efforts that are counter to our national security interest counted the interest of the American people encounter the interest of the people in those countries is this one of those things is just a counterintuitive thing where you would think that getting rid of someone like Kadafi would be a good idea he was a terrible evil person but they get rid of them in a Livia's a failed state if it's horrible what is happy Olivia as a result of that as you can watch slave auctions on YouTube missing say exactly it's hard to imagine that an era of YouTube and slave auctions exist in a place that you know at least some part of the blame has to be on us supporting the rebels it went in and took out Qaddafi like it's not good that he's one of those counterintuitive things are not good to have an evil person in control the country but it's not good to kill him and then this power vacuum yeah it's that it's it's hard to accept sometimes the reality that there are bad people in the world there are leaders of countries who are doing bad things against their people with the real question is is we recognize this is the world that exists in reality not the world that we wish existed and then the question is for the leaders of our country is what role should the United States play does it make sense to try Act is the world's police as we have been for far too long both as we look at what is in the best interest of the American people what's in the best interest of our national security as well as what impact will our actions have on the people in these countries and with Libya not only do we see strength interest groups there terrorist groups all over Libya now failed State the Libyan people are suffering now far more than they were before but we see the ramifications of that in countries like North Korea we're again John Bolton in the Trump Administration is talking about using the Libya model with North Korea as we work towards this objective of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula one of the leaders in the North Korean government just said the other day the United States government is talking about using Olivia model with North Korea to get them to get rid of their nuclear weapons they don't want to end up like Olivia or erock where in Libya is you remember the United States went in and told Gaddafi hey get rid of your nuclear weapons program and we're not going to come after you and he did he got rid of it and what happened very short time later the United States and other countries went in and took him out so that action and that decision that policy is directly undermining our national security and our efforts to make us and the world more safe to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula with the argument for change wars being that would it be that if we didn't go over there and if we didn't have a military presence and we didn't make them fight against us they would somehow or another gain more power and they would we would deal with this evil superpower is this this is like the worst case scenario for the pro interventionist foreign policy I wouldn't even I wouldn't even go that far and that the argument that's made by people who are advocating for these regime-change wars is we've got to do something to help people who are suffering that's generally the argument that's made and they sell this to the American people knowing that hey we we we have good hearts and we want to help people if we can but what they fail to do is to tell the truth and be honest about what they are hiding behind this guy's of humanitarianism if you look at Saudi Arabia for example and you look at the kinds of atrocity that Theocratic dictatorship is conducting against its own people decapitating lgbtq people persecuting religious minorities being the biggest propagator of this this most extreme intolerant ideology of Islam that is fueling terrorist organizations like Isis and Al Qaeda waging a genocide a war in Yemen killing tens of thousands of people you know that murder of the journalist in Turkey the list goes on and on and on yet what are we hearing from leaders in our government both Democrats and Republicans Saudi Arabia is a great Ally of the United States but then you look at what's happening in Venezuela ready to launch our military to go in and take out another dictator ready to go in and lunch are military ready to go and wage war against Iran so this is this is evidence of the hypocrisy that exists between those who are Waging regime-change War in some countries by the way usually countries that don't have nuclear weapons and usually countries where they have some other underlying interest in ulterior motive which is not helping the people of those countries and then when it's convenient for them countries like Saudi Arabia sidling up to a country's leadership directly and indirectly support Al-Qaeda the very terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 who we are trying to defeat interest in ulterior motive which is not helping the people of those countries and then when it's convenient for them countries like Saudi Arabia cycling up to a country's leadership directly and indirectly support Al-Qaeda the very terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 who we are trying to defeat</div>

	<div> <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6urQjuO9eI"> What Tulsi Gabbard Was Told Her First Day in Congress | Joe Rogan </a>
		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this has been one of the most frustrating things that I've seen and experienced throughout my over six years in Congress that really started when I first went up after I got elected or after every election happens in new members of Congress they go and they have what's called new member orientation and they give you these books and here's the maps and here's where your offices and you know all the all the administrative and logistical stuff but very quickly I would say within the first few days you know where we first come in together Democrats and Republicans immediately Kate Democrats go this way Republicans go this way immediately separated and what were told right off the bat is look this is about getting wins for our political party and if you work with the Republican then that's going to hurt the party especially if you work with the Republican at the Democratic party's trying to take out forget the substance of the idea forget the substance of the bill and it happens on the opposite side Republicans with Democrats both both political parties are diff are are guilty of this where they're really putting the interests of the political party ahead of the people who just voted for us to go and serve them and not just the Democrats who voted for me but yes there were the independence and the Republicans both who voted for me or who didn't but who I serve as part of my constituency and you just you continue to have continued to see this where you know you'll have a bill that because it's Democrat Bill Republicans vote against it substance aside or Republican bill Democrats vote against it just because it's a Republican bill but then hey if if they come in and you know a month or a year later introduced the same bill or a similar bill but now because of the democratic Bill okay everybody hey let's go let's go and support this legislation you can even imagine why there's so much gridlock in Washington why nothing really gets done and ultimately all this divisiveness and this hyper-partisanship is hurting the ability for the needs of the American people to be served when you talk about people like yourself that are completely funded by the public and you have this very logical and objective way of discussing this gridlock do you think that the future is in young people like yourself getting involved in politics that they are not connected to this old world 4:30 I 45 years this world it sounds like this is just what you do I mean I watch House of Cards and get kind of I get a sort of that that seems like chaos being politicians voted out or die off where we see those who are very entrenched in this this broken system feel very threatened by the rise of people powered campaigns individual contributions coming in and supplanting the big money that they get from you know that the packs and packs and lobbyists and and in their sphere there because they see their whole world being disrupted by people like me or others who are coming in and saying no we're not buying into any of that and we're coming into actually fulfill the mission that we've been charged with by those who voted for us to serve the p all the people of this country and would you say that would you this is my position I think that Trump plays part of that because I think he was the first guy to Camp the come to come in basically self-funded or being funded through his own me and not listening to the rest of the Republican Party saying hey I'm going to take Oliver and I'm going to do this my way and then knowing that he could do that and knowing that there were so many Republicans against him and knowing that there so many Democrats against him as well because he's still the present people like Jesus is a fragile system but the system is it's what they've done to acquire power is still very vulnerable even though they have us deeply entrenched system of weird little relationships that it's not good enough that if the people do rise up and they decide hey wanna put Tulsi in his president you going to have a different situation and allow you clowns going to be out of work absolutely I mean and that's really that that's the message that we're carrying to two living rooms in town halls in what is across the country is Washington continues to underestimate the power of the people exactly and that's the thing as you know our founding fathers had this vision for our country that our government would be of the People by the people and for the people and instead what we have is a government of the Rich and Powerful by and for the rich and Powerful of the special interest in corporations by and for the special interest in collaboration and you know we the people get low behind and they continue to talk to us like they're in control yeah they're one of us and they're supposed to be public employees as opposed to be servants that's right of the public they don't talk like that now they talk like people who are in a position of power and influence and it's not healthy it's not a healthy perspective it is evident of that huge disconnect video on the bubble that is Washington and the reality of the lives that we live everyday people all across this country that's always the case though when people get control things there was metal make it easier for them make it better for them what can I do to make this a little easier. Is there another way how can I help write myself here how can I make sure that when I get out of office I can do these public speaking tours make a quarter million dollars a pop yeah mask on and go sit with those bankers and listen to one of those conversations that Hillary Clinton got paid a quarter million dollars to talk ya never release the transcripts turn out right now so old I would love to get that guy and just get him drunk and put them on the edges like have them just talk about life know you only got like a few years left everything's falling apart in your body with your regrets what you do wrong what could have done differently stop all this bullshiting like what Deanna wise mushroom this role of being the person that is in control of this country is always been this impossible task and when I see a person like you who wants to do it I say listen you have some of the best ideas in the most healthy perspective that I've ever heard from anyone is ever running for president but why would you want to do that to yourself those are the two things that I think of because it's not for myself and and it's not be in control of the country in the people it's to serve the people and our country it's a continuation of this mission that I've chosen for my life to be of service to find different ways to do that you know it started in Hawaii with Gathering my friends as a kid and going to picking up trash off the beach on the weekends and experiencing even then at a young age that that made me happier then than anything else then you know going and playing video games with my friends or anything like that and that that mission that that was deeply ingrained in me further with my service in the military serving as a soldier where you know I'm serving alongside people of all walks of life as you know of race religion ethnicity orientation everything everyone of us wearing that same uniform serving that same flag that represents the American people with that laser like focus on putting service above self and that's what I seek to bring to the White House do to restore those values of Tegrity and honor and respect to make it so that that White House is a beacon of light for the American people to know that that White House belongs to them and represents them and their interest in their interest along does anybody even a person with you who's on the outside do you think anybody truly knows what it's like to run the country until they get in there do they even have an idea of what it how impossible a-tasket is to be in control of the economy the environment the infrastructure the military Arbor position in the world it seems like the most insane duty to require someone to run all those things to be aware of all those things to be responsible for all of the successes and all of the failures it's an awesome responsibility there's no question about that and I think it fulfills that that hire that higher and higher calling that the not about any kind of selfish interest is for me is not about any kind of ambition that I've had I've never had any kind of that why I want to be president one day or even I want to be a member of Congress one day it's always been about how can I how can I best be of service and how can I make a greater impact and that's what I've seen throughout my time in Congress where I've served on these committees I've served on the foreign affairs in armed services committee's I've been been calling for and fighting for an end to these wasteful regime-change Wars and end to this Cold War nuclear arms race there's only so much I can do as a member of Congress to be able to serve as president commander and chief I know that I can make that kind of impact and see change in our policy that keeps our country safe that moves us closer to that future of peace and prosperity and that's where I hope to be able to make a difference there's only so much I can do as a member of Congress to be able to serve as president commander and chief I know that I can make that kind of impact and see change in our policy that keeps our country safe that moves us closer to that future of peace and prosperity and that's where I hope to be able to make a difference</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it's so unbelievably compelling though to consider the idea that somewhere out there there's another civilization that maybe even more advanced than us and this thought of it is just so attractive it's it's it's incredible that should be coming or even slightly coming then that should be civilizations ahead of us I mean we've been around compelling the timescales we've been around is it a civilization play Bad science let's say since Newton Al Capone has 500 is at most what we've done we've gone beyond the solar system with voyager we've walked on the moon and we went we're about to go to miles I would think they're about to begin colonizing I run solar system in 500 years imagine a million years in the future so I would something used to say there are many civilizations out there in the galaxy go to funny Paradox because if you imagine the civilization that's a million years ahead of us they should have written that presents across the sky by now they should see him I mean you'll see us if we survive in a million years into the future and we will be exploring the galaxies we will have spacecraft that are going to if we last into the medium said would we choose to not do that Here's my thought on that is uncontacted tribes like do you know about the the gentleman who was the missionary who visited North Sentinel Island and was killed by the natives North Sentinel Island which is a really unusual place because they branched off from Africa 60,000 years ago and they've been living on this one small island the size of Manhattan and is Wells we know there's only about 39 of them left somewhere and we can't we not supposed to contact them like people are nuts but we were supposed to like leave them alone and there are rare try when they find them in the Amazon the uncontacted tribes initial instinct is back off let us know like what they look at us dropping bombs on each other and polluting the ocean sucking all the fish out and putting clouds into the Skies of dirt and particles and why would they look like look at these crude monkeys look at their there they're so far beyond where they need to be before they could join the Galactic Civilization that way send it when you say written across the sky supposed to trigger I'm thinking of Starships energy things that you can see the signature there's a theory that is actually being tossed about that these people that have this ancient well they have his memory of childbirth right so all of a sudden you're being born is bright lights above you is a man or a woman who's the surgeon with a mask that covers their face all you see is their eyes and everything looks bright and it's terrifying and clinical and you're on the stable and everything's cold most of these abduction experiences that people recount they take place in some sort of a medical facility and everything is bright and strange and cold and they think that what this is is there they're saying that we had this idea that children don't have memories that babies don't have memories and why wouldn't they Dearborn Inn it's probably one of the most profound and disturbing memories because before that everything is incredibly peaceful inside the mother's womb pulled out and then there's a bright light above you never experience any life so every and your visual perception your field of view is all distorted right the first time using your eyes that's why people have the same because of you think about looks since then the abduction so well does because people don't really go anywhere to think about the abduction thing is they put like cameras in people's rooms and and they say they have these alien abduction experiences but they don't go anywhere so what they're doing is a dream which is NYU sleeping 90% very Medical in nature right you're being examined and then there's also going back to childbirth is also a lot of people that have these experiences that they are being told that either they're taking their baby away from them or their studying their baby of the day had a baby inside of them to know about that the aliens have put it there and they're taking it out I mean it even goes back to the Virgin birth right and felt very weird but this this memory that people have from childhood is most likely you know I'll probably a pretty intense powerful memory that's always there Kilik 20 kids everything that we would like to come and help the blood brings her like sharks and the technology find you attractive I'm giving you want to know where I can read it where can I read that those statements that they were contact with the aliens listen I think that they are absolutely obsessed with the occult so that's been pretty well documented alien craft that came into her Galaxy change speed and went different directions than scientists said that it was it could be something could be what is Neil Degrassi say about it it's not talking right now scientist Harvard spaceship to fly through the Galaxy I would definitely make it look like a big rock why wouldn't you like look if we just make this thing drive by them and don't change speeds don't have no idea is to recite we miss them okay I could talk hit the gas I'm tired I want to f****** taking too long but you got it. sounds good doesn't it kind of want to believe so hard I hope you do because I was going to be there's going to be a lot of stuff so you see what else have you seen I've seen many many documents on the studies of these things and I've seen a lot of the science associated with what the technology is and what it does like I could show you if I fold up pieces of paper and stuff let's go on with it but basically you know these craft when you AAA travel in a straight line but they're folding space like in Event Horizon will they explain it by folding a piece of paper and punching a pencil through it Jersey that means it's in a word used to traveling in a direction like that and so when we look we see a plane that goes straight right but these these UFOs fold space-time like this and so it looks like to them they're going in a straight line so if you're in the ship you see that but if you're on the ground you see that that's why you see them blink off and on a lot of those videos jumping it's just because of this so they having space-time some way of interfacing with space itself is different than our idea of traveling in the linear way from point A to point B space the fabric they called the fabric of space-time because it's like a fabric it's malleable. Let me ask you this how often a new conversation do people look at you and think you are f****** crazy when you start talking about this and how long all the time and all the time crazy out because I'm involved on the most important s*** I've ever been in my life like this is like the most important thing you've ever done the life yeah like I have meetings with Senators coming up like your friend that hasn't talked for 22 years I love s*** like yeah you don't hear about that or someone that stopping and Van Halen to go f*** with swords you know I know but I feel like he's made himself readily available do that s*** you know like I don't know if I sit and scratch my head and I don't know I don't know either such a good songwriter yeah that guy is such a f****** Loose Cannon he became the president like maybe they can get it from him or his f****** chaotic as s*** is right now it is something I don't know something with slip you know I would think that if they told him if they brought him a dosist just two things I would want to know who killed JFK those are two things I want to know if I became the president and are aliens real what you got motherfuker I go to the top generals I bet look I'm going to defer to you guys I'm not a military okay I'm and I don't want war but I want you guys to have support I got full respect tell me about the Russians are going to be in space and we're going to be in space or or fight off the aliens buying am going Jesus going to say oh yeah I don't know man but if I became president I never will but if I did those are the two things I would want to know who killed JFK and where the f****** aliens from The Comedy Store I'd like to and then I watched some goofy I've been on this UFO documentary kick one of them is Area 51 Bob Lazar and alien Area 51 and flying saucers documentary on this guy who claimed that he worked on these alien ships in Area 51 in the 1980s and health as time's gone on more of the things that he said approving the actually be true an element that he talked about Element 115 I think it was called Matt Like a Man created element you know if there's carbon will do an element that they created that he talked about way before it was ever publicized and he talked about this thing and then it turned out to be true he talked about these there's easy hand monitors that you would put your hand on this thing and these why these metal lines would detect the distances in the bones of your fingers the exact distances and everyone is different so I can signature and that they could find out if it was you or not you it was trying to go through so the way they would scan to look bioscan would literally measure the bones in the fingers and people said that was horseshit know they did have that and Los Alamos they did have that and in Area 51 and that this technology was very very very very people did this guy who's creator of this documentary is very difficult for them to get photos of this hand scanner but his hands can add it existed existed exactly as this guy described it in the 80s that he actually work there there's people that worked in the same Los Alamos lab with him to try to say never work there but his name's on the Manifest it's very strange like they've tried to erase parts of this guy's past because he he filmed a bunch of their crafts as they were flying around like he knew what days this is the thing that thing right there you put your hand on that it actually measures the distance of the size and length of your bones escape room in LA talk for a while after a while like he's telling the truth like what if he is actually telling the truth cuz he's actually telling the truth there is some part of the government that had access at least in the 1980s to alien technology you believe in UFOs here's one thing I do believe most people are full of s***. To come still like most of their stories like it's it's hard to find a person that could just tell you what happened based on what they really remember people wanted Jazz things up and then one at Salt and Pepper they just sex with me the tested that they don't necessarily tell you the truth to tell you what they think is going to be an engaging story that kind of represent truce maybe especially when it's a weird thing like you saw something in the sky what did you really see how long did you look at it for how many seconds was it here's the problem I have with UFOs and I believe there are UFOs but I don't think they're coming here why I mean I would lay in that b**** right in the middle of Times Square and be like what we are here why would you do that but why wouldn't I why am I getting in fields where nobody can see us are you aware of how we treat uncontacted tribes yes still point but but what I'm saying is if you're way smarter than far distances we can't even imagine and they're here they don't have to hide it just like they do it because they have to hide or do you think maybe they do it because we can't handle it because we can't handle it why would they care if we could handle it or not because here's the problem whenever any civilization has ever encountered a civilization far superior to them the results have always been catastrophic every single time every time Europeans have invaded North America ever I'm the Spanish visited the Mexicans every time this has happened it's been a disaster this is human beings if there was something that came down here from another planet with so unbelievably sophisticated that I can travel through vast distances in space and had insurmountable impossible technology that we would look to it for Oliver answers it would become our new daddy it would completely disrupt all of our governments would disrupt all of our religion so we just wrapped every single bill system we have in people would fall apart they wouldn't know what to do psychologically it would be devastating look I'm not a psychologist but I know most people would not be able to handle it I understand that but why would they care because that was my whole point about who would be affecting our culture and it wouldn't care but why wouldn't we have that because we care about animals animals you're a deer live in the forest and in year 2 years old you might not have ever even seen a person even know what the f*** we are but we're trying to keep those beer alive we spend billions of dollars every year protecting them we do that because we care about Wildlife if we cared about a rare monkey that we found in Indonesia and it wasn't strange monkey we would do whatever we could to make sure that monkeys populations thrived if there was a way to help them and that's one of the reasons why zoos exist they take rare animals they try to breed them in captivity and so sharing the same Earth will they maybe they look at the universe that way and nuclear civilizations like our civilization mean our civilizations of very dangerous one because we're a bunch of semi hairless monkeys with nuclear weapons I mean we're f****** nuts bro yeah we're obsessed with sex with Jack off to our phones where we're taking pills keep our dick Hardware on speed things that people did do us we pretend people that did worse things we pretended we didn't do things to people we lie about stealing we lie about money we lie about all kinds of things me people are so so your theory you're thinking aliens are thinking about all that before they come down of course they would when you discuss the cosmos may be the single most intriguing possibility to us as human beings is what other intelligent life if any is out there and how interesting is you when you spend so much time studying the fundamental particles of the universe itself how interested are you and the possibility of other intelligent life forms or have you just like put that out into the it's just so ridiculously unlikely or so far away from us that will probably never going to make contact stations the problem that from my perspective is that although they might be out there they had a real head start on us before you receive them but then image be speculated on beings from the previous Eon communicating with us an advantage there is that you're looking at the really Advanced civilization disappeared you know you know how many billions of years are you talking about the big bang was fourteen billion yes but you see that's way at the beginning in a sentence or three-quarters of the way through in another fence csec are the farthest in terms of our technological achievement in our understanding of the universe itself it's possible there were at the front of the line. There might be some other intelligent life forms in the universe but they might be behind us whenever it mean I'm not saying they got through you maybe they have techniques yes but it would have to be in the form of photons or something yeah I'm talking about ridiculous speculation but encoding information into photons yes optimistic about current intelligent life somewhere in the universe not too optimistic just because well maybe it took us a long time to get going because the dinosaurs were there for a while ahead of us is conceivable I'm not going to really tired I just not terribly optimistic about it I think it's worth doing it's worth looking</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> interesting what else should we be concerned with we should be concerned with anything that North Korea is doing the last place I I have spent a lot of time in North Korea that's why I brought could have growth and integrate into the rest of the world that would be great if you want to listen 2015 been there twice from China and zigzag the country by land visited 10 or 12 different sites so we spent almost two weeks by Lance I've really incredible I'm in North Korea one it's the most organized place I've ever seen him and there's not us anywhere there's like on the side of the road to the stones are all raped not a stick every little line is drawn it's like total control there were very in them in their agricultural areas that were very few and very few farm animals I saw people pulling plows I can do usually have that the animal in front of the plow and the person behind here they're like two people in front of the plow and one person behind the people wear the the the animals and we would go and visit these they just cuz they didn't pay a lot of animals got eaten when they had their founded and so we visited these different sites for the special economic zones and they would say like what they had done and what they were thinking about doing and I would say like how do you do you know anything about the market like you what are you going to sell here and it will we we know about clearing land and building a fence and then we we went to to Pyongyang and I spoke to about 400 economic planners and I said look I know you had these plans that would be special economic zones it's totally going to fail the way it's going to work you have to connect to the market economy after Empower your workers you need information flow how else are you going to learn and adapt so North Korea it's a really US Patent now it's even more dangerous because President Trump through a business kind of nonsensical Hail Mary in these these meetings with Kim Jong-un there was never any indication that the North Koreans were planning on giving up their nuclear weapons they never said they would it's the last thing they would do because their goal is survival and so there was this kind of head fake which was like a PR stunt to be able to say art we're having these these meetings and of course the North Koreans weren't ever going to give up their nuclear weapons they're still not so now things are ramping up so North Korea in the last couple days and started firing missiles again at the United States today and see if military sees a North Korean ship so we're going back to this very dangerous place and and so I can we we really need to do a much better job we need much more considering it's really hard and these guys are really smart I mean I they are they are very people say well these guys are poor they must not be so I mean like a mad like that we're playing cards with them we've got the whole deck they don't have one card and yet they're there and why did you go over there like what what were you thinking so I thought a lot about it because I have a background in human rights I was a human rights officer for the United Nations in Cambodia on the child Refugee I have this very strong belief in human rights and that in supporting people in North Korea they have about a hundred and twenty thousand people in the most beautiful the brutal horrific prison camps and so when I was asked to be part of this 6-person delegation advising them on the special this album especially cuz I'll make those one Instinct was screw them I don't want to be part of this at all but I also felt that if North Korea could have some kind of integrated economic development that would at least connect them to the world that would create some kind of Leverage and that would that would help that help people so I decided to go and I'm glad that I did I did but if this is these are really hard or issues people and it's very unfortunate did it in in President Trump's negotiations with the North Korean Human Rights was never once mentioned I think that's is coming back values like we have to be clear about who we are and what we stand for and be consistent in fighting for him do you think that Trump didn't bring that up because he wanted to be able to effectively communicate with them and not put them on their heels maybe but I feel like he had they done anything that if he thought that there was a real chance of progress that the hard thing was he didn't know much about the North Koreans he had people people work in the United and all those people all of the US intelligence agencies were telling President Trump that the North Koreans have absolutely no intention of giving up their nuclear weapons and so maybe he did think that he would charm Kim Jong on her he would say hey we're going to give you a conomic development or or whatever but I think for most people who were The Observers of Northwood watch it while I thought that was not a lot so we didn't mention we suspended or military exercises we gave them the legitimacy of a presidential meeting which they've been wanting for 30 years and we didn't get anything back so heavy got something back then you can say well that was a risk for taking may be described that way I'm agreeing with what you're saying what do you think you could have done differently though I don't think the meeting should have happened with no kids no conditions I'm open to meet with the North Koreans which is something the North Koreans have all way we could have met with the North Koreans anytime immediately for the last 30 years but in order to do it they need to do this this in this and if they do it will meet like that would have been a legitimate thing but what he said is somebody that the North Korean I'm inside at the South Korea National Security just peeked into his office in the end because they they wanted me to get it was like sure seems like an interesting thing to do with this diplomacy find Android queens-born didn't have an incentive to do anything in return was his perspective that it would be better to be in communication in to be friends with this guy was that what that was that was just thinking we have real interest in the sense that we we we have large military forces in Seoul we have a lot at stake we have our closest Ally Japan who had citizens abducted and so I think that was what he thought is like let's be friendly and then with the the force of personal chem everything will will unlock but I think that was always extremely unlikely what do you think is going to happen to that country eventually eyewitness I think eventually this regime will will collapse under its own weight but it's really held out a long time because you think of the collapse of the Soviet Union they had enough so Union had enough bullets you just survive if they had said you were just going to shoot everybody at the Berlin wall and every dissenter they would still be the North Korea has essentially murdered millions of people so with famine and execution and then and prison camps are going to stay for a while but eventually there will be leaders in North Korea who will come to the conclusion that it's safer to oppose the Kim family then to wait for the Kim family to come and get you in that through tends to happen and you kind of totalitarian systems were there so little trust or so little loyalty weather conditions like technologically like what was their infrastructure like General infrastructure is absolutely terrible I mean they have roads in the big cities are actually quite nice roads cuz there's no cars and so it but their infrastructure is is terrible I mean all of their their power supply they have brownouts blackouts all the time they're manufacturing is all being a decimated so it's terrible but they have really focus their energy on build is nuclear weapons because they think of these nuclear weapons give them leverage to do things and to extract concessions and to get to get a VIP it's terrible infrastructure so do they don't have an internet right but they have something similar but it only allows them access to a few state-run websites well average person doesn't have access to the internet so the way it works is and it's all about loyalty so you need three or so generations of loyalty to the Kim family set foot in Pyongyang the capital so yes so it's not like you can move around or whatever like just to be in the Capitol like you have to have your loyalty proven and so average person out in the country they don't have access to much of a little bit more now than they did in the past and then for this relatively small number of Elites who are in largely in Pyongyang and in the other cities where it's like there is there's a ring of Defense around these hit justed to enter you have to have all of these checks some of them have access to limited internet buddy 6th it's tightly controlled and it's not like you're kind of going on Google and look going wherever you want and they probably would get in trouble if they Google the wrong thing yes and trouble it's not just you trouble like if you jump if if my brother or my uncle does something that gets me in trouble with the regime the whole extended family is out let me see. You go to prison camps for youth you're kicked out of it's all about Collective punch people are terrified and by that ruthless punishment structures their setup that's how they've kept control the country yes and everybody's forced to ride on each other right now compelled to tell on each other for one thing you did if you don't then what if you don't then you are complicit these people were in the prison camps like I have a friend of mine and she was this thirteen-year-old girl and her father was a like a low-level North Korean official and he was accused of something and took his family was privileged all of a sudden was without and and there's a statistic is horrible things in prison and rape and this little Emma now she's in United States incredibly positive and it's amazing how resilient just like a real hell it's a written issue and I think that for us as Americans as humans we're less human when there are people who are suffering like this you know you were traveling all over North Korea what were they having you do while you were out there way would do as we would go from one of these special economic zones to the other end in each one it was kind of the same story get there there be like a big field the farmers have been kicked off there was a fence around it and then the group David local officials would come and it have like a big chart and they have a plan like yours were going to build this building and here's and then I would always ask the same question like what are you going to do here why do you think you're going to be competitive how do you know what the market prices are how are your workers going to be empowered so they can change things too many in the old days that used to be you just kind of have these automaton workers now workers are actually making big decisions and fixing things and they didn't have an answer to any of those that's what happens when you have these totalitarian top down systems is that like if you being creative is actually really dangerous so somebody says do X you just do X Y A really incredible it's so sad because I spend a lot of time in South Korea and this is the most dynamic place there who is like the future and then just 35 miles from Seoul is the demilitarized zone on the other side it's it's incredible and the real problem would be once they finally did get free of that Community or the of that you can come whenever you want a dictator and that his family what would they what tools would they have like how old would they be to be on top they have if there is two Here's my thought of what a scenario of the scenario might look like I may eventually probably still be some kind of coup attempt again to say it succeeds but that would probably result another military dictatorship was another group immediately Americans fighting against the the but the green one of the two sides was America and the South Korean fighting against the North Koreans and the Chinese the Chinese did the most of the of the of the fighting and so China and North Korea is the only country in the world that has a treaty Alliance now with China kind of like we have with Japan and within with South Korea and so China their biggest fear is having a reunified Korean Peninsula Allied to the United States I think if there was a coup the Chinese would immediately move in millet then immediately there would be just call to have some kind of un body and there would be a call for a un Authority and then I think it would be agreed that the Chinese would stay and they just would put on Blue helmets like as it as a u n forest and then we'd have to negotiate what happens next I think what the Chinese would do disable will leave when the Americans leave is that I think that would be what will likely have been eventually I think we're going to see a Korean location of the good news of these reunified countries like East and West Germany is there's a whole system of law that is just uses North we will be swallowed into South Korea and then you have while you have an infrastructure and it'll take one or two generations I think that will eventually happen and I'm hoping it can happen without nuclear war terrible terrible Bloodshed but it's that it's going to be a big challenge I will eventually happen and I'm hoping it can happen without nuclear war terrible terrible Bloodshed but it's that it's going to be a big challenge damn yeah that sounds insurmountable about North Korea getting absorbed by South Korea</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> anticipating sing like a lot of freaky things come out of China yes well you said that very queer yeah I spend a lot of time in China it's a different great ancient civilization but they destroyed their own civilization in the Great Leap Forward and the cultural revolution they they burn their books They smash their own at historic relics and so it's really it's a society many ways it's starting from scratch and so all of these Norms of people get inherited through their Traditions China in many ways doesn't have and so and so it's it's a very different and China is growing and they are increasingly powerful in China is going to be a major voice before defining the world of the 21st century that's why America has to get it back together that's a hard concept for us to Grass we think about the fact that they had the Great Wall they have so much ancient art and architecture we just assume they're real culture they are but they wiped it out that's yeah if you want to see great Chinese art you have to go to Taiwan because when the Chinese National is left in 1949 when they lost as they were losing the Civil War they took the treasures and they put them in the national museum of Taiwan in the cultural revolution the Great Leap Forward China the red guards were just smashing all of their own stuff their own ancient history now now that the Chinese Communist Party don't know we're going back and we have this great 5000 year old culture in some ways it's true but in some ways it's like an adolescent culture without these kinds of restrictions that other societies have got such a unique perspective that I haven't heard before and it makes so much sense in terms of like how frantic they are restructuring their world yeah and everybody else tributary and so they're monumentally pissed off that these Colonial Powers came and overpowered them and they had to make all these concessions they had to give land away and and hell-bent on playing the long game they are playing a long game and we are not and we have to be mindful of it that's also something you can do if you have complete control of your population you don't have to worry about people's opinions or you can just go in the direction that you can do is going to benefit the Chinese power the powers-that-be country run by Engineers lawyers and then then reality people I guess these problems and the answer is always have water in the North or trying to rebuild this massive biggest water project in the world from south to North you want to win in the Olympics you engineer your population to take kids away from their families them in their Olympic sport schools I arrive at the scene in Genesis Code if you're trying and you kind of have this Plato's Republic model of the world and work on that kind of identify the genetic or maybe manipulate these genetic Superstars to be our greatest scientists and mathematicians and Business Leaders and political leaders like there's a model that you can imagine for 4 how to doing it makes you really nervous it should like I just drinking with this country we don't have time to have all these distractions we're focusing on junk like what just like all of this all the time when I'm when I'm home in New York and North Korea but it's all poured in which kind of for drawing people's attention to these few stories but there's these big stories that we have to focus on and then certainly the rise of China is such an essential story for the twenty-first century because China is competing in all of these Technologies and China it's like go-go-go million people in China who are involved in the tech World when they go in and visit Silicon Valley uniformly they say we cannot believe you people are so lazy why are they not working twenty-four hours a day why are they not issuing product new product every every week and so this is when they are racing somewhere and it's going to have huge implications for the world and so if we believe in our values as I believe we should we have to fight for him in the place that we have to fight for him first is here and he can't you do it just like everyday that we're just focusing on this dramas reality TV drama of our government another day we're not focusing on the big thing how are we going to get our act together how are we going to lead the world in technology benefit another example is this is immigration like we have this whole fight how do we keep people out what I'd like to do is to go to to the Statesboro side every Embassy in the world you have a new job you have to bring to give you whatever a number 500 slots per year you have to be in your country find the 500 most brilliant talented creative entrepreneurial people and say we're giving you a green card we're going to give you a little starter money we want you to move to the United States and just start a life and have kids and it really should be creaming the crop skinny the queen of the rest of the world and then we could take over we did we could Revitalize these countries were having this fight of how do we keep a small number of refugees out and it says we're not focusing on the right thing in this country and really but not just why I learned about it because they put out the pretty Innovative phones and right interesting technology but we learned it because the state department was telling people that stop using their phones do you think that that is trying to stifle the competition like to try to look good cuz the market if they have if they do really have been number the number to selling cell phones in the world now that's not from America America is largely out of that conversation right and if they were in America would probably dominate the Americas well cuz they're cheaper yeah I know really good at mean that they are phones are insane they have cameras in their phones are off the chart if they they put some video of the the zoom capability of their newest phone and people calling bowlshit there's like this no way that's possible but it turns out it was true Zoom for sure the founder of Huawei is a former Chinese military officer for sure in the early stages of their company they stole straight out stool lots of source code from companies like Sysco for sure we should be really worried if Huawei is the sole supplier of the infrastructure that supports 5G all around the world because the Chinese government would have access to everything that lead us to the question is one is there a problem with Huawei itself into is let's just stay and I tell you the answer that first question is probably yes but then the question to would let you say Huawei is a legit company and they're not totally intimately connected to the Chinese government can we trust their relationship with the Chinese government has the big Chinese companies Champion company they have a Communist Party cell inside of that company and Saudis like I think that we can't think of big Chinese companies just like we think of companies here we have to think of them as quasi-state actors and that's why this despite that's happening right now is it is so important and that's why like when China is ours investing in different parts of the world including Africa their companies are kind of acting like arms of the government and they're making all kinds of Investments that don't really make sense if you just see what this is a company doing something if you say that this is a company with backing by the state that's fulfilling a function that supports the state it's it's just it's a very different model so I am actually quite concerned about about Huawei and and I'm not a fan of everything that this Administration is doing but I think it's important that we we need to stand up and I think pushing back on Huawei is the right thing to do about that about the Chinese government being inexorably connected to This Global superpower and Technology I'm also uncomfortable that it sets a precedent for other nations to follow because it looked as the only way to compete because what you were talking about the Investments That One Way Or that Chinese government makes and these other in these countries and they don't seem to make sense of you're just dealing with random funny right but if you're dealing with someone else trying to take over the world and makes a lot of sense and some place in Africa and you're competing with a Chinese company owns to do something build a port or whatever and you're competing because you are an American company until you have your cock aside this look for what's the income stream going to be about it you have a certain amount that you can bid because otherwise it becomes a bad investment but if the Chinese company is that their calculus is not is this a good or bad investment it's what is the state interest in controlling or quasi controlling this asset we can't project ourselves onto the Chinese we can say they're just like us different it's if we have different models and I'm all those are competing do you think that we should avoid while we products or consumer should I have I think the government should very tightly regulate products by Huawei products Network router using them long history of European Japanese South Korean companies that have invested very well they've out competed us and we've we've allowed we allowed the Japanese companies to out-compete Arc auto manufacturers and that was that was fine and then sits in the 1970s our cars had to come s*** because we had this Monopoly until I'm all for open competition I'm all for free trade it has to be fair but I think that what China is doing China recognized as a state they could use the tools of capitalism to achieve State ins I think we need to be very cautious about that that's interesting that you compared to the automotive Market because the consequences are so much different right so much given his but we do have a model to go on we could see what happened we didn't we made citicards the Japanese took over and then we may hear all of the different and there was like a Nissan and Toyota and there was a Cadillac and if I thought you know I said I'm going to go with the caddy it's a great car to respond to them in that are you an event or like I'm all for competition but I just feel like what Chinese some Chinese companies are doing it's not competition it's big have become not all of them but quasi-state actors and then that's what they're doing I think we need to respond to them in that way interesting</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that's what's going to get now are you concerned with artificial life he concerned about the propagation of artificial intelligence they different kinds of artificial life so 1 is artificial intelligence and I know people like Elon Musk and and light Stephen Hawking or are afraid terrifying focus on those cuz if we just say oh that's that's crazy we don't focus on it it increases the likelihood of these bad things happening so kudos to to you on Mike but I think that we are a long way away from that threat and we are and we will be enormous beneficiaries of these Technologies and that's why my don't sound like a broken record but that's why I keep saying it's all about values if we should take those threats very seriously and then things that we can do now what are standards that we can integrate for example into our computer programming and then so I mention my World Health Organization committee the question is will what are the what are the standards that we can integrate into scientific culture is not going to cure everything but may increase the likelihood of it better rather than worse outcome competition or diminish their Competitive Edge we were going to need to need to hold its and it's really hard but we have a window of opportunity now to try to get henna been like as we have chemical weapons biological weapons nuclear weapons where we've had International standards that have roughly held and then there was a time when slavery was the norm and there was a movement to say this is this is wrong and it was largely successful so we history of being more successful rather than than last I think that's the goal but you're right and this is a race technology and the best value is my real concern about artificial intelligence paradigm-shifting moment will happen before we recognize its happen again and then it'll be too late yes that's exactly like I said in the book that's why I'm out on the road so much talking to people like I buy such an honor for me to be in pleasure for me to be here we have to reach out. If you know people can't be afraid of entering this conversation because it feels too technical or feels like it's somebody else's business this is all of our business because this is all of our Lives it's all of our futures so if in the future you think 20 years to thing that's going to really change the most is predictive genetic predict accurately Health what do you know when light Health in lamp for all the stuff in the thing that we have to avoid the most so one is as I mentioned this determinism just because if we just kind of take our sense of wonder about what it means to be a human away like that's really going to have to harm us we talked about equity and access to these Technologies and don't even need to be real in order to have a negative impact so in India there are no see navigate genetic differences between people in different castes but the caste system has been maintained for thousands of years because people just have accepted these these differences so this is a whole new way of understanding what is a human and it's really going to be complicated we aren't ready for when I ready for it culturally we aren't ready for it to educational a certainly our political leaders on paying much of any attention to all this really huge job so when you and you give the speech to Congress what what are you anticipating from them in terms of liquid what do you think that there's anything they can do now so a few things one is we need to have a National Education campaign, this is so important I would say it's on the future of genetics Revolution and of AI because I think it's crazy that we aren't focusing on days like I I learned French in in grade school and high school and I'm happy to speak French but I would rather have people say this is really important stuff so that's that's number one number two is we need to make sure that we have a functioning regulatory system and in this country every country and I do a lot of of comparative work and like the United Kingdom they're really well-organized have a national healthcare system which allows them at a national level to kind of think about long-term care and they and trade-offs in this country average person changes Health Plans every 18 months and I was talking with somebody the other night and they were they were working on it at predictive Health company and they said their first idea what they were going to sell this information to a health insurance because I wouldn't it be great if you could hell if you're a health insurer and you could you had somebody who is your client and you could say hey here's some information you can live healthier and you're not going to have this disease 20 years from now when he found out is the health insurance we found out is the health insurance they could have cared less because people were just there only going to be part of it for a year-and-a-half so we really need to think differently about how do we invest in people over the course of their lives and he certainly education is one but thinking long-term about health and well-being is another</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> there's a real a thought and this is something at Terence McKenna described way back in the late 90s early 2000 he believe that you're going to be able to recreate a lot of psychedelic States through virtual reality so that people that don't want to actually do a drug will be like to experience what it's like to be on that drug and that I mean that's it's very theoretical and hypothetical and you know who knows whether or not that's possible but that could be one other way that you move beings interface with technology so humans in my view are far more hackable than we think that that there are so many that we just imagine our biology is being fixed our biology is really variable like I have a friend who's an anesthesiologist at Stanford and she's done this experiment using just running just like very mild electric current through people brains and people have these very real experiences and whether it's arousal or something that it that you're answering people's minds two different ways so we can talk about that virtual reality we are entering a world where the pixelation of virtual reality will be equal to life and that's how you're going to be in this VR space and it says it will look it may smell it could have with haptic suits it may feel just like life I don't know if you've done these things with these VR glasses where you go and you can see people you just like you know in a hole and you put on the glasses and now you're in an elevator going to the top on the outside like a window cleaners Eldridge the top of this high-rise and there's a little rickety board and then there's this cat at the end of the board and they're saying that you have to go go save the cat and you've already seen that in a hall you know it in your brain there's this cat everybody's looking at you and you seen all these other people panicking when I'm there I'm going to be so I'm going to go grab that cat and you're terrified like you're trying to override your lizard brain and your little thing like no don't step technology is going to be changing our sense of reality and then what's real like if you feel arousal in your brain because of electric current where you feel it because you're with your girlfriend or wife or reading a magazine or whatever is that different is one real and one not real that I think that this is real people from doing the Ray Kurzweil deal in the downloading yourself into this Dimension not much to do a full download or not that's an open question but whether people are going to be more comfortable living in these alternative World experiences every bit as real in that world as in our world and people don't know that's not real those those aren't your friends like even now like you know we all people with global live these friends I have a good friend and Mongolia we talk all the time do you ever see them in person four things get weird it's true but let's just say I find that hypothetical you have that person they're part of your whole life and you're there with you there if they with you through your life experiences you called them up when you're sad but if it's so essential that you've met that person physically like is that the core of what it means to be someone's friend that you was not essential but it means a lot and we are these virtual be figuring out what the balance is going to be really tricky yeah what is the balance like what I'm worried about augmented reality to him you know when you see people that use Snapchat filters and they give themselves dog years and stuff like that like that what how long before that is just something that people choose to turn on or turn off about life itself yeah you'll be able to see the world through different lenses could be a different color be different color my right about this in one of my novels Eternal Sonata where I think we're just going to have these contact lenses and I'm and it'll be different kinds of information based on what people want me to like I'll meet with you and it'll say alright this is Joe here's a little bit of background whatever and then we'll have useful information or you're walking around the city and you'll be get little alerts of things he might do or history Adidas with so annoying that people actually killed people to weird yeah yeah yeah just do everybody felt like they were getting film to a were you but you're walking around with Google glasses on you assume the people recording everything scary strength all of our lives are going to be recorded now do you think that that's going to come in the form of a contact lens or do you think it's going to come in the form of like ski goggles that you going to put on and if you don't want to look like an idiot and so in the beginning beginning all these you talk about Michael Douglas it is only like that my favorite one is is Kurt Russell in Escape From New York what do you have there really cool to finally gets out of this Manhattan Helm and he's got this phone and it's like this big yeah I think it's like an attachment Ernest and accessory to a phone yeah it's like you can bring it with you in the back by not a ring your other phone that's the idea behind it yeah so you can decide where I'm going out let me just bring my tiny phone yeah right in your nerves any kind of crazy stuff going to happen it will take some of it won't it seems like we're going to have to see how it plays out that's one of the things when you're talkin about scientist that are working on these think they're working on what's right in front of them they're not looking at greater landscape itself in terms of like at the future holds problems but we need to figure out the future what you do so we'll certainly and we need to have a mix of different kinds of people until I certainly do people like me who are kind of big-picture futurist we need that we need scientists I work with some really incredible sign it did it an event at Harvard last week with George Church who's kind of like the living Charles Darwin David Sinclair who knows been on this program is offended work on life extension and we need people just from all and so like I would say like we need people we need poor people need people from developing world we need all kinds of people but in terms of the people who are kind of articulating the big picture of the world and what are the challenges that were facing I certainly put myself in that category people like Yuval Noah Harari in a big also can a big thinkers people like Sid Mukherjee and I just have to articulate the big picture we have to do it in a way so the people a big also can a big thinkers people like Sid Mukherjee and we have to articulate the big picture we have to do it in a way so that people can see themselves in this story and then and then enter into the conversation</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the backyard beer corepoint and that's the reason why I also write science fiction is that the world of science is changing so fast that we really need to apply a lot of imagination to imagine where it's going to that you're just looking at what's happening now it's like this train is going to speed by we have to kind of a mad just like Wayne Gretzky have to imagine where the puck is going to be not where it is now. I mention George Church who's like he's at Harvard he's like the living Charles Darwin and I do a lot of speed alongside George and it's become my little thing that he says that he reads science fiction like mine and then imagine says what is pretty cool how can we do that what I do is I look at the research coming out of labs like Georges nice I will that's where we are now what's that going to mean in 2050 plays a more important role than it ever has in imagining where we're going and it's that imagining that allow just to try to table what if that's one of the options of where we're going what are the decisions that we need to make now so that we can have a better outcome rather than a person if you were gambling person I don't know if you are get it if I had to give you a hundred bucks to put on something in 20 years is going to be profoundly just at change is going to change us in a way that is something that we are not really prepared understand deal with what you think that's going to be I think it's going to be predictive genetics they were going to have all right now it's like you go to your doctor when you're sick you could have been this could have been some genetic disorder that you had from the moment you were conceived and it was ticking it was ticking and you showed up 50 years later when that's been manifest so it's going to be very different you're taking your kid home from the hospital your newborn and the doctor says Hey congratulations this is really just FYI that your kid has a 50% greater than average chance of getting early onset Alzheimer's 50 years from now and your cat your kid has a really great chance of being phenomenal abstract math like how are we going to think about how I think about what it means to be human when we have all that information in their things now that we called fate and it's it's it's a just a different model and so I think that and once we have that that's going to change a lot of things is going to fundamentally why are Healthcare movie called Healthcare Now is really sick care you show up with the symptoms and is it going to be predictive and it's going to change the way with the way we make babies because people are going to have real choices about which embryos to implant and we're going to have a lot of information about a lot of really intimate stuff so you feel like genetic manipulation and genetic engineering genetic understanding genetic knowledge and then applied genetic medicine yet so there's going to be the big changes in the next 20 years even more so than technology what is interconnected rings with these it is really it's like a super convergence of these technology so that the genetics Revolution is the artificial intelligence revolution in the sense that the complexity of genetics is so great it's Way Beyond what our brains on their own could process and so really there all these Technologies are touching each other and so the biological models are now influencing the AI so for example we are coming to the limits of silicon but DNA has unlimited storage capacity so we had before the game ended the boundaries between biology and AI genetics and AI is going to be very blurry you have that is an interesting concept brought the idea of storing information mdna and that done has been discussed ever imagined interact with all the rest of stuff that's already well I mean if you can do it in your body you could doesn't have to run in your body and stomach like you're in your DNA has 4 billion years of history and it's done a great job of recording it it seems that you have all that data inside your head and that's also when people that make when they try to understand instincts that people have that these are some sort of I clean coated memories right with some understanding of things that are dangerous and that these they're they're in there because this is how we've learned over the years without actually having to experiencing sites personally all these Komodo dragons like the most deadly creatures on Earth and there's like some little guy with little stick and it's like how effective is that sick at work so you just walking around walking around when they're not killing people or killing them they're just sitting there and berries bag and then forgets where the egg is and then let's just say that this egg hatches and does little Komodo dragon comes out in the mother sees her own baby Komodo dragon she'll eat it in a second and so if you're a Komodo dragon you better have your entire survival strategy baked into your DNA cuz nobody teaching and so for us do we have this sense that it's like parenting is really environment is really important it is but so much of who and what we are is baked into our genetics and I ain't that that's going to be the challenge we're going to see ourselves as increasingly genetic beings we can't become genetic determinant think they were just genetics the we're going to know a lot more we're going to demystify a lot of what it means to be human the randomness of life because that's what people are concerned with right now if if we have some sort of genetic uniformity especially in particular look like things like intelligence and athletic performance we're not going to appreciate freaks as much and maybe we'll all want to be free but how are we going to think about constructing societies when it's up to us like if we are going to say we've value certain people certain ideas I think we're going to need artists like right now people like artists are sometimes in the Main Street and sometimes they're on different but artists are going to be maybe the most important people in this new world like right now in hospitals you have kind of a hierarchy and like the most technical people of the people who are valued the most and the least technical people like some of the nurses or nurses aides are the people who are often. and paid the least but when technology can do these technological seats what's going to be left is how can we be great humans how can we amode how can we connect how can we create art and if we get Swept Away by the tide of science as and you know how excited I am about this we could really undermine our Humanity humans what humans value is many aspects of humanity literature things that we we we when you read someone's great Pros your reading like an inside into their mind and that's what's interesting about it right and like yes you're not going to get that from just ones and zeros and even if we can do a genetic analysis of Shakespeare and Mozart and and whatever it's still miraculous and need to celebrate that and we can't allow us to say that we are just our genetics or even just our biology but we also can't just a biology has nothing to do with it especially because we're going to know more about our biology know about art are our differences in it that's normal and then used to be in the old days they have 151 God is weather and now we understand whether pretty much anything all that lightning that's God we make sure that we keep this view of life that we have Artisan humanists who are just at the core of this conversation about where we're going what if that mystery ultimately turns out to just be ignorance and that as you develop more and more understanding there's less and less mystery would we like to be less smart while we like to be more overwhelmed by possibility mean wake up every morning before we just don't know the answer and there's some people like but you're going back to the issues of Life Extension there are some people who say well that death is essential for appreciating life I die talk about the stuff all around and I'm in there people who say you and you're talking about eliminating these terrible diseases but I know somebody who had that terrible disease and their suffering with a gift to everybody else because we all had more Humanity in response to their suffering it look screwed up I prefer them to not have that suffering but there's people are thinking why I can hit wacky but we need to like I totally agree with you that if we allow ourselves to get swept away with his kind of scientific determinism if we don't say we really value our humanistic Traditions our artists are cultures we could get lost and become obsolete used to think man can become a human will become less monkey you don't know being looks in the mirror and recognizes that they are evolving but we've only been Homo sapiens or about 300,000 years for high school biology it's really hard for people to imagine being something else in that is outside of our of our Consciousness and so did she will Square yeah charts from high school biology it's really hard for people to imagine being something else in that it's outside of our of our Consciousness into said she will Square yeah and we are monkeys we redefined are monkey thing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> are you aware of Elon Musk neuralink check technology how much do you know about it my friend Brian Johnson he has a company Colonel is a few different companies that are trying to think about these brain-machine interfaces and what are they trying to do basically what they're trying to do is to find a way to connect our brains to our machines and there's a little bit of progress in our brains are they're incredibly complicated and they're messy I mean it there there's a lot that that that that's happening but we are in recently figuring out how to connect our brains to our technology and so people are imagining a time when we can do things like download download Memories download ideas or upload memories and upload that isn't there some very early science that is too guessing that this will be possible that it's it's still very early days the very early days but he alone was giving the impression that sometime this year they're going to release something really something but it's not going to be something that's going to change the world his business that technology is way more nascent than even the genetic technology that I'm that I've been talked about it's not like it's remotely possible that this year you're going to be able to upload a full memory or download a little things that are happening but the technology is fairly transparent in terms of like where the state-of-the-art is right now it is in that it's extremely early this stuff is really so when you think of it systems that we understand I mention that we understand just a little bit about genomics we know less about the brain the brain is kind of the great unknown of this unit we know more about the ocean that we know about our brain very very little we understand if you stick an electric current in somebody's brain like that can I view if you shoot a spike through somebody's had to really understanding how the functions if we're still in the very early days so do you think the Kurzweil is off with this idea that you're going to be able to download your Consciousness into a computer cuz that's one of those controversial ideas that he's come up with right I think he's I think he's off based on your use of the word you're so I mentioned it a month ago I was in Kyoto and I was at this at the stem cell lab but I also went to another lab of a guy named Hiroshi ishiguro who's the world's League humanoid robot assist and so he's the guy who's on the cover of wired and he's created these robot avatars and like I had a conversation with this this robot woman Erica and it's really interesting cuz I could see if I would smile sheet smile and lean forward if I had like a exaggerated :-( she's like change her expression and she can have like a basic basic conversations having full robust I had this before by human interactions but I had this debate with issue girl and he was saying that he thought that the future of humanity was non-biological that we are going to unload ourselves into these non biological entities and that is how we would gain our immortality and I admire my argued something very different I feel like we are biological beings I think will fully integrate with our technology but if we ever become entirely non-biological and that's not us either who lived committed suicide as a species or these robots are they will have killed us because even if let's just say that I could download my entire Consciousness to some kind of robot unless it's a that was possible that robot would be me for that first exact moment when the transfer happened then then beyond that they wouldn't be me anymore because there be a whole other set of certainly interaction of connectivity with this Tech is going to be greater and so even if Kurzweil isn't exactly right he's directionally right the other problem would be that you would be locked and if they downloaded your Consciousness into some sort of a bank of computer somewhere right where are you if that's your consciousness suffer for all eternity download you while you sleep it's just that I have something worse than that okay yes and I think that nobody is going to say what I'm going to be Joe living a life or I'm going to like not be Joe and I'll just have my Consciousness download it someplace else and so if the comparison is well I've lived this life and I don't want to die until I rather be here in some kind of version and even if it's not me this something some people will want that not everybody on people will but they don't know what they're getting right in terms of you don't know what that experience is going to be like at 9 or do you know if there is some sort of a chemical Gateway that happens in the mind when that new expire and allows you to pass through to the other dimension that your Consciousness in your soul long to travel to but no u we'll just because I think that this kind of immortality comes because time stops time is relative concept into at the moment that you died that's immortality for you because time stops flowing for you time is that's what Einstein told his time is this relative concept other people they're legitimately and there's no way to prove it feel that we have this solo on this Soul can travel to other other dimensions I happen to believe that we are biological beings and our experience of the Soul memory distal on this Soul can travel to other other dimensions I happen to believe that we are biological beings and our experience of the Soul memory is connected to our biology when our biology stops functioning those experiences whatever they are stop being acceptable at least to us</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you have any psychedelic experiences I have it and I was so tempted started the interview talking about my chocolate on him I haven't I was really want to I don't think so and I'll tell you why so I listened to the Michael Palin interviews and he had his great in conversation with Sam Harris and I really think that this psilocybin stuff is is real and just got decriminalize as I said before I think that the ultimate drug is us and so for me I would rather and I definitely think that our awareness that doesn't Encompass everything that is knowable everything tweet that we could know but we have ourselves in and if we want to get out of those limitations certainly drugs are ways that people used for for many thousands of years but when you take the drug you're like taking the drug like I would rather what does it mean if you're taking psilocybin you're having this great experience but then tomorrow you're not taking psilocybin and so kind of your Consciousness has near my aspiration would be to recognize that the drug is us then you want to expand our Consciousness there are all kinds of ways whether it's meditation or awareness or just simple appreciation that's when I do these ceremonies what I'd say is like you have this in front of you but if not just this think of the person in Honduras who planted the seed the person who water that see the person who took the plants the person who paved the road to bring the pie and I just I just think that we can expand our Consciousness through our own mean and they always have like that getting in your not on anymore because I profoundly invent wind chill for the your perspective in regards to the whole rest of your existence as many people that have had psychedelic experience think about it as a rebirth that they've gone through this and changed again so we'll why would you have this rigid thought process about drugs and not drug in but yet you don't have it about you which is a mild drug how many people have described are good friends of mine who really done and I've really I've talked to them about and I'm running endlessly curious why don't you do it the reason is so far I have been on this journey to see what's possible Within Myself and I've done still on that Journey I'm not I don't have clothes off any possibility for work experience that other people found to be profoundly honcho so so far you're very resistant to this like you can't talk to me like yeah yeah yeah you can't wait to come back with your own rational right back to one of my closest friends is the prime minister of the many times to John's tala and indy I've met with his Holiness the Dalai Lama many times and the most incredible thing about meeting with these guys and they they are all people who found these incredible states of of heightened Consciousness so much that their brains are changed when they go into the the fmri machine but when you have a conversation with them it's not like we do like you exactly and thank you for calling out like you say something I've already in my head countered what you're saying is good that's what you what we want and he's guys it's like you talked to them and they would just be so tuned in to what you were saying and they were just kind of think about Nu Finish and then they kind of look up and then because we're Americans we we we want to know somebody stop speaking like you have to if you don't speak right away and then he was like a minute and then it's like you're kind of looking around with it and then they would come back with this incredibly thoughtful you're right want to close off any possibility there many different things that we could could do the path that I have been on and certainly with this cacao you write Cacao is like a a mild not a huge one but a child to a different identity different Consciousness and now he said I don't do psilocybin but I do daily meditation but I can see where I'd like to go what's possible so I I get there you know there's a bunch of different substances out there that have very similar profound Friday different Consciousness and now he said I don't do psilocybin but I do daily meditation but I can see where I'd like to go with possible so I I get them there's a bunch of different substances out there that have very similar profound</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how do you think it's going to play out in terms of how people various religions perceive this down so where there's a real variation so there are people on one end of the spectrum to believe that this is quote-unquote playing God and if you believe that the world was created exactly as it is by some kind of of divine force and that it's wrong for humans to change to to quote on quote play God it's hard to explain how you could justify everything that we've done it we've changed the face of this life on this planet Earth but I really respect people who say look I think that there's a line that you know that I believe that life begins at conception and that any kind of manipulation after conception is interfering that's going too far and I respect that and those people need to have a seat at the table and that's in there certainly very strong religious views in Judaism there's an idea called which means the world is created cracked and broken it is the responsibility of each person to try to fix it and that's a justification for using science and doing things to try to make the world a better place and then there are now these new kind of transhumanism it's almost like a religion it's this religion of Science and so we are going to have where humans were so diverse we are going to have this level of diversity in the challenges and how do we make have a process that brings brings everybody in but it's it's tough so when we're talking about genetic any sort of genetic manipulation we're basically talking about doing stuff to the wet we're doing that up to the biology right what do you think about symbiotic interaction that technology cuz I shouldn't want to think that I'm concerned with more than anything is this sort of inevitable path of Technology getting into our bodies whether it's through Nanobots get its diseases or a true implementation we were talking yesterday about chip right like what would what would they have to do to get you to get it put a chip in your body like what and what kind of powers would it have I have before you accepted it now people already doing it in Sweden little chips in their hands in their and under the skin that using it to open doors and access things I'm so it's just starting to I definitely believe you right now you look at me look at the photographs of our parents and your hair your clothes that's crazy definitely I think that look at pictures about say what's that little rectangular thing and you're going to say that was a phone what in the carried around in our pocket and like Michael Douglas new people say well aren't you wouldn't what is human genetic engineering have to do when we know that AI is going to get more and more powerful than the future of technology future of all of this is not human or AI it's human + Ai and that is what's going to drive or we record all them with our technology and that's what's going to drive our Drive Usborne but you're exactly right to be afraid and to be concerned and again everything else so how are we going to regulated where are we going to have guardrails of how far is too far we going to let companies just do whatever they want or we going to put restrictions on what they can do I think letting the whole world decide though you're you're going to run his religious roadblocks if for sure and now and that's the challenges that the science is advancing exponentially whatever we do and so we have to have our understanding of the science needs to at least try to keep Pace regulations need to keep up on part of the World Health Organization International advisory committee Human Genome editing meeting six times this year in Geneva and the question that were asking is how do we think about global regulation at least to try to put limits on the far ends of what's possible and it's it's really really difficult but that's why we need to have this kind of process and it seems impossibly ambitious but every crazy idea has to begin somewhere so you're doing every couple months yeah yes wow yeah cuz if you want to be on top of it as things change that's the goal it's so hard because even the World Health Organization of the United Nations if not enough the task is so much bigger and that's why we need to have this kind of grub bottom of Groundswell that I'm pushing for you're absolutely right when you said before like 8 because there's not a crisis people are focusing on other things open any news sites like what do you see not like the really important stuff it's Trump did this or cardassians did that and I were in this culture where there a lot of drawers on our attention but sometimes there's really important stuff and people are afraid of it people are afraid of science people who I didn't like it is uncomfortable your this is this is for technical people and we can't science is so deeply transform in the world not just around us but within us and so we have to understanding people who are explaining signs like me the onus is on us like if somebody read my book until that was really dense that was too hard like that's my failure I got was giving a talk in New York. Couple of a couple of weeks ago until I gave my my talk and I'd try to make this really accessible for people who were all jazzed up that got it and then there was this wonderful guys brilliant senior scientist major stem cell research center and so the they they host said that Jamie just talked can you side can you get a little background on the side guy knows so much sand he started going and it was very technical and you can see the faces with people in the audience who was like oh God what's Happening Here by and large to communicate and Kyoto in in Japan I went to the laboratory of the world's leading scientists who's doing the process of what I mentioned earlier I'm turning adult cells into stem cells into eggs and so this this will revolutionize the way humans reproduce until I had was in a meeting with his top postdocs do so these are like really The Cutting Edge of these Technologies and I went around each of them I said here's my question a few questions for you to be one tell me what you're doing now and 2 tell me what are the implications of what you're doing now for 50 years from now and for his first question is all I'm doing this and we're doing this with mouse models people are so animated and then 50 years enough people just froze and it was so uncomfortable like squeezing the table just cuz that's not what scientist do they're trying to say well this is the thing just in front of me so I thought I was writing this book for the general public but I'm being invited to speak to thousands of doctors and scientists because isn't the doctors and scientists because what they're saying is we get that we're doing this little piece of this and whether it's lab research or fertility doctors or also or something but it's really hard to put together the whole story of the genetics Revolution and what it means for us and for society</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah man that is interesting about scientists right there just concentrate on the task at hand yeah I mean wasn't that that was like one of the big concerns about the Manhattan Project right this is the task that I have to tell you I figure out how to do it so they figure out how to do it not the eventual Oppenheimer English translation was holy s*** and and that's in this science is real but it's not going to be as not one person doing it means that's the whole thing like science has been diffused at least with it with nuclear power is a relatively small number of people and it was a one or two states that could do it now with this Precision gene-editing when you get The Nobel Prize for for figuring out how to do it Nobel Prize for figuring out how to do crispr Gene edits but to apply it once the formula already exists you get like an A minus in your high school biology class so this technology is out there it's cheap it's accessible did you go to the 2045 conference in Manhattan a couple years back do you know about all that 2044 that's that's part of the thing with these transhumanist for right they believe that with their own cow relations of the exponential in technology that somewhere around 24 you find the very least we're going to reach this point where you going to be able to either download Consciousness I have some sort of an artificially intelligent sentient Reigns hanging out with you one of the programs of Singularity university called exponential medicine and so we're thinking a lot about that a few weeks ago imagining a visit to Africa in the year 2045 and again because we're on this exponential change is really hard for people to to internalize to kind of feel how fast these changes are coming I do think though Ray Kurzweil who's who's a really big credible genius he thinks that we are soon going to get to a point now where are artificial intelligence is self learning because when you think about it if it gets to the point where he can read something read and comprehend like in seconds read every book ever written in June and then it says it be when you have all these doubling and all this more knowledge you can imagine how that would happen pretty quickly that the counter argument against and I think that it will but I don't think that word that they are human brains are on one hand they're incredibly complex and they're also kind of irrational do we have all these different lizard brain and every decision that we make a rational decision but then there's all the other stuff that our brains can rise to the level of our awareness that are that our brains are processing and right now we don't really have one really effective artificial intelligence algorithm which is for pattern recognition but if you think of pattern recognition is a core skill of what our brain to our friends. We have a thousand to thousand different skills but the core thing is whether we reach the singularity moment or not these Technologies going to become incredibly more powerful they're going to become increasingly into into our lives and into our beings and part of our evolutionary process there's no longer a we just have our biological evolution and our technological Evolution those are separate think they're connected it's going to be that weird question of whether or not it's an artificial intelligence is going to be able to absorb all of the writing that human beings I've ever done it really understand us yeah will they really still be able to understand us just because they get all the writing so right now you would say no but he could come up with a reasonable facsimile I mean they could figure out a way to get it close enough yeah you know where it's like her like that they're imagining like an intimate relationship with some artificial intelligence intelligence it feels just like a human. I don't think that's going to happen wouldn't want a eyes with these brains like we have that have all these different impulses that are kind of imagining all this this crazy stuff we may want them to be more rational than then we are so like chimpanzees are our closest relatives they don't think just like us we're not expecting them to think like they're their own thing I think he will be there will we be interacting with them will we be having sex with them yes but it's there it's not going to be that they're just like us we're going to they're going to be these David live within us live with us and together we're going to evolve well they're certainly already better at doing certain things like playing chess and it took a long time for an artificial intelligence to be able to compete against a real chess master but now they smoke them no human could ever compete and then they said well there's this Chinese game of Go which kind of people here look at it looks kind of like Checkers but it's actually way more sophisticated way more complicated than chess I heard that there are more moves in go more potential I was in there are stars in the yes yes so they had alphago that this company deepmind which there was later acquired by Google they built this algorithm that in 2016 defeated the World Champ people thought that was we were decades away and then deepmind created this new program called alphazero and Alpha zeros with alphago they gave it access to all of the digitized games of go so it ain't very quickly was able to learn from how everybody else had played go alphazero they just said here is a basic rules of Go and they let alphago chess play against itself with no other experience other than here are the rules and play get it in days alphazero destroyed alphago and then he'll thinness alpha0 destroyed the world champions of Chess and Destroy every other computer program that has ever play chess in this again does computer program pet internalized all the chess games of grand Masters alphazero had not internalize any it just played against itself for a few days and then shogi which is a Japanese traditional game kind of like chest the Grandmasters of Fatso the world is changing is changing so much faster than we anticipated we have to be as ready for that as we can I think we need to come to go to the fact we're way stupider than we think you are what we think we're really intelligent and we are in comparison to everything else on this planet but in comparison to what is possible we are really f****** dumb in comparison to what this computer can do and what the the future of that can be and what may be that computers going to redesign another computer and this is good I've got some I got some pickups here yeah technology serves our needs rather than undermines our needs you know whether or not our needs supersede the needs of the human race or supersedes the needs of the planet we're almost too much champ right into contemplate these how it's going to unfold from here on out we really might not we but the people that are actually at the tip of the Spear of the stuff that really might affecting the way the planet is shaped as years from now and we're doing that now I mean we are there is an article came out the other day there's a million species are on the verge of Extinction we are driving all these other species to Extinction we're warming the planet so this is humans are that the determining factor in many ways for how this planet plays out and that's why it my man everything comes back to God you're right we have the lizard nature this does monkey nature it's it's who we are and that's me you wouldn't want to take that away because that's the core of what we are and yet we are also a species that has created philosophy we create a beautiful religion and traditions and art and the question is which version of us is going to lead us into the future if it's this new tribal primate with these urges like that's really frightening if we can say that we've done better and worse than his that is terrible second world war and yet at the end of the second world war with American leadership the world came together we established that United Nations established these concept of Human Rights like you can't just kill everybody in your own country and say hey it's it's just my business so we have this capability but it's always a struggle many of these forces are always at war with each other anyways it's just too much to think about amusing to me is that we seem to have this insatiable desire to improve things and I've always wondered why like it is that maybe because this is what human beings are here for it's what we do you know we are a product intelligent trying to survive against nature predators and weather and all the other different issues that we came up that we evolved growing up and dealing with it and then now we just want things to be better we just want things to be more convenient faster but more data</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah unintended consequences are something that I've been taking very seriously lately when I'm paying attention to technology as a as it's used in social media I am particularly disturbing me quite a bit over the last few weeks is that there's a model that they use and not intentionally but there's a model that they use to get people upset about things show you things in your feed that you argue against B that makes you click on the more and yet engage in them or and because of the fact that we have is Advertiser based model for people trying to get clicks because they want to get ads on their page in the more clicks they get the more money they get from Those ads and so they want incentivize people to go there and the best way through the algorithm would they found without doing it on purpose is to get people upset information an accepted part of our Lives did you go to check your Google feed on your Facebook feed and I'll blood that what the f*** are they doing that's real they going to ask this goddamn it and then you get mad and I you engage with people online and then it resulted in more Revenue but getting them to stop that if you had to go to Facebook and say hey hey Mark Zuckerberg you have a hundred billion dollars whatever you got but you can't make any more money this way right because what you do is f****** up Society happy to be upset and arguments and you're doing it at great financial reward but great societal cost. And so far out of hand it's so far away from where it is it's literally effect and global politics one option is to break it up that did it seems to work pretty well with AT&amp;T another option is to regulate has which eye is at in my mind would be a better approach and that is to say here's what's okay and here's what's not okay and this stuff is really intricate if they're really get down beneath these algorithms which are unbelievably complex that you're exactly right and what we're seeing now is we are being pushed into it I said information ghetto but it's like information put into camps and it's so dangerous because the old man is this country is based on not everybody agreeing but having a processor people coming they work it out and they say you don't not perfectly happy with this outcome but here's a compromise and if we can't compromise and arm Civic culture is going to break down and under your Society Society very very different everyone's life experiences we we kind of take for granted you can go out the door walk to Starbucks and and not get shot or you can you have your house something happen your house gets robbed you call the police and the police aren't the ones who robbed your house or they're not in contenders all these kinds of crazy things if we break down the foundations that underpin our life that's really dangerous what I was kind of getting at was that through what this this process of this algorithm how the stock selecting to The Chosen your feed and how people getting upset by this and how this is generating massive amounts of Revenue once it's already happened it's very difficult to stop and my gas turned would be that this would be a similar thing when it comes to genetic engineering we need to be able to put regulations on this we needed to be able to stab a knife but once it gets out of the bag once he gets rolling and I have remember when Mark Zuckerberg sat in front of all those politicians they had no f****** idea what they were. make money as a piss-poor prepares and it just shows you like these are the new little looking out for his good walk and Lucky's are luddites they're dumbasses their pools right and there they don't know anything about almost everyone was underwhelming and under impressive in that here in that hearing yet the fact that they're dealing with one most important moments of our time but they didn't bring on some sort of a legitimate technology expert and do some of the way that the rest of us could end up so they're not going to protect us from genetic engineering either right cuz they're not there. Generalist Scatman terms of education for the most part and they're not they're not concerned is not their concern with raising money for their campaign too concerned with getting re-elected that's their concern with I totally agree with you if we wait to focus on this issue until we'll have been made the reason why I wrote this book The reason why yeah I'm on my way almost week 3 of This Book 2 are doing events like this every day is what I am saying and every form that I can is this is really important you can we are watching the news yesterday they had this royal baby in in the UK like I don't give a s*** it doesn't affect my life anymore but what is it play now is the future of our entire species are democracy in our lives and we have to be focusing on those things because we have a moment now where we can it was certain extent influence how these revolutions play out and if we just wait around if we're distracted with focusing on all the stuff that's sucking up our attention and whether it from for brexit or molar and all these things we were spent how much of our time are we spending focus on this fine let's play a little bit of attention but there's really big stuff 50 years from now no one's going to look back and do that was the age of trump 4 billion years of evolution took control their own evolutionary process it is huge and it's going to change all of life and what I'm trying to do is to say everybody has to have a seat at the table whether you're a gay gay Conservative Christian whether you're a biohacking transhumanist everybody needs to be at the the table because we were talking about is the future of our species were talking about the future of our species but are we even capable of understanding the consequences of these actions this the stuff that we're discussing like right now I'm not like I'm talking about it right I mean if someone said hey you going to go speak in front of people about the consequences of rain in a very clear at 1 our presentation I'd like to know I'm not well what I'm talking about when we can go together so you're good thank you the reason why I've written this book hacking Darwin is I wanted to see if you could read just one book and it's written just for everybody and a very clear way with lot of jokes that I think are finding my mother laughed at them as well that you get it and then once you know just the basics as a human being anybody it has an equal right to be part of this of this conversation as the top scientist or the the leaders of any of any country I would agree with you there. But I don't think that other people are going to see it that way I think the people that are in control they're not going to say hey we need to find we need to be fair with everyone all the citizens the world how do you feel we should proceed them but that's why we have to that's why we need to if people people aren't even aware of what the issues are and that's and that's the challenge and that's why forms like yours or are just so important when you have all of these people and then you maybe if one doesn't listen to this podcast. I get it I can go give that everyone speech but you can read a couple books and then you can give him an hour speed issues like yes there are scientific issues but this isn't a conversation about values and ethics in a conversation for everybody the scientific conversation is a conversation about the future of this species in the other species will be home and that's something we're holy unqualified as a species we've never been this educated I don't think either I really do. on average. And we've never been disconnected so we have it so I climb the book I call for a species y Dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering 7 billion people on Earth how are they going to do that but we have the opportunity we have to try because you don't want to look at the beginning of the gently modified crops are the scientists were actually really responsible but regular people weren't consulted and get it to me modified organisms that we are entering the ear of genetically modified humans and that's going to scare the s*** out of people and so we need to start preparing and we need to make people feel the respected and included and our government leaders aren't going to do it for us so we have to find ways of engaging ourselves and that's why with me with the book I set up a website where people can share their views debate with other people I really want everybody to be part of this conversation and included in our government leaders aren't going to do it for us so we have to find ways of engaging ourselves nuts y with me with the book I set up a website where people can share their views debate with other people I really want everybody to be part of this conversation</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what makes you nervous about this alright three big areas first humans and all of us incredibly complex may I talk about genetic code which is mind-bogglingly complex but our genetics exist within the incredible incredibly complex systems biology we have all these things like our microbiome are viral Mar proteome our metabolism and then that exist within the context of our environment everything. changing an in and interacting it so we are messing up their tools to mess and we will mess because we're this hubristic species with these really complex ecosystems including ourselves we don't fully understand that's number one too and you mentioned it before this issue of equity what happens if we had every technology has to have first adopters if you don't have it you never get the technology but what happens if a group of people move much more quickly than other people dangerous societal changes in the third degree is diversity we think about diversity we think it's great to have diverse workplaces and schools and and we're more better people for it and we're more competitive is something much much much cheaper in darwinian terms diversity is random mutation like that's our core survival strategy as a species if we didn't have that you could say we'd still be single cell organisms we wouldn't we would have died because the environment would have changed and we wouldn't have had the Dolton resilience to adapt yeah that is really important think about diversity right now we we need a non-uniformity when it comes to our own biology yeah because he's a bunch of different kinds of people have to have it because even if we optimized for this world the world will take there's no good and bad in evolution there's just well suited for a particular environment that environment changes the best suited person four-year-old environment may be the least suited person for the new in Visalia real like really great ideas now like optimizing health so if you have sickle cell disease you're probably going to die and you're going to die young and it's going to be excruciating excruciating painful and so you would say well let's just get rid of sickle cell disease which we can do but if you are a recessive carrier of the single of the Sickle Cell Gene you don't have it you're just carrying it and you have a pretty significant to your kids but you also have an additional to malaria and so we are probably are almost certainly carrying around all kinds of recessive traits maybe the ones that we don't like that are harming us now but they could be some protection against some future danger that we don't yet understand how our haven't faced and so the challenges that diversity has just happened us for 4 billion years know we're going to have to choose it and that's a big a big challenge was so we're going to have without doubt some unintended consequences some unintended domino effect things that are going to take place that we really can't predict we just have to kind of go along with this technology and see where it leads us as it improves don't you go back and look at surgeries from the 1950s comparison of surgery of 2019 giant leaps I would never advise someone to get their knee operated by a 1950s position someone's going to have to be an early adopter when it comes to these therapies I agree with you but where I would slightly around would add to what you're saying is these Technologies they're going to happen they're going to play on what did play now is not where these Technologies are going to advance day will it will do it they will dance in a way that is going to just blow people's minds. Whatsit play is what are the values that we are going to weave into the decision-making process so we can get a better outcome do they will dance in a way that is going to just blow people's minds. Whatsit play is what are the values that we are going to weave into the decision-making process so we can get a better outcome than we otherwise would have had and that's was in my view but that's the real important you know</div>

normal color therapy and it's a small number of Gene probably but we are messing with very complex system that we don't fully understand and then that's why there's a lot of unknowns are coming back

that you can think of there is a range and you're crazy on the left and crazy on the right and crazy people are going to want to do things and the question is for the any society what do we think is okay and what do you think is not okay and maybe there should be some I believe there should be limit to how far people can go with experimenting possibly likely on themselves to certainly on their future children certainly future children do whatever you want if you really want maybe 2525 reality we are the jeddak revolution has already begun and is going to fundamentally change our lives in in three big areas the first is our Healthcare so we're moving from a system of generalized Healthcare based on population averages so that when you go to your doctor you're treated because you're a human toothpaste on average and we're moving to a world of personalized medicine and the foundation of your personalized Healthcare will be your sequence genome in your electronic health record that's how they know you are you and that's all they can say this is a drug this is an intervention that'll work for you we do that then we're going to have to sequence everybody so we're going to have about 2 billion people have had their whole genome sequence within a within a decade never going to be able to compare what did Jean say to how those genes are expressed and then humans become a big data set and that's going to move us from Precision to predicted Health Care where you're going to be just born and you can have all this information your parents have all the time about how certain really important aspects of lifer going to play on some of that is going to be disease related but some of that is going to be life related like you have a better-than-average chance of being really great at mathur having a high IQ low IQ or being a great Sprinter how do we think about that and then again A revolution is already happening when it's going to change the way we make babies were going to get away from sex as the primary mechanism for conceiving our kids will still have sex while the great reasons we do and that's going to open up a whole new world digestive how of applying science now I'm to what it means to be a human with a lot of new possibilities was going to be so freaking when people stop having sex to make kids they make it hasn't a lab every kid's mean the lab would not only that I think we're going to move to an Era an era where people who have to make babies through sex will be seen as taking a risk kind of like people who don't vaccinate their kids with natural tonight's more natural to not vaccinate your kids then to do it that people say wait a sec you're taking on a risk on behalf of your kids about 3% of all kids in the world are born with some kind of harmful genetic abnormality using in vitro fertilization and embryo screening that 3% can be brought down significantly and what happens if you see somebody 20 years from now who has a kid with one of those preventable diseases do you think that's fate or we think those parents they made an ideological decision about how they wanted to conceive their kids moving to some really deep and fundamental changes so well yeah that's that's an interesting conversation of whether or not you get to a point where people don't allow people sort of like people don't allow people to not get vaccinated like there's a lot of that going on that day which is great right you don't want these floating around but what if that gets to the place where we do that with people the people creating new life-forms what if you say Hey you are being irresponsible you just having a tax and having a kid I know that's your grandma did it we don't do it that way in 2099 I think it's going to be hard to do that in this Society like the United States but in a country like North Korea they'll be able to do that make babies however you want but if you make babies the old-fashioned way and if you have some kind of genetic do your kid has some kind of genetic that was preventable we're just not going to cover it with insurance so you're going to have a 10 million-dollar lifetime bill you don't need to you don't need to require something you can create an environment where people's behaviors will change and then they're over there will be increasing social pressures to me right now somebody see some little kid riding around their bicycle without a helmet they're kind of looking at the parents of hey what are you doing how come you don't have a helmet on your kids and I just think they were moving toward this kind of societal change where people will I believe see conceiving their kids in the lab as a saiful safer alternative and it's not just safety because once you do that then that opens you up there to the possibility of all other kinds of applications of Technology not just not just to eliminate risks or prevent disease but you have a lot more information so already it's possible to get to roughly rank-order 15:3 embryos tallest to shortest in a decade from highest genetic component of IQ to lowest genetic component of IQ is very real and very personal what do you think would be the first thing people start manipulating health will be the primary driver because that is what is going to be kind of entry application people wanting to make sure that they are kids don't suffer from terrible genetic diseases and then I think the second will probably be lungevity me right now there's a lot of work going they're going on sequencing people the super agers people who live to their late 90s hundred to identify what were the genetic patterns that these people have so it's like to live to 90 have to do all the things that you Advocate healthy living and whatever but a hundred you really need the genetics to make that possible to go to identify what are some of the genetic patterns that allow you to live those kinds of of long lines should I let its wide-open made it sits higher genetic component like you outgoing personality faster Sprinter when we are humans we are primarily genetic beings and we are going to be able to look under the hood of what it means to be human will have these incredible choices and and we have it's a huge responsibility how long do you think before we have a person with four arms to take a long time the real driver there's two two primary drivers one will be embryo selection the right now average woman going through IVF has about 15 eggs extracted and then in IVF in vitro fertilization those eggs are fertilized using the male sperm and an average male ejaculation there's about a billion sperm so so men are just giving it away women not human female mammals are a little bit a little bit stingy then the next killer application using a process called induced pluripotent stem cells and so she knew yamanaka is great Japanese scientist won the 2012 Nobel Prize for developing a way to turn any adult cell into a stem cell to a stem cells a kind of cell it can be anything and so you take the take a skin graft that has millions of cells you induce those that is built adult skin cells into stem cells use these four things called yamanaka factors and so now you have let's call it stem cells and then you can induce those cells into egg precursor cells and then eggs all of a sudden humans are creating eggs like salmon on this huge scales we have a hundred thousand eggs fertilize them with the male sperm in a machine an automated process you grow them for about 5 days and then you sequence cells extracted from each one of those and the cost of genome sequencing in 2003 was a billion dollars an hour $100 is going to be next to nothing within a decade and then you have real options cuz then you get this to put this whole expression algorithm and then you go to the parents table what are your priorities and maybe they'll say while I want health I want longevity I want high IQ when you're choosing from big numbers like that you have some real option and then on top of that then there is this Precision gene-editing the stuff that happened in China last year I think it will be in the rain coming back your question about forearms I think it's going to be ideas to look like Chris Bergan if you use someone's going to sit at the computer and say like more arms and three heads and wings and and whatever it's pretty hard because human biology is incredibly complicated and we we we always no more the worth of the very beginning of understanding the full complexity of human biology enough to make these big kind of changed finisher choosing from 100000 fertilized eggs are all your natural kids yeah and then you would get the best of them and then work on the exactly that's exactly the amount you get that and then you say alright what if you have like 20 sons that were awesome and they didn't tell you about 18 of them when you kept two of them and 18 of them shipped off to some military industrial complex turn them into assassins live in regulated environment so like now think of the internet and they do in the beginning days the internet people Loyola just let the internet be let you know just let it play out it's going to liberate all of us and now China showing how the internet can be actually be really actively used to suppress people Facebook is just taking people's information to Google it away that's frightening a lot of people feeling hey it shouldn't be that these companies can do whatever they want we have to have some way of establishing limits because not every individual is able to Harley protect themselves they don't have power than have all the information we need some Representatives helping us ago did the real concern is the competition right the real concern is whether or not we do something with reggaeton in regards to regulation that anti-monitor stifle competition on our end and doesn't allow us to compete with Russia and China privacy around the world groupings of countries three models of privacy there's Europe which has the strongest privacy protections for all kinds of data including genetic data there's China that has the weakest and there's the United States that has the middle and the Paradox is from an individual perspective we all are thinking well we kind of want to be like you're up cuz I don't want somebody accessing my personal information especially my genetic information is like my most intimate information but genetics the ultimate big data problem and so you need these big data pools and you to access to dig these big data pools in order to unlock the secrets of genetics over these three different groupings everyone's making a huge bet on the future and the way we're going to know who wins like right now in the in the IT world we have Amazon and Apple and Google knows big companies but whoever gets this BET right they will be the ones who will be leading the way and making a huge amount of money it world we have Amazon and apple Google knows big companies but whoever gets this BET right they will be the ones who will be leading the way and making a huge amount of money on these technology we're talking about is it is it really a multitrillion-dollar industry</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> affect things like competitive Athletics so right now we have this problem someone like Lance Armstrong is he was doing his manipulating his his body and what he's basically doing is adding more red blood cells so that he can carry more oxygen and people feel that that's cheating it is a different topic when's the people take nobody's doing drugs and we sequence all these athletes some of them will just have a natural genetic Advantage their bodies will naturally be doing what lamps are Lance Armstrong had manipulated his body to do you know that's happening with a sprinter right now person who has it was kind of a borderline on between genders and we just kicking the s*** out of all of these women in cage fight against like we have these categories of man and woman we know that the gender identities are more fluid but how do we think about it when these genetic differences confer advantages so if your body is primed to do something. Maybe you could have like a Plato's Republic world where everybody do the function that you are genetically optimized to do and that you could imagine that being a very competitive kind of environment but what do you do if for now in something like the Olympics of somebody had this huge genetic Advantage should be a let somebody else manipulate their bodies are Justin called Gene doping in order to change the expression of genes allow your body to act like you're as Jeanette naturally Connecticut hands to somebody else Westminster Gene doping right now instruct your cells to make proteins that's that is that's how the whole system works so you can change genes or you can trigger the expression of protein so you can get people's bodies to behave as if they had the they are now starting to look at Gene doping and this is the first time that that's that that's even being considered as a category and then there are other people that have done that other people would have done it successfully is looking for it which makes me assume that it must have done but I haven't seen I've looked around I haven't seen any reports kind of everything how's their system of their Olympic sport schools in the way it works is they test kids all around the country so let's just save its it's diving and they identify what are the core skills of a diver what do you need I'm going to go around the country they test kids and then they bring a bunch of them to the Olympic sport schools and then they they get them all involved and then some kids are the best of those kids and the best of those kids menu in advance so rapidly the what happens if doing that but it's at the genetic level and there are countries like Kazakhstan they're already announcing that they are going to be screening all of their athletes that the science isn't there yet so it's really impossible right now to say I want to do a genome sequence of somebody and I know this person has the potential to be an Olympic sprinter but 10 years from now that's not going to be the case of the whole idea of what is fair what is human yeah I mean look it's not like people don't already alter their bodies by training by diet exercise all sorts of different recovery modality and cryotherapy song high elevation training all these different things at the end of that manipulates the human body but it's not like it would be kind of crazy if you had sports but you couldn't practice and you couldn't work out if you want to play Parsons really like no practice no working out the thing is like we are moving it comes back we're saying before about nature nature somehow feels comfortable to us that's what we're used to is all the stuff at 10,000 years ago with all these questions even now look at a sport like competitive weightlifting they they have these like the real competitive bodybuilding and you see these guys and they're they're monsters and then they have these drug-free guys and everybody looks like a yogi freak levels difficult and so maybe we can have some kind of Natural Area light but I think that our our model of what's normal is just going to change cuz like I was saying in the beginning we set our Baseline based on how we grew up and then that it seems about right like it seems about right to us that everybody gets immunizations but immunizations are a form of superpower imagine if our ancestor they couldn't even imagine immunizations what an unfair Advantage when you have a hundred million people dying of Spanish flu so what does all this stuff is scary and it's going to normalize but how it normalizes is is that's what's it playing in all the world is change so much just in the last 20 years but it feels like this is just scratching the surface in comparison to what's coming people Miss understand and they underestimate the rate of change in the reason that they do that is since the beginning of the digital Revolution we have experienced thing called exponential change which is basically computing power roughly doubles every two years and meet internalized Moore's Law and that means that every new iPhone we expect to be better and stronger and faster and all these kinds of things but now we're entering a world where we're going to have exponential change across technology platforms and so we think about what is exponential change mean in the context of biology well at the very very beginning its genome sequencing is is is going to be basic basically free we're going to be able to change life and because we're on this J curve like when you say what a 10-year unit of change looking in there in the rearview mirror that amount of change is only going to take five years going for and then two years and then one year and so that's the reason why I didn't this book. We have to get this stuff is coming fast and if we want to be part of it we have to understand it and we have to make our voices heard in the rearview mirror that amount of change is only going to take five years going for and then two years and then one year and so that's the reason why written this book is good we have to get this stuff is coming fast and if we want to be part of it we have to understand it and we have to make our voices heard</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> did many people have a concerned that someone else is going to do what we're not willing to do first yes right there were China and Russia those two big ones trying to like Huawei just recently surpassed Apple the number to cell phone manufacturer in the world 5 years ago they had some like a single-digit share of the marketplace now their number two planter I mean date they hustle and if they just decide to make super people and they they do it before we do that's what people are worried about right there were worried about this trivial things or seemingly trivial like Athletics and then there's things that are really like what what's to stop people from just becoming the Hulk what's the stop people from becoming Immortal what's the starting what is really big issue the 21st the story of the 21st century one of the biggest stories of the 21st century will be how the US China rivalry plays out and the Plainfield will be with these revolutionary Technologies and China has a national plan to lead the world in these Technologies by 2050 the putting huge resources they have really smart people they are really focused on it and it's a big deal in genetic Technologies already in production November when is it now for these first genetically engineered babies have been born in China and so I called the publisher I said we need to pull this back out of Productions I need to reference this but it didn't require much of a chance I'd already written this is happening we're going to see the world's first Gene edited humans it's going to happen first in China and here's why that's had to had had to add a few sentences saying and it just happened in October of 2018 so China is on that path and we need to recognize that on one hand the night needs to be competitive on the other hand we don't want a runaway arms race of the human race and that's why we need to find this balance between National ambition and some kind of global rules that's really hard to do and the other thing is that were competing with them again so if they decide to do it first we're almost compelled to do its second or compelled to try to keep up do you think we are from physically manipulating living beings versus fetuses versus when you're younger your body is better able to fight cancers what you can do some of the cancer you take their selves you give their Unity like their cells to give them surfeiting superpowers and you put them back into the person's body and now the person's body behave like you're a younger person you have the ability to fight back so Gene therapies are already happening a relatively small number of them have already been approved but there is a list of thousands of them with Regulators in applications to Regulators around the world so that the era of Jamaican genetic changes to live in humans that's already here like what can they do with it so far so so far is focused on treating diseases but a lot more is is coming cuz when people think about the human genome is our genome isn't the disease Gene we are going to be able to do things that feel like crazy things are changing people's eye color changing people's skin color to Funky things there's a lot of be able to do it our genome isn't a disease Gene genome and so we are going to be able to do things that feel like crazy things are changing people's eye color changing people's skin color to Funky things and there's a lot of stuff that we're not doing now that we will be be able to do it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> second thing is I believe that there are no I save it to my sandwiches no such thing as sacred cacao or sacred plants are sacred mountains or sacred people if we don't treat life with sacredness but if we recognize that everything is sacred then we Infuse life with sacredness and and meaning in that Center that's why I do it a lot of fun that's very interesting from a guy who specializes essentially in manipulating life well you know we haven't manipulated life as humans for a very very long time idea of things being sacred but you are specialty is manipulating genetics right yeah well it's so strange moment that we're in for a 3.8 billion years our species has evolved by this set of principles we called darwinian Evolution random mutation and natural selection has brought us here to be single cell organisms and now look at us are deciphering some of that magic we are like looking under the hood of what it means to be human and we are increasingly going to have the ability to manipulate all of life including our own that is very unnerving to allow people to dance uncomfortable and scary and they like things the way they are we all me I'd like to stay the way I am we always think that we live these lives that are entirely dependent on these radical changes that our ancestors have created and we didn't find this building or agriculture medicine in nature we built all those things then everybody gets a new Baseline when you're born and you think well I want your organic corn I want whatever but all these things are created entirely created world and our ability to manipulate and change that world is always growing and I think we need to recognize that but being afraid is is okay and being excited is okay and we need to find the right balance between those two emotions I think for a lot of people do feel like so many changes happened in particular you talk about genetically modified foods so many things happened before they realize they had happened so when they like hey man I don't eat any GMO fruit well then you probably shouldn't eat any fruit because everything that you buy has been changed every Orange you buy that that's not more than oranges to be like to buy an Apple Apple didn't used to be like that tomato didn't used to be like that we set our Baseline just from when we were kids so if you went back 12,000 years ago to the end of the last ice age and you said I'd find me all these things that we buy at Whole Foods most them didn't exist we we've created them and then the 1970s we had the ability to do what's recombinant DNA of people called genetic modification and people are afraid because it's well after unnatural replying science to to food and you know that's that's the issue and now we're entering the era of genetically modified humans and there's that same level of uncomfortable as to what happened the reason why I written this book hacking Darwin is that if we approach genetically modified humans in the same way that we approach knechtly modified foods which is the scientist say hey we got this we're going to manage them responsibly and it just kind of happens to people nuts mini imagine how agitated people are about GMO Foods if they don't have a say in how the genetic The Experience The Human Experience of genetic modification plays out people are going to go berserk so we have this window of time we can start bringing everybody into an inclusive conversation about where we're going because where we are going is just radically different from where we've been yeah I think it's an awareness issue and I also think it's a perception issue I think that everything people do is including cities I think cities are not that's why they're all over the world I think there is natural beehives and I think as much as we like to think that technology is not natural it's clearly something people naturally make of course they make it in every culture hiking in the woods 3D love hiking in the woods has the we've murdered all the Predators like in the old days in the forest with no weapons set an alarm in pugs if you had natural wheat like or natural corn in particular natural corn Smith tiny little thing weird gross little rain and then now we made it this big juicy sweet delicious thing you put butter on which is great but we have glyphosate wearing Birkenstocks and eating it in Whole Foods that imagine a world sucks for us that's why we left it is true but there's some sort of a balance right wing that we do appreciate the nature aspect of our world and Eagles and salmon and all the other wild things and to be able to see them as very cool but yeah you don't want to get eaten by those things you don't want them everywhere you want to be able to go out and get your newspaper without being worried about getting attacked by a jaguar the nature aspect of our world and Eagles and salmon and all these wild things and be able to see them as very cool yeah but yeah you don't want to get eaten by those things you don't want them everywhere you want to be able to go out and get your newspaper without being worried about getting attacked by a

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> actually was hacking Dominic what was the motivation behind it was it for a person like me or would like for the everyone like as far as for everyone and so did what I really wanted to so the backgrounds good gift so more than 20 years ago I was working on the National Security Council in my then-boss Richard Clark who is Dan this obscure White House official who is jumping up and down saying we need to be focusing on terrorism and al-qaida and Bin Laden and he was trying to everybody and nobody was paying attention to his totally marginalized and when 9/11 happened I'm dicks memo was on George Bush's death saying exactly that we need to focus on Al-Qaeda here's what's going to happen to and Dick even before they would always tell me that if everyone in Washington was focusing on one thing you can be sure there was something much more important it was being missed it so more than 20 years ago I was looking around I tell these little pieces of disparate information and I came to the conclusion that the genetics Revolution was going to change everything so I educated myself I started writing articles I was invited to testify before Congress and then to try to get that story out I wish I started I wrote my my two most recent near turn sci-fi novels Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata for those and I explained the science of a self-educated citizen scientist and a novelist would explain the signs all the sudden people got it and that was when I realized I needed to write a book about the genetics Revolution that people sort that wouldn't scare people from my mission for the book is hit this stuff is we've talked about it's so important everybody needs to be part of the conversation we had this brief window and what I'm calling for is this species y Dialogue on the future of human genetic genetic engineering and I have a whole game plan in the book about what people can do how they can get involved and people individually on a national level we have to put a lot of pressure on our elected leaders and say stop focusing on crap there is really important stuff that needs to be addressed and we need leadership I'm going I'm speaking in Congress a week and a half from now talking about about these issues so we need to have on an international level we have to have some kind of International System we're so far away from being able to do that we don't even know what the standards are but we have to be pushing it so it but the thing is with nuclear weapons a lot of that happened at the state level at the country-level just needs to happen at a popular level and at a at a government level so the only way that's going to happen effectively as we need real comprehensive education on the subject it's not be answering that people can just guess right now I need to know what's the consequences what where we're at right now do I try to do it to say like if you just want to go to one place to understand what's happening what's at stake what it means for you and what you can do now if you want to get involved I tried to do that but then ironically I'm now as I mentioned being asked to speak to thousands of doctors and scientists because they're all reading this book and they're saying this is this is auditioning my work in in a much bigger context Sanjay gupta's very interesting because he was very anti-marijuana and then started doing research on it and then flipped a hundred degrees to me is it a great sign of both humility and intelligence of the data was different in his presuppositions yeah he had these prejudices that were very common now when you speak to Congress do they briefed you in terms of like what they would like specifically for you to address note so this one it's I've been asked to go and speak in the lot of members of Congress are going to be invited and what I'm going to tell them this is really important our Congress is not doing enough and here are the things that we need to do and what are you going to say to try to really get it in their head let me say is that the genetics Revolution is here if we don't have a system if you don't have a rational system to manage if we don't have a system you talked about public education the challenge we faced in the United States as we traditionally I've had a representative democracy and now we're transitioning from a representative democracy popular democracy Switzerland has a popular democracy but they look really well educated people who are able to have enough information to make smart decisions we have an educated are public and yet the public is making big decisions in a lot of it happened just on a gut feeling that's what's happening with trade agreements where people is high by the feeling it's bad without the ability to to really get into the into the details until we are having that transition which means there's a lot of responsibility on us to educate it's a tragedy bee treat people in this country like you can just throw people away like you so many of here in some crappy school system and you and your your your chances of success are so minimize not because of anything that you've done just because if you're circumcised that's unacceptable and you're not going to get quality by time you can get different different amounts of effort and different people are qualified or more talented at different things but what I'm worried about is what I said initially that some people going to get ahold of this stuff quickly and it's going to give them a massive Advantage yes some sort of like it mean if you the first person that has the ability to go forward in time for 5 minutes right is going to be able to manipulate the stock market in unprecedented way I don't think that's really possible In Our Lifetime but that's the kind of thing I'm talking about you could get so far ahead right that if we're talking about competition there will be no catching up baby you don't have to travel in time to do that but I didn't get the $10 of benefits countries like China or something like that when they're already moving in this direction in terms of technology and a proud American my father and grandparents came here as refugees I believe in what this country at our best dance for I want us to continue to be the country that setting an example for the rest of the world that is articulating what are ideals of responsibility and governance good governance and accountability all these things that we've champion because of that I want us to get our act together politically and I want us to be the leading technological country in the world and so I think that's what's what's at stake and we're losing so much time because there was a time in the. After the second world war where we recognize that technological leadership with the foundation for everything else we we had recreated the world out of the ashes of the of the war we realize that we needed to have the economic growth we needed to have the competition we needed to have these so I think that's what's what's at stake and we're losing so much time because there was a time in the. After the second world war where we recognized that technological leadership with the foundation for everything else we we had recreated the world out of the ashes of the of the war we realized that we needed to have the economic growth we needed to have the competition we needed to have these Technologies in weave it was a miracle what we what we've done and now we've lost our focus and we have to regain it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do bears that's the big ones in a brown bears and grizzly bears the same thing but brown bears are way bigger than the reason why they're way bigger is cuz they live in the coastal just eating fish and dead whales that they Longston anything else I can get the f*** are working on f****** fatty fatty heavy Foods video of a Grizzly that's pulling black bear cubs out of a den and killing them and eating them in the mother is trying to stop them he's trying to stop the grizzly from eating her babies and he just wants her away like she ain't s*** I got to say that it's awful dude you shouldn't shouldn't play it you could definitely can't play it and you shouldn't even watch it I'm going to watch it the screams that they make and takes it's a long-ass video and she's trying to fight him off he's like f*** you I'm eating your babies that's one thing that bothers me the most about the anthropomorphization that people do Moses that their stance on Bears is that I don't want people to hate bears but I want people to know what a bear really is versus what they think it is if it does sweetie honey in their sweet and they're nice and I don't really f*** s*** up they'd are amazing I'm a big fan of bears but they are all cannibals they're all can bears make me feel like I'm course there were dinosaurs fairs are like that's just a f****** dinosaur well it's a beast but it is it's a beast in the purest sense family have had to have dinosaurs that that was just a small dinosaur nothing like good dinosaurs far far far far far creepier than any hair I don't trust anything with no hair you don't have any f****** a little from Russia that's awesome they want to put a bomb on that thing by had a Russian strap on its back that's the whole deal folk Russian the Russian to trained it to get close to boats that he can hit the boat and blow it up so you don't care I care some things are cool I mean red hair by the way the front of its face without the other thing they think it might have been because they think they might have been scavengers here ex was a ginger with freckles where did you find these Jamie called a dick colored drawings they just take chances they still made up the University of Bozeman not University Bozeman Natural History Museum in Bozeman Montana has a raptor that on one side of it they had feathers on it so it's hard to give you like an alternate perspective of what it might have looked like so they had this Raptor and in one side of it it looked just like unlike an evil bird it's really cool cuz they didn't know now that's what it looks like they know now that a lot of dinosaurs had feathers they actually got fossils of dinosaurs with feathers so they know that the idea that all dinosaurs were these reptile looking things is incorrect some of them literally were birds so the birds you see today whether it's a peacock or chicken or something like that they're f****** dinosaur but the ones you know Halo hide that when the impact of the crater hit the world that it was so devastating that killed almost everything I never whatever was left whatever scrounging Scavenging oh creature that was left evolved and became us we used to be a mole used to be like a shrew 65 million years ago that's what these people you came from a monkey I know where I can trust you I know you know baby Jesus is how crazy you know that it's crazy to think you came from monthly lease motherfukers take it to another level that they're so crazy they think you came from a shrew you were like a little mold character and then that became a monkey and then becomes you all that s*** inside of 65 million years get the f*** out here in years old being a person who knows and loves Jesus in her heart s*** inside of 65 million years get the f*** out here a while crocodile or a hundred million years old do crocodiles have the same but somehow or another we went from being a f****** shrew to being a person who knows and loves Jesus in her heart s*** that's it right there that thing</div>

Biological material to there's nothing left and I just sat there in the Sun and waited for someone to arrive never happen of course that's what's happening that's what's going to happen the robots are going to start going I want to be on right now I don't like being off with Google artificial struggle to turn off a robot when they beg them not to owe them not to creepy I somehow felt sorry for him I want to be with you Andrew and I need to go to work Jamie's for food Jamie won't let us leave Jamie doesn't think I'm a real woman but I know you do but it's like we're on the way we made a deal with them to leave us alone and we got to go to North Sentinel Island to exist uncontacted that bad for a long time.

Like a woman's right to choose right like I grew up in the midwest I grew up Catholic this is how I am most family is first in so many words against abortion but I don't think these things are mutually exclusive that you can be against abortion and against women's right to choose you can say that you don't like abortion but also say I'm not going to control what you do with your body how I feel I don't love the idea of abortion being honest I just don't love it but I do think I'm not going to stand here and tell people what to do but I should be able to still say I don't like it I don't think it's going to get to the help to do I don't really enjoy I don't enjoy like the spreading of it being kind of this not a big deal thing but I do think people can do whatever they f****** want to do but I'm also allowed to go I don't I don't I don't love the idea I don't like it just hit an option I just don't love it I don't love it birth control is obviously the best method for wear is a method of birth control women take birth control pills that s*** f**** with them and when they do it and they also smoke they can cause like real complication right again tends to land on women a lot worse like you don't tell me how to f****** you don't tell a woman what to do with the bodies okay that's fine I'm just saying how I don't like it also I don't like guys nothing in women and f****** ghosting and not wanting to raise a child right so I think the other side of it is two parties here should be responsible men should take responsibility over stop do you know but again this is this weird balance of like I said I come from this conservative but like this really Catholic upbringing in the midwest you know a good old Irish Catholic boy and the ideas that you hear as a kid all the time you then grow and I now go I think people should go to do whatever they want to do I'm not going to control somebody but I still have those little moments of love it though cuz it was something that was instilled in me as a youth Casino coronavirus Catholic boy and the ideas that you hear as a kid all the time you then grow and I now go I think people should go to do whatever they want to do I'm not going to f****** troll somebody but I still have those little moments of yeah I just don't love it though cuz it was something that was instilled in me as a youth</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> pursuant boxing 2 unboxing it used to be thought that you pretty much you know if you went to a good trainer they would teach you to keep your hands up that was always the way to box but then you get to a level of like a Tommy Hearns number to do a Tommy Hearns used to fight he's keep his left hand low really low at you like a cobra that's why I stayed calm that could be coming out of bucking know where Hitman Tommy Hearns he was a bad motherfuker dude and then he would hit you with that right hand and he has so much torque is he was a really wide was really long and wide for a welterweight manly look at him in 147 lb of stew crazy slugfest Yamcha that final pull up Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns this might have been the great I think it went to rounds but it might have been the greatest two rounds in the history of the middleweight division cuz these two guys were super skilled I mean Marvin Hagler was a brilliant technical boxer can switch from South pod Orthodox like fluidly like you didn't even notice the difference. Just as good from both sides and knocked everybody out and iron chin and Tommy f****** motherfukers he Mark Roberto Duran with one punch its face play one punch man he's done with one shot and let him see that first hears the build-up the build-up is Tommy Hearns KO is Roberto Duran let's watch that first and then we're going to go back to Marvin Hagler vs. Tommy Hearns so you get a feel for what it was like to be able to see did dances is so crazy when he was just so good at that and he could buy and it's weird for a guy when you're used to I remember the first time I fall guy was left-handed it was super confusing everything's coming from the wrong place everything was like reverse got to get used to it right you don't see it as often right so if you don't see it as often sometimes it's more effective but some guys are really good again Southpaw some guys have like a lightning right hand and that was one of the speculations about Hagler vs. Hearns had this lightning right hand and Hagler often times. best the counter for South High is a is a straight right and watch this. This is just goes to show you how God now you got to watch this this is Hagler in his prime he was 30 years old who the Undisputed motherfuking middleweight champion the world and most people thought he's the best pound-for-pound fighter on Earth and Tommy Hearns of course you just saw what he did to Roberto Duran and it was a lot of speculation lot of speculation coming in this fight and they just went at it from the beginning of the round was very little feel UPS just constant pressure but Hagler right hooks boom these are two of the best f****** middleweights ever and they stand in front of each other going to war and it doesn't feel like anybody's face it feels like there's a guy feels like they're the exact same energy level 200 do they have the same output friends decided to fight this way he decided to stand right Liam the referee can barely separated her decide to stand right in front of Hagar and hagor decide to stand right in front of her aunts and they just now Hearns is moving see now this is what her and could have done from the beginning and made it interesting sticking and moving but by the supreme Supreme he always put pressure on people and you couldn't hurt them we have one bulshit knock down his entire Crews of b******* knocked out before I think was Juan Roldan and Juan Roldan kind of like it was more like I shove and maybe maybe they tripped or something like that and the referee called it and knocked down but I remember thinking God damn it cuz Hagler had a weird thing that he was either born with or developed he had giant muscles on the side of his head like he was Temple worn with gear I'm not bullshiting they had him and this was like a big thing in the world of sports back in the day like that he was literally almost born for this that's how good Hagrid was we're never going to reach the 12th round rightly said f*** it let's just do this and Hagrid just stood right in front of them constantly blasts in them and you see at the end of the first round Hearns is wilting he just does not have the power or the speed of the movement see he's all Goofy and he sloppy out again real Saucy Saucy but still the warrior in him is no one really knew what the f*** was going to happen in this fight and then yeah as a little stumble in one of one of Hagar's incredible attributes besides his skill was his determination to win man he was just lose a ferocious competitor man just ferocious and so someone's willing to engage him in this kind of crazy fight we going to stand toe-to-toe it seems the bigger man oh my God everyone's going to die still so much left in the tank even at the end of the first round this for years he's never out of shape he never partied you never did anything stupid what did he do when they never got fat after the Sugar Ray Leonard fight lost a controversial decision Sugar Ray Leonard that to this day I think he won and then but as a close fight but in then just retired Italy Prime and I just say goodnight. Nobody else did it like nobody else did it like that that's why I heard him and he starts teen them up remote motion without her is going to fight from the beginning like that moving moving from the outside like that that's classic Thomas Hearns but the warrior in him wanted to find out you know I find out who's the baddest mother f***** in town who is it he's hurting now they're standing right in front of him and he is touching him but he's he just doesn't have the pop anymore you know what it's like when you're working out and at the end of the work out your f****** exhaust and you can barely do one rep that's what happens with your arms when you're fighting they just there's nothing left and it's not like he's doing this on purpose right he doesn't have no gas in his arms like his arms are completely flooded right now like all the blood in them and everything it's a horrible feeling to be swinging do look he's swinging but its way slower than it was the first right on his snap was so much quicker in the first round now he's now he's not following through a little bit exactly a tired man and you couldn't hurt them was crazy he fought a dude named John the Beast mugabi and John the Beast mugabi was f****** terrifying people mad he starts Terry Norris he starts bunch of dudes he was a heavy Punch or heavy puncher and Hagler stood right in front of them they got caught with one big uppercut and didn't even budge uppercuts that were like American people didn't even flinch it shows you how f****** tough Tommy Hearns was I mean those two rounds were just f****** knock-down-drag-out yeah just nonstop but towards the end you clearly see how I was coming on I mean he looks good he looks good and he's Peyton himself now he's just just moving forward throwing shots but he is exhausted exhausted see that big deep breath please take a big size almost like now do you know HBO just canceled boxing don't have box anymore at all at all just pay-per-view now they don't even do pay-per-view they're out of the boxing business what that crazy but I'll never ends yeah man I don't have any more HBO got out of the boxing business what do you think that's because of its not earn enough money anymore I don't know it makes me sad though they had some of the greatest boxing telecast of all time is it mean that was what you would do to go if a big fight was on Bernard Hopkins was on a lot of the times I was on HBO is on pay-per-view then you knew was going to be on HBO the following week right so you can if you couldn't afford the pay-per-view you could hang in there time is it I mean that was what you would do you go if a big fight was on Bernard Hopkins was on a lot of the times was on HBO on pay-per-view then you knew was going to be on HBO the following week but so you can if you couldn't afford the pay-per-view you could hang in there a week later but you could watch the fight on HBO</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> of course I'm biased but technology way I can help that could help the lonely people that's actually the passion of my life but the movie that is what I suggest is podcast twice and I don't deserve it but I'm deeply grateful for it person who created her oh boy and we'll have that's that's been my life goal my love life dream not hard the movie believe in creating a dream of creating a companion a friend that someone you can love but the road was going to go hate assholes and you shouldn't be so interested Aruba does it kind of fun ideas but they actually get to the core of the the point that we don't want a servant in our systems we want a companion companion means the tension the mystery the the entire dance of human interaction and that means yes the robot may leave you going to leave people left and right. I'll be the end of douchebag humans that humans will start to as opposed to being rude will become Kinder well I think that's certainly possible think that's beautiful and it's very homocentric like Homosapien Centric but I think if I'm really worried about the future I'm worried about the indifference of technological innovation into the indifference to what we hold dear what we appreciate that it's always seems to be moving in a more complex Direction always I like if you if you just had to look at it just look at it look at technology just as a swarm of things that's happening is has numbers it seems you're never going to slow that thing down it's always going to move into more and more complex way and so the question is where does that go well goes to a life-form and if it got does become a life-form it's going to be infinitely more intelligent than us and it won't have any use for I did all your ammo all your crying and you don't like being alone I got you guys are so useless it's such a shity design you like chimps that kill each other you know like when you see chimps kill each other in the in the forest like a terrible temper so mean to each other it's like f****** people we do that too if the AI comes long as you guys are the history that I will let the human race survive if you can get this but if you're honest with me do you think they'll ever be a time where human beings as you know them don't experience War you have to say no you say okay I'll let I'll spare you if you if you lie to me and say you do think that one is going to be no war yet the f*** out of here that's not true you we know we know we're so crazy that we're always going to kill each other we know that right that's just that's a part of being a person today but about war except all the killing I think what that means is all the great things about Society have been created if you look at the Des Moines or post-war through War The Suffering The The Beauty has been created through that that's yin and yang maybe essential biological form but why would it be essential in something that gets created in something that can innovate at a 10,000 what is it like what is the what is the rate that they think once a t a i can get 10,000 years of work done in a very short amount of time that's random words is Sam Harris's come up with and I'm going to talk to him about the one that you can come up with any kind of bow they become ten thousand times more intelligent in in a matter of a day so what does that look like the problem is we don't yet know it's like thinking about what happens after death we don't yet know how to do that and we don't yet know what better way to do what we've done here on Earth you're right and he's also right right by both did this again this is a very human problem right yes where you're right I mean I look I'm all in favour technology I think it's amazing Shuffle time because a person be able to experience all this technology wonderful but I also agree with him like the difference of the universe the indifference that just black holes or swallow and stars no big deal just eating up Stars it doesn't give a f*** and so if you're dumb enough to turn that thing on and all the sudden this artificial life-form it's infinitely smarter than a person that's ever lived and has to deal with these little dumb monkeys I want to pull the plug pull the plug motherfuckingly plugs anymore you idiots never figured out of the operate on are you so stupid with your burning fossil fuels and choking up your own environment because you're all completely financially dependent upon these countries that provide you with this oil and this is how your whole system work since all intertwined and interconnected and no one wants to move from because make enormous sums of money from it nobody wants to abandon it but you're you're you're choking the sky Dooms and you could have fixed that you could have fixed that they could fix that if everybody just abandon fossil fuels a long time ago probably would have you all with a tassel it out by now it's a flawed system but humans are way more than flawed we're f****** crazy like that Churchill quote about democracy yeah it's messed up but it's the best thing you know I love it. I'm agreeing with you and I'm also saying the technology doesn't give a f*** the tech not to what I'm worried what is not everything that you and I agree on about the I don't know not a dystopian person turns like today I'm not cynical I think I like people I like what I see out there in the world today I think things are changing for the better but I'm worried is a technology doesn't give a f*** protocol of constant completion of this and it's going to become a god it's just become something insanely powerful that doesn't need to worry about radiation cooking it or worry about running out of food or worried about sexual abuse when their child even so it's definitely Unstoppable technology all we can do is innovators and creators Engineers scientists is steer that way right and I think the best we can do and those are the best that's really the best we can do is as good people steer it and that's why the leadership is important that's why the people that Jack Elan Larry Page everybody at the Mark Zuckerberg they are defining where this wave is going and I'm hoping to be one of the people that doesn't swell the people that Jack Elon Larry Page everybody at the Mark Zuckerberg they are defining where this wave is going and I'm hoping to be one of the people that doesn't swell</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I don't know anything about coding but do you have like a is there a spell check for coding yeah so it's kind of called the bugging is trying to find bugs and it's a software that's doing this software so there is depending on the programming language and everybody should feed if you haven't tried programming you should try it it's it's cool it's the teacher should learn to program okay that's my plug you supposed to learn to code I heard there's a part of scared of it it's a problematic term I don't know why it's the dumbest f****** problematic code of all time because someone ridiculously was suggesting that coal miners could maybe learn how to code computer code in like get a different job they could be trained and so as some of the way people are looking at it like that that was a like a frivolous suggestion and that it was ridiculous to try to get someone who's 50 years old doesn't have any education in computers at all to change their job from being a coal miner to learning how to code so they started saying it to politicians and people mocking it but then would Twitter alleged was that what was going on was it was being connected to white supremacy and anti-Semitism in a bunch of things like people are saying learn-to-code and they're putting in a bunch of these other phrases in my suggestion would be will. different f****** thing like now you have like he'll give a problem with Nazis and white supremacist but that's the promise with Nazis and white supremacist when someone is just saying learn-to-code mocking this ridiculous idea that you going to teach you know that's a legitimate criticism of someone's perspective that you're going to get a coal miner to learn how to f****** do computer coding is crazy people getting banned for that rightly so people were Furious Google described it to me and Tim pool and we're discussing it was that Google I mean skews me Twitter Twitter described it was that essentially were dealing with something when they were trying to censor things at scale there's there was so many people in the so much going on that it's very difficult to get it right and that they made mistakes I think that's a fast one of the most fascinating applications of a I actually is filtering trying to manage you learning so using learning to manage this huge conversation you talk about 500 I believe it's 500 million tweets a day something like that story act 1 of that 10% make up 80% of the tweets created by adult Americans 2% of the people on Twitter make up 80% of the tweets more likely I don't think Jack is lying but nor is Vijaya but I do think that they have a clear bias against conservatives and that's being shown that that's an issue in question I have your friend my friend and Mentor Eric Weinstein talk to me I disagreed with him a little bit I think there's a bias inside Twitter what what is that conversation like I think I tend to believe again this might be my naive nature is that they have they don't have bias and they have just they're trying to manage this huge flood of of tweets and what they're trying to do is not buy it as not to remove so conservative is a liberal so on there trying to remove people that lead to others leaving the conversation so they want more people to be in the conversation I think that's true as well but I think they definitely are biased against conservative people there is Alexander Alexandra AOC Octavia Cortez is the last one think I wasn't planning on talking about her but there was a parody account and someone was running parody account which was very mild to just humorous parody account they were banned permanently for running and then their own account was banned as well whereas there's some Progressive people are liberal people that post all sorts of crazy s*** and they don't they don't get bands the same brain it's really clear that someone in the company whether it's up for manual review whether it's at the discretion of the people that are employees when you're thinking about a company that's a Silicon Valley company you are without doubt you're dealing with people that are leaning left there's so many that lean left in Silicon Valley the idea that the company was secretly run by Republicans ridiculous there are there almost all run by democrats or Progressive people so that the leadership level there's a nail mindedness that that that that permeates all value saying there's a leading left that permeate Silicon Valley I think that's undeniable I think it's undeniable I'll be heading if you had to pull the people that work in Silicon Valley where their political leanings are I think it would be by far left I think would be the vast majority does that mean that affects their decisions well what the evidence did not treating it with 100% Clarity and across-the-board accuracy or fairness rather I think that there's absolutely people that work there that late and there's been videos for the capture people that were Twitter employees talking about it talk about how you do that how you make their thought you find someone who's using Trump talk or you know saying sad at the end of things and someone is talking he's going to know that certain characteristics they look for these been videos of what is that project Veritas that guy got boys got undercover footage of Twitter employees talking about that kind of stuff is how much power do those individuals have how many individuals are there like that at all those people exaggerating their ability and what they do at work or they are they talking about something that used to go on but doesn't go on anymore I don't know I don't work there I think it was down to one of those people that believes it's it was not to the leadership to people at the tops at the culture and the culture has to be you cannot be this kind of Silicon Valley narrow-minded should have left-leaning thinking even if you believe even if you're hardcore liberal you cannot when you operate the come when you drive and manage a conversation in the entire world you have to think about Middle America you have to think about if that fundamental respect for human beings who voted for trump it is a concerning thing for me to see just a narrow minus in all forms one of the reasons I enjoy listening to this guess is you're pretty open-minded that open-mindedness is essential for leaders of Facebook and Twitter people who are managing conversations I think so too I think it's I think it's the thought of being open-minded and enacting in that ethic is probably one of the most important things that we could go forward with right now because things are getting so greasy it's so slippery on on both sides and beard is weird position that I don't recall ever in my life there being such a divide between the right and left this country it's more more vicious more Angry more hateful it's different than any other time in my life and I think a lot of our ideas are based on these narratives that may or may not even be accurate and then we support them and we reinforce them on either side we reinforce them on the Laughing reinforcement where you looking at reality itself and you don't have these clear parameters and these clear ideologies I think we're way most of us are way more in the middle than we think we are most of us are we just don't want racist running the country we don't want socialist giving all our money away we don't want to pay too much in taxes to shity government we don't want schools getting underfunded we all you know and then we decide what what does my team like the team that I've been I like that this team will not everything but they got a lot of things so I'll go with them maybe I'm not a religious not but I'm fiscally conservative and I don't like with Democrats like to spend money I'm going to go with the Republicans you know maybe maybe I'm you no more I'm more concerned with the state of the economy in the way we trade with the world than I am with certain social issues that the Democrats brace so I'll lean that way even though I do support gay rights and I do support this ideas for all these other Progressive ideas this is way more of us in that there's way more of us that are in this middle of the whole thing for sure but there it goes up and down so all of us the mope I believe I hope I am open-minded most of the time but you have different moods Over Georgia and the other question is this is where the role of AI comes in does the AI that recommends would tweet I should see what Facebook messages I should see is that encouraging the darker parts of me or the the Steven Pinker angels of our nature like is it what stuff is it showing me because if it shows me stuff that if the AI trains purely on clicks it may start to learn when I'm in a bad mood and put me two things that might be upsetting to me and so escalating that Division and escalating this vile thing that can be solved most likely with people training on more digits or something Facebook algorithm that encourages people to be outraged because accidentally not even on purpose but this is what engages people with this would get clicks so they find out or will he clicks on things and you find other people are anti-vaccination or he clicks on things when he finds out you know what would it fill in the blank with whatever the subject is and then you get these m************ on Facebook watch people fight back and forth and in Fury and anger you know it's up it's another one of those things that becomes a extremely lucrative subject for any social media Empire it later if you're all about getting people to engage and that's where the money is an advertising getting people to click on the page in the bathroom those page get those Cliffs get that money if that's how the system is set up and I'm not exactly sure how it is cuz I really use Facebook that's what it benefits I mean that's what that's what I gravitate towards gravitate towards controversy so and when we think about concerned for AI systems talk about to the Terminator I'm sure we'll touch either but I think of Twitter as a whole is one organism that is the thing that worries me the most is the artificial intelligence that is very kind of dumb and simple simple algorithms that are driving the behavior of millions of people and add together the kind of chaos that we achieve mean that algorithm has incredible influence and all Society Twitter our current president is on Twitter the the I mean it's scary to think about we talk about autonomous vehicles leading to fatalities one fatality to fatality it's scary to think about what the difference between Small Change in the in the Twitter algorithm I mean I could start wars it really could if you think about the long to if you think about is one AI organism that is a super intelligent organism that we have no control over and I think it all boils down honestly to the leadership to jack it to and other folks like him making sure that he's open-minded it goes hunting that he goes to Jitsu that he eat some meat and some tacos vegan right I think it all boils down honestly to the leadership to jack it to and other folks like him making sure that he's open-minded and goes hunting that he goes does some Jutsu that he eats some meat and sometimes goes vegan right</div>

I know you're going to shut this down as most if he drops everything and goes to like Siberia to train I would love to see him and could be too well there's nothing but that's my friend Hans molenkamp and Connor's Barn f****** around powerful on it logo on the background like a goddamn on it and yeah I mean he's always going to have a problem with khabib's wrestling is so high level it's so different he Smothers you in a way that you think you have good takedown defense to you run into that m*********** he just gets a hold of everyone he does it to everyone was it with your Michael Johnson or Edson Barboza and why how could you take down defense looked in the past and the Barboza fighting basically just waited towards him waited through the f****** the fury of leg kicks and punches and just clamp drag smash to everybody mad the real thing about a guy like him would be seeing a guy like him again Jordan Burroughs like it could he do that to a guy who was a spectacular wrestler as well then it becomes mean his striking which is gotten very high level is very dangerous striking so he dropped Connor and he can he can f*** people up he stopped he stopped a few people strikes he me he's a dangerous he's dangerous enough on the feet that you would have to know how much how many really high level also have like striking that can stand with him cuz he decided to keep it up you have an advantage there until they got good at it then versus Ben askren will be very interesting advantage of striking if you torture them he's got a dad bod though and he's</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> U&amp;I Andrew Yang had like a million people ask me to talk about Ubi so are you still support of euboea I think we're probably going to have to do something if the only argument against Ubi and my eyes is human nature the idea that we could possibly take all these people that have no idea where the next meal is coming from and eliminate that and always have a place to stay and then from there on you're on your own that's what Universal basic income essentially covers covers food enough for food right you're not going to starve to death you're not going to be rich it's not like you can just live high on the hog but you got to wonder what the f*** the world looks like when we lose millions and millions and millions of jobs almost instantly due to automation yeah it's a it's a really interesting question specially with a position so there's a lot of Economics questions on Ubi I think Spirit of it just like I agree with you we have to do something yeah the economic seemed kind of questionable ready $1,000 a month is that what it is I thought for him it's $1,000 to $1,000 a month for 300 million people not everybody so if you are wealthy you get it to do when you can opt-out right nosy idea yeah so it's like everything else is super messy so what is the right what is the right amount and how do we pay for it and ultimately the problem is helping people giving them Financial grounding to find meaningful employment or just meaning in their life and that the main thing of a job isn't just the money finding meaning and purpose and the right garage your identity from work I mean that's maybe that's one of the downsides of us human that the biology is what kind of crave that meaning and the question he has a lot of other ideas around besides just Ubi Ubi by itself does not simply provide that meeting and that's a really difficult question of what do we do next what kind of retraining what kind how do we help people get themselves over their life but the real question balance is underlying all of this so one of the things I disagree with the the fear mongering which I think in this culture we have you have to do as a presidential candidate that might be part of the game but the the fear-mongering of saying that we should really be afraid of automation it automation going to take a lot of jobs and from my understanding the technology from everything I see that is not going to be as drastic or as fast as as he says and but that they are in your estimation he doesn't on his prognosis I think I think it doesn't really provides there's a lot of uncertainty more about the spirit of the language used I think AI will technology Ai and automation will do a lot of good the question is is it is it much deeper question about our society of the balances capitalism vs socialism and nobody I don't think if you're honest capitalism is not bad socialism is not you have to grab ideas from each you have to you have to both reward the crazy broke entrepreneur who dreams of creating the next billion-dollar startup that improves the world and some fundamental way the Elon Musk has been broke many times creating a startup and you also have to empower the people who just lost their job because there were data entry there data entry job some basic data manipulation I did a management that was just replaced by a piece of software so that's that's a social net that's needed in the question is how do we bounce that that does not to do that's not new that's not new to Ai and when the word automation is used it's really not correctly attributing where the biggest changes will happen it's not a i it's simply technology of all kinds of software digitalization of information so data entry becoming Much More Much More automated some basic repetitive tasks I think I think the questions there aren't about so the enemy isn't there a personal there's no enemy but it certainly isn't air automation because I think AI automation will help make a how to make a better world and spokesperson for a i n automotions I am I am I am banned for Ubi I think I think we have to give people Financial Freedom to learn like lifelong learning and flexibility to find meaningful employment but like a eyes in the enemy but what do you think ever could be done to give people meaning this this mean anything I agree with you giving peep is money enough to survive doesn't make him happy and if you look in a dystopian movie about the future Mad Max is just like what is it society's gone haywire and people are like ragamuffins running through the streets and everyone's dirty and they're shooting each other and s*** right that's what we're really worried about what we're really worried about some crazy future where the rich people live in these like protected Sky Rises with helicopter circling over in the bottom it's desert chaos so suddenly you be as a part of that system providing some backing somewhat any kind of welfare program is a part of that but also much more seriously looking at our broken education system throughout yes I mean it's just like not blaming AI or technology with your own inevitable developments which I think will make a better world but saying we need to do lifelong learning education make it a lifestyle investing it not stupid wrote learning memorization that we do it's a so the way mathematics and engineering and chemistry biology The Sciences and even art is approached in high school and so on looking at education as a lifelong thing finding passion and like that should be the big focused the big investment is investing in the knowledge and development of knowledge of young people and everybody just not learn-to-code it's just learned going to be more and I also think you're always going to have a problem with people just not doing a really good job of raising children and you know screwing them up and you know making kids if there's a lot of people out there that have terrible traumatic childhoods there's just to fix that with universal basic income just the same I will give you $1,000 a month hoping to be happy that's not going to fix that you know we have to figure out how to fix the whole human race you know and I think there is very little effort put into thinking about how to prevent so much shity parenting and how to prevent so many kids growing up in bad neighborhoods and poverty and crime and violence and that's where a giant chunk of all of our the momentum of this chaos that a lot of people carry with them into adulthood comes from a comes from things beyond their control when they're young and that is a struggle at the core of our side the car was fine tree that's that's bigger than raising humans raising and educating humans making and you know making a better world where people get along with each other better or it's pleasing for all of us like we were talking about earlier this thing that most of us agree on at least a certain extent as we enjoy people we might not enjoy all of them but they're the ones we enjoy enjoy and you really don't enjoy being alone unless you want them Ted Kaczynski all those people that like I'm alone are like f*** you you are f*** you you are and you might like to spend some time alone you don't want to be in solitary man you want to be alone in the forest with no one like Tom Hanks in Castaway you'll go f****** crazy it's not good for you it's just not yeah people get annoying f*** yeah I'm annoyed with me right now I need for 3 hours I'm annoyed with me and the more we can figure out how make it a better place for these people that got a shity roll the dice that grew up in poverty that grew up in crime that grew up with abusive parents the more we can figure out how to help them and I don't know what that answer is you know what I suspect if we put enough resources to it we could probably put a dent in it at least if we really start thinking about Eliza would put the conversation out there like UK can't pretend that this is just capitalism and so many people are born like way far behind the game weiwei f***** me if you're growing up right now and you're in West Virginia in a f****** cold cold town and everyone's on pills and it's just chaos and then crime and face tattoos and f****** get your teeth knocked out what are you going to do I don't want to hear any of that pull yourself up by your bootstraps b******* mad cuz if you're growing up in an environment like that you you're so far behind and everyone around you is f***** and there's a lot of folks out there listening to this that can relate to that if we don't do something about that we don't do something about the the crime and poverty and the chaos that so many people have to go through everyday just to survive until we we shouldn't be looking at anything else we're all this traveling to other countries to lock things up and metal here and metal there we should be fixed in this first one for having a shity lawn when our house is in a re full chaos plants growing everywhere it's a it's goofy goofy we we we we almost like a waking up in the middle of something that's already been in motion for hundreds of years and we're like a spaceship the spaceship earth and in the middle of our Lives we just realizing that we are now the adults and that all the adult running everything on this planet are not that much different than you and I not that much I mean like Elon Musk is way smarter than me but he still human you know me so he's probably f***** up to so everybody's f***** up the whole world is filled these f*****-up Apes that are piloting the spaceship and you're waking up in the middle of thousands of years of history and no one knows if we've been doing it right along we just know that got us to this point should we continue the same stupid f****** patterns or do we just take a step back hey how should we really do this how should we do this cuz we get what he got like 50 years left 60 years left we just going to hang on to all our rubles into the end we going to clutch our bag of gold and a bucket of diamonds that we're going to do going to leave it on mansions and fly around in airplanes and I think I am Texas somebody in Russia somebody in India all suffer the same kind of things all get lonely all get desperate all need each other and all need each other and I think technology has a role to help their not hurt but we need to force them to the first really acknowledge that we're all we're all in this together and we need to solve the basic problems of humankind as opposed to investing instead of keeping immigrants out of find as opposed to investing instead of keeping immigrants out of the body's kind of divisive kind of ideas as supposed to just invest in education investing in infrastructure investing in the people Ubi as part of that there could be other two totally different solutions</div>

The one that Goodwin know for all moments of beauty many Souls must be trampled is always a possibility that beings are the most advanced life-form that's ever existed in the cosmos there's always that that has to be an option if we are here right if we can't see any others out there and even though you know there's the Fermi Paradox and is always contemplation that if they do exist like maybe they can't physically get to us or maybe they're on a similar timeline to us and they're also it's also possible as crazy as it might sound that this is as good as ever gotten anywhere or anywhere in the universe rather that human beings right now 2019 Rose good as a whole universe has ever produced or just some freak accident everybody else is throwing shade at each other right this 15 arm caterpillar people that live on some other f****** planet just toss around shitted each other and they never get need never get any work done but we might be that but even if that's true even if this beauty that we perceive even if that that this Butte choirs Evil 2 battle and requires seemingly insurmountable obstacles you have to overcome and that through this you see a cheap beauty that beauty is in the eye of the beholder for sure objectively the universe doesn't give a f*** that is Rocky Pizza Apollo Creed in the second movie it doesn't give a f*** it's nonsense that everything's nonsense to you look at the giant ass picture what what beauty is it if the Sun going to burn out in 5 billion years what beauty is it if there could be a hypernova next door that just Cooks us the book sapiens that basically we've all one of the things with great here is we've imagined ideas that we all share ideas of beauty ideas of Truth ideas of fairness of all created together and it doesn't exist outside of us as a society and no don't exist to us yeah who is it does exist in this is where I think the beauty of being a person truly lies Eliza nuts our appreciation of us we appreciate people in a profound way we're talking about Hendrix I don't know how many hours of Hendricks we're Richard Pryor how many hours of Richard Pryor I watched in that how much that affected me as a kid watching live in the Sun trip is what got me into doing stand-up comedy we affect each other a CT Fletcher was on the podcast yesterday who's this incredibly inspirational guy you watch this video if you want to lift the f****** world and throw it into space you know I mean he's he's so powerful we appreciate each other we appreciate people so all those things you're saying a real like for us the real for us my concern is not that my concern is that we are outdated my my concern not that there's not Beauty and what we are I'm a big preciate ER of this life I appreciate human beings in this life and human beings there their contributions is that the end as I get older like particularly like over the last few years are a lot of international travel in appreciate the s*** of all these people with weird language and weird smell in foods and I like to think like what would it be like if I grew up these are just people but they're in this weird sort of mode I think we are insanely lucky that we have this enthusiasm for each other that we haven't listened to like for your work man I have this deep enthusiasm for what you do I'm fascinated by it I love being able to talk to you and pick your mind about like you're out there coding these f****** vehicles that are driving himself artificial life on Wheels any other animal appreciate each other the way people do I mean I might be wrong people do right now I might be wrong about dolphins and whales me maybe they love each other just as much as we do just in a different way but what where does a I fit into that so you're worried I'm worried that we are Australopithecus in a eyes going to come along and make us look stupid the only reason why I asked her to pick Australia pithecus would be cool today's we found a gang of them on an island somewhere really cold they survived never evolved from the Zion just cracking coconuts and just eating fish whatever they can catch that would be amazing but every documented or discovered uncontacted tribe are all Homo sapiens all of them so it's like you know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that's an interesting thing for someone who studies artificial intelligence mean if anybody was in this podcast book what the f*** does this guy do there's a joke about movies stuff I mean there's been a lot of exciting stuff on the autonomous vehicle space you came on I got a Tesla and I have experience with that thing is like when I put it on autopilot and it's stunning without you doing anything and it does all the work so because like one or two people listen to this podcast take this opportunity and tell people if you drive a Tesla whether you listen to this now or a year from now to years from now Tesla or any other car keep your damn eyes on the road so whatever you think the system is able to do you will have to still monitor the road and yes I still have to take over when it fails if went really so sore throat with this is like the moment we're throwing downright no I think he's obviously I think it's really important in this transition rephase whatever the car company whatever the system that we don't over trust the system we don't become complacent we don't think you can do more than you can currently 40,000 people died in the United States from from fatal crashes the number one reason for that is distraction so how much is a gone up since smartphones people don't exactly what they're trying to understand that there's a lot of studies showing that it's significant increases but it's hard to say it's because of smartphone but it's almost obvious that the flip side is even though everybody's not using smartphone texting someone they become better at using this Smartphone so they're better at texting and driving is a better balance in that now this is a hore nothing to do so if you listen to this podcast you should listen to in your car and keep your eyes on the road and not text I think worst was Pokemon on Pokemon was in its prime I was watching a guy on the highway playing Pokemon as we driving no more than one person playing Pokemon Grandpa's $300 a month to buy virtual currencies in the game board or in an Innovative genius perspective people misuse their innovative crazy you think most people are on your side the thinkcentre woman's greatest movies all the other woman but I was defending Godfather Scent of a Woman on autopilot avoiding crash what happened with autopilot involved just like on the flip side it's hard to prove that autopilot was involved in the dangerous stuff but I think by any measure the media is really negative in terms of their reporting on Tessa there I think I think you've talked about before in general negativity gets more clicks and I think Tesla negative stuff on Tesla gets a lot of clicks so well not Tesla about a thymus Vehicles if there's any Fatality and you crash it's over-represented it's over phora. I ate too many people who are interested in AI helping save lives in these systems like autopilot I feel you carry the responsibility of being at least as good as a driver you are when it's under manual control so don't text and drive keep your eyes on the road by say anything over and over is that drunk driving of course is G possibility of being at least as good as a driver you are when it's under manual control so don't text and drive keep your eyes on the road by say anything over and over in this podcast is that drunk driving of course is the other one and so don't drink and drive but the number one thing is distracted driving</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so what do you picture like because you have to look at Boston Dynamics robots cuz you said walking around I'd like to get to a sense of how you think about it maybe I can talk about where the technology is of what that artificial intelligence looks like in that 20 years in 30 years that will surprise you so you have a sense that it has a human-like form if you go back and look at look CT has a CT Fletcher has a beautiful old patina. Pickup truck what what he said was from like 58 or some s*** 60 anyway old ass cool heavy metal you know those sweeping round curved those old school pickup trucks at now look at that and look at a Tesla Roadster why in the f*** happened when better and better at it to figure out the most effective shape of you want a motherfuker to move. Did that little car have you seen that video where they have the Tesla Roadster in a drag race or in a race against a Nissan GTR it's a simulated video but it's based on the actual horsepower of each car I don't have you ever driven a Nissan GTR but it is a f****** insane car it's insane of this is CGI version of what it would look like if these two cars raced against each other so the card on the the Nissan GTR dude from the beginning there goes Lookout fastest thing pulls away the Nissan GTR is f****** insanely fast man insanely fast but this Tesla is sword another level it's so in the future. It's not even close as the video gets further and further you see how ridiculous it is it's essentially lapping that car it's going to go Nissan pickup truck this is the future there's any limitations in terms of bipedal form or wings or not having wings if you can walk on it mean does not give me any of that s*** and then we might have a propulsion system or it might be us and they might they might design some sort of organic propulsion system like the way squid have and s*** f*** know they could also operate in the space of language and identity example familiar with you know openai as a company a they create a system called GPT to which does language model in this is something in machine learning where you basically unsupervised let the system just read a bunch of texts and it learns to generate new text and they've created the system called GPT to that is able to generate very realistic text very realistic sounding text not sounding but when you read it it makes seems like a person and the questionnaire is it raise a really interesting question to talk about AI existing in our world it is paint a picture of a world in 5-10 years plus where most of the text on the Internet is generated by Ai and very difficult to know who's real and who's not and one of the interesting things from your perspective to get what your thoughts are what I did is they didn't release the code for the full system they only really how much weaker version of it publicly so they only demonstrated it and so they felt it it was their responsibility to hold back prior to that date everybody in the community including them has open sourced everything but they felt that now at this point part of it was for publicity they wanted to raise the question is when do we hold back on these systems when they're so strong when they're so good at generating text persepolis or at deepfakes at generating fake Joe Rogan faces Jamie just did one and he showed me earlier so we could go crazy with it if you want play between joke and something that could be at scale transform the way we communicate you ever go to Kyle Dunnigan Instagram page or one of the best-looking that's me play anything's a lot of variance of this we can take for example of full disclosure I downloaded your fate the entire like have a dataset of your face I'm sure other hackers do is wild are you so for this exact purpose I mean if I'm thinking like this and other people in the world of people talking in really high quality audio with quality 1080p foremost for a few hundred episodes of people's faces the lighting give you better it is basically make Joe Rogan say anyting this is just one step before they finagle us into having a nuclear war against each other so they could take over the Earth what are going to do is they can design artificial intelligence that survives off of nuclear waste and so then they encourage these stupid assholes to go into a war with North Korea and Russia and we blow each other up but we leave behind all this precious radioactive material that they use to then fashion their new world can we come a thousand years from now f****** beautiful and pristine with artificial life everywhere no more no more biological it to Messi are you saying the current president is artificial life when he's been around for a long time and talk about being present for a long time maybe Electronics have been playing the long game they got him to the position and then the grand scale of time it's not really long game 70s you know about that internet research agency right you know about that that's the Russian company that they're responsible for all these different Facebook pages where they would make people fight against each other it's really it's really kind of interesting Sam Harris had a podcast on it with Renee Renee diresta and then she came on our podcast and talked about it as well they were they were putting these people against each other like they would have a pro Texas secession rally and directly across the street from a pro-muslim rally and it would do it on purpose and they would have these people meet there and and get angry at each other and they would they would pretend to be a black lives matter page it would pretend to be a white Southern Pride page and they were just trying to make people angry at people now that's human-driven play jam now imagine this is my biggest worried about AI is what Jack is working on is the algorithm driven manipulation of people unintentional trying to do good but like those people Jack needs to do some Jiu-Jitsu need to be open-minded you know like really understand Society transparency to where they can talk to us is to the people in general how they're thinking about managing these conversations because you talk about these groups very small number of Russians able to control very large amounts of other people's opinions in the arguments yeah and algorithm can do that 10x more and more of us will go on Twitter and Facebook and fake Bots that will assume stances on definition cinches argue into Infinity who's real and who's not changing nature of our communication online I think it might it might have a fax this is this the problem the future is hard to predict the future it might have a fax where we'll stop taking a knee anything online seriously and we might get retract back to communicating in person more any there that could be affected we're not anticipating total are there might be some some ways in virtual reality with quick enough educate our identity better change the nature of communication I think the more the more you can generate fake text then the more the will distrust information online and the way they changed societies Building open question with we don't know but your what are your thoughts about the openai do you think they should release or hold back on it cuz we're talking about AI the artificial light there's stuff you concerned about some company will created the question is what is this possibility of that video looks like when it says type of small paragraph in here hit a button it says how openai writes what does it say what it's a gym and then many industry yes basically you give it you start the text to say Joe Rogan Experience at the greatest podcast ever and then let it finish the rest and I'll start explaining stuff about why the greatest podcast this is a particular research by Oxford University 1000000000000 on post-brexit infrastructure that's crazy that that's all done by an AI That's like spelling the sound is very convincing argument the thing is the act the way actually works algorithmic is fastening cuz his General is generating it one character at a time it has as far as you know you don't want to discriminate against AI but as far as we understand it doesn't have any understanding of what it's doing any ideas as expressing its stealing ideas like the largest scale plagiarizer of all-time right is basically just pulling out ideas from elsewhere and automate away and the question is You could argue us humans are exactly that we're just really good plagiarizes of what our parents taught us of what a previous so I'm sure that's not release it yeah yeah you do I scares me it scares me that they would think that that's like this mindset that they sent the inevitable inevitable meaning that someone's going to come along with a version of this it's going to be used for evil but it bothers him that much that seems so it seems almost a responsible for the technology to Prevail for the technology did to continue to be more and more powerful they scared of it getting out right yeah that's scared the s*** out of me like if they're scared of it they're the people that make it and there they are called openai This is the idea behind the group or everybody kind of degrees that you're going to use the brightest minds and have this open source everybody can understand it and everybody to work at it and you don't miss out on any genius contributions and they like no no no more and they're obviously their system currently is not that dangerous that was you just saw that that he can do that but if you think through like what that would actually create I mean it's possible it would be dangerous but it's not the point is they're doing it they try to do it early brunch it to raise the question what do we do here because yeah what do we do because they're directly going to be able to improve this now if there if we can generate basically ten times more content of your face saying a bunch of stuff what is that what do we do if I have a Jamie all the sudden on the side develop so much better generator and has your face doesn't auction podcast essentially fake Joe Rogan Experience and then what do we do to deceive release that you know what does he because now we can have basically generate content and a much larger scale that will just be completely fake and content is fake there worried about manipulation of opinion if they have all these people that like that that little sentence that leads that enormous paragraph in that video was just a sentence that showed a certain amount of outrage and then it let him feel let the AI fill in the blanks you could do that with f****** anyting like you could just set those things loose if they're that good and that convincing and they're that logical man this is this is not real Ben Shapiro all creates AI creates fake Ben Shapiro this is the way I think about it one of the funny things about Kyle Dunnigan Instagram is that it's obviously fake that's one of the funny things about it's like South Park animation like the animation sucks that's half the reason why it's so funny cuz they're just like the circles weird-looking creature things on the Canadians and their heads off at the top is this kind of Technology will ultimately just be used for memes Ono still something towards Putin's going to be he's going to be banging Mother Teresa on the White House desk and a video and we're going to be outraged when we go to war over this s***</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you are you sometimes say artificial life instead of artificial intelligence because I think that it's a life-form just look at his curious to think why like how do you think about artificial what do you picture I picture human beings being like electronic caterpillars that are building a cocoon that they have no real knowledge of our understanding and through this and new life-forms going to merge a life-form that doesn't need cells and mating X and Y chromosomes does need any of that s*** it exists purely in software and in hardware and in ones and zeros and that this is a new form of life this is the inevitable rise of the sentient being the inevitable I think is if we don't get hit by an asteroid within a thousand years whatever they know the time frame is someone is going to figure out how to make a thing that just walks her it does whatever it wants and lives like a person that's not outside the realm of possibility and I think that if that does happen that's artificial life and this is the new life it's probably going to be better than what we are I mean what we are as basically just go back and look about you know 300,000 400,000 years ago when we were some Australia pithecus type creature how many of them would ever look at the future and I hope I never get a Tesla laughing Waters a f****** phone glass and wanted air conditioning and television the last thing I want is to be able to talk in a language that other people can understand it's real to call people on the phone f*** all that man I like living out here running from Jaguars and s*** and constantly getting jacked by bear and they wouldn't think that way and I think if something comes out of us and makes us obsolete it but it's it's missing all the things that suck about people and it won't good and hard things suck of our people can we eat War violence thievery people stealing things from people people robbing people thing that those dark parts of human nature I think are the suffering and Justice I think all of that is necessary for us to discover the the better angels I don't think you can so we can talk and creating artificial life but I think even those life-forms even those systems need to have the darker parts why is that is that because of our own biological limitations in the fact that we exist in this world of animals where animals are eating other animals and running is always yours have to prepare for evil you have to prepare for intruders have to prepare for in a predators and this is essentially like this mechanism is there to ensure that things don't get floppy continue to look if the Jaguars keeping the people in the people don't figure out how to make a f****** house to get eaten and that's it or you figure out the house then you make weapons you fight off the f****** Jaguar okay great you made it here in the city now see you had to have that Jaguar there in order to inspire you to make enough safety so that your kids can grow old enough that they can get information from all the people that did survive as well and they can accumulate all that information and create air conditioning and Automobiles and guns and keep those f****** Jag eating your kids this is this is what had to take place as a biological entity for once you surpassed and once you become this thing that doesn't need emotion doesn't need you know doesn't need conflict it doesn't need to be inspired it never gets lazy it doesn't have these things that we have built into us as a biological system if you looked at us as wet we're operating software it's not good software write it software design for cave people and we're you know we're just trying to force it into cars and force it into cubicles the part of the problem with people in their unhappiness is that all of these human reward systems that have been set up through Evolution and natural selection 2 to have these instincts to stay alive but no longer relevant in today's society so they've become become road rage extracurricular violent depression that's one perspective that's basically our software through this evolutionary process that was necessary to arrival we are but it's outdated at this point and now the necessary for us to succeed succeed in a purely almost a darwinist way in the sense that it's about the Aleutian especially since we're so we can meet its really became this week because we got so good at protecting ourselves from all the bad things actually incredibly strong and this is the best the universe can create actually we're at the height this is where the height of creation there's there's a beauty in this tension in this dance between good and evil between the cat penis and depression life-and-death and that through that struggle that's not just a useful tool to get us from Jaguars two cities but that is the beautiful thing that that that that is like what the universe was built for that that that is the height like our current the Jaguars the city's but that is the beautiful thing that that that that is like what the universe was built for that that that is the height like our current the the evolution and the creation that results from it is the height of creation</div>

Don't want to over over over state it but he is incredibly creative one of the great painting wrestler so he pins people like confuses them and pins them incredibly well and you can you put them against basically a freak blast double like the greatest double Leg Takedown Tony put a clip of a whole city went off the f****** man into the crowd that's pretty I was all that's part he defended to take down those the best part that's crazy man that they they have such a drop off with these guys like you shouldn't really have a platform like that work I can fall off into the crowd that seemed so stupid and rarely happens what the f*** are you talking about just happened really happens they rarely have these terrible things so dumb I can't believe they did that this whole mess could be contested doesn't count but I don't look that stupid that's not smart a guy who's a f****** Powerhouse of a blast double hitting you and send you flying to the crazy that is crazy that they didn't have to stop that wrestle on a platform basketball that is a phenomenal wrestler but you're right he hasn't competed in a long time he's not necessarily at the level that he was back then even though it's incredible for MMA standards it's good to see like it's good it's good to see that with boxing it's good to see that with anything like when Floyd Mayweather fought Conor and it was good to see that but there are really levels to this and then sure thing about German bars I think he's so good that he's probably going to stay out of MMA real crazy but there are right here some clips of yeah we can't show it to people but flowrestling flowrestling with this on a Wonder people are pirating it online or if they they put it online if they're allowing and now they are pirating it yeah good luck support flowrestling no. They do have like a member are you so we're watching this ladies and gentlemen who were just listening probably boring to talk to you but Jordan Burroughs is one of the best wrestlers really a Maryland every empty and three-time World Champion down. Tragically lost in the previous Olympics and he's back at it again but there are a few terrifying people especially in the Russian side that I that I think the heavyweight Division and I'm UFC should let you should be really worried I don't know if you heard about the Russian tank the twenty-two-year-old from Dagestan know he's probably going to be the greatest wrestler of all time him against Kyle Snyder at those two heavyweights is American size American another guy right here the tank of Dagestan how do you say his name and that competition Gene Snyder look look look the look of the thickness these guys are monsters and they're not just heavyweights cast member in the wait is there still boys 22 right right they still haven't gotten the full like that about UFC fighters that are sticking up as they get older I wonder how many of them were damaging their body by cutting weight does a thick fella so right now we're just seeing mostly stalemate and that's from the American guy and the yeah and that's from the American guy and the yeah is a highlight-reel of his or something I think he's a seasoned Olympic champion and he goes from the whole line of sight your brothers and the all the dagestani wrestlers</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> there's a concern about this system is being vulnerable to third-party attacks yasso hacking I think there is a whole discipline called adversarial machine learning and AI which basically any kind of system you can think of how we can feed examples how we can add a little bit of noise to the system to full it completely so they've been demonstrations on example where you can take you can take you can feed noise into the system that's imperceptible toss humans and make it believe you said anything so full system into thinking so ordering extra toilet paper I don't know in the same for cars you can feed noise into the cameras to make it believe that there is or there isn't a pedestrian there is or there isn't Lane markings so someone Air India released in in theory that's the big difference is it in Siri is doable you can do demonstrations in practices actually really difficult to do in the real world so in the lab you can do it you can construct a situation where pedestrian can wear certain types of clothing or put up a certain kind of sign where they disappear from the system I have to ask you is to know just remember that you would be the perfect person talk about this I'm not sure if you remember this case but there was a guy named Michael Hastings Michael Hastings was a journalist and he was I believe in Iraq or Afghanistan him somewhere overseas and he was stuck there because of this volcano that erupted and I believe Iceland and he was over there for the Rolling Stone magazine and doing doing an article about a general while he stayed there for a long time because they were stranded because of the volcano and they got real comfortable around him and he reported a lot of the stuff that they said and did them they thought that he probably wouldn't have reported on including them saying disparaging things about President Obama at the time anyway comes back the generals forced to resign he's a beloved General and Michael Hastings was fearing for his life because he thought they were going to come and get them cuz these people are very very angry at him he wound up driving his car into a tree going a hundred twenty miles an hour in the car explode engine went flying and people that were the conspiracy theorists were saying they believe that that car had been rigged to work autonomously or that someone for some third-party bad person decided to or good person to pay on your perspective decided to drive that guy's car into a f****** tree at a hundred twenty miles an hour do you think that and this is 2011 Michael Hastings death 12012 will see what it says 2013 do you think that in 2013 that would have been possible it's entirely possible. I just want to say that shout out to the check that one off the list and Jamie pull that up whether it's possible is an interesting question whether it's likely another question I I think it's very unlikely and the other most important questions that something we should worry at scale about our future is cars being used to a essentially people I'm rushing so I've heard of those things being done by our friend Putin over I think I think it's very unlikely that this kind of thing would happen scale that people would use this I think there will be more effective ways to achieve this kind of end for sure and I just think it's a very difficult technical challenge that if hacking happens it would be at a different level than hacking the AI systems it will be just hacking software Bryant's the hacking software is the kind of that the kind of thing that can happen with anything and elevators elevator software or any kind of software that operates any aspect of Our Lives could be hacked if nothing was in 2013 was that technology available where they could take over someones car go-kart was Mercedes I think it was in that class C to C C C Class yes yes yes but I don't think I'll boy this is like this has been widely speculated and he had to run them to see if they can just put a stamp on it being possible or not let me just say that Alex Jones officially not allowed to say MIT dentist says exactly where you going to try to do know I first of all when you back off and say I am not a security expert which is a very important difference that is important that's all then autonomous vehicle I build autonomous Vehicle Systems I don't know how to make them extremely ravassa security to hackmatack have a lot of really good friends which are some of the coolest people I know who are basically hackers ready to Security Experts I would say the Loosely speaking I think the technology was there yes who is physical access to the car to be able to control it but I don't I think it's extremely unlikely that's what happened I see where you're coming from I'm not asking you whether or not it's likely that it happened I'm I'm sure you don't even have much information the cases I explain it to you right the guy also had some serious they compared it to crystal meth but the reality is he was a journalist and most journalists I want to take most a lot or on adderal and adderal is essentially you amphetamines and that's what it is it's real it's like it's like next door neighbors to Crystal Meth really is he is it well you said it's possible they could actually get it to turn the wheel yes I have to look at the exact like I said drive-by-wire think that I mentioned some systems are not it's not so easy to turn the wheel actually accelerate and slammed into a tree cuz I have more to do with the software a low-level software that can be primitive then the high-level AI stuff with it was there's no cameras on the outside of the vehicle like there is on Tesla today which has autonomous driving as an option as it's okay I see your point now so you wouldn't be hacking the system that precedes the world and actors in the world it would literally be malfunction that forces it to not be able to break the kind of attack then then control then making the car steer out of Lane that's a different that that's what people worry about with autonomous vehicles once more and more you're talking about potentially 10 20 million lines of source code all this code and so obviously becomes a mandible susceptible to bugs that can be exploited to hack the code and some people are worried legitimately so that the security attacks would would lead to these kind of what at the worst-case assassinations but just basic basic attacks basic hacking attacks and I think it's I think that's something that people in the automotive industry and certainly Tessa is really working hard on and making sure that the said that everything is secure there's going to be a course vulnerabilities always but I think they're really serious about preventing but in the demonstration space you be able to demonstrate some interesting ways to trick the system and turn the computer vision that this all boils down to that these systems that actually they're the ones that a camera-based I'm not as robust as our human eyes are to the world so like I said if you had a little bit of noise you can convince it to see anything to us humans that look like the same road like the same three pedestrians costume lens cameras right you can get down there with Sharpie Next Generation system will address camera problem I have to update the song updated yeah where is tassel just handle that s*** over the area capability but then the Boeing the flip side is you know significant change to be here the system and there could be a glitch that could be a glitch that could be a bug that the bone was terrifying especially with a lot of I mean that number whatever it is X3 combined 300-plus people dead maybe even 400 I mean it up I don't even know how to think I think about that number from a software glitch the guy quoted it or the girl code it must feel terrible yeah Audrey Wright has the capability to save human life but the terrifying thing is also has the capability to take human life and that's that's a weird place to be as an engineer or directly a little piece of code you know I write thousands of them a day but you know basically notes you're taking could eventually lead to somebody dying give ability to take human life and that's a that's a weird place to be as an engineer we're directly a little piece of code you know I'll write thousands of them a day but you know basically notes you're taking could eventually lead to somebody dying</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what's mine I don't remember if we brought this up last time but I don't remember seeing this video you're playing guitar while you were driving honestly and what what exactly do you have to do to a car to change that could cuz that car does not have the capace to the capacity to do anything like that so the right my correct no actually not but you are absolutely correct the there's the first part is being able to control the car with a computer which is converting it to be drive-by-wire so you can control the steering and the brake and acceleration to debate be able to control with a joystick and then you have to put laser sensors all around the car that we can do a sensor and a softer I saw what's the best kind of sensor is out on cold laser a lot of debate on this and throw down between Elon Musk and everybody else has the best sensors camera everybody else while everybody else says that at this time lidar which of these lasers is the best answer so more on the side this case on camera on Elon Musk so here's the difference lasers are more precise they work better and in poor lighting conditions they're more reliable you can actually build Safe Systems today that use lidar the problem is that they don't have very much information so we use our eyes to drive and cameras the same thing and they have just a lot more information so if you're going to build artificial intelligence system so the machine learning systems that learn from huge amounts of data cameras the way to go if you can learn so much more you can see so much more so that the Richard deeper sensor is camera but it's much harder you have to collect a huge amount of data it's a little more futuristic so it's a longer-term solution so today to build a safe vehicle you have to go lighter tomorrow however you define tomorrow he almost has its in the year are there say it's 5 10 20 years camera is the way to go that's that's the there's a lot of other debates but that's one of the core ones basically for camera you if you go camera like you're doing the test that there's seven cameras in your Tesla 3 looking forward to is all around so on one looking inside know you have the model S Plus radar and ultrasonic sensors that approach requires collecting huge amounts of data and they're doing that they drove about 1.3 billion miles under autopilot Jesus as it's it's a very large amount of data so you're talkin about over 500,000 vehicles have autopilot 450 I think thousand have the new version of autopilot autopilot to just the one you're driving and all of that data so all of those all the edge cases what they call them all the difficult situations that occur is feeding them Learning System to become better and better and better and the open question is how much better does need to get to get to the human level performance like one of the big thing one of the big assumptions are human beings is that we think that driving is actually pretty easy and we think that humans suck a driving those two assumptions to take like driving you do you stay in the lane you stop at the stop sign it's pretty easy to automate other one is you think like humans are terrible drivers and so it'll be easy to build a machine that outperforms humans are driving now there is that's a I think there's a lot of flaws behind that intuition we take for granted how hard it is to look at the scene like everything you just did picked up move around some objects it's really difficult to build an artificial intelligence system that does that to be able to perceive and understand the seen enough to understand the physics of the scene like all these objects that it like how to pick them up the texture of those objects to wait to understand glasses folded and unfolded open water bottle all those things is common sense knowledge that we take for granted we think it's trivial but there is no artificial system in the world today nor will there be for perhaps quite a while that can reason do that kind of common-sense reasoning about the physical world add to that pedestrians to add some crazy people in this room right now to the whole scene Ryan being able to notice so I can just got an a****** looking was he doing what's he doing get off the skateboard and the considering not that he's an a****** he's a respectable skateboarder in order to make him behave a certain way you yourself have to behave a certain way so it's not just have to perceive the world you have to act in a way that gets us presence in this world you have to take risks so in order to make a skateboard or not cross the street you have to per have accelerate if you have the right away and these are that there's a game theoretic a game of chicken to get right we wouldn't even know how to approach that as a as a artificial intelligence the research community and also Society do we want an autonomous vehicle that speeds up in order to make a pedestrian not cross the street which is what we do all the time we have to assert our presence if there's a there's a person who doesn't have the right away food begins Crossing we're going to eat them 18 speed or speed up potentially if you want him to not cross so that that game there to get that right doesn't dangerous game for a robot it's for a robot and for us to be rationally if that God forbid least a fatality for Honor Society to rationally reason about that think about that I need a fatality like that could basically bankrupt the company there's a lawsuit going on right now about an accident in Northern California with Tesla and where it this is a common problem for all all link keeping systems like like that's not a politician there's a divider in the highway and basically the car was driving in a long Lane and the car in front move to an adjacent Lane and this divider. I see you have to now steer to the right and the car didn't and went straight into the divider oh wow the basically what that boils down to is the car drifted out of Lane right or didn't adjust probably to the Lane North kinds of things happen is because the person was allowing the autopilot to do everything that you can't so we have to be extremely careful here I don't know the really deep details of the case I'm not sure exactly how many people do so there's a judgment on what that person was doing and then there's an Elsa with the system did write the system did it drifted out of Lane and the question is did the person was a person paying attention and was there enough time given for the person to take over and if they were paying attention to the vehicle steer back onto the road as far as I believe that the only information that have is hands on steering wheel and they were saying that like half the half the minute leading up to the crash hands weren't on the steering wheel or something like that basically trying to infer where the person paying attention or not but we don't have the information exactly what were where were their eyes you can only make guesses as far as I know again the question is is this is the eyes on the road thing because I think I forgot to pack a saying you're tempted to sort of look off the road with your new Tesla or at least become a little bit complacent that's worried worried the Warriors that you can just rely on the thing that you would relax too much but would that relaxation lead to Departments of something happened if you weren't you know when you driving has many times on the podcast to The Reason Bob road rage one of the reasons is because you're in a heightened State because cars are flying around in your brain is prepared to make split-second decisions and moves and the worry is that you would relax that cuz you're so comfortable with that thing driving everybody that I know that's tried that they say you get really used to it doing that get really used to it just driving around for you so the question is would be what happens when you get used to it and start looking off-road you start texting more do you start watching that's that's that's really an open question in the life example just did it the study published a study from MIT on what people in our data set with look like this data set of three hundred thousand miles and all these people are actually doing and are they paying attention when they disengage the system so there's that really important moment here with 18,000 of those when the catches the car you know the disengage autopilot and that's a really test that uses this moment as well that's a really important window into difficult cases so some percentage of those some small percentage is about 10% is we call them tricky situations is situations where you have to immediately respond like drifting out of Lane if there's a stop car in front so on the question is are people paying attention during those moments so in our dataset they were paying there were still remain Vigilant now in our data set the autopilot was quote on quote encountering tricky situations every 9.2 miles so you could say it was failing every 9.2 miles is one of the reasons we believe that people are still paying remaining Vigilant that it's regularly and unpredictably serve drifting out a lane or misbehaving you don't over trust it you don't become too complacent the open question is when it becomes better and better and better and better will you start becoming complacent when it dries on the highway for an hour an hour and a half and it supposed to 9.2 miles make that 50 miles 60 miles do you start to over trust it and that's a really open question do you think or do you anticipate a time and anywhere in the near future where you won't have to correct you will allow the car. because the car will be perfect the car first of all we'll never be perfect no car will ever be perfect as Vehicles will always you think we require at least some sort of manual override yeah let's let's talk let me see will it achieve because people are obviously not perfect will the Chivas state of confidence that exceeds the human being and let's put it in a dark way confidence measured by fatal crashes time that's converted to 1 year have you met him interviewed right and confidence the thing is a lot of the things he does which I admire greatly from any man or woman innovator it's just boldly fearlessly presume you ideas or jumping off the cliff and learning to fly on the way down that that's I mean you no matter what happens he'll be remembered as a great innovators of our time whatever you say maybe in my book Steve Jobs was as well even if you criticize perhaps he hasn't contributed significantly to the technological development company are the different ideas that did still his Brilliance was in all the products of iPhone of the the personal computer is mac and so on and I think the same is true with with Elon and yes there's in this space of autonomous vehicles of of semi autonomous vehicles of driver assistance systems it's a pretty tense space to operate in there's several communities in there that are very responsible but so aggressive in their criticism sew-in driving in the automotive sector obviously since Henry Ford in before there's been a culture of safety of just great engineering these are like some of the best engineers in the world in terms of large-scale production he's talked about Toyota about for GM these people know how to do safety well and so here comes along with Silicon Valley ideals that throws a lot of it out the window and saw revolutionize the way we do Automation in general we're going to make software updates to the car once a week twice a week over the air just like that that makes people and safety engineers and human factors engineer is really uncomfortable like what do you mean you going to keep updating the software the car without like how are you testing it that makes me feel really uncomfortable if you come up with the design of the car every component and then you go through like really rigorous testing before it ever hits the road here's an idea from the Tesla side is where they basically they'd in Shadow mode Tesla software but then they just release it so essentially the drivers become the testing and then they regularly updated to 2 to adjust a if any issues arise that makes people uncomfortable because there's not standardized testing procedure there's not there's not at least a feeling in the industry of rigor because the reality is we don't know how to test software in the same kind of wood the same kind of regular that we Face the automotive System test it Automotive system in the bath so I think it's extremely exciting and Powerful to make software sort of approach Automotive Engineering with at least in part the soft-machine effective so just doing what's Mead Silicon Valley successful so updating regularly aggressively innovating on the softer side to your Tesla over the air while we're sitting here could get a totally new update of the flip of a of a bit as it says it can be gained all new capabilities that's really exciting but that's also dangerous and that that balance faulty a bug so if you're you're at the apps on your phone no fail all the time where as a society used to software feeling reboot the device will restart the app and most complex software systems in in the world today if we think outside of nuclear engineering so on there really nobody that they're too complex to really thoroughly test so dorable complete test proving that the soccer is safe is nearly impossible almost Opera systems that that's that's that's nerve-wrecking to a lot of people because there's no way to prove that the new software update is safe to what it what is the process likes do know like how they create software they update it and then they tested on something how much testing do they do and what how much do they do before they upload do your car yes I don't have any inside information but I have a lot of that sort of public available information which is up they they test to soften Shadow mode meaning they see how the new software compares to the current software by running it in parallel on the cars and seeing if there is a disagreements at like seeing if there's any major disagreements and bring those up and seeing what both programs running at the same time one the original of yes at the same time the original update actually controlling the car and the new update is just making the same decision making the same decisions without them being without a loss for that and I think other companies should do the same the really exciting powerful way to approach not just automation not just the thymus vehicles or send me Thomas vehicles but just safety is basically all the data that's on cars bring it back to a central point to where you can use the edge cases all the weird situations and driving to improve the system to test the system to learn to understand where the car is used misused how can be improved and so on that sinks how many people do they have analyzed data that's a really good question so they have anything about driving is most of it is pretty boring nothing interesting happens so they have automated ways of extracting again what it called edge cases so these weird moments of driving and once you have these weird moments they have people and at 8 I don't know what the number is but a lot of companies are doing this it's in the hundreds and biscuit humans annotate the data to see what happened but most of what they're trying to do is to automate that annotation so to figure out how the day they can be automatically used to improve the system so they they have they have methods for that cuz it's a huge amount of data I think in the reason a couple weeks ago that this particular stretch of road they showed off the know they're able to query the data is basically asked questions of the day the saying example they gave us there's a bike on the back of a car the bicycle in the back of a car and they're able to say Well when the bicycles in the back of a car that's not a bicycle that's just the part of the car and they're able to now look back into the data and find all the other cases the thousands of cases that happened all over the world in Europe and Asia in South America and North America and pull all those elements and then train the Train the perception system of autopilot to be able to to better recognize those bicycles as part of the car so every Edge case like that they go through saying okay the car freaked out in this moment let me find moments like this in the rest of the data and then improve the system so it's it's at this kind of cycle is the way to deal with with problems with failures of the system is to say every time the car fails at something say is this part of a bigger set of problems can I find all those problems and can I improve it with a new update and it just keeps going the open question is how many Loops like that you have to take for the car to become really good better than human basically how hard is driving how many weird situations when you manually Drive do you deal with everyday somebody mention I don't know that there's like millions of cases when you watch video you see them how many mentioned that they drive a truck UPS truck at Pascal pastures and they know that if there's no cows in the cow pasture that means they're grazing and if they're grazing that mean they might be using the correct terms I apologize not call guy that that means that there may be called up ahead on the road that that means that there may be caused up ahead on the road there's just this kind of reasoning you can use to anticipate difficult situation and we do we do that kind of reasoning about like everything cars today can't do that kind of reasoning they're just perceiving what's in front of them</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> appointment with all this martial arts skill equator is Big might have like a gut but he's a sick mother f***** okay whatever like back when he fought like Vegeta like back when there's a picture of fate or standing around with a bunch of kettlebells ever see that picture has lifting day suspect in this that's that's one wen-fei doors fairly on up there but that sucks I'm talking about you know that one with the kettlebells is that picture up TV find that picture never six-pack in sight but I suspect it might have been on some performance-enhancing substances during his prime you mean like our training lots of drilling technique that's him in his prime that's a big motherfuker now I do not know if he was on anything but everybody else was me literally everybody they had in their contract that you will we will not test for steroids you know Ensign anyway told me that they like essentially encourage people to take steroids set movie Icarus you see it I don't steroids often feel to me like a bit of a Witch Hunt often times you assume people are on steroids I'm a bit of a maybe I'm naive or an optimist but I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise but it Chris obviously proved the technique on that technique execution the timing the Brilliance of us got meant they have everything they also it's not your steroid cycle EPO radically in enhancing for endurance and then it's starting to catch people need they just stripped TJ Dillashaw UFC bantamweight champion Force for repl rather its tragic it is certainly top 10 pound-for-pound and then this is one of those things that comes up and you go man to Legacy killer and reconsider what kind of what you be allowed or not you should makes there was legal or not legal sorry a lot or some kind of supplementation like where's the line when you when you start to talk about the future of martial arts of future sport if you can control the level so that they're healthy and isn't that the reason that they're not allowed is because if abused they become unhealthy play no other person look if that was the case we wouldn't allow fighting cuz fighting is more damaging steroids for sure for sure getting punched and kicked and f****** need in the face and elbowed into unconsciousness that is way worse for you than steroids their concern is not for the athlete the concerns for the opponent the ideas that you will be able to inflict punishment that you would not ordinarily be able to inflict you will have more endurance you have power you hurt someone potentially even look there's going to be a time where someone dies in a mixed martial arts event and if that's someone who was the Victor who did not die was on steroids it is going to be a huge National tragedy and a massive disaster for the sport for everything if that if it does happen we can only hope it never does but keep playing and when you are martial arts and very dangerous game and when you were enhancing your body with chemicals that are illegal while you're doing that game the real question is though here's my take on it and this is a human subjects and that beat meaning meaning that it's messy humans are messy like there's good and there's bad you know look like abortion is a messy subject it's messy and whether you have the what do you agree with someone's right to have it or not it is what you're doing is especially as the fetus gets older it's messy but you know when it's a complicated discussion it's not a clear it's not like you should drink water and I mean it's like it's a very complicated discussion steroids are a very complicated discussion you're not allowed to do them but they exist for a reason the reason why they exist as they're really effective they're really effective in enhancing your body how much of that will we allow we allow creatine we allow supplements in terms of you know there's there's certain things that can slightly elevated testosterone slightly elevate your growth hormone we allow song on Ice baths to enhance recovery but that's that's too much too good too too effective but it's weird it's weird that this thing that we found that makes you better you can't use yeah and I have to go back a little bit disagree with you on something so I will in terms of fighting being dangerous and that's if we wanted to forbid into the dangerous for you would forbid fighting I think the main thing you're doing can be dangerous the main thing that were talking about the sport the the combat event that can be dangerous because that is what we watch two people at the height of their scalability heart passion putting their life at risk that can be dangerous but the supplement around it the way to make it to make their training better more effective that can't be dangerous and I thought that can't be named can't be dangerous so I thought steroids were considered what should have banned because abuse has lead to long-term damage to health now we seized there was a cheating but it was band initially because it had that might affect you that is detrimental is alcohol when you allow people to drink but even a bit even when abused where the bodies like there's there's not a lot of feel like it's a great documentary on it called bigger stronger faster and it's about my friend Chris Bell and when you watch that documentary you realize like oh well did the real negative consequences of taking steroids or that it shuts down your endocrine system so it stops your body's natural production of testosterone and growth hormone that's the real problem for young people that can be very devastating and they can lead to depression suicidal thoughts and I'll also it's a really bad things when your testosterone shots doubt but as far as like death boy I mean people are prescribed pain pills every day of the week and Fighters that are on injuries that have been you know that have gotten surgery they were there prescribed pain pills every day the week and those pain pills kill people left and right the fact people died of those things all the time much more so than steroids so I'm not advocating for the use of steroids right I'm just being pretty objective and neutral about this but I'm just looking at it like it is a it's a very messy subject both introduce any unnatural exogenous steroids into their body and hormones and their body do what they want they want everything to be produced by the human body when they want to eat healthy food and train hard sleep well and compete naturally you know it's an interesting possibility in moderation you'll be able to loss steroids and enjoy life lyrics Because with an argument that if it done in moderation you can actually create healthier athletes they say that you actually are better off and healthier taking steroids and EPO then you are doing it without it cuz it's so unbelievable or drooling on the body at I mean those athletes are

		<div class="paragraph"> so did you look at the heart before they put it in you did you get a chance to see it no no no I told you so yeah that was the first thing that's hilarious I was a funny thing to say when you come back from a heart transplant I hope you die and your I wish we did already know stuff like that you feel sorry for those people now I don't know yeah most definitely now I dunno got to being angry reminder to don't even know never yet met I just can't stand Joe Rogan because I don't want to miss nothing to Joe Rogan has to say but I hate them makes no sense Manuel it doesn't make sense but a lot of people don't make sense that's true people live their lives and just very counterproductive ways and they feel like as long as they got something they're excited about that that's they're doing something even if it's excited about hating you for no reason baking cake livers and hearts and different organs from anime Samaritan and switching around with interchangeable interchangeable one thing that's too bad it's to ya Asian vs. black Pakistani stupid add devices and if so what makes it interesting what's fascinating to me is that human beings came from every single spot on the earth and they one time they originated in Africa and spread out all over the place I'm out here we don't need this melanin because we're not protecting herself in the Sunday more Sleater Dwight just as I did the same exact thing you can take that guy from African and this guy needs a part and a Gentleman here Graham Hancock was on my podcast last week and he's a brilliant brilliant guy but he studies ancient civilizations and people and one of the things that they're studying now is various civilizations that we didn't even know existed that existed in South America are like huge a multi-million size of population with civilizations in the Amazon like 20 million people living in the Amazon one point time they were wiped out by Spanish explorers in European explorers that came over game smallpox like the way they wiped out 90% of the Native American the same thing happened down there in the Amazon cities down there that European settlers at reporter. just wiped out but the point is it we were everywhere it's all one thing it's all human it is all human race white racists like they have to deal with the fact that the only white people care that neanderthal do you think that I don't think that they would find that a bad thing wrote I don't need to talk to you that's all right give them into bet so that they know these Russian people that was a totally distinct subspecies of human raveled travel to Tibet and Neanderthals lived for half a million years so they were around way longer than Weaver we've only been around I think for a couple hundred thousand years where to find a spot and adapt that's right we make it work in a community so you can help each other and live off each other and adapt and unfortunately that's where all a tribalism comes from two that we have this tight-knit group and everybody else f*** everybody else it's US versus them and that's inside of us you know great and in it and I don't think that it's wrong if you Italian guy I don't think it's wrong to be very proud of being Italian INF you opposed I don't think it's wrong to be very proud of being posed why can't I be proud of why can't you be proud of being whatever race you are you can be proud of that but this that means that I have to hate another guy because he's not know what you are and not hate another guy different than what you are how about we give Daddy tried well I think the feeling that you got from the second chance on Life is Beautiful feeling of appreciation and celebration of this existence that's what we need to try to Foster in people who try to let people know this is this is a temporary thing man well I think the feeling that you got from the second chance on Life is Beautiful feeling of appreciation and celebration of this existence that's what we need to try to Foster in people who try to let people know this is this is a temporary thing man</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you lucky like we're talkin about a hundred years if you're lucky you get 200 years I'm 51 I'm halfway there right if I'm lucky if everything works out perfect and it probably isn't let's be honest I beat the s*** out of my body right so it's probably not going to make me want to make it too specialist I think they're on the verge of being able to reverse aging that they're treating aging like it's a disease like as a disease at the cellular level instead of accepting it in that like well you get older hey you going to have to accept you can't do as much by is not going to work as well why maybe that's not the case maybe if they can correct certain things about the human body maybe they can correct that I think it's very likely that in the future I don't think that's an insurmountable situation the correct what happens to your body when it ages the deterioration that is caused by the aging process your body produces less hormones your body starts to slow down Alzheimer's all these different thing I think they can be able to correct those things then what Dimension filled with love and peace and happiness and there's no emotions like we think about here cuz no fear is not none of the things that hold people back none of the anxiety in The Angst it's just Consciousness and love and then you're wasting time you're just trying to stay alive taking pills to live to be a million boy you open it Joe without a shadow of a doubt none whatsoever death is not the end you don't think so I know I know to how do you know in bed right what about that experience cemented in your head like I said it was the most peaceful and I I don't feel like is the most peace most restful most I was I woke up laughing I was Steve and I was not sad at all you know I was overjoyed very happy very peaceful and erased any fear that I might have had in a nnat fear of dying is gone I don't feel good at all it's so I may admit that's why I don't want to go to Manny was so much pee so much and it wasn't like you know this is you know I'm just in the ground, and I'm not a plant just dirt you know I know that I'm in a very comfortable place and if you know I wouldn't mind visiting again your I believe that you're so then some people have a different name for consciousness of whatever is definitely Eternal and it has how else could you have these feelings or emotions or you don't have that that sort of comfort the feeling of comfort and being in the right place if something didn't continue to my wife my wife is gone that's my wife my my body you know I told my doctor that died and he said no you actually it's called some kind of Paul's or some s*** like that and I said looking at the pause last it back I wouldn't be talk to you remove like that's what we're talkin about when you ride talk about being a hundred like having someone wipe your ass and take care of you like that's the big fear it's not death death is just peaceful the end but the big fear is the deterioration of the physical body to the point where it's just painful everything painful you can't go anywhere you can't count on yourself yeah it's it's very peaceful but I definitely thanks the beginning yeah yeah band that said it's an overwhelming feeling like I had I was able to peek over into the other side and that is definite assurance that it's not the end that big is something else on the other side have that Assurance is able to Peek'n Peak into it I think we all have this feeling that we are something other than a body most definitely I have that feeling like I feel like there's like a little ball of energy in there that moves this thing around your right but that's what it feels like it always feels like that that's what I've always rejected the label atheist like people say are you religious I'm like I was when I was a little kid I had to go to Catholic school and you know I did all that jazz but my parents when I grew up where hippies after that my mom split up for my dad my mom shacked up with my stepfather who's is that he's a hippie and there was no no church after that but I'm not an atheist I'm not I don't know like I don't believe anybody that says they know what life is or what life means or what happens when you die I want to hear your opinions and want to hear your thoughts but you don't know and anybody that says they know what happens when they die I know what happens when I die it'll be black and and cold and that is the end and just like there was nothing before they'll be nothing at you don't know that you just saying that there is no God how do you say that how do you say that will one day what if you stand in front of God or in God's presence and some non physical form and then your your weeping in in your arrogance and say stating that there is no higher power like it might be the the universe itself might be God mean we don't know anything you say we are a strange little monkey people living on his f****** planet Macon things that is Alter our environment moving around driving flying talking to each other talking s*** but at the end of the day you only wear what you've experienced right and when you don't know that's like when people that I've talked to several friends of near-death experiences she was in a car accident she had a very similar thing where she said it was so peaceful they got rear-ended and like really backed up and when it felt like she was going to die she felt so peaceful it's so true a lot of people that have come in and close to Dying Light of them going to say the same thing that they have no fear of death anymore it's if it's erased and you but you also have the feeling that you know that this existence on Earth you when your physical body that is not the end my manager and I talked to her all the time the way she describes things is essentially exactly how you did that it's just so peaceful honest about to spell peaceful yeah but not like black people costume and a heaven and hell Brimstone fire and brimstone preacher and oh yes oh that's hilarious always say I'm a man of faith I have a tremendous amount of Faith but faith in religion it to me for things a lot of people confuse them and they talked about him as being the same but they are definitely not a religious man made yeah some would say that like you're a spiritual person that's like a thing that gets thrown around today like I'm not religious but I'm spiritual people say that a lot like what does that mean no one really knows it's a strange sore definition but I feel you're saying like there's something more to this there's something more to this than just tissue and bone and blood moving on this rock that's traveling through the universe to something more there's something something to some and maybe it's just something more for us but the the beauty of friendship and love and family like those things are intense beautiful emotional experiences that I don't I don't know they seem to transcend just regular life itself they seem to have there's a higher power than a higher Beauty to them I think that's one of the things that we like when we see people doing something really great we live we love seeing people accomplish things cuz we love we like seeing people succeed we like seeing people like that have doubts and and something almost insurmountable and Incredibly difficult in front of them and then they they overcome that gives us all hope and it gives us all like this inspiration is feeling we're connected in some sort of very very strange way but I think you could just chalk it up all that's just come right at we needed that because of evolution that's how we stayed alive like maybe maybe there's something else maybe whatever this Consciousness is that's totally not no one is ever define consciousness in the brain in the neurons in the synapses and it might or that might just be an antenna I mean Consciousness might very well be you are using your physical tissue to tune in to whatever this this thing that we share is this life force that we all seem to share and when looking in someone's eyes man like when you know someone's like there for you and you know you're there for them like that, the expression the windows to the soul that the eyes are the windows to the soul it really does seem like that maybe this isn't a smart thing or maybe maybe maybe I should have done better by you or talk to you over yeah and I am the first first time I had open heart surgery experience also strengthens my belief in there being something after Buddy Guy's Vision or whatever you want to call it I was able to see my mother that passed away the year before and I say I seen my mother and Aunt see your face I just heard a voice and I know it was her and she was pleading to actually guide lot of people may say you know what whatever they look up to and I ain't got no problem I don't think that because people don't believe exactly like I believe that they're doing and they going to hell although that was the way I was raised and if you don't believe like this all Catholics when my dad all Catholics were lost because Muslims f*** that just lost me and my mom was a slave and I was perfectly fine with him and in also this is the guy that was f****** women in the church but you don't believe like I believe you're going to hell remarkable ability to be hypocrites people want to control the people they want to be able to tell people what to do and when to do it and it gives them some power and their own life by doing so yeah man I thought I just destroyed my faith in you know anti-racism the Watts Riots I'm little kid we went to church together soldiers and a little kid in the backseat where you going I'm going to church I want to be at home looking at f****** heco in Japanese cartoons man that looks like a piano guys got so he was super dedicated you know to you know hardwood super dedicated to what he believed and then sister's Sally's house to give her consultation and I'm looking for the room or bedroom doors open then my dad Junior slip and s*** and I guess me and my brother will be able to be his Escape go or be always excuse my mommy or if I take them and nothing could be going on wrong and I guess me and my brother will be able to be his Escape go or if you always excuse my mom if I take them and nothing could be going on wrong</div>

Of time okay mr. Fletcher we have a heart for you they call me like 2:40 in the morning I think it was so that you have to get in there right now cuz I don't know hours before I had to actually be at the hospital at the hospital thing like 6 or 7 that morning I could go through another flat Ryan but I was sad for the donor and gums family yeah I knew somebody had to pass away in order for me to get that heart so I feel real bad about that so they put it in you you wake up what does I feel like it felt like just another try another door is life wow yeah I get another start another chance at it myself ain't over so from them up this they have to open you up right what is all that like you were out open it you know I have a scar but considering it is my second time being split open in the first time out in 05 and they have put a metal valve in Flatline during that operation three times on the table during the operation itself so the pacemaker out they take the metal valve out of it well we could go hard candy Metal Fab Hard Out Here putting a new heart and is just being unbelievably a shower would kill me if I took a shower I'll be done for the rest of the day help me out people take taking a shower for granted but that amount of physical activity would kill not be wiped out just for washing and yes for the rest of the day maybe it was hanging by a thread how humbling how long do you have to stay in the hospital for a hospital not very long but I think I was probably two weeks and then are you using a walker or you walking fine like I would say I was walking fine but I was walking just walking slowly old big time Big Time slowly how long does it take for you to get to where you're at like now have no idea that you had a heart transplant do you live when you come back close to dying everyday is just a blessing man if people ever hate doing something I'm lesbian I'm so I got no complaints gentlemanly Blanco yes no complaints whatsoever I need to transplant it now back I had it the first 6 months were rough the first 6 months after it was like normal things. Granite City Blackout have to stop probably 12 13 times and take a seat and get up and try to walk and it was it was killing me in my on my my wife Slow Down slow down and walk with me and it was such a struggle not like you know I don't give a damn how long it take me I'm going to make you I am lifting again but very likely I'm able to do you know the machine McStuffin attend I think I've been able to do that for the last two months I do when you say to lightly is this by doctor's orders so what what holds you back in terms of like lifting weights like why'd you have to go light and my strength is just nowhere near what it used to be the strength of steel you know I can tell that you know I have a long way to go but you know just to be able to do anything so I guess I can tell people all the time so now do they have you on medication to make sure that the heart doesn't get rejected by your body most there cleaning up and people are out there who've had transplants I know there are like oh man yeah I take it back 21 different medications it was different Medicaid something and make it kind of kicks Mart arthritis I have arthritis through some kind of cakes in the toes is still feeling pretty much every day but when I compare the side effects to the what could possibly happen which is death how to wheelie Bibby transplant they going to take off about four or five different medications so I'm a year out now they laugh at me and the further you get out the less medication and singing events will get down two or three but you always have to take some oh yeah definitely and it's just because your body doesn't understand why it has someone's heart in it for a while wide why the bodies rejected they didn't understand that it wasn't the one that you was born with a heart and I'm going to talk to you about that heart what I know about it I'm always talking about how strong my faith is and you know I'm faith faith faith faith man Superman face and I have so much Faith to can't phase me and I went into the operation may I see you guys in other side of it is because you know I got I know I'm going to be alright I got so much faith that you know I'm going to get through this when the doctor came in and told me that I had a woman that suck the s*** out of my face now because I have done that you don't have to look for you know stating on this thing the survival rate of male-to-female and it wasn't good that that you know psych Med testing my faith big-time how did she die I have no idea I have no idea but the thing I have feelings haven't talked to the family I would love to I don't know anything about it but I had these feelings and I really would like to know if what I'm feeling is right you know I want we want to meet the family and let there be no let him know that I'm out here doing everything I can to raise donor awareness and their mother of their wife or the sister or the aunt didn't die in vain and then I'm doing my absolute best to carry on and let people know that you know she was a donor and that it's so ugly important for people to donate to give the gift of life one of these feelings I have feelings that for some reason I can see I feel like she was the Oriental lady you know I don't know why but I really have feelings like that and I feel like I can see this woman telling her husband mean I've seen we get home from work and making plans with your kids for the weekend and I have no idea if this is right or not but I just had those feelings do it like a memory is like I get to look into her you know her existence her her life and I don't have no idea I could be totally wrong she give me a Jamaican lady I have no idea.

Hellcat why did you do this to me why did you give me a woman's heart and a old woman at that why can't you give me a I could be ma'am I am dude I have tears in my eyes because it's wasn't I might f*** I got another heart but I ain't going to last long one thing I know we got heart grow to match your body already has the proper size that it's it did yes in the doctor that told me was too small is the one who told me that he had grown to the proper size realize it had to adapt to a larger but I'm giving you a credit to God because it's just me man because he came back too fast I mean is like a week later I left the hospital he was telling me that it's already sizes you think Jesus how many Seconds to Mars as a normal thing I have no idea I have no idea for the normal thing and not but he know I didn't mean I'm getting cramps while ago that Miracle fake guy and I said I questioned God and my answer was what did I I got back was was simple he said if I gave you a 18 year old Olympic athletes heart CT and you recovered was doing well then people are going to say that that's why we got 18 year old Olympic gold medalist heart and you're able to recover and stuff because of this but if I take my old lady's heart is too small and that not you're not supposed to be able to come back and do these things with this heart then they're going to have to give me a little credit cuz I have a habit of taking the Beast of the East and making something out of it and I seen or let me Shut the f****** absolutely right it wouldn't be that impressive it would be a miracle if I eat a wonderful heart but because I'm God I'm going to take this heart and give it to you and you don't still do all those things I just feel a little tired you back off I can't help but Christmas I know that's why I'm asking something I've done my whole life and I'm just glad to be back able to do you know some of what I used to do it's just I feel good and I have I feel talk to her though every month or so you get stronger it feels like you know it's that's what it should be in my my body adapts and how long does a heart-transplant usually survive in a person I think the the longest at this point is close to 40 years 48 I want you know I never expected I said on June 8th I'll be 60 I never expected to make it to 40 so you're really really yeah I never I never expected to me I expect you to Die Young so I'm way past where I thought I would make it anyway so brilliant Michael shoot ending Just Go For It Go For It Go For It Go for it and explode why do you say that though you want to be alive right now and every day is a blessing right now so why isn't 40 Years of blessing and somebody yeah yeah yeah I know what you mean but right now you're not a burden I hope not yeah I guess so I don't I don't see him he's huge you that that's kind of stuff don't even matter that much to me a new lease on life donor awareness what date passed away just waiting trying to get in I was so fortunate so blessed to be able to get one that I want to try to make sure that a lot of people get one too so if whatever I can do to try to raise awareness what is the problem but people putting that they'll donate their organs do the DMV and get your. On your driver's license and I want to be a donor and I mean you can't take the stuff with you anyway so no people get paranoid to I've heard people say I'm worried about doing that because what if they don't resuscitate me because they need someone to get a heart or liver or something like that I really don't think that's what doctors are in and I mean you can't take the stuff with you anyway so no people get paranoid to I've heard people say I'm worried about doing that because what if they don't resuscitate me because they need someone to get a heart or liver or something like that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> biggest controversy in America in terms of transgender people probably the biggest one of the biggest is competing in sports with biological women that's the biggest one yes if you haven't already got them I know yeah it's okay buckles and we already do that in restaurants really share stuff that the toilets in the airplanes we have died by the way if you just remove your nose at in theaters and places that won't be getting off to the women accusing forever and the men and not caring that's why everyone she has everyone but he's wrong responsibilities I've heard of it working in the school as well there's less bullying in in the lose so it's that adjust check is regression of Technology I want is a cubicle just go to the loop and then use the mirrors and and and then go at everything being for both genders yeah you just make it old even then we get outside the law problems some people will have pushed back on that and have other reasons why I don't like it when they don't want to be in a washroom with men than what they already are going into if they're sharing an illusion the airplane officiant in the airplane is one you know some men are f****** creeps and some women just want to have a place where they could just be themselves and their makeup and go to the bathroom and wash and talk amongst other than to stand that it's just I you know if you think about anything that's going to change anything there's usually something that was the only reason to do this is to accommodate people who are transgender in a way that it seems like it doesn't it doesn't put them in a position where they they can be judged because Bruins doing it well if you stop bullying in schools then it's it's the number of things in there that that that it could make easy just makes a whole a whole area of things a lot easier I'm sad now I just punish the creeps which is really what you mean if someone's being a creep in the bathroom to the problem is the creep it's not the bathroom right yeah it's anyway so this is on the spectrum of something so the idea that anyone who is pressing themselves in a different way that that is a problem if you take might just right. If we all went back to how we used to think even which is interesting that makes that makes sense I see what you're saying the concern right was it we have a system in place and someone tries to change the system and people get upset than a trench and I mean women Duke you forever and then Don Q I told last but this it with open plan toilets have seen that we have made it into a problem we have made this a whole psychological bro mother I'm just sit down and have a pool and have a chance and once they did make it a problem and categorize people by gender then it became this thing and now you don't want to change that well yeah and the forests in having a pool was just having the flu and now we feel it's a big problem having a pill we had like it was like we have a four-wheeler to admit that we have to pay does the Queen have a poop has the attitude besides the marathon thing that has attitude culturally shifted in the UK the same way it's shifted in America words to get more I think the mole is more and more people out and positive images from women is it from anyone that feels like the hours of the loop if you can have a post any positive role models to go out there that do other things you know just something is talking to his sexuality on television I know about this person Over Me Knocking you know in baseball you see the debate the famous documentary baseball Z black people off the Civil War black people playing baseball and it was some guy was a powerful he said there would be no black people in major leagues at all and it was blocked from about 1897 like this all the way through to 1950s I went backwards so that was a positive role of them that well go backwards and forwards and I just think in effort when I get to weld with everyone's living that live that's really what we need that's the only time people care and let Mike might issue with this that I've ever come across with his with athletes it's with transgender athletes competing against women particularly in my field and fighting there's been some there have been at least there was one very vocal case when were very public case of a transgender athlete who was male for 30 plus years transition over for a couple years for 2 years then start fighting women didn't tell them that she used to be a man right and it became a giant issue and people were outraged and anger the women who got beat up or angry cuz I got destroyed two of them did and then she started his public about it and started fighting women that were willing and new got to say things in French things about it is that there are no real answers that it's one of those things we just got to go home what do we do here in this is this is what I think one of the more unique things about being a person as that we have this opportunity to look at this unusual circumstance and communicate about it and try to figure it out are no real answer is that it's one of those things we just got to go home what do we do here in this is this is what I think one of the more unique things about being a person as that we have this opportunity to look at this unusual circumstance and communicate about it and try to figure it out</div>

Very good as well and I play nice to die young but I was I was doing the stand up I see that's why I put that together that was and I couldn't Jesus crisis of, because as a Jewish guy he died that we could say what we want to do and say the mrs. maisel things makes it a little it's a little homogenized like him like in even his struggle it's almost like it's no big deal you in the latest season is he as mrs. maisel and it's interesting sheet yeah ignore McDonald got mad about it. do ramps into that and it was that was something she went to France and did stand-up it was weird I have done it in French comedy I was willing to let that suspension of disbelief and I liked it that the sexual relationship is always coming back the husband's always coming back into the frame and I'm his fight that yeah but the whole I'll leave the stand up to you so I have no direction on it so I just did it as close as I could to have Lenny would have done it did you listen to a lot of recordings I did that difficult for British to know look up the sum of the punchline or never the number The Wretched because you should come and get it this is a trick I do in Universal human that I take either huge references or explain my references so that you know she's a everyone nothing so he I worked out but only give you all my stuff is numb dateable his note I didn't do any topical stuff I don't do party political stuff no you should not date I do historical stuff cuz I never date how much is a handy thing to do stuff in a stand-up does the cultures so significantly different between the late fifties and sixties were laid Bruce was sort of starting out making his Mark versus today like the things that were naughty back then the things that he could say that were controversial there was nothing today they're literally it's a non controversy was one that that still had was when he said how many people and were they an ass working I just went to old how many residential I did this yeah it was something we had some still there was a unfortunately accidentally a friend of mine is still one of his jokes didn't know that he actually just thought of the same premise that the premise was that homosexuality in some places illegal and what do they do if they catch you while they lock you up in jail with a bunch of men won't have sex with you like in that was Lenny Bruce's line right like dig homosexuality is it legal to do they put you in jail homosexuality is it legal rights what day do they put you in jail with a bunch of men have sex with you and all I got was his whole like it like that still would work today like if there was a place where homosexuality was illegal today and you did that joke it's a good joke it's like set-up punchline it's all right there</div>

John was talking s*** about him he was talking s*** about John you know that maybe they'll fight John is way bigger John's a big man and I think John is going to clean out the light heavyweight Division and then move up and I think he's probably going to try to catch DC Ford easy steps out cuz DC's going to fight against email chick they're going to have a rematch and then I think DC vs. Jon Jones I think John wants to go up there and take that heavyweight title you know but I think DC has a better chance against him and heavyweight I don't think DC like chatting away and I don't think it's good for his performance or his durability or anyting I think judging by his fights with Derrick Lewis is a f****** huge guy never been able to do it like that before the way DC did it mean DC says it heavyweights just way more powerful hits harder takes a punch better you know he's not tall guy someone 511 but he is wide is its fucken table my favorite anime fight that dude is not the greatest of all time is in a conversation conversation is like a me my my opinion is that Mighty Mouse Johnson is the greatest of all time but the caveat is that Mighty Mouse never really fought the Caribou Calabro competition that Jon Jones did Jon Jones first fight in the UFC at for a title is fighting Mauricio Shogun Hua who is a legend that's John's first by John opens up with a flying knee no toques Lyoto Machida completely on Griz you know chokes out Rampage choke sizes just smashed everybody John smashed everybody's only lost one time that's a b******* long special University really is he something special in that I think he's had some troubles in his life and in trouble but I think he's got that ship behind him I really do I think he's you know what mean he hasn't had a near-death experience but I think he's had so many you like near careerjet experiences that appreciates it now I also think to be. Good you got to be f****** crazy and I think Jon Jones is f****** crazy and he's just getting his crazy online he's just getting his crazy in order like he's my crazy under-wraps just keep my crazy together but he's got like the perfect combination of things like smart and wild and physically talented like maybe after the fight with the Thiago Santos have some time off but it is interesting his coaches thought that his powerlifting was a bad idea for him apparently Mac coaches got really into that before the OSP fight never had a big butt I just f****** dangerous and I think I think that it's just one of those things where stylistically you know opens for a really good fight and I mean open set up broken arm for I think the last round and round with a f****** never let anybody know about his form snapped</div>

And I think that when you've been traumatized to the extent that Russia has been traumatized certain thanks you know the ability to stand up against aggression and to be brave and Powerful those become that that becomes the commodity that's where that's the guy that gets all the money all the women all that you know whatever and I think that's a product of their history so Putin is an admired man in the power he's respected I'm not saying that sir I don't know a thing about Russian elections but I will say this I don't know why you're putting words in my mouth why don't you know what the hell's going on would get elected anyway I think some of them so allowed open criticism of them how many how many journalists have been murdered I don't know but enough only sending all kinds of weird show Google Google journalists critical of Putin murdered cultures and interesting culture why why because not only are we representative heartstrings the military the NFL in UFC all that s*** Yeltsin are okay so they just been doing that forever so this is like presidents just do that in Russia murder Crossfire terrorist act in 2008 there was six of those murder only there's another six listen to of them were brought to trial those guys used to kill wholesale I mean then that's a fact up to their elbows in blood who's that guy that got murdered recently that was running was a political opponent they shot that dude down when his death was not related to the journalist work the conviction rate exceeds 90% was not related to the journalist work so you talking about the rates of conviction that was a weird quote rates of conviction of very high of course they do not pass go good luck with the trial that strip the judges like yeah I listen to you 20 years f*** off why was funnier this way better Ron James At The Comedy Store this is why we're better because we we have protections for our that the people on the fringes are creatives our weirdos are fashionistas all the people that make our culture interesting Steven Jobs with that he wasn't going to CrossFit we provide at least there was Dooku recourse at least we know that there are soft restraints have to be protected and makes you more interesting and it makes you more creative and stronger to be innovative creative and you you marginalize every bill cuz they're different put in the name of Charity whatever like really weird public statement about homosexuality the law and Russia like is homosexuality illegal in Russia wow Apartments it's it's hard to live and make a living so what happens all of creative people who could be contributing and coming up with beautiful ideas there their marginalizes perverts Aviance and that's the dumbest Russian gay propaganda law for the purpose of protecting children from information advocating for a denial of traditional Family Values the gay propaganda law on the anti-gay law building was unanimously approved by the state Duma on 11th of June 2013 holy Batman say you want to protect children from exposure to you know home activity yeah and it was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin have on the 30th of June 2013 how long is he going to be president besides the fact that they're essentially one crop economy which is oil and I guess some other Commodities what happens is you kill all your creativity what happens if you are not a strong country your Weaponry isn't even cut that's the irony of all this s*** and you have one idea what you're going to be f****** week and you're not going to be creative a good rifle it's been right now he's on 7 years in office is Arthur he's been longer than that yeah but I mean 7 now currently and then he did it eight years before yeah but he didn't even take four years off we took four years off he was like running ship from behind he's got to look like I'll kill you like you kill you inappropriateness running a country that requires a strong man who they respect so he's caught in that to even if he agreed to you the world was so you're the king of the world how you fix Russia you you you come back come at them with a few percent and idea the ID I just presented which is the idea that you might want to protect the people that you consider to be Queer as deviance and Weirdos nerd where they are because those people a lot of times our York I don't know why but they are you think they lived in too much of a wartime culturefly for too long identity develop this hardness to them too yeah that's why they're lacking in the creativity and Innovation and a lot of times when you've been traumatized that you're dealing still at the residue and the trauma of World War 1 and World War II and that's very real and you know and also by the way communism and having nothing nnat know they have strong my friend went to Russia and said everybody was nice to him f****** they're good people and their Innovative people in their cribs look how good they are boxing anything the

Rhonda Patrick posted something I think it was on her Twitter account that how information led to impulsive decision-making led to cheating on your diet and led to poor decisions in terms of an overall lifestyle just from having higher levels of inflammation so eating shittyfood not getting enough sleep drinking all those things lead to inflammation right all those things cause you to make more impulsive food choices she food choices bad dietary choices bad lifestyle it almost like information wants more of it here it is study finds an inflammation even at subclinical levels and healthy participants May promote impulsive behavior and an inability to delay gratification is that amazing yeah it's like I think I think what you and I are after like when the reason I'm happy and the reason I feel so fulfilled is I'm able to express myself fully I told you they're there like a certain developments my life like I was like I I I want radical honesty in the sense that I don't have to lie about anything I don't want to lie about anything I want to be very honest you and I have always been so honest with each other and that's why we know each other so so what that allows you to do is to express yourself fully and completely original self-expression is my whole my queen of my idea but but so eating well if eating well the way I don't want to get the way so I investigate how to feel optimal so that I can just not have to get in the way and I can do other things I love that is a form of expressing myself like I always wanted and I'll be I'm nervous today cuz I got to go Spar some fuk I don't even doing it now how many years almost 5 years now five common to throw the old left right left</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you think the meek will inherit inherit the earth you think if that was a prophecy that they would be talked about technologists they'll be talking about like the people that run Twitter and Google and Facebook and in the internet tech people which is if you think about like the amount of money that Facebook has your money that YouTube has it like these these enormously influential tech companies even Amazon right yeah like who who are they who are they vision in darkness are very aggressive notes and they're very thoughtful competitive I think I think who's the make so I think the meek that the philosophy behind that and I and I and I think the United States also works on this premise in the sentence is the American dream is that what keeps the masses from rising up and taking the money from people. The Have Nots from taking money from The Haves and especially when the haves rr-rather slimming number in comparison to the large proportion of population that says $500 in the bank will what's great about the United States was always worked about the United States we don't have these the French Revolution in this country is because the American dream is about potential there is a potential I may not have money now but I made and I will because I know I will cuz I'm an optimist I will be in the one percent eventually I got it yeah bro I'm telling you it's a great idea and people need that hope you take that hope away you take the ability to take the idea that there's no way I can ever esteem out of my condition you better be careful that's what that's that's so potential the potential to be better than potentially wealthier but think about how all of us a lot of us as well as we get older leftover I think it's a way of getting people to at least live with the fact that I'm a serf I'm a peasant I have no way to esteem out of my condition but at least I have the afterlife at least I know that if I live and I suffer well and I suffer quietly and I suffer with dignity there will be a reward after this what is the conventional definition or the conventional meaning to that state the meek will inherit the earth Ecuador how to Scholars interpret at what religious do you think Jesus was a real person historically I think there was probably a rabbi name Jesus of Nazareth Nazareth that that's what that's what that seems to be the conclusion about a lot of historians he was a radical radical man cuz he's simplified Judaism is really look you know you could follow the Book of Leviticus and all the rituals it takes to become a good Jew which is a certain way to quarter a calf and there's a play certain things you can't eat when you have to bathe and you have to all these rituals they said that way too complicated whenever the spread the word this way he said just make it simple do it right about hello said in the the Old Testament do unto others as you would have them do unto you and hold only one God is your god in the father so that we're all the idea of a monolithic God is that there's if there's one father we're all brothers and sisters that way we're all the same moral worth that way I can't judge that way I don't know what your worth only God knows I don't know I don't know where you have I don't know what your value is your human being I can't quantify that I think I think that's a beautiful thing I think we all benefit from that religious and that judeo Christian idea whether we know it or not and if you want to replace that but my only issue was atheists if you want to try to replace that are rational idea that arrest I did it we're all the same or what cuz I can't prove it but if are biologically but what do you replace that with rationality you want to try it you want you want to run a society and rationality can't do that well if that's the most dangerous idea that works Bedrock mortars in the handicap is draining resources from our gifted and I'm telling you now in a lot of this weekend in about history what if we live in abundance around new people take care of the people that handy cuz it doesn't always last and you can't predict the buttons at 11 right now but not really not for a lot of people easy to justify if you were just pray to the god of rationality be very easy to justify then people have done this in history people are severely retarded whatever they are severely handicapped they're draining me cuz I know you love him but we need this money for over here you're in a hospital you're taking one of the very old very informal you think we need religion to keep you from taking people off life support well I will say that I think religion and specifically The Joker and I included them in that and by the way I mean Buddhism is all talk about the sacredness of the sentient being are there because and I think we benefit from it I think that all of you too I mean where does our justice system is predicated it's predicated on the idea that all men are created equal do we benefit from it but there's also real problems with it we wouldn't have compassion for the people to mentally handicapped it does it's too thick or what I'm trying to say is that there's something very irrational and and very religious about the idea that all men are created equal and we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal right and you got her our talks about this brilliantly in his book which is that you cannot prove mathematically are biologically that that the idea that all men are created equal is that seasons of the new BSA is Israel right sound so because we're not LeBron James if he standing next to me is we're not equal is my chocolate Avatar right so but we inherently know that our humanness our human that you're not equal physically he's a super athlete but I'm funny or I had my own gift to I have suck Asian imagine if he was really funny. Like if you couldn't follow them that's when I give my girl she imagined that though I would protect him with my girl has a 6-foot what 11-6 965 f****** 7 ft in the air and I go mister mister James I'd like to be a traveling occupied by night when I don't want that I'm not your type would be so embarrassing like if a guy was that good at basketball but then was like a natural at comedy special and he's murdering and you still going to be something I don't know babe I mean there are at once but at the same time what I'm saying is that you can't quantify human being because you don't know what their potential is found you you got to follow him he's going to murder and then the King has left the building least he's going to drop the mic and walk away and be a problem and you got to going out of town is it really right and working like it's the amount of hours that we work on our craft verses about a basketball player at the practice different listeners one it's a long road is like you take a guy who has the kind of discipline and work ethic than an athlete does at the highest level of the game and apply that stand up, I bet they'll give further than a lot of us</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> are you getting punched in the head what is going on with you and I can't punch hard how hard I mean sometimes there's have been my buddy Chris from Boston is a giant and healed by accident sometimes you need to get connected and stuff but no you know you learn how to kind of keep your hands getting older you worried about that I'm insecure about your brain is a little cloudy Jesus cuz you're older what are you doing are you getting that look like yeah that's right that's what happened so keep that s*** up man he storms off yeah well he he came to the realization that he was yes he he made it out of the right invested in him like my brother so whenever you talk about ctm like he's honest if you wasn't doing good he tell you you know if it wasn't feeling good. I think everybody needs someone who they trust implicitly that they that can pull the cord on them tell them hey man you got to stop getting hit yes and for young Fighters man it is such a hard decision to make. I'll talk to several guys who tell their fighter several trainers have to tell their fighters to retire and it's never easy it's never easy and central angle identity the fighter will leave and go with a different trainer and be successful and in the the you know and this one case the trainer was like I wish him well and I'm sure he can still beat guys that's not the the problem is he's showing some obvious signs of deterioration mentally neurologically The Way She Moves the way she talks and could a person cares about you is going to go okay we had a lot of fun this great run your fine right now if you can talk if we can treat whatever problems come up apparently CBD is fantastic for that for a lot of people with brain issues and a lot of immuno inflammation issues because of trauma stuff to do not know what magnetic stuff that has zingano did Riley went down San Diego and soldiers where they put the electrodes who is retired who doesn't still feel like they could fight for the belt is already 48 that you never lose that part of what makes you a great fighter and a killer is that that sort of Love of the Game if you have Paulie malignaggi right now I guarantee I guarantee your life could you buy for a total of course</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Highpoint malignaggi who's at my gym and then he kind of knew he was waiting I just figured out who the f*** you are so so I take the opportunity to ask him like I'm just asking like some boxing questions next Endeavors give me a boxing lessons he look like he was in shape he was like in he was giving people pointers he's very he looks he seems showtimes he knows the game he's very smart as well as he can figure out the puzzle power-punching and he punches in volume is always in great shape me patterns like just basic things that I was like damn I really want to see the actual sparring match between him and Connor cuz all DLC release is Connor cracking him I know it's a long one there had to be some fun moments of the yeah or something yeah that's as a promo ruthless bro with the idea that they weren't going to use that is more ridiculous come on what who are you you don't understand how this business do you think that they're going to spare your Sensibility bare your feelings and not show edited versions of you getting popped my problem is so that I have a problem with that all across the board because because I feel like when common decency Fairplay you know a contract and answer the contract you in that you enter I'm coming out to help you out to do is use me go fuc yourself if you sign paperwork over at 5 sure they did but that's a sneaky move and I have a problem with it I just don't like justifying anything because it's going to be good promotion I'm always uneasy bad press What you talkin about him actually happened you hate the truth cuz of you if you hate the truth I could understand why you would want to show on that video that I have kind of did drop him when I left and it still be a great fights Conor McGregor vs Floyd Mayweather in terms of it creating this fight with r that means citizen against not the best award and reward for my favorite and Roy Jones jr. Aamir Khan like if you are like he has an amazing record he's fighting a genius in Crawford and probably it in there's no shame in this he was supposed to fight Kell Brook's any kind of went you know what this guy is time is on his side and he's going to he's kind of figured this out he's bigger and he's going to kidnap to he's going to hit me in and maybe hurt me here I don't feel like doing this anymore if that was the case I forgive him for everything it's okay. That was a smart decision baby was really hard does Yard-Man number one yeah I mean I think Crawford like when he fights Earl Spence and I think that lomachenko has probably had more fights and you can really get into this conversation cuz he hasn't everybody they said how many fights it was something ridiculous like that I mean he fought a world-class sliders first time out Jorge go to Crawford Crawford a great amateur background to look Crawford the difference is Crawford way bigger that's the difference if they were the same size would be really interesting to see what would happen but Crawford's a lot bigger than him he would now it's just what is footwork is unparalleled but Terence Crawford Men first of all he's probably the best switch hitter ever next to Marvin Hagler he might be better news hard to say when you can see he can have your game plan for that no-good southpaw meaning of the best aminos Anderson Silva as prompto who does figure out your timing figure out what you do how you enter where the gaps are where the holes are okay I see the key to the castle let's rock and then somewhere around the end of the first round and it would start switching stances on you and f****** doing some Bruce Lee moves and the next thing you know he's got his foot in your face yet I tried to figure you out of the elite Fighters they're just the best at solving the Little Riddle That is what your skills are how do you solve the Riddle That is copying there, that's a different riddle is that motherfukers not on the outside boxing you and isolating had two hands on that wrist he was stopping him for a long time from closing his his hands and and that seemed kind of effective for a while I mean good luck so long but that's like saying you're running a marathon hey you know he beat me in the marathon before the first hundred yards I was way ahead think I even appreciate it I mean I can intellectualize it and I could describe it but I think when you're in there with him like when when he fought Edson Barboza he had Escobar blows up against cage fighting a baby and I love I love looks like its legs body looks like you know guys here at the pool, works out maybe a little it just doesn't like making like a most muscular pose or something cut the s*** Bro eyeshadows look like that when you yes I really got into lifting while I think I am weak I'm like striking demands and your muscles in your fatigue and it works the other way too cuz I remember I had done any striking at all in like a year I got the nun 02 and then my friend Jamie and I are doing Jamie is a trainer and we were doing this training session and he had me hit mitts to and like just Mets for a couple minutes of gas that was like an old is possible so I roll all the time I'm in good shape right now finds that way when you can't we get guys for triathletes whoever they come in and Wayne McCullough trash out at the great way McCulloch my trainer while of love thy God he's the best I f****** that's one of my favorite people in the world in the world find this guy here who's who beat Morales who fought Prince Naseem to the distance and nobody knows it and he never tells anybody and you'll see these guys hitting them like Wayne why don't you tell them because they don't ask me I don't I don't bother them he's just the most humbled in while I get drives me f****** nuts but lost but we'll get like traffic people in really good shape but if you if your sparring and you're afraid to get hit you stop breathing and sew in 3 minutes into minutes I don't care how good of shape you're in if you're sparring and you're afraid to get hit you stop breathing and sew in 3 minutes into minutes I don't care how good of shape you're in the middle get pushed once you like literally it probably took me three years to get over that in the way cuz I have no confidence is a boxer and I shouldn't</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but that thing in the Congo man's it's apparently a very difficult spot to reach is very dangerous to go through there couldn't know when Justin ran go through there he has some hair-raising stories about being held up at gunpoint in ordinary people thought they were going to kill somebody bands got moved into the Congo and lived in them in you know in the jungle and who knows who doesn't just go and building Wells wanting to give people money get $5 every time someone signs up and uses the code Joe Rogan and they've built at their building Wells right now because that was the latest number I forgot what the number was he sent me an updated it like very early on that we're dead built to Wells and then they built a bunch more and provided water to a s*** ton of people down there I don't know the exact status clip of the pygmies in the Congo for a long time but that's what Justin said that they smoke a lot of bacteria and parasites and stuff to the anime parasyte some water skin diseases and weird things like that the other jungles not even if you have evolved to live in it a very I spent enough time in the Indonesian rainforest I've never seen bugs like that in my life I've never seen it's so loud sulfur coil good luck with the mosquitoes bug spray their laugh at your f****** at your bug spray you got to carry out you have to burn to self a quill and just hold it has like a heating coil in it and some fuel and you ignited and the the heating coil it heats up and you put this little pad across the screen in this little pad has his stuff in it the mosquitoes hate it's probably terrible for you but the chemical waps up in the air and I'm telling you it creates a 10-foot bubble around you where no mosquitoes get it yeah I'm not using it every day I wouldn't recommend using everyday but if it's difference between like and jointly cuz you're in a place like Alaska go try to raise crops in South Africa When Animals when elephants were everywhere and lions and leopards now even now these poor villagers that they are poor and they build these crops and they they have this farm and they they have all this food for their Village and then elephants romantic and that's a wrap you want here like I have a lot of stories about elephants have this mistaken South Africa there was this guy was a farmer and he had a donkey and it was tied up and the elephants came into his property and he shot guns and got them the hell away from there and then the next day the elephant's came back and stomp his f****** donkey into mush stomping the donkey was on yeah route they're like really gang gang gang then of course the other the neighboring Farm in the elephant's came she she laid out a bunch of food for them in the eyes and they spared her her crop there all these elephants have this mistake which is all by the way maybe the biggest a holes in the world he's watching like this little bump what's up oh my God yeah elephant came over and rolled it over about you wow you got to see how the video I didn't pull those three elephants, Lions Hill elephants which is just so nuts they did they will take a chance to try to kill an elephant they'll jump on their back the try to Jack them or when you go to a game reserve in South Africa you can't it has to be big enough to sustain lines cuz it's super expensive cuz they're just a pride of lions eat everything got to keep replenishing the animals because they just they're just too effective you know after the dentist shot Cecil the lion and became the international outrage they ban the lion hunting and because of that people didn't want to go back and they weren't getting the money from it so they want of euthanizing like 200 lion I have because their ungulate population was getting devastated but it made me think when I heard that I was like how many lions are they killing how many people are going over there to hunt lions to bring them good money a huge part of South Africa's you know that part of the conservation in that like we are so conflicted in so weird that the only way we have animals that stay alive in this part of the world like with her and record populations that is to set up so you can kill him so like that we figure out some weird loophole like we don't want the Rhino to die hey we don't want to ride or die either so let's go out a bunch of them all the different animals that you think Plains animals in Africa their record numbers their nilgai to bring back to taxes to rollover taxes you know there's so many animals there and a lot of those panels were on the verge of Extinction but they're there because people kill them like what a f*** if he has another drum unbroken migratory range weather in Rome for thousands of miles but most of Africa now is broken up into I didn't know that Darian Cameroon or whatever but most of Africa's broken up into a van in South Africa it's all basically with the exception of Kruger Park it's all abandoned you know cattle lots and then they just did this money and it's You by that lot need to stock up with animals and then you drive around sustainable ecosystem call Rodney Allison population and lion population when we think about Africa right when we say oh elephants are going extinct in Africa like Africa is so big crazy it's so big you seen the map where you stuff all the countries in South Africa in abundance of them in one area and none in another area it's like saying like they have a black bear problem in New Jersey what could do okay today yeah they do but that doesn't affect

		<div class="paragraph"> sorry there's a layer somewhere around 66 million years ago that indicates that the Earth got hit by an asteroid that's what I mean that in the layers high in the Iridium I think an iridium has it's very rare on Earth but very common in space and there's a bunch of other indications that that's the time that it hit what they're saying the Radiolab on is that the current state of understanding is that the dinosaurs and basically most died within the first couple hours like all the dinosaurs think they were all their bones are there fossils are in that iridium layer a lot of times right after they think that their blood boiled in their body to think it got so hot that during the few hours that got to look 700000 degrees 1200 degrees is just got insanely hot now I got to worry about f****** that's a full-time job raise my kids that's we really should be thinking about not just how bad were f****** the Earth out but how bad something could fuc the Earth up from the sky that's what we really should be paying attention to instead of paying attention to so many nonsensical things people concentrate on there's a real chance we could get hit in our lifetime with something that end civilization like that at 100% Can Happen I had Graham Hancock on last week and we were going over his new book this book where is it up it's accilent and Graham was talking about to call the America before it's the evidence of civilizations in in the Americas in North America particularly in the Amazon that did they think that there was millions of people live in the Amazon but when the European explorers came over here the game smallpox and wiped out everyone and they came back hundred years later and there was nothing like the entire civilization wife they said think I feel like I'm fourteen ninety-two are there was a I think when the Spanish came up through the Mississippi Delta the same thing same thing they wiped out 90 BP a lot of people think that the genocide of the Native Americans was just European soldiers in and people and settlers killing Native Americans 90% view missionaries are going out there and trying to convert them to Christianity you're giving them you are diseases they knew that back then they knew that they were like you're there getting sick and they're dying of you know that there was also in there like we're getting these colds and people are dying didn't have any resistance to a crazy dirty Europeans their s*** water shoots outside their house and I'll f****** Vermin running around that was War of the Worlds member War of the Worlds they weren't ready for pathogens that's my whole philosophy on we all try to be tough one of the things about all of his men or anybody is we hate to be vulnerable so you Night Train and I stay in shape I eat well and I will never ever I don't think there's anything such thing is I don't think you can be really ready for a situation when you get bit by a tick or you get the flesh eating disease and you die I don't know if there's any way to get MRSA yourself yourself but you are ultimately very vulnerable but then what this Radiolab was freaking me out about was that there's so many of those things floating around the sky and this would Graham talked about in not just his book but done in previous books that they think that's something slammed into the Earth somewhere in the past that ended the Ice Age probably wiped out at a giant chunk of the large megafauna on North America the large megafauna on North America led to the almost instantaneous Extinction of so many different animals and so it goes and so it goes and it can happen again that could be a supervolcano that's all kinds of stuff at that all these f****** things that this week</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so I mean I'm with you in that I am ridiculously optimistic I think that I think people I meant I follow Steven pinker's logic of people will sort of look at the horrible things that we have today and say God this world is terrible but there are definitely terrible aspects but this is without doubt the greatest time ever to be alive that we've ever seen at least in recorded human history giant part of that it is basically This Global worlds which we thought was going to be beautiful thing in the fact that life on the internet yeah I've got to be optimistic yeah well I just wouldn't be here but this military aspect like something back to that but yeah I do try and think I need to do this I think that's a good thing to do if you go the same speed as the river they could throw you on the Rocks they can give you a wonderful ride it could be anything but it's up to the river by his iPad like crazy sometimes I backpedal like crazy I have actively backpedal against things and sometimes use them pedaling faster than the speed of the river to try and guide myself to you that there's a possibility that we need all this negative in order to reinforce the positive that there is some component of human life that desires or or relies upon negative things to reinforce positive things that this yin and yang that we exist under that this this that week we see the horrors of war and horrific poverty and all these terrible things in the horrible we see this and it actually serves to reinforce our desire for positive things and reinforce and pushed our society any more positive direction I mean I almost think that this is when we see National tragedies and shootings and all these different terrible terrible things there's there's all this fear and anger and frustration but there's also action in the action might meet you might think there's a lack of action by politicians or lack of action by the police or a lack of action by whoever we think should be responsible for mitigating these horrible situations that happen but publicly that the social fabric of the world the way people communicate and interact I think it reinforces our desire to not have that happen it reinforces our understanding of peace and our our love of peace and I think that these these bad things that we see in our world there almost Propel us towards a better world because human being constantly striving for improvement and Innovation is one of the things that we do we want things to be better and bigger and faster and stronger and we want our society to be better at all times never say this is good to keep it just the way it is whenever it's whenever said that so might my thought is that even this even what we were experiencing this country would like as it seems at times were on the brink of civil war between the right and the left and people lying on both sides and conflating people's opinions and changing people's perspectives Jerome narrative that I think that this ultimately all this angst until you see it from the outside and you look at it or what the f*** are we doing I think it's a natural part of the way human beings figure out life I think I think almost the same as you I would. things to go on a stick of World War II Shania we went right to the wire on that and then suddenly became back and maybe not even wasn't even the political will on that it was just activates the Japanese haven't bumped Avo we wouldn't you guys we would have had you guys in us with us for the money the Russian people we wouldn't have won World War II and that was when they were in this agreement so I can't quite work out Humanity I do think positive I do think of the negatives you can appreciate the post is not do Thing 1 Thing on on the brexit brexit thing that's been going on has a lot of young people coming on saying what you're going to lose all this stuff that we could travel to to your without visas we can work that we could retire that we can get a healthcare.org what what today they could lose a lot more so yeah the yin and yang that you can I think I think it's going to go on this way and also somebody wants once we get to a good place I've noticed a lot of people will say okay I'm not going to be politically active anymore I'm just going to carry on doing my life and other people so things I've noticed people will get activated to get to a result may be an election result or something or referendum or whatever it is and then they will just back off I get frustrated single that done that's bags and a positive way maybe I'm just say but now I'm not even go to pay attention what's going on I think this out rolling backwards so I think we're going to keep having it like that maybe the percentage of positive things to negative things has never changed over all the years it would last 10000 years just as more people in the world doing more positive things and doing more negative things maybe you meant he hasn't changed Jasmine is the size of a brain is not move so we he went back to seven 70,000 years ago we would still be able to have conversations like this even though we wouldn't of the Raiders and the things that be more on I'll try I think I'll try to be better than you were trying to actually stay by I think all the way back and it went well just bring me food you nice good three fight if it wasn't that they was maybe going to millions of years ago but no 700,000 years ago we landed on the moon open I think Michael Collins in to come out natural said this is for the world and it was just kind of feeling a Neil Armstrong it is it's a nice yeah I like grabbed hold of that guy the kid I was growing up not being able to talk to space travel in a hundred thousand years that's what they think right didn't have real language I think it's about a hundred thousand years ago the best when it came up in the first place we said was pause bastet's and all they did was ate kill it go poo and have sex that's all I did those things by the enlightenment of Human Rights it's a week we added maybe we'll never know but it has happened I just don't think a bloke did it upstairs with a big bears head now is the time that you speak do you make Handbags and no fight was with the mg42 and now I just I just think it happens and we need to roll with it and try to make humans work on this planet cuz I'm going to be getting Mouse soon and you can just say that we going to Kalamazoo some bitmojis cuz we want to vote in government you two are you a slings you know they're going to treat us the same way Americans treat the British you can just see that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you are running for something now what are you doing I'm going to I said that but 9 years quite consistently I would like to say that I was going to run in 2020 week we had set terms and politics like you always had you got a four-year we arranged into a five-year but then we come back to the old system which is where the Prime Minister the country can choose when they have an election and it can be anywhere up to a day and the next day after the election after 5 years later so we have no idea decide you know what we'll have another election in 2 weeks yeah and they wouldn't do that for that but you know like we have a generation of 15 2015 and then 2017 having been if it's only two years tourism I was persuaded that he could go over like you're not going to win big on the tons of extra seats and then we'll be able to do whatever we want but they lost seats and sometimes what is a traditional guy in the fourth year because if you go older you can always go and everything's pretty good okay let's go now we go. But he is fabulous and we can cuz we know where's a good place and then you have to allow hit 6 weeks for election campaign but yeah that's we do that I think other countries do that but supposed to United Kingdom Wales in Scotland is this a step are you going to move further along the line or you were going to eventually know that would be but you have a set. Of time where you going to do this and then afterwards going to retire no I I would do it no set. Of time I just got to go off and I can come back when I stand up lifewell you can like books you like to write books in the hospital's it's all a bit hazy but not sure if you have the same system as my friend Doug Stanhope was running for president briefly kind of as a lark and realized that he really couldn't do stand-up because we did stand-up he would have to allow equal time for everyone else who wanted to perform who also had some like his stand-up performances were then thought of as political campaign running form answers sing along those lines it was like some weird bulshit that he was going to have to navigate that he decided to back out of it but he was bullshiting the entire time she's doing for fun now I'm going to do it I think a lot of motivate and encourage my in the world to go in a positive direction I think I've been saying this politically then I think this is a lot of century on Earth or its after sent you and I think next 80 is everything we're going to choose everything here either going to wipe us out the planet or we're going to make it a fair world at 7:45 billion people will you have a right to have affair with enough democracy and transparency enough money to live a lifetime of family know everyone know billions of people living on $1 a day or $2 a day so I think we need to get to back because then immigration raises its head you'll come to my country every country in the world and that's old people moving around because they have enough money to live on or I'm going to security cuz it's a war Civil War and if we could get beyond that then a lot of those problems away so but I'm going to take some talking about a global vision future whatever is slightly we seem to be trying 1930s politics again and implicitly area so I felt well I'm going to I'm going to look for a vision of positive vision of the future and I know when I came out as transgender in a B-52 was no way I could have imagined anything I didn't know where I was going to go I just thought I need to argue or discuss at least try and set up a positive image version you know cuz was just so out at transgender you need to talk about it people MD MBA the told mentalism if you're in a shooting bullets but everything in the end of psychological and if I was going to do that I was going to try and do they said I would take risks in these areas of of you know I'll go out and people say of you know I'll go out and people saving the street whatever they do and do that and then I'll run the map is not knowing that you might have to be in an altercation</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> we were talking before and you were trying to tell me you were lazy and like to f*** you I saw that thing that you did that documentary where you ran a series of marathons in a row no training at all and I remember thinking before that had this opinion of you and opinion of you was your funny guy you're a funny comedian you have a good stand-up you obviously work hard at it but then I saw that and I was like okay there's something going on there human being kind of human being that can push themselves into doing that day after day after day and I looked at your feet with your skin was literally falling off ear taping everything up and that's a that's a person that's got you have an iron will I got some very unusual will for a comedian doesn't really exercise like when you were doing him you were Me Maybe actually has a little bit but you weren't in shape and you decided to run how many marathons first one yeah that was 43 and 51 days 43 marathons in a row in 51 days with no training at a death way I did have time at 6 weeks training encyclopedic about you live alone and Revolution motivate and be able to but on the spot training a training as you have a long but I did the first time you for the next 33 cuz you go I've done one time on the second and you can call me RA Georgie come punch this guy you count for the metal I knew that you already you've got up at 5 or 6 in the morning and it's midday and you're you're going through that it was yesterday and I didn't actually wear all the time so we started bathing in surgical spirit with you cool something else if they said it's a method of your face and so I got a tough and actually that goes through and then I started and also apparently cut in 27 mountains in 27 days in South Africa in 2016 and that was the temperatures for crazy on that but it seems that the body was switch on a healing property that we got lights and in ourselves that we don't use and you will heal quicker that you will heal faster the more you got to get stronger after that it's kind of easier used to your body just a dab somebody understands Yep this crazy-ass whole thing to do is crazy also and the Brain goes what kind of math and she'll be run today as opposed to what kind of Marathon I understand let's let's try better Mathis don't push it too hard you know you the brain sucks talk into the body and somehow it levels out and about Sorel American 18 - 23 all of this country I grew up in and you feel up the road the fields the bird I didn't know any music I want a safety thing for traffic but also you could hear everything that's going on but running it was somebody's house and there was a river running through the back blackberry's out of the bushes like I did when I was a kid it just became effective Federal this the hellis tocopheryl marathons that's what I was doing which is fine and I'm just wrapped up in this other place and it was beautiful on the last day the last run when you cross the line feeling like why this is a bit she brought out that picture is me, they put up some flags and stuff that was beautiful I tried to do it a 5-hour Marathon that if you know the Speed 2 hours is what the slow but then having done 42 minutes in suits maybe it's fat and I missed it by about 30 seconds but it was it was beautiful to finish it I was really quite strong on the way to I didn't stop at any time that was that was good in South Africa though 27 days salute to Nelson Mandela's 27 years in prison and they fight they put me in hospital because they killed my kidneys were given up experiencing rapto what devices I couldn't spell being dyslexic and I was paying Brown pee and and did it real pain love last time and this is without exercise so I trained but yeah this was not through the whole series of marathons or was that was I I tried to do South Africa twice 2012 was my first one off today for on an empty cholesterol drug and then they said either hospital now into the bloodstream of kidneys it's apparently something that happens when Fighters over-train as well and sometimes are not doing it scientifically so they're not analyzing their heart rate or heart rate variability and they don't know that they have a really truly recovered and they continue to push themselves because they prepare harder they have this sort of mental mindset just train harder and you'll be better off but that's not necessarily the case of your body can't physically keep up with the recovery and sometimes they'll go into a fight over trained and then they wind up getting rhabdo from the fight Tappan several times since cause a few deaths yeah well they said that he said you care on 2012 I would need that medication I would have told you know they check you out the final flag with a Chevy waving flag you could another Masten together and it's just what yeah I might bring like a this is kind of good but because it is 90k you going to do today ignore it carry on and it was a rough rough whole day that's up 5 hours then another 5 hours 5 hours plus they got to come right back after this I have to go which is 90k and they go to 1200 so I said I will do 90k in 12 oz orgasmic when you finished it must have been incredible finishing 84 was beautiful you finish at the steps of Nelson Mandela statue where he was president and that was I actually go faster than a thing where you have to speed up there was a wind that was a single sport relief is doing it. Was raising money and I wanted to finish it inside the camera with the letter window till 3:15 South African time police at schools with needed a certain base otherwise you'll get carjacked things and and it is and you won't survive this account we just ignore ignore it nothing Drive is Victoria start me off and then I'll run there and we'll just continue it on that so we had to do that so we got behind because I wasn't running cuz I'd be driven that crossed it's dangerous. Of part point of road to be dropped to Pretoria and then I just have to run the kilometers off so they have like a car jack Andrea we got to do this just Chicago then so I said well just get me closer to the Finishing Line and then I'll just run right this very matter where I'm running now we no speak Torino we need to finish I need to just run that distance so I ran the distance off but the time and got behind so I had to speed up from 7.5 km an hour to 10 km 7 extra said it was me which was kind of evil I was never considering not doing it and I got the live feeds at the London finish the quarter past and we got about 30 minutes pass we have at 2 minutes and they just caught it before the weather is this Sunday and so they kept talk normally they said we can't talk anymore we got 2 minutes and I'm going to talk to important people go away that's what normally happens if you're talking to life present national press but I was on the thing and they just can't talk because I was a slow news day nothing was happening and they say we got this idiot that I'm going to go away now I got to stop this I have to start my own interview which I've never done in my life I realized they just got no one else to talk to desperate did you notice a big change in public perception of you once you completed those marathons now Mount their butt fat plant I got to pass up that play to you if you're going to do that I was trying to do selection you know that they ask they have selection your Delta posters Navy Seals they will have this thing that can you just go on and on and on and it's the stamina thing and that was my civilian selection for whatever do the next shot he said he knew how to shoot things I played my cards I've never got back in a few done the whole South African failed and people are tweeting about me and he is a you know Africa kick your ass either you just going to TIAA you know this is Africa I kept trying to reset the day that can we get back and do the thing but doesn't know we went okay I'm going to finally be able to that and it suddenly it's on it's on it's on and I didn't I couldn't try him again and so I thought I'd just go get it done and then day 5 isn't Hustle day6 I just didn't look good it was 11:35 38° whatever you know and I'm used to it and I was not used to that and so I was I would have made that I feel but he's didn't even know what the word meant nephrologist I was very cool black dude in the he was that inside Afghan Easton East London is cold is the city just a big place and he's going what are you doing you need some Hydro while and after that it got better but I'm so they 11 I got into the national National talk shows no one else that just me and animals and this is a rainstorm as well in the middle of it getting stronger through the barrier and I also cuz I run full Mac and then a day off and then the fifth sixth day I ran 2/3 or Mathis Road 142 that's masses in 6 days the eight mountains in nine days is always one day behind so I'll stay out there and that'll be a good climax take and off my South African thing what is going on with your mind when you doing this because you you're not listening to any music in your in this sort of meditative state where you just Left Foot Right Foot Left Foot Right Foot breathe in breathe out like I just feel it just I'm such a beautiful thing of May because that's what we used to be as humans that maybe I'm reaching back out on the Plains and we were looking for honey Wild Honey or berries or fruit stuff and and if we could trap something we've vitamin D and you're getting stronger pain that somebody once read my time ever do the hand palm reading but I was at a Halloween party and there's a palm reader read my hand I never played Sports this is one of my gifts to myself accident I think for the age of 12 in your teenager is your bones where they moving and setting and at that time I was out there doing anything so I think my knees have never gone the people say running in the knees my knees are not gun I got a whole theory about that the heel of the foot which it should never in a you should have spent his toes curl running should be that's not how people are supposed to run those actually change by Nike they developed a running shoe with a fat heel and they changed the way people run they change the gate and it's responsible for a lot of injuries I think that I'm that medicine horses if you look for the Halo horse it's right by that bum has the toes and then you go and we are the ones that use the scale thing obviously initially to for walking to make us balance when we went from the chimpanzee station to the most people if you just give them if they're Barefoot like children for example like one of the things that I was reading this book about barefoot running and how important it is to develop as most people that have problems from that they're really having problems because their feet don't have strong muscles and then because of the atrophy and the way they driving a regular running shoes essentially like a cast and that you're you're so used to being protected in this calf that everything sword just gets mushy inside of it and then you're also striking down the hill which is a very unnatural thing and I want to watch my kids run like my kids will run with me sometimes and they naturally know to run on the balls of feet that other naturally run and when people start running heel first that's where all the problems come it's just not a normal way for people to run yeah and I was also after running on Sutton road Services weather just dropped instead of doing a tarmacadam kind of covering they had just put rocks out to see some Lauren come along tractor just drop rocks out of the back instead of hold together the mud and in the Rainy times and very uneven surface pay out of the foot and I was I was doing these very thin sole running shoes Vibrams in the world vivobarefoot ones and we run marathons in Barefoot initially I was and then I train it I just got so hot and then I left it to them to choose my wife is here and he's olympic-level so he said okay honestly I make a deal with these shop Rock Spot already shop I was every few steps and they were just they had they were laughing and running along that faded built up like and it's very this is very rule area so let's a mortal Mortal that was that was the rain that was the rain stop done with the flag and I do to people and I'm glad to say how are you in that Kusa Kusa this guy seems like he's wearing women's clothes

		<div class="paragraph"> sports watch football that's it do you worry about brain damage NFL leather helmets and there was less concussion because you would not lead with your head now you have a weapon on your head and people have used this such and so I would love to know how to do throwback uniforms let's let's go throwback equipment so many different factors the way to practice daily setup plays lesbian new game I don't think it's going to happen I think the perception of the helmet being safer f*** the game up I really think did you know I'll write I used to think that bare-knuckle boxing but I like they should have bare knuckles in the UFC but then I've been watching is bare-knuckle boxing stuff and people get caught up so bad now I'm thinking you know what it's better to have padded Knuckles it's better it's better for the fighters that have a hard shell what day did you do this as a weapon so that's literally the only way you going to be able to stop this brain damage and you still not going to stop at all this took colliding into each other guys are getting brain damage from getting hit in the chest do certain age I think meow yeah and then the practices will be different where we only do pads once a week for the real game will be amazing if they ever came up with something that definitively fixed it like some stem cell treatment or something like that the regenerator brain tissue and bring you back to your normal state right if they do that enough to worry about it anymore that's a very complex question of how to regenerate neural tissue brain tissue how to get rid of all those abscesses and all those things you see in those people's brains enough CTE the MLB's like holes in their brain it's serious yet it's wild asporto did you play football the fastest cars are small and just so you know if ass kicking and punching stuff but when I was in high school when I was wrestling they were trying to tell me to like the coach coach Murphy he was also the wrestling coaching was also the football coach and he's like football I think he's not squashing me the f*** out of here the hardest I've ever been hit with my little didn't practice probably like five 7 and he just he was a DB and it was a practice was like third string running back in there like I was just running up the gut and I was falling into the endzone right it was over and then he had a run-in that's the hardest I've ever been hit with my little guy so he can run and just think of all that mass behind them really good athlete can run and just think all that mass behind them behind them getting is probably unlike anything in sports other than a car accident but other than that</div>

To do that that's a good question then as a female doesn't go to a female prison that's a good question I don't know maybe that's why they put her in solitary right right protected from dudes know I'm going to prison I got like a year before I get sentenced I might just go to get that sex change let's say if I know I'm going to prison I got like a year before I get sentenced I might just go to get that sex change I'm with females</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I read about you fellow Boston native in the red about your Tesla journey and I was like there's a f****** interesting story this guy buys a broken Tesla right and then you couldn't get parts for it anywhere so well that would have happened to the car's been an accident no so the guy I met the previous owner and he actually was during Hurricane Sandy pillar phone oh yeah yeah I know right so I could fight the water he lost obviously and it was just under water man I'm liking what I got to try this thing and so what it would Tesla do in that situation if you wanted to bring it back to them they would have to rebuild the entire car they would even do it because at that point once anything liquid you know I kind of like water intrusion happened to the movie the whole car off the Fisker dilemma at the Hurricane Sandy when they had the Fiskars that were parked at the is it was some sort of a doc right where they thought they all exploded water level Rose the water got into them they just went off with the whole bunch of it you can watch the video they just start going off like f****** oh yeah oh yeah I know that feeling that boom boom boom once people realize their car could just explode information that has back in the cars that's what was left of them wow in the f****** blew up the beautiful card mr. did a great job of making car that looks really good right button Chrome one you know we have no idea if he has that car no kidding tucked away somewhere but what are they drive like to the you think that back and looks ugly I hope you like it that much know what's funny but doesn't look that bad some guy got arrested in Germany they pulled him over and and compounds his car cuz he had a gold shiny wrap on it right was it to reflect spoke you know I didn't want you doing that and then I want you flexing too much over there not too much now I bet they were like reluctantly or making cars like super flashy to like American markets and s*** I think so too I wonder you think so I don't know I don't know and handling my goddamn German cars have it now they really do I do and it's an insane car by today's standards only has like 505 horsepower of funny but like it. It's not a lot and so mean it's a mean car the car put you on your ass really quick Man Taylor out there was telling us that they put a Tesla in ludicrous mode on Dino and it had some insane number of torque is Rite 900 pound pound feet of torque Drive in somewhere in the neighborhood of a thousand horsepower on a Dyno could believe I lied about leaving gold at 9 all the cases they're insane cars man I'm telling you America's not to do it now I think it's interesting that you know people don't realize it's when they see a Tesla it's a fully American car yeah I didn't realize after just like always probably something like you know German or like Japanese car button to 100% made here is this the which model is this 20 mile an hour to roll sound like little boys don't take this Chancellor. There's so much torque it took very very very powerful car but I'm try to describe it to people especially people who never driven electric car make it doesn't even seem real it seems like it violates physics so I do like yours by the way I know that you came here and Bamboozled by one pretty much figure things out right now which is what brought me to you I love the fact that you took this car that was f***** up right and you refuse to let it go you like I'm going to figure out how to fix this f****** thing how much did you buy it for what it was 15 Granite I'm not like some like Evil Genius or Brainiac this was driven by my cheapness yeah she had a job at Tesla and he's like buddy listen to these crazy cars I knew have a ZO6 but this car is faster than that going to love this thing up and electric crap all kind of wine and do with that whatever you brought the car over great looking car I said all right and I'll take it for a drive or whatever and the thing was amazing amazing car so I was intact and I'm just like listen like you know I like how much does this thing cost I can make decent money whatever I just throw some money at and then he said he left and I thought to myself like every night I was like you know what I got to get my hands on one of these cars now I got to get one like you know sell a kidney whatever I sell a testicle whatever I can do and it's I was searching online and you know at what happens whenever a car gets messed up whenever a car gets up as they say total in the way and it's a total loss and insurance company will take it and they'll kind of auction it off to the highest bidder and I saw home for sale was like in a 15 G and they said it didn't want to drive and it was in a flood and I'm just like 15 grand I could do that two piece of cake man throw some money at it whatever hard going to be extinct in a bag of rice and it's tied up and I got it home and I was like you know what this is I got myself into some s*** here cuz it was a lot I thought I was going to be in sight unseen really let you on the auction lots to Austin so they took five photos of it it was sent from the interior of some from the side and up one under the the front and I was just like I could probably do this right no big deal so this begins is Project which takes how long from to completion I didn't tell you about maybe six or seven months or so of straight work know so I have so I was working at the time and I think only butt the hours of like 7 p.m. and like 11 p.m. like every night Tuesday and then weekends for a few hours until I figured it out fam So Good by social life pretty much yeah I was a permit for there for those months and what actually ended up doing was so I had the car right so I was freaking out because my wife was just like how much was that thing like us and that was really messed up now I couldn't save I want to get that one for gas for Grand minimum worth 15 grand dead serious that's insane what does it mean to have doors yet I took the doors I'll have to do without the battery pack is still in there right and the motor and the motor was still in there to do people take those and put them in like old cars or anything yet but I didn't know what training used so you know how you know this swap Lillian LS into everything Land Cruiser Toyota Land Cruiser 11th and Portia people are losing their f****** mind taking old air-cooled cars yep Witcher notoriously difficult to get to a high-horsepower exactly cuz those are cool cars like you'd only get him like around 400 + horsepower they've got that insanely engineered new one was that called right away either way it's like you know damn never exactly a million set giant house man Tesla Motors all electric muscle car that's good looking to one of the best looking car ever how you go what the f*** it's going to cost you to recreate that same look company that does its company called rev ology that makes old like 1966 to like 68 Mustangs but they do it with all new parts brand modern technology pretty much because it's a new car there they buy the full that's a brand new car that's never existed stay by the Holyoke cuz it's I think it's called the unibody construction is that what it is there's something little the way that these Mustangs are constructed the body built into the frame and they bought this company sells them like completed versions of the body kit that are perfect with perfect tolerances right select it like it's called that's one the 67 Shelby GT500 that's a price I'm oh wow Opus fuk if you look at like what it looks like go down and see some pictures of it Jamie you get a better to a better sense of it but this guy is meticulous is very meticulous I've been following her stuff for quite a while and what they do is really incredible that one's a GT500 that was actually nice for charge that is a 600 horsepower engine there's from the bottom up being right then it's like I don't mind not shifting in it that thing seems like it's going to literally punch a hole through space-time do too bad I think so too I think I'm looking at it like 0 to 60 in like one point something so I can get in the car nothing just lead to the top of buildings that walking around right and regular until it goes down amazing cars man and I think that's that's what the main reason why I think I got to get one of these man what was the struggle initial struggle you have the car you take it apart and what did you see rights because I was kind of taking my time because I knew it was a point where I couldn't fix the damn thing I was kind of wasting everyone's time Wesley does a certain point where I took everything apart and I was like all right cool I found a dead fish in the back of the car by the way to actually know what the turning point of this whole thing was that the turning point was I I realize it was salt water and not Friday so you know what saltwater does and I said to myself all right to call Tesla you know by a motor buy battery pack I'll be good I'll spend like 20 and for a battery in like maybe 10 promoter I'll be home like 4:40 it's still cheaper than a hundred front right so so I called him and so I bought this test was under water and it's not going to work number in the VIN number Carlisa to salvage that thing was underwater we're not going to help you and I just hung up the phone every single car is they know what it's doing it off the airbags went off and if you farted the front seat they know everything about these cars the cars are always the mothership to give me the status in the car so they have going on so you know if you try to hide from you just can't do it so so I had the I had to contact myself you know what this is going to work I got to figure something out so what I did basically I bought another car for fifteen Grand and I was like I got to swap this stuff over so I stopped to receive the other one that you bought for fifteen Grand everything worked what it was in a front-end Collision collision and frame is bent a lot of the wiring harnesses work right in the front end collision car but the interesting part was that in the flooded car the wiring harnesses were still good for the most part in the front really do what I did was Meet meeting not broken or torn or haven't been connectors I just took those connectors off and actually clean them because I couldn't get parts from Tesla my took like the wet wiring harness they're all corroded pulled them out. Let you know what Cue tip toothbrush and all that stuff and like a wire brush and I got a toothache to really get in there in like cleaning the contacts and stuff I just rinse them out water but this time your wife is probably like what she pissed because I noticed were missing $30,000 to my bank account free grant writing my friends Hey listen do you know I'm in a mess here I'm rebuilding a test on it just like you know you're an idiot you're not going to figure this out like no one's doing that cuz it was so two years ago this is when the cars were still kind of coming on at the scene and they weren't as popular as they are now I like you can't fix that like you're an idiot I can't do that I've seen your work and so you know I got one running and the parts I didn't need any more like the old battery pack and some of that there were some parts of the body that we're still good so I actually sold those parts like online and on eBay and stuff like that and then I sold at the motor he had water and it's going to be 5 grand from oh to have water in it that's all Bible these parts and so after all that's all the parts ended up getting the car have now for about 6 grand so you take the engine and is that one of the four-wheel-drive ones the ones you have to adjust the rear wheel drive on and you'd so it has just the rear engine the single motor yet one engine until you take those out you put it all back in your place the wires and then it's good to go what about the computer what about so pretty much that the computer thing was intro because there was like all Tesla again I was like hey buddy like this car is like 99% of the way there. They know who you are at this point they still don't know who I am you know what I mean like count me out your hickey and they were like you the same idiot that, yeah I need the key there like we can't as I stated before we can help you cuz you know this this is a salvage car so you're on your own so what I did was I actually in the in the GPS screen for the screen turned on the the the guy still had the home location so I pushed home on the GPS screen found a guy's address dress and I was like hey you know can we call them up I'll take a did you own like a white Tesla by chance and he's like yeah I was like yeah so I bought it and I need the key do you have the key to the car and he's like no I don't have that and I want to figure it out I can't help you like damn that sucks you know cuz you know I have a family and stuff when you know I'm just going to look for help me I'll be good and general topics and he's like you know and I know you're a car guy that's awesome I had a I had a ZO6 once too and it was LeMans blue and Florida liquor I bought the car from a guy in Florida are bonding so it turns out I actually owned his old ZO6 what kind of Silent for a week he called me back and said buddy I found the key to the car I was like awesome dude like you're fantastic I'm going to send you an envelope to your address so you could kind of give me the key and he's like yeah yeah great great great how about like six hundred bucks and I was like broheim we just bonded over the fact of your card what you doing to me here that's a lot of money and I was like Hey I was like you didn't the key didn't exist to you as of a week ago but how you can make money from it like now you are charged in a box and uses like you know again how about 400 bucks and I'll just give you the money to take the damn money and I would have rubbed that money on my balls and go bro make sure you snap that time dollar bill does a phone work like your app does it work on the car that's big that I like to get the car to come to you if you can summon income</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I want for the practices to practices outside of hypnosis is there like some things you concentrate on or meditate on yeah so I do my best to just it's kind of like the weird thing about me is fighting is something that is just kind of happened by accident but it's caused me to search for so much peace like inner peace because of everything that I go through emotionally being a fighter so going from this I know Tony about it but going from this kid who just like super overweight my whole life never fit in with anybody I was always just like this introverted Gothic weird kid that nobody you know nobody ever talked to never even wanted to fight over always been non-confrontational but somewhere in the Journey of becoming a fighter I was like this is cool but I need to find more peace because this is like it's bringing up way too much just like just way too much my of my anger kind of like you know from everything that I held onto so practice meditation lot of meditation I read a lot of different I'll study different religions whatever wherever I'm at all just to find peace man being in a cage fighter find around it but I think that internally there's just a lot of there's a lot of expression for me it so it is a big expression it's an expression of just my my danger my ferociousness this the the the the the part of myself that I've always held back you know it's like I have to hold back and I'm a big guy you know that guy if I get angry I'm afraid I can break something lazy self fighting for me like when I train after training super peaceful after I fight I feel like I've grown I feel like this guy is trying to hurt me all these things I can it's it's just a place where we both agree like hey I'll give you my strength verse of your strength or whatever whatever powers that strength is what we meet in the middle and so it helps me balance man it does cuz when I'm not fighting I'm so relaxed it's crazy I think that's something that could ate a lot of men I think just at least training the suspect I think there's something particularly soothing about hitting a heavy bag there's something particular like when you're done man you feel so good when you're done hitting pads when you're done sparring you feel so just peaceful got it all out anything left in year set up in the gym right there super huge it is like I gotta let it out then we can swing those arms like in our nature right like now everybody everybody's guy like curiosity like I wonder what it's like they have to is the wrestling team on the wrestling team and they will teach you a very important part of fighting but other than that Savages I remember being a high school kid in the high school wrestling Ramos awful and other badass the guys training and this dude's got a log on his back and he's walking up stadium stairs and then but I knew when I was in high school everyone worships movie come out it's probably like 85 or so I thought the cover for it is it 85 what about being Native American to get into but my grades were terrible so I never got to play but I was like heavy set I think it was just a joke. I think the coaches were just messing with me and my friends to when did you get involved martial arts when I was 20 so 2010 so really quick right after high school I started I started traveling so I used to play in a band ice play minivans and guitar guitar play drums at play keyboard a little bit everything every Christmas my mom would just know that give me a new instrument and I'd lock myself in my room and teach myself how to play not just always how like music was my first love Ain't So my pot yourself yeah I just put on bike headphones and I would just match the sounds and then keep restarting the songs over and over again and then it got really lucky board song I'd play it like just on the CD player and you know as it evolved and for some reason I can just I can Mash Tunes with whatever in maybe you've always been able to do that since kid so no formal training nothing I've tried to take I've tried to take guitar lessons before but it didn't work for me and my mom was just wasting your money like I was learning but it was kind of like school for me like a teacher he told me okay this cord in this Gordon as I got just let me feel it like that I'm not sure I know there's a lot of people I can just kind of play by ear but so I was like I just loved instruments I'll pick anything up and just start playing it and end up teach myself how to play drums bass guitar keyboard I play the stand up bass and in Middle School I've got like a little home production like Beats Studio at home all that stuff so after high school I start to worry and that's when like I started getting my heaviest we were eating fast food every single day three times a day never drink water soda only smoking like the pack and a half of cigarettes a day and just on the road traveling and then by 19 I got up to 305 lb 19 years old I remember one night laying down to go to bed and I just felt my heart pumping ridiculously and I was just like no way this is like I think I'm going to die and I got woke up in a panic and weird thing is I got up and went outside for me 10 minutes and I smoke another cigarette and I was just like this is the problem like I'm coughing up stuff my hardest going to give out and I'm only 19 years old you know so around that same week is when I discovered him and met with my brother just like watching ultimate fight on TV and so I went on my last tour and I told the guys okay I'm going to go train MMA going to be a fighter like you think you know and I'll just like I don't know what I'm going to be but I'm going to go training okay cool I'll see you in a couple months you know to hit like no one really believed that I was going to go and actually trained at 5 told you I was always been like should be quiet and computational guy so I went and took my first class Muay Thai and March 1st 2010 took my first Muay Thai class and then after like a month doing Muay Thai I started to see progression I started to see like my face slimming down all the stuff so give me motivation to keep going and then I remember going to a MMA event amateur and I saw a really big heavyweight guys going at it sounds like I think I want to do it I want to give it a try and sell my coach was like okay if you lose a hundred pounds all like I'll find you a fight sounds like a hundred pounds find you a fight if you lose a hundred pounds so I just kept within 11 months lost 100 pounds and then took my first fight and then was that Mike every fight has been until now because like I have like more of a drive and a passion for it but all the way up until then everything kind of happened by coincidence or just like I just I didn't really want to fight but I had a lot of people like all you're so good I keep doing it and I was the first time in my life I've ever had people supporting me to like really do something that was big and I was a new guy and I was in shape and now I can you know girls are noticing me now and like all of them my whole life changed within a year of of training MMA like I'm going to this guy to nobody even paid attention to to just like oh hey how's it going or you know like all you're so in shape and I was like oh this is weird it's still weird it's only been nine years eight years you know everything still very new to me I've only my first day stepping on the mat was like you know nine years ago an amazing story that's crazy that's like a legit success story you know is that you what is that so I thought I turned it off what is that it's just like stock iPhone you've entered into the options and went down in there and then I tried so I had like three or four fights in one year being a pro and 353 or four fights and then I tried out for The Ultimate Fighter so I have like three or four fights in one year being a pro and then The Ultimate Fighter tryouts came out and I like tried out for that made it on those I cash it so most of my career has been in the UFC wow</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and a few other things I actually got I got like hypnotized to before yeah dude my friend Dominique he has he has us like I met him through one of the one of the other UFC fighters like Julian Marquez I met him I met him through him and he's like oh yeah I do like hypnotism all the stuff of mine who I've done it before in California and so I think 3 weeks three weeks prior to the fight we had a few sessions a week we're just like help me to really get that visualization clear cuz we have so many thoughts all the time right and everything just like thoughts are constantly coming in and to stay focused and to really like like get the outcome that we you know set Our intention to it's kind of hard with so many distractions so when you go into his office in or wherever you do it and you guys talk about it do you set a goal before you start we do this thing called time line therapy so it's like I'm just going to sit in there with my eyes closed and we kind of just do this will take a subject whether it's like you know pain fear you know nervousness something will just pick us up Jacob feeling whatever is going on and it's kind of just like a visual timeline of like where did this start wouldn't come from what's the event whatever and we kind of talked about that for a while and I just kind of dig to this place of where the nervousness is coming from or where the you know where the fear is coming from or whatever I kind of just I find a place on my timeline and I did from it was in the future or the past whatever and then we get things clear and then and then after that he kind of helps me guide me into this like hypnotism which is really just like a really deep relaxation if I wanted to open my eyes or something I feel like I could but wanted to relax I wanted this to help you know I wanted my vision to be clear so I did my best to just like surrender to the process and I'd say it's not something where I woke up and I was like aw yeah my life is change but I can definitely remember the thoughts that I had so that I can stay more unlike and not in that lane of what I wanted and in my in my hypnotism actually visualized not winning the fight because I didn't want to stay too hard to win like it's just something that I've been kind of studying it's like the outcome is not really like the winning or losing I don't want to base too much on that I just want to put on like a great performance so I visualized after one thing and act like just having my hands in the air seeing my brother smile my coaches smile and then slapping hands with the crowd on the way out and then I was also like and I want to see my win bonus and my show money and these are that I wanted to see these are the outcomes that I wanted not so much just I want to win the fight but the things that I like how I wanted it to happen and having that Vision clear it help me until like everything that I visualized before that it happened I was like cool hand raised slap hands with everybody on the crowd away out sign both my checks and that was like that was the end of it for me until the next session until I want to get clear on something else you know so anything like that before any mental coaching that before they go Kentucky fight I did something very very similar yeah with with another guy who's the first time you've ever done it first time doing hypnotism yeah definitely and yeah my friend Mathias he's here and he's really good too and he just like to take some notes you kind of just have a conversation in the beginning and everything comes from your unconscious mind it's not somebody telling you something I just dumped out whatever my unconscious tell me he was helping me to like relax be at peace and just listen to like my unconscious mind just on unfold all of these kind of like hidden answers that we will have you know that's it when you get hypnotized and you thinking about a specific fight do you think about specific things you're trying to accomplish things that you think you'll do to him that you'll have an advantage at or strategy or like how do you those were thoughts that were half before my hypnotism but then all of those thoughts were coming from the anxiety when coming from the nervousness you get what I'm saying so it's like let's go back on the timeline to why you're feeling nervous like all these things are happening they're going to eat you you're anticipating all these things happening and it's making you feel nervous to let's go back to the nervousness and revisit that why you know like stealing things out and then after the process of that mixed with the hypnotism I'm not even thinking about going to hit this armdrag or whatever I just I'm thinking about having my conscious clear my mind clear and everything so that I can get the expectation that like the visualization that I created so have you tried different versions of that or different styles of gnosis no not that I can I mean I've done a lot of just like closed I like emotional intelligence type of like exercises you know like where I'm just like my eyes are closing I have someone helping me visualized internally you know like just weather extremes or emotional pain or whatever it may be people just like guided meditation almost yeah but actual name like hypnotism I've only had it done by two people as when you watching Fighters if you are I think Fighters are one of the most complex puzzles for psychologists cuz I think it's a super rare State like they're the rare state that someone gets to where they can be completely calm see everything in the heat of a dangerous encounter with another train fighter and when you're watching these things play out on TV and you off in time see how much anxiety plays a factor or doesn't play a factor how much someone having the I don't give a fuk attitude for real that can play it can be a benefit and I can f*** you up sometimes too and to see these complex psychological puzzles will play out and see fight or struggle and then regroup have a bad fight and come back better all that stuff is like it's it's really like a giant microscope on the human character you know and I like a guy like you comes back from the Johnnie Walker fighting looks Sensational against Erik Anders man was like there was one of those things you like I like what I'm seeing this guy he figured some s*** out man show me back on the map so now I'm ready to just go back and you know how many guys use Mental coach is now if you had a gas a good handful good hands a good handful I think I'll finish him he had besides me and he has a lot of fiber it's pretty weird but he's a great mental Coach Sue though he knows like what's creeping around your subconscious and is waiting to pop up and play tricks on you and I know you show me around where does he live one of the least trained aspects of fighting is the mint aspect of it you know what you realize how good guys are just by watching them trained you see them Spar you see them to always think of Danny's got this guy so I can goods guys got great Jiu-Jitsu it's got great kickboxing you ever hear about the people that like they're they're saying right like man that guy's amazing in the gym but when he showed up to fight unless he just doesn't put on like I've been that guy multiple times in like a lot of it has to do with mentally that's almost like an unaddressed giant chunk of the puzzle of the puzzle I grew as a pie 1/3 is keep it together it's ready to go and now it's all happening don't freak out and you never like your kind of something I think about you never know everybody's situation right so the day before the fight we have weigh-ins and then Dana comes back in like he gives us our speech right so everyone there you don't know what life position they're in you know so it's like there's a potential we can get a bonus so all those guys are affected emotionally somehow you don't need some guys maybe they don't care some guys maybe they do but then like we walk out and then there's a crowd 15,000 people sold out look around we got Joe Rogan sitting here we got Mick made us if we got data why we got everybody sitting around and then like we're still human too so we're thinking like this kind of test you know it's like we got all the we got the whole board right here in front of you ready to take my test you know like really depends on there's so much that goes into it like mentally got to be prepared for a lot of things or some guys block it out but it's just like like anything else to know about halfway in the first round some special s*** was happening though on this fight yes after so after the first round I was very happy I sat down my coaches were like okay this is good this is good you doing this I was like listen I don't want to know what's good what should I expect the next round like I was ready to go the straight to Georgia might do I don't care what I need to do next what should I prepare for and he's like prepare for a little bit more pressure he's probably going to try to shoot for the takedown this round goes like Okay cool so that I was just looking for that and using my tools to count in to just prepare for that but definitely Midway through the second round those okay like I know he's still got a lot of power all this stuff but I think that that like I should be able to Piano by sometime and take away a little bit coming at me for what you mean he had to be in agony and you never stopped, but he didn't wins at all like even on the cage when I was just like when he was on the back and I was trying to kick his leg adjust his face his facial expression never changed Savage man that's crazy he's a bad man respect for sure for sure even before and after you know I had to do it the way he did it with 100% of the character intact never shirked never shied away from it kept moving forward that's a dangerous person and he still getting better is just getting better when you were do how much do you think the hypnosis helped you a really good amount man am I different did you feel like you want way I just I felt more clear on I feel like a lot of times I can be just kind of like an anxious guy I just I feel like I feel a lot of Just Energy account like I don't know I go into a room and I'm just like so having having to focus on having my intention set on what I wanted to happen was 70% like I do 70% of like the hypnotism all that stuff to just help me to keep my thoughts on track something to fall back on to every single time if I felt like I was getting distracted or felt like I was getting distracted or getting nervous or whatever I would remember you know the things that we went over in the hypnotism and so every time just kind of like that hit that reset button or just a delete button on on thought that I just didn't want to have our thoughts it would make me feel anything other than happy and ready to go</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you decide to move a you take anybody with you you go solo I'm going to start off going solo I would like to get you know my brother to come visit I'd like to get my mom to come out really as many small out there so I think it'd be really cool for her to go out there but at the moment I'm just really like this place is great for my career right now. I just want to get there ASAP and get back to work sorry how do you account for jet lag like do you do you just like you give yourself enough time to adjust to the time difference you know what the whole time I was there I would my sleep schedule is off I never adjusted so I was going to bed maybe 2:30 a.m. every morning then like get up run at 5 and then you know get tired later later and then when I came back and took me like a week or two to adjust so I was disappointed how stupid my body was going to pay dummy go to bed now so if I'm telling you just go to bed now like might I didn't know my body had such a rigid schedule when you Jack that thing sideways and you're on the other side of the planet that your body just really doesn't know what the f*** is going on seriously I did inform me being stuck in that plane for so long oh yeah I like smino from Thailand Vegas you show up two weeks early yeah well this is my first time flying back to the states after being in Thailand and I flew a week early know I flew two weeks early one week I stayed in Vegas and then fight week stay in Atlanta and no kidding that was perfect timing oh that's good so I can get a little little difference in time between those weather 2 minutes no hot like we train outside and it's humid and hot so between every round it feels like you know like the third round of a fight we're going in the championship rounds I've never been there but I'd imagine that it feels very shity and that's how it feels every round in Thailand just like you're covered in sweat hot thick yeah that was probably like my 5th round or something like that by this point shout out to the editor for making me not look at training strength conditioning coming up against the wall so you getting everything down there Joseph henle right there he was on the on the ultimate fighter I forgot what you said they called them Leonidas is black. Out there and he helped me out a lot man there's you run into so many different people and he's like yeah like black belt any type of grappling you want any positions you want to work like we'll go over it will create a system whatever so he was really big help in this operation for this fight yet bunch of free Spirits live in their right so many how many but everybody's down there with a goal they want to get in shape they want to get healthy or spiritual path whatever maybe there's something romantic about the expat living in Thailand having a good time you know he hadn't romantic about that so it's interesting I don't really cool yeah I mean that whole culture man and the tie and Muay Thai culture what a phenomenal. If you look at Combat Sports and then this one that it's so tied into the stadiums it's so Linda gambling admitting it's something kids get indoctrinated into it at a very young age pre-owned super younger guys at the gym that I was at little kids they can come right after school and then go to Muay Thai training and their training just like the older guys and then they go right back to like homie dinner but that's just their lifestyle so that it starts as a kid it's like go to school more tie go sleep and then as an adult's like moytie feed your family feed your family these guys live at the gym at Jesus they live at the gym and they go home maybe two days after a fight just to take care of their families and then come right back to the gym and get ready for the next fight of course everybody knows various people in different organizations or what-have-you one FC but what about those guys are fighting in those little small Thai gyms in stadiums like how much access do they have the grappling I have a do they ever did they are they satisfied to just do more tires here at all like a movement in Thailand starting o m a tiger a lot of those guys are coming over to the MMA and learning Jiu-Jitsu and wrestling one of the guys I was learning to clench from he was like them he's got probably 300 fights 300 more Thai fights and he started training MMA and taking him in a fight so it's that they're they're definitely open in their mind to it and and and hopping in there and access in Bangkok to a different cuz that's very like Stadium based you don't like high-level moytie and they're not to focus on animator a couple MMA gyms but if you want to do that if you want to get the best of both worlds it's in it's in Phuket a tiger so is there any MMA Bangkok but nothing would like at like Pro Fighters or any high-level Fighters but they do have they do have maybe three or four gyms there was just guys stopping in I got to practice you know a little bit of everything I'm always really interested in countries that figure something out better than everybody else comes to leg kick and nobody figured it out any better that I five rounds and then sleep and maybe the next day go fight like another small event or a smaller reason sometimes even in the same night and it's like man aren't you like your shins to hurt your elbows to hurt nothing in these guys they're just like their bulletproof they're used to this man it's crazy wow and their first time in my life I go into a locker room and the red and blue corner it's both in the same room probably as big as the studio and they're all getting their hands together getting massaged out together everything no weird energy in the room like you know the UFC like they separate us we have to kind of be separate whatever purposes but like in town and they're just like hanging out same room you know talking whatever and then they just go fight right after it's so weird like that the piece it's it's so weird it was the first time I experienced at like maybe I can start lining up a little bit like really fall back dial my training cuz I was really nervous I was nervous to start to try the new stuff that I learned out and never through many like kicks in any of my fights I've never really did that stance everything that I did was pretty much brand new and I was really nervous and what if it doesn't work you know like so many different so many different feelings and for this and I are the only thing I can tell myself as like rely on your training I never really did that stance everything that I did was pretty much brand new and I was really nervous and what if it doesn't work you know like so many different so many different feelings and for this and I are the only thing I can tell myself is like rely on your training</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it's weird how that you feel bad for killing an elephant but other animals is like a rat because I deserve it would totally biased towards certain types of animals right now for sure like it's like why we how they say it probably feed pigeons now they think it was their using it as a bioweapon like they would strap a missile to this thing and then tell the whale to go to boats this way I was trained to go towards boats hole and had this harness on it and they they think that what they did was they train this thing to go on a boat out of that thing well you could use something like that to hold a bomb strain it to go towards the boat and then we would hit the boat it would detonate the bomb explode they must have given this way of some sort of food reward for banging into the boat and slowly do they cut it free of this this harness me this is total speculation they don't know where the Hornets from but I'm hoping someone was trying to ride it and they weren't pretty sure pretty sure it's a bump I'm pretty sure this will found off Norway Coast believed to be spying on me expertly Security Experts have a wheel with a harness right we don't really know how often do whales are hard to show up to the fact that you're next about it I think that the u.s. government red equipment of St Petersburg on the strap ocean exactly that I would write Maiden Rock Sean it is y'all in English to Russian my property of Mother Russia of Russia I think the government did that with dolphins to see if that's true that the government rain Dolphins to four weapon 20 of them something like the US government did that to blow up boats I know they would you at least a jihadist knows right when you tricked him into going to 72 virgins and blowing up you trade them but the dolphin doesn't even know it's going to die play story the concert 2015 it says that the US Navy's combat dolphins are serious military I said so it is started stopped something that's an organic part of the environment to kill every dolphin that comes near the boat and after they see a dolphin they think it's just a dolphin Triton painted like a dolphin smarter than us they keep escaping oldies offense not on the loose. It's very confusing when you look it up so military dolphins not actually on the loose who says that. Gov I have sex for pleasure yeah if you chimps Dolphins people yep and dogs</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> as you go to Utah and you just you just wait well is a lot of hiking you know you go and essentially you go where you know that the elk are going to be in the area and when they're in the Rut which is the one you hunt that one's legal between there their mating and breeding and smashing heads together and let it then you hear them scream at each other when you're ready to kill well they are definitely a little do they know competing with all these other may also she always scream at each other and smashing heads and occasionally phone when it's dead that was killed by another Bowl but you don't eat that no no no no you could I mean you certainly could if it was like a recent kill right if you knew if you got to it like right when it was dying what temperature is still coming out of its body but you will find them they they get stabbed and they they kill each other yeah that mean that's the whole reason why those antlers exist send a Kik the wolf must have time so where do you how do you get that thing back those things don't like yeah you have to you have to do is called quartering it which is you take the legs off and you take the the front legs off and then you take the meat off the carcass and then you take the heart in the liver and the edible organs and you have to pack it out so you haven't yet give a crew that goes with you or is it you with a big-ass knife I'm not very good at hunting I'm like it's if hunt a martial art I be a blue belt okay Bells like your white Bell Blue Bell purple belt brown belt black belts right this year but I go with a guide who's going to take me to the places that I need to go and show me in a guy who's an experience Outdoors when who do basically teaches you a trainer in martial arts exactly is a hardened Outdoorsman hard and they'll go and take you and show you like but then it's it's your job to ask you the shot your job to get close your job is stalking your job to make sure that you don't get with cold winded means the animal smells the winds at your back and the wind character sent towards the animal they have to move around Target is really fun it's very cathartic it says like something that is a release when that Arrow finds Stardust feels really good yeah it's probably some primitive s*** from back we used to rely on killing things with rice and arrows that like accuracy but there's something about hitting something with a like when you shooting something out of Target in hits it it's very very sad I would like a traditional bow or recurve bow you draw it mean you have to pull it back but it's a compound bow it relies on these mechanical these gears that these call Cam on Walking Dead little pencil holder amongst Outdoorsman season and there's a reason why bow season neglected if you looked at like statistics across-the-board if you have it with call the tag look so if you want to go deer hunting you have to get a license and then you get a tag in the tags available today are you wanting to pay a certain amount for that tag now if you get a bow tag they they make the bow season earlier you have a higher much higher likelihood of failure with a bow than you do with a gun so I can stay like 50 people that got a atag it's usually not that hot but 50% of people that got a tag for rifle for successful it might be 10% with a bow out how hard it is to get to where the animals are and you have to be able to shoot far accurately so you you have to be able to shoot far accurately so you do most of the shooting when you go up there do you have but you all to myself</div>

That's that stuff you're a big deal than to lie I got to respect that about you one of the things that we have a problem with people doing what they want to do is cuz we don't get to do what we want to do Friday only see other people though I really like that stuff tell me how to do s*** I hate that she's only men that are b****** a lot of those out there any of that works for me right and I was like Hey listen I got to take a week off to go out to California work on this project and then I was talking to your guy and they're like a list of going to be out here come back the next week as well you know what you can say Hey listen to have two weeks out here until my boss and he's like listen man like 2 weeks is a long time and I have any coverage like you know I know you'll be on Joe Rogan this really cool but much will you do that or not so made decision following in your light I said you know what oh s*** I left my job man damn I need a job Joe and I have a full-time job I can't work on these bills I can't do this and I have no idea I finally left and I was reading your story a while back Boston with LA and it just felt so liberating because literally you know when you're doing something you're not passionate about that's literally 8 to 10 hours of your day doing something that you just you just don't really want to do its most Trace everyone's rushing to get somewhere every turenne you know about Boston lucky rushing to get on the train you're rushing to to get somewhere that you don't really maybe you're right there to work for 8 hours for someone else to do something that you don't want to do and it just gets Taxi man going to do your best with the things you do afterwards if you've been doing this thing for 8 hours right before you really have to go to bed when you get home at night that you had it noon or 10 a.m. or whatever it was when you woke up or when you got to work your what you have what you're dealing with is this past this crossroads right if you hit this past where you can decide to either not take a chance or I can just you just slowly take like little incremental steps towards what you really want to do right or take a risk right and when you take a risk insurance if you continue to just fail and do it again one day you'll figure out why you're failing if you're paying attention if you're doing your work and you'll find something you can do that you're successful at it's only want to hire you if you're good at your job if you go to a place and your valuable to that employer you be valuable yourself he's got to figure out how to do it or what it is that you want to do that you could do without having a boss without something that feels natural so does that you are you gravitate towards morning I'm talking pump I'm going to self yeah and imma do my thing where ever come here to do a podcast where I go fuc to do this good thank you furniture or f****** painting or whatever it is you got to make a living doing that hot damn that's Everything Changes the world world becomes a better place Boston thing was super lucky I was only 25 or less 24 damn 24 and I was doing stand-up no driving limos during the day and doing a bunch of different jobs and s*** and then I got seen by a manager who is coming from New York to Boston to scout for new talent I just got dumb luck wasn't supposed to be on the show and he asked me to go to New York and do some spots in New York there and then next week I was living in New York I signed a contract with them and I just packed up my s*** in my grandparents we're still living in New Jersey they live on North 9th Street which is like when the time and they first moved there was a pretty nice neighborhood Newark is got kind of funky dope Audi parked in his Highway and smashed his door the battering ram and it said it was a legit as an experienced catchy neighborhood but that's why I didn't have any money I didn't I didn't know if it was going to work out at all but I knew this is a chance but I was young when they are you like whatever Insurance whatever I didn't have health insurance for a long time do you have it now yeah</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so impressed with your performance from that pass UFC hate that I had to I had to talk to you I seen guys make like you are always a very dangerous Striker from obviously from the go-karts hockey fight ever got everybody got to see that but to see how fluid you were against a beast like Eric Anderson Eric and has a scary cat he's right you were so fast leap that you've gone up over the last year what do you think it would be compared to like who you were before that not that I believe I mean the high like that performance for me was like I feel good about it but that was only four months so I'm like I know there's so much more for me to gain that's why I'm like yeah I got to go back so the leap not not too much because I know there's still a lot more to go you decided for people don't understand what we talked about you went to Thailand you spent four months down in Thailand and Footwear fight like a tie box it was crazy like Mark dellagrotte a who works in the production truck guy picks out the into replay. Talk back and forth sometimes while the fights going on and mart Market with his heavy Boston acting like dude classic Rochas so fun to watch man so it's just usually wherever I go I've always been good at just like kind of absorbing the culture I'm a guy like I can go into a room full of people and I can just kind of pickup with the energies like and that's another reason why I wanted to go to Thailand so just the way that they trained and the discipline the power but the relaxation like everything I was learning men are so much more than more tired even the days that I didn't try not to sit around and just watch these guys because more ties with more than just punching kicking elbows minutes balance you know what I mean there's there's repetition how many kicks are you throwing you know the guys at the stadium they're like their kick kick kick kick in so I was able to learn a lot man in there still a lot to go it's beautiful to see it someone on that Pursuit and I think it's it's much like Rodger May set about boxing like most people don't know s*** about boxing your way he said that's like if anybody is going to say that he's going to say that because there are levels and layers and there's there's a pass to go down and it's interesting when you see someone like committed with a very like a very specific style like your you like your adoption of that more typed out so if it's so effective as a striking style to really interesting when you think of all the different ways to attack with striking that one play became very particularly successful you-know-what before I even started training MMA as a whole my first Mixed Martial my first martial arts classes in which I class I knew that I wanted to train Muay Thai or learn Muay Thai and so since I've started I always thought I want to go there you know just maybe it's cool but it has always been my thing but I never really learned it like actual way you know like from from the root of where it comes from I was just kind of like passed out or like brazilian-style Muay Thai stadium and most people. so sometimes the Shogun would be light on his front leg a little bit one thing that they were doing a lot that's pretty similar to stick they go at it shoot the box I'll go out if you just go until the other guy stops pretty much but from the shoot the box I was like very combo based like punches and kicks I like one too. You have to memorize these crazy combos Cordero is he lying to eat one of the guys that just like past it down a lot they have the system and it's very like combination based memory slipping Punch Kick all the stuff but the ties are just like it's just straight kick you know like punch you you fall down in that front foot elbow knee it's just it's broken down completely differently if it's a whole different style stuff has his elbows combination same tools that you're going to use it more time play Ty's got a whole different game plan you know clenching like I've never trained as much clenching in America as I haven't Island in just four months and I've been fighting our training now for like 9 years so just in 4 months I've gotten more clinch time in Thailand I have Juno in my whole career because it's a whole different game you got to have to for Effective like real true Muay Thai you getting a lot of wrestling over there yeah that's one thing to I heard I heard shop talking about it Tiger has amazing like it's amazing Jim 4260 guys on the mat from everywhere chechnya while you know and everywhere and everywhere man those guys they come there maybe for a week maybe two weeks maybe for a month but you're getting constant good training grappling everything MMA boxing CrossFit everything you need is in it's a blue my mind being there honestly and your coaches that you were working with before I still working with them and Thailand or you just going to I know you talked about actually moving to Thailand yeah yeah the plan is to move there like as soon as possible so I was like hitting you up like John wanted to talk a little bit but the next couple weeks for at least a year and I want to go there just because I can just train that the lifestyles completely different I can walk to the gym hop on a motorbike it's just it's so simple but that answer the question about my coaches I always have my brother in my corner he's just kind of like moral support we started this together I had a conditioning coach / friend / mental type of like support Lorenzo tabica and then my head coaches have switched probably two or three times in the last cup outside Kenny Johnson from Black House John Wood from Syndicate and now I have your chicken from Tiger Muay Thai and so this change that you decided to make did it come after the Johnnie Walker fight so the Johnnie Walker fight like that camp was tough man like I was doing so much to try to improve in my wrestling and grappling because that was always like a big hole in my game so so much time wrestling over a black house with Kevin Casey and this guy that fought Blake Trooper huge and these guys are great Grappler so cases of Powerhouse okay I'm comfortable on the feet if it goes to the ground and ready and I think I just completely lost sight of like my striking my boy died in a fight his size everything I just kind of froze up man I was just like I didn't know what to do how to get there so what's up part of the education writing mean this is what this this career of fighting that you were you on this path is what it's all about ya and fighting for me is like baked self-awareness do you know I think it's always important though when a guy has set back to see how he responds some people get discouraged some people get in Courage some people just decide like they're going to be much more committed and that's what you did you just I cannot move to do your camp in Thailand and seeing how paid up man Eric Anders is a very tough customer and you simply shot him out yeah and it was very very impressive man that was that was the plan no because I knew he was telling you before I spar with him before that everything in like he's watch all of his fights the guys hard to put away with making a case for the fight being stopped we're making a case me DC was saying like the we can stop this fight I was saying it was like you were f****** his legs I like this about it during the fight I wasn't but that guy so damn tough he kept coming man and heat he never stop trying to win that fight now there's no quit in him remember to do or die he never stopped trying to win that fight now there's no quit in him remember you ever do or die</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> an outfit for someone who was in a used to have to hide it before yeah you know that's the beauty of it now is if you don't have to hide it and people that used to you know you got people now that you never thought were smokers and you know now they're coming out and just being totally free with it and that's great man you know his laptop skin covers it could just be a look alike but it looks like it is what it should make it forever for a long time so it's cool to get in here and went to hot boxes we could have yet we're going to get in that slow Irish it like we just had Mike Tyson in there do you know and how weird is it to smoke weed with Mike before in and I have smoked with him on a couple surf the separate occasions aside from there but one of the places that I smoked with it was at that f****** Lyoto Machida Rashad Evans fight when we all left you know after the fight we were sort of getting to our cars and he ran into me and in my partner Kenji and we're smoking a fat one right there all right you going and we always knew he smoked out what was crazy about this interview real quick that did I say it right cuz you asked me this in this interview like what did you do for the anxieties before like you don't listen we can go on Stager do the s*** right so I asked him that similar question I said you know as Artist as athletes with before we going to go do our thing in front of a mass amount of people you get this nervous energy what did you do to you know deal with that and he said I used to get hypnotized before fights yeah you know and he was saying how he would the guys that work work with him the way to instill these certain words like calmness you know that would be a reoccurring word that they would do in the Hitman you know in hypnotizing them before a fight so that he would always be calm in the fight and never fight desperate and always be do the situation no matter what happened and that's how he would do you know get that nervous energy down in in IND be able to fight with such Focus but the other interesting thing he said was that he never fought I mean he was smoking the whole time you know he's big we'd had since he was like 10 years old apparently but he said that he was smoking you know but not necessarily when he was training they were given Pharmaceuticals when he was training you know s*** that he wouldn't feel numb but he didn't have Focus McKenna Pharmaceuticals he said some of it was fentanyl some Percocet some fencing wasn't even around back while it's a form of it you know like the opiate that was whatever the defense and all of that time whenever I can't remember what he called it but there was two or three prescription drugs that they would give him and he said he he wouldn't feel nothing he felt good like there's no pain no nothing but the focus that he had was was not not there right he said that he smoked weed in one fight like you smoked weed before one particular fight and and he use the Whizzinator to get through the urine test somehow he f****** he says it in the interview and you know he said that the fight that he had where he was smoked out was with Andrew golota and he said he never had so much focus in a fight that it made him realize he should have been smoking weed through every goddamn fight because focused on everything he was supposed to said he broke his cheek he broke his ear he broke a rib and part of his back with a body shots Christ and he said the email that was the fight that was the one and only fight that he's Dino smoked out beforehand and Andrew golota got he got flat Riddick Bowe fights I mean cuz Riddick Bowe was really good you know but you didn't hit like Mike no no no no no no one hit like Mike if you look at like some of his early training or how crazy looking crazy back then if you look at some of my early training in his footwork it's almost like you know almost like a martial arts-based the way that he attacked and then he shifts on his attack and you was a master yeah it wasn't until he eats switched up and got rid of Kevin Rooney and you know where the destruction starts at 2 you know by the time he retired mean it was probably just a whirlwind of chaos and it's crazy cuz he realizes that like looking back at it and he says that he doesn't train anymore because it awakens of beasts and I know you said that maybe nerve it I could have said it's cuz he said that to you too right yeah yeah yeah cuz I cuz I was watching you know your interview with them and one of our guys that was in the back seat after maybe whoever trained you ever he know is that I don't do that no real quick like f*** you walk you around he just got up and left that guy away feeling these brushes do something was wrong I can listen you know if Andrew golota do you know who's been in wars and you know with Riddick Bowe another Fighters like he was no slouch if he's telling you I've had enough of this year which inside of his had you know what I told Mike that he didn't realize it if this is the last thing cuz I know we both got to go but I said do you know that all the dudes you font to get to that title including you know the dudes that the you know that that you took title from they all stopped fighting after you beat him none of them wanted to come back and get nothing in want no part of that heavyweight title after that he retired so many boxers down the line all of them he retired Larry Holmes wait until he went to jail and is like I'ma come back yeah yep yeah that's only got both Crusher Smith yep yeah I'm Thai real big yeah man the white daddy tired a lot of people we all saw it as a force of Nature and I told him the other thing I told him real quick to was you know like that explanation that he had on his documentary where he as he's coming to the ring he knew he had to fight one he could see it in their eyes and then once he steps into the ring he's a God they're done right and I told him you know how that that Bruce Seldon fight and I saw exactly what you explained in Bruce Seldon could Bruce was knocking fools out left and right he was like a really good heavyweight the mini got in there with Mikey Fanboys out tasted that glove didn't want no more yeah it was an experience it wasn't just that you were fighting guy who knew how to fight but you were fighting Mike Tyson there was this your idol who's this thing is cultural phenomenon he was thought to be at that time everybody think he's the greatest heavyweight of all time he was a fat that was an idle and he said he got totally got rocked he was so huge of the time that when Buster Douglas beat him even though I knew he beat him I watch the fight afterwards I couldn't believe it I'm like this is he's going to get up it at bruxelles it Harley Fatboy doubt on Mike man Mike stare down we seem to stare down you look at that too because realistically the guys who trained him they had a certain technique and nobody uses it when was not just died was what Mike talked about in the podcast about being hypnotized I mean he's a little boy and you know the fact that he had nothing before that everything was is life wish it was all pain and suffering and poverty that also and some guy comes along and rescued him and take some teachers matter box and then all sudden he gets recognition and in and positive feedback and he felt like do something special boom if I can hit that canvas hard that you don't want it what it was like watching those fights to go back and watch him now I mean this is amazing Fighters right now like the like Terence Crawford and just one Saturday night amazing amazing boxers but what Mike was was something he was something completely different than it was something that like transcended sports everybody wanted to see him fight you know if you believe in conspiracy right he didn't even hit it right there he just fell on purpose red you believe in conspiracy theories right you think about it like this right Mike was knocking guys out in the first round and people are paying a whole lot of money for the tickets and pay-per-view you know when you look at it it looks like they were trying to slow his roll and put in a guy like Evander Holyfield 2 as a brawler you could box but he could bra and take the fight 11 rounds great pay-per-view were Mike totally ruin the paper you a knock your ass out in a in a minute and when you look at it the way boxing was for such a long time I wouldn't put it past it that you know a lot of s*** that happened to him it was manipulated so that it would slow his roll the people that he had around him and his people that eat rusted away from him put different trainers in his corner different people that were influencing him and did it just took him backwards man and in all the people that actually help. I'm there were f****** gone and those are the guys that was actually giving him guidance as to he know how to conduct yourself via man in and all that stuff and he got around the vultures man and they into me I think Don King being Don King he stood more money eat stood a chance to make more money with someone taking out the fight you know 11 to 12 rounds as a pro he stood more money he stood a chance to make more money with someone taking out the fight you know 11 to 12 rounds as opposed to one while he just he gave Mike the worst deals ever to the whole things terribly stole money from them to this day Mike hates him yeah</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when was your first time ever getting on stage do you member first time that they used to be a club called radiotron here in the 80s right and it was the hip hop club if you are into hip-hop any aspect of it whether it was rapping breakdancing popping who feeding all the people went to that spot and it was hard to get in there and it was hard to get on the mic no less but we had a homie who is like a legendary DJ out here when when the AM stations play hip-hop his name was Tony G and he was the leader of the Mixmaster show that had Mixmaster and he had a residency at the radio Tron so we grew up with one of his when his boys that was his like his Protege so they invite us over and myself insane got on the mic and mellow and I froze the f****** I tell you I froze up I forgot rap I ever wrote or ever memorized I was like it would be one of the two times that I would freeze in my life and it wasn't that was the first time was on stage and in all those people looking at me waiting expecting something I totally blew it and you know and I told myself okay I got to get over the nervousness and then the other thing we were doing it was it was like they wanted rappers to do this PSA for some bulshit right and they wanted us to write this rap and put all this certain information in there and I had it I had it memorized I had it locked in the minute they said go and they were filming it you know this is the film it I can't f****** it up horribly like I didn't even get through it I thought does like I'm sorry I can't do a fuk up you know I'm getting mad at myself to what's wrong with me Mekhi is when s*** like this happens right those are the two times that I totally f***** it up in like from the last time I said I'll never do that again I'm going to be prepared and I'm going to get through this anxiety or whatever it is and so those were the first two times but the first time on stage where I actually pulled it off was probably one of our first showcases it was that a it was at this place off of the 10 and it was in a showcase taxi at a competition yachty's to do competitions at clubs like f****** when they call it a forgot what they used to call and let you know different bands with it was like a battle of the bands right so we went in and I'm coming off of that horrible f****** deal with it just happened you know maybe a month or two before and I totally got over it in and we're performing real estate you know in this showcase and we lost but we made the biggest impression there because the song you know we performed it like you know the way that it's supposed to be and then at the end send dog jumped on the big judges table and you know he grabbed his balls right in front of the f****** female judge and then as he jumps off the table it breaks in half into her lap and no and everybody loved it we lost to these dudes were like new New Edition wannabes we called him Tootsie Rolls but we don't remember when they they won but in reality we won because that's what everybody work was talking about us at the end you know like how we're all that wasn't after that show I realized you know this is this is how I'm supposed to do it and I seen krs-1 do a show one time where the sound went out and you never staged new things on a couple of table that were put together and he just got up in front of the whole club no microphone no music and just started rapping his verses and people were rapping right along with him not giving a f*** the sound turned off but the fact that he just continued to do the show and that right there taught me a lot about how you control s*** on stage sometimes when things go wrong it's a great opportunity let's do a show I could yell so we just did that with everybody just did the show with no microphone but that was us I know the Improv the small rooms 180 people at that place was a small place to but I mean it it goes to show you man like it if you got it you got to do it the other way yeah you know it probably would have been a great show and people would be talking about it but they'll remember the fact that you got over that adversity and were able to still deliver and that's the shitt that krs-1 did for me he showed me through the adversity he kept doing the show and the people were still with him and I thought okay one day that's going to be me and I'm going to do what the teacher does and do you know that that that had been one of the most important things that I learned you know and watching others do shows and stuff like that and what I would do when I got up there you know and do I apply plight all those those you know lessons menu knowing and it's made me who I am as my part of Cypress Hill and when I do my solo stuff and when I'm with prophets of Rage that you know that got me prepped for everything that I do now in terms of music the light you know but that's I think that's important there's nothing wrong with those feelings man it's it's good you got to learn Mandarin did it's it's it's like you liking it to two like college stars that are coming into the professional sports now that basketball players for instance you get this number one draft pick he comes to a team and everybody has these high expectations no one knows at this kid he knows some people on the space like LeBron and Kobe in Garnett came straight from high school and they own the space the minute they got in it I mean Kobe had to work and wasn't the greatest you know when he when he started he had to work to get to where he was at in and allow these guys do some of them you know again they come in and they already got it you know like LeBron he was you know plan and groans met grown man's game right when he got into the league thrown into the fire but he was for that he got better and in learned the role and learned who he was as he's gone but he was one of those rare thing rare people that can just jump into it some people have to get better at it and he know it's the same thing with music like you get thrown on on that big stage for the first time if you're not prepped for you have definitely be nervous now you can either Embrace that and it'll it'll be your first showing you could do a good one or you can do a horrible one but either way he'll learn and if you don't learn from it in the run is short if you learn from it you know you know you learn how to get better and in sustained a longer career how did you learn how to get over the anxiety like your first show having a the first show suck like that what was it what was what did you learn like how did you how did you take classes did you read a book when you know what we did get that helped me was that we were first a lot because for me it was like remembering the songs it wasn't like the nerve to go out in front of people because we came from the break dance and b-boy culture popping and stuff like that so much of that is going against someone battling someone in front of a crowd and if you can be in front of a crowd doing that cuz that's vulnerable I mean you know because in the battle you could either win or you lose and if you lose you know obviously you can lose in an embarrassing way or you lose in the clothes bad either way people are sitting there watching you judging you either cheering you are bullying you wouldn't you know any one of those so that help me be able to get on stage and perform in front of people it will for more from me it was more about knowing the songs making sure that I known through the nervousness you know and it is so for us we did a lot of rehearsals in the early days just so that those first shows that we did that will allow and we made an impression and you know when we did that and we saw the results of how people were reacting to our show they gave me more confidence so you know I'd I'd rehearse the songs in my head you know when I wasn't around the other guys be kicking the songs and not be or be on a treadmill working out saying the songs you know getting them in my head and just gave me the confidence and I know this f****** s*** I go up there I'll rock this f****** thing I'm not going to forget it cuz that's always the problem for me it was never getting in front of people that was do I know my s*** and now I know it in such a way that like you know it's it's second nature do I still get those nervous butterflies yeah for sure some shows depending who's watching who's on the side stage or how big the crowd is in and what not yet I still get some of that but you know I do a quick meditation before I go out there you know just in my head real quick and then our band prayer in the nest that's the switch right there and we go already in it but it took me awhile to get to that you know because it takes work is like anything if your athlete of your boxer you only going to get better by boxing all the time training all the time not overtraining but making sure that you're in there putting into work and it's the same thing when you're rocking stages you know a lot of us sometimes forget to go in time-in you were hearse and you could see that when there's a sloppy show or someone's out of breath or they're not saying the whole line and they said the line wrong or they're changing up fragments of the song to make it easier for their performance and it doesn't necessarily fit that's when you know somebody ain't putting in the work but for us you know we always you know that was a part of the draw for Cypress that's how we want a lot of people over was the energy of Our Lives show so they took that the rehearsals man and I would tell any artist coming up right now man before you start doing your shows you cuz you make it hit like that fast these days and you may be called to go do that show now if you don't do that show right and you suck as good as that song is you're never going to sell tickets when they f****** say hey so-and-so is performing at the you know this place. I got to just listen to the record he sucks life no sew throw her ass man rehearse and then after that hey taking off do what you will but those they f****** help man you know for your confidence on performing the song that's a wise thing to tell people man beat up professional your pro you can be a professional decide your professional give you confidence and it works with fighting it works with, I'm sure it works with everything you got to be proficient an official at the same time what is the meditation that you do just that the self-awareness you know what I mean like the the circular breathing you know and concentrating on that and in the moment and then you know just letting that clear my head you know me and just focus focusing on the breathing I mean that's what they tell you pretty much in any meditation to focus on breathing and all these things I can come through your head but if you keep on Focus on that you know everything sort of goes away when your your reset so you know all I'll do that when when I feel maybe some sort of anxiety before going on if I don't feel that I don't necessarily do the meditation of will just do the prayer and that's sort of like you know sets at all in but yeah like some shows man I'll have to let go in a room and just sit there and you know do the breathing man and it helps yeah like some shows man all I'll have to ride go in a room and just sit there and you know do the breathing man and it helps people might think about the f*** is I can do is going to reset your mind and give you some clarity you know for me at least that's what it did</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the whole rap world is always been fascinating like how someone gets him like how do you get started are there open mics like what the air back in the day man there's someone had to be the guy endorsing you know like I said to you know these guys over here amen listen to this these artists right or this artist right here they're the new shitt they're going to be the one and then you would have to do a couple showcases and stuff like that and you know when some people over I mean definitely did our share of showcases in the beginning but we're getting past on left and right because you know people thought you know what are they talking about with this cannabis s*** and we and we didn't sound like it the West Coast group you know because we're trying to sell our s*** to West Coast labels here and they did not get us it wasn't until you know mugs had you know that he'd previously been in a group called 73 and he had worked with these guys rhyme Syndicate which was Ice T's guy so he kind of you know he was the guy that people knew and then send dogs brother and mellow man Ace eventually would get in the door and so people started hearing about us through you know through more mugs and Melo Melo Melo didn't really do s*** for us you know all of all trooped old but mugs you know they kept hearing about a group that he was forming outside of 73 which came to be Cypress Hill so you know the guys that worked on him work with him on the 73 records which is Joe Nicolo up of ruffhouse Records he know he wanted to sign whatever mugs was doing and you know he eventually ended up signing us and they had a distribution deal with with Sony Music so you know we you know put out our records to rough-house Columbia or roughhouse Tony something like that and that's how we got put on you know and in and it had to be word of mouth because if nobody hurted you heard of you you have to have some really f****** Dope music for them to even like consider you if you didn't have like someone back and you was tough you know you had to have someone come speak on your behalf and say these guys are the new shitt in and fortunately for us once we put out or snippet tape like when Sony put out or snippet tape guys like EPMD right and they were one of our favorite groups in the world man are the top five for Cypress Hill as you know Public Enemy Beastie Boys EPMD and those were the guys that took our snippet tape and they were showing our snippet tape to other rappers like a goddess look at these new f****** guys cuz you know Busta Rhyme told me the story of a ghost on I heard you're going to be PMD way back in the day and it was playing it for Public Enemy and I just happen to be in the Boom and you know Ice Cube when we met him for the first time you know that we had our ups and downs with him but he's one of my homies he told me yeah man the first time I heard of y'all was through epmp that can we was on tour was doing the showing they came in without taping that's how I heard of y'all in and you know that they were like our first street team man f****** DT MDR say my favorite one of our top three favorite groups is out there like with our snippet taped people are these guys with the new shitt and then are they do they do stuff occasionally but that day I think they do more work you know individually now I know Erick Sermon is putting out a record right now he's just promoting it on on some radio show and I mean those guys still active stay active I mean he's a producer so he's always making music but as a rapper they don't put out as much stuff as they used to but yeah they're still active Kool G Rap a lot of guys don't have a style if he doesn't you know if he had never come out and up yet how many people were influenced by him one of those guys like Mad vs Man like his bar work was incredible incredible I still listen to the song cock blocking every now and then I'll try and I got to tell you you know like it if if you hear songs that he does today he's still f****** current like his he's still got that style that did cuts through like you know some of the older artists that they sort of lose the style that did two people love and they don't know how to transition into you know what their Style right now you know like updating whatever that style is you know a lot of a lot of the older artist had trouble doing that you know but my man Kool G Rap not if I do something Blues Billy still ill and if your underground force you know you had to make a conscious decision whether okay I'm going to go main if I go mainstream I'm going to lose these hardcore fans I might gain you know these mainstream fans but how long are they going to stay with me as opposed to these core fans that do you know that there I think it was due to you know the record company not wanting to take the chance because as an artist you want everybody to hear your s*** no for us we didn't play those games we said f*** it you know if if we felt it was the right look for us we were going to take it you know no matter what anybody thought you know and again you face scrutiny for s*** like that but in the end you know if you didn't play yourself people remember that you know and I said f*** it we're going to take our music mainstream even though that was not our intent do you know we always meant ourselves to be a more underground group but insane in the brain didn't allow that propelled us you know that we're like okay well we're going to take our underground asses up into this mainstream and show him how we do it and it it kick the door open for a lot of other underground next to go into the mainstream and we prove that if you do right and if you stay on your game and if you keep working in in and stay present and put out quality music that you can sustain those those mainstream fans that you gain right there and the core like rage that was awesome different take on it but like yeah but it was it was a cover but it was his take it was badass it was in my favorites man you know and it was an honor to me because you know like I was really good friends with them to begin with I saw them come out the gate before they exploded in became Rage Against the Machine and sew for them to cover one of our songs we like man f*** yeah you know because it date they helped us get better and there's a lot of groups that we live four influence even if they were doing different style of music like Public Enemy was an influence to us Rage Against the Machine was an inspiration to us to like push the envelope a little bit more on what we were doing. Nasseri like how they were cuz they had their own sounds just like we had our own sound so they made us push you know in groups like that made us better so when we heard this guy f****** doing or this band doing the cover and then they asked us to come play this song with them would be their last is Rage Against the Machine for a long time this was like their last show right here we got to do that with them that must have been amazing I was wearing a dad hat before Dad hats with cool I will not wear one right now I know what I was thinking. like their last show right here we got to do that with them that must have been amazing elsewhere that dad hat before Dad hats with cool I will not wear one right now know what I was thinking but f*** it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you first start rapping like you rapping with kids in your neighborhood are you like aspiring to be a rapper Brighton shut down and try and things on your friends like how do you get started with the way that I started I was writing you know like poetry first and yeah it was it was almost like writing raps but it just you know without saying it right because you read it and s*** like that whatever but I would just write poetry about you know everyday s*** you know mean nothing you know it wasn't like doing like the I don't know if there's like categories of poetry but it be known it was just stuff that they would happen from day-to-day you know and I had a knack for writing I realize that now is wanted to be a journalist that's you know what the thing that I thought I was going to be right you right now I was for a while but I looked at himself just again everyday stuff or you know I'd like randomly pick something to write about so if it was Ken about the Cannabis industry I'd write something about that if it was about the music industry I'd write something about that like every now and then I would there was a back in the early 2000s was a magazine called industry Insider magazine and occasionally I would write articles that I wasn't really that great because you know I was so spotty in school that you know that my you know it needed work you know by state they left it robbed the way they did that I would put it out there and people got my point now that was cool but I looked at it in the way that the de music that I've done in a lot of the song serves as a certain form of Journal journalism for me you know like you know bringing up certain issues dip don't necessarily here like throw your set in the air has a song on Temple of boom and it's a song about how you would get me know in inducted into a gang how you get put into a gang how you fall into it and some people might think you know by hearing it that it was glorifying and praising it but it wasn't it was basically this is how it is this is so you know the signs to look for if your kids are you know f****** around with the wrong people you know and that's you know I took it like okay you know maybe I'm not a journalist like I intended to be but this is my way of it you know I can Enlighten people with certain things and you know like anything somebody's going to read something or hear something and in may be misinterpreted what you say but you know it's all about who's who's listening and who's reading and who's watching and stuff like that their interpretation of it and some get it some don't and that's just the nature of it but like most people get I've come across people in it if come to me and come and said hey man your your your songs on Temple of Boom man you know that they help to get me through these times or these songs raise me they taught me this this and that that's awesome and to me you know that that's that's the impact right there that's the shitt means more than anything got me through and fired me a you know when expired and stuff like that of what might happen because he could have been one of the biggest stars in in Hip Hop but he chose not he chose to be a voice and sometimes and being that voice you know you get objects put in front of you and not certain opportunities don't you know get put on your table because it's like being mad at the manager at McDonald's yeah you know for the way that corporations being run he is very insightful in in the ship that he says and he is very unafraid stated and stated opinion if you to get like people coming up to you when they first or come up to telling you that your music got them through things that mean so much to them when I first started happening I must have been so real you know what yeah because as an artist as especially as a young artist that's not something you think about all these songs are going to load depends on on the artist you are right in 91 and it really started going for us in 92 South 22 TV with built when MTV was still allowed over there format kid ever envisioned happening you know I didn't think that you know the music would blow up like that you know we're doing it to obviously try and in and make a name for ourselves in and make music to people like the f*** we didn't see that coming at all especially with insane in the brain when they told me when like when killing man started going it was like surreal because you know we didn't think that song would take just because it if you know of the chorus itself anal f*** with the song is about to do you know we knew that the chorus was you know what they were going to hear more than anything that's all right you know we we thought that we going to have a good underground album who didn't realize it was lower intake they're going to put kill a man in the juice movie and that would blow that song up even more so than it was it was getting because we had released phuncky feel one's first and it was a double a-side single funky fluid and killing them on the other a side which means at that time the DJs had the option of which song they wanted to go where is most of time yet a side B-side in the a site is most definitely the one that the record company wants you to push we gave it a double a-side because we thought maybe the DJ's would like kill a man more they went with phuncky feel when the record company because they figured it would be easier to market right and then the DJ started flipping the record attraction behind that record was out like 6 months had dropped off the chart and they flip the record our s*** slowly starts to go back up to chart we got back on the chart and started climbing and we're getting a whole lot of mixture play and then we start doing a lot of promotional shows that being one of them and it started going and killing man started getting us going and I mean we toured for probably a year-and-a-half like a lot of juice body promotional shows are leaving not getting paid you know just you know Sony having us out there promoting the record and by the time you know our record got back back up into the middle of the charts I mean it was still Rising but then they saw that they're like we got to get them off the road and making a new record so that's when we got out there with black Sunday and do with black Sunday and insane coming out again that's not a song I thought would blow up when they chose that for the sink all right there's better songs but f*** it that's the one okay so it comes out boom it explodes and now we have a black Sunday charting it number one coming in and our our first album have come all the way from the bottom to hit number five so we had to two albums in the top 10 200 top 10 of the 200 songs you know on the chart which no one had ever done in hip-hop before we had one 5 slot and you know f*** we definitely didn't think that was going to happen to me and you know it was always surprising it went from one minute you could go to a mall and beat you know unassuming and nobody even knows where the f*** you are and you know you getting about your day to now you go to the mall and whole f****** mall is swarming on you like f****** you're like you know Paul McCartney or something it was too crazy s*** they asked us to leave the malls yeah like I used to go to this one called the Montebello Montebello I can't remember what the name of the mall was but it was in Montebello the only one down there at the time and we knew everybody there when you know as we're coming up because that's where we go shop so you know you make friends and people in the shop and stuff like that and when we come back off at or this time and go try to go to that mall and you know one of our friends f***** up and were Cypress Hill nothing a f****** billboard when you're standing next to one of us right so before you know it boom we get swooped in and he doesn't free cell phone to yeah in the mall security cuz I hate man you know I know it's f***** up but you got got to go because you know what I don't want to cause them problems to it was now it was tough to go somewhere at that time and not get you know swarmed when I get swarmed yeah it was it was it was quite quite an experience man like you know cuz you only ever hear about it till it happens and you might know if you have friends in the in the industry and it's happening for them you might see it indirectly he no like to do that through their s*** and do you know we had friends in the business you know free Kid Frost was one of my friends before we got out there and stuff you know I don't know if he's putting out so much new music these days but he's still here in there he's doing some of the Cannabis industry stuff too because he's a big connoisseur I got tell you my man smokes used to smoke like a trained man like him and I would trade Joints off left and right but you do for a Time I would go hang with him and his gigs I'd be his bodyguard cuz I was the one that was not afraid to carry the hammer meaning the Magnum in my waistline you know I was we were Cowboys man we were always armed at that time from 89 to probably 97 or 98 holding pistols on our head black cowboys and you know he knew that so he asked me you would ask me to go to the gigs you know till you know double as his bodyguard I wasn't his bodyguard but I was as bodyguard you know Amy and dumb I see the way he handled it and let's see the way you know people crowded around him and then and you know I saw I learned how to deal with it watching you know how he would do it in a negative way or a positive way cuz he know he was sometimes embrace the crowd sometimes as I f*** off me like a lot of lot of artists are you know and that's sort of prepared me so it wouldn't you know we got enough Lane you know I knew how to sort a deal with it and Idina was always courteous and in cool and respectful whenever the guy that is like not man f*** that get out of here cuz I sit in some of my homies were like that you know and I didn't I hated the feeling that when the fans would walk away just totally f****** wind out of their sails and s*** like that now they don't like this artist ever again you know and I saw that and I just walk away just totally f****** wind out of their sails and s*** like that now they don't like this artist ever again you know and I saw that and I never wanted to have anyone walk away with that experience always embraced it even when it was a pain in the ass even so</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> occasionally I'll have my lungs checked in they tell me they're great it's crazy because I think if you keep active know like you train and and and a lot of restraint do I go this generation they're not like lazy Stoners and I'll just sit back and do nothing but you know I don't think it has the same carcinogens is you know people expected you don't like cigarette and so you know you my look at someone's lungs who who smoke cigarettes and and you might see something there in like hey you need to you know slow the fuk down over here but in every time that I've had my lungs checked or whatever for whatever it would arrive you know gotten sick or whatever that they're all telling me loves her in good shape and it's a funny thing because you know in they can 1987 you know I was 17 and our g*********** I got shot you know that I got hit by 22 and it's Atlas hollow points do it it broke into three three pieces the hollow-point in one of them punctured my lung on my left side and you know they were telling me about well you know if you smoke now I don't really smoke because I didn't smoke cigarettes I smoked weed but I wasn't going to divulge that at the time I was 17 and Vino and they said well you know well that's good cuz you'll never smoke again is if they punctured your lung and blah blah blah. They thought I was going to have to work off one lung but in the three days you know they were able to get the blood out of the lung and I was able to get it back you know through the exercise they told me you know to get it back to its regular size and I've never had a problem since then knock on her way to piece of metal out know I still got the three-piece that's like when I go do my golden they do that you know that the MRIs in the x-rays and all that the doctor is Kino sometimes they forget cuz they see so many patients this mr. freeze these appeared to be bullet fragments with what is that you just said it. fine but I was at Martin Luther King Hospital in Lynwood and we call that place killer king cuz you go in there for something small and end up dying to come out you know give doubt or something so you know I wasn't going to allow them to try and get to those bullets over those fragments breathing apparatus that has like a ball in it right and it has two lines and you know that the first line you're trying to there telling you everyday for 5 minutes 10 minutes to blow that he knows not all in one shot but like to keep practicing getting the ball up there and not willing to help inflate the lungs and get it back so I had to do that for probably like 3 weeks and you know in the puncture wound healed itself pretty much ended the pieces are still in your long. In the rough don't let sit did went passed along a big-shot passed along so he know it's got a piece up here and went off to ride in the back well when it's really cold due to the the nerve damage I'll get like stinging like you don't like when you get when your hand falls asleep the little needles then I'll get that here and then then back here then turn right in between a rib here to stick to you been to put the the hose into the lung to get the blood out of the Lund yeah you know I was looking crazy before I got into the music the music saved my life pretty much really yeah I started I started young I was probably changed up what I was doing cuz you don't never really get out for say unless they jump you out and you know that I was too into it to to be jumped out like that and you know I mean that wasn't something I was going to do because of you know for his negative is it was it taught me a lot so my my boys did I do know ran with a understood I was trying to do something different you know that I made a choice to try the music and and leave that s*** alone because they're there was no way that you do both if you do both you see the results of that was happening today with a lot of cats Hinata mean that they try to ride the line be professional and be in the music but they're still kind of in this world over here and when it bleeds in one bleeds into the other if you know it sucks everything up you know and so I chose you know I was going to do music and just talk about those life experiences and whatnot and Elsa 18 that I started taking on the music and that's that's where it went even said you learned a lot from a well you know your street you know that there's there's common sense and then there's Common Sense on the streets and then there's being aware and looking out and you know not being a doormat and just it's it's a whole different type of schooling when your g*********** do you know that's the way you are carry yourself the way you communicate with someone and know whether they're disrespecting you or not and how you deal with that disrespect witches Hino whole different world in the g******* s*** but it's it's a different kind of education you know I wouldn't I wouldn't take it back some of the things I would do you know I definitely regret it while I was doing it for sure but it made me see things from from a different perspective you know and and why you know things are the way they are in gangs and stuff like that from lack lack of opportunities you know. For these kids to be doing something you know cuz not everybody's good at sports you know but there has to be other opportunities other than other than that to get kids interested in doing something else because falling into the gangs it's it's easy if if you don't have a good home life at home the guys on the street or your second family in the eventually become your first family you know what I mean and if you don't have a father figure at home one of the guys in the gang you know becomes your Mentor he could become like the guy you look up to as like your father figure you know there's that and then you know again there's not enough programs out there to keep people into doing something different than falling into that and then sometimes you know it just it's a matter of you know you growing up in this neighborhood have to walk down the street and they approach you and say you live in this could you got to be with us if you don't really make it hard for you so there's that pure pressure and then there's the Legacy s*** like so if my father was a gangster in this gang and he still lives in this neighborhood pressures on for me eventually to take up with Father left off you know and it's it's all those things and then some people just start the real secrets and they choose it and I'm you know in common with none of that they just choose it for some people to so appealing to have somewhere that you belong right it in that the thing because if you don't feel like you belong in your school or you don't belong with your in your family and in that that she can totally take hold and then you end up there you know fortunately I had good friends that work game things you know that they had talent for music which is mugs and send and sends brother mellow you know they were it sends brother mellow you know they were you know I did music as a hobby you know before I got in the gangs and and they got me back into the music they cuz they recognize something in me and said hey we want you to come back where we got these opportunities over here come join us</div>

and I got to where I was things go in the Mission District right so I'm going to the gym in the morning and I think it's 7 a.m. and I saw probably just as many homeless people living in tents next to buildings as there were people commuting to work Game of Thrones know who the better okay here's a better now than she did you ever see I Am Legend yeah okay on all the f****** crazy zombie before running it once yeah that's what it's like you serious I'm telling you you can't believe the volume the most popular Downtown Crossing Area Parks you whenever they junkies that like have that through the whole gangster lean they just leaned close their eyes and stuff replacement batteries 2000 square feet pretty nice he goes yeah you know you know things a little tough can I get OK borrow some money from paycheck to paycheck I was like what we talked about was a 1.6 million dollar house and it was this big to the house it's a warehouse I do live in a warehouse that's actually cool you can live like blade its member warehouses and cars smashed windows that I've seen here it's I couldn't believe it well most of those people living in cars are actually stand-up comedians that's an issue we're having around here we're having around here with these people that live in Caravans they live in these mobile home place I've seen the mess there's like if you drive around this community go down certain streets and you just CDs mobile home because busy complaining because we was one business with this guy I had parked his Caravan right in front of its where a buddy of mine works and this dude had laid out his like a blanket on their front lawn and was sunning himself in front of the camera so the front of his building became this guy's lawn so this guy in this Caravan was literally using that they were sharing grass right so he's got this multimillion-dollar building and he's sharing it with a homeless guy who's cooking meth or out of its math but yeah white noxious smoke the crap out walking around more if I see a large standing body of water does a homeless guy living there too if you'll just everywhere everywhere I'm telling you what you saw is nothing when you got to go to Skid Row it's it what is this the Skid Row let me tell you something that it's look at that look at all that to the right to the left it's f****** grown people have businesses there or they just deal with it they just deal with it most of them most people they just put out the like Gates and locks and s*** and so what what's on Skid Row placemats why can you or you just wear jammie we just work well it's a lot of warehouses and s*** and but the interesting thing is this area is getting air quotes gentrified so there's a lot of is are going now they're opening up apartment buildings right and a buddy of mine has lived there my friend Magnus Magnus Walker he's a famous car guy to I don't know if you know who he is he's got all his videos of Porsches old he rebuilt old Porsches he's got this crazy dreadlocks and beard crazy Englishman that he's been living down there forever he and he has this Warehouse where he has it set up where you know but his living spaces one one part of the warehouse been down below yahtzees car set-up but if you drive down some of these roads you'll see like the super expensive apartment buildings that are going up now and then a block over you see these homeless encampment and people think it's like cute to be around like all this dirt what is it that we go and you just you just have to deal with it so if you live in that area you know you just have to jump over needles and try to figure your way through it I feel terrible because the drug addiction or mental illness does the real real problem you guys have no drug addiction a mental illness like places that you can go to for help here I don't know what it is but I don't know enough about it entirely ignorant about the what's going on if you talk to people that work in the field that work with these folks run over my light on my gosh I need disability oh my goodness man that's crazy crazy of homeless people in that whole Skid Row area that's one of them is one of the things that keeps AmeriGas in the whole thing in the break it up and make people move but this did not the numbers are so high yeah not much they can do man that's Chris $100 and Chloe ray had people ride I'll name him they experiencing and then he'd come back and do like an interview like what you just went through and it's it came out 10 years ago so it's it's different I don't know if I'm assuming it's worse now but it's definitely not good at this fit in this is so crazy so I will just D1 also don't need broken elbows like like Odyssey it is good for Core workout all the way up YouTube bass and a lady sticks her hand out and she offers me a a chocolate chocolate ladybug ladybug rapping like that I'll give it to her how nice gesture a write-up you know I give her you know him to the V bucks as I start slowing down the one-wheel other people started popping their heads out of the tents and actually saw me give her the money and immediately a guy runs out and like snatches it directly out of her hand snatched it right again someone else coming around the corner takes it from him and they start getting into the and I'm just like I've never seen anything like that before I normally passion about that but I just it's just it since I just can't stop thinking about it's crazy it's really crazy out here man and everyone comes everyone comes to to to LA California to get their big break and it's the struggle is real out here it's real it's real I everywhere but when whenever you get giant groups of people you're going to get do you know a higher percentage of people

I can't say I can't do it what is he trying to do is trying to be like Middle America like there's a market for that right is that what it is he just wants everyone to love everyone to not a bad trait to have a late night host probably the best trait to have heard that he quit drinking but I don't know that's true but he would like he like to get drunk in like 10 like shity bars and like hang out and like with the with the staff in the crew like he was he's like a man of the people and he didn't just want to go home and drink he wanted to go out and go to some weird bar it was like going to Subway that no one knew about and have beers like he was using a fun drunk you know what he did a lot yeah there was always those rumors problem to Hueytown can a problem yeah yeah that's like the pressure of just being this like super friendly sweet guy on TV want everybody to love you they like oh my god get me a f****** drink so I can cut loose I think I could be part of it you know that's why I was I was with my Persona when you can so it allows you to be nice off stage so you get a Cuke and it allows you to be nice off date you know you got to keep kind of a little bit of distance with the guys who come off as like your best friend on Sage tend to be monsters off days</div>

But they take themselves out in America it's like let me know who can I take with me and I don't know what that what that is well Japan emphasizes humility and they were awarded like if the emphasize being polite and orderly it's really interesting there was a piece I was watching on YouTube of these people that live cyber cafes that they have cyber cafes that are open 24 hours a day in Japan and they have like this little cubicle so you take in there and they're just online on their computer and they have all their things there and that's where they live a shower and they go back to the little cubicle but this woman was saying that it made her feel like she wasn't alone but you wasn't with people either or she likes that the like she wants to know the people around her but she doesn't want anybody in our life yeah that's super sad just the loneliness like that that's a giant issue apparently in Japan is how lonely people are wasting credibly ironic when you consider that's probably one of the most population dense places on Earth and Tokyo at least oh yeah working their asses off I mean they f****** love to jump in front of Trance they live for it like it really is a good countries it's it's the least happy country in the world but the happiest is like someone's Scandinavian Yeah Yeah Yeahs together as like a neighborhood, and they just like everyone contributes and they're just happy and content that makes sense the numbers are small or two and think that helps us up there that helps to are factors that write like what's a big city in Finland Helsinki how many people that 50 people live in Helsinki has 1.2 million people how many people Helsinki have to get on The Price is Right well you can't doesn't if you Google population of Helsinki people socialist side but I get it little too many Birkenstocks and tables and girls can use a little bit more makeup full makeup on gas smell it up a little man if you live around nature to get bunch of fit people that like hiking in Shallotte North Face jackets you know North Face jackets you know whether yeah yeah they really do they have blizzards and snowstorms and s*** but they also have like you it'll be 30 degrees in Denver or Boulder and then the next day it'll be $0.60</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> speaking of which I was watching a video today you know how YouTube for whatever reason to start recommending things and you click on it watching a video today on this is what it was I was looking at bulletproof clothing for whatever reason cuz it was like why I saw an ad on Instagram with this guy had a bulletproof hoodie on and it looks like a regular hoodie and shot himself is it like a John Wick situation where it's like yes got with a 9 mm justbang while why was playing this video would like a regular hoodie I'll leave this is crazy and this hoodie it look like a regular hoodie was but it's some sort of Kevlar something so then it recommends this next thing and his next video that I watch is on whether or not you should carry with a bullet in the chamber so is this guy who's just speculating like today new kinds of people is kind of people that thinks they're going to have enough time to wrap a bullet and there's a bunch of people that realized that when something happens it's like being in a car accident happens quickly and you got to be prepared to not going to have enough time to wrap a bullet until there's just the long discussion as to whether or not you should have a bullet in the chamber or not when you conceal carry and he was talking about his guy was open carrying but he could see that the guys the hammer was shut down turn on the pistol which means you don't have to Cock it cuz it was not a revolver but you know whatever an automatic semi what is it when you call what do you call one of those when you have to load it like that like a 9ml Glock what is the difference revolver revolver revolver revolver shoot the pistol anyway he was saying because the way the hammer was could tell that this guy you know he was going to have to pull that hammer back I was like this is this is like next level thinking like these people are everywhere you go someone's wearing about shooting you and then I go on to Twitter almost like this is synchronicity and Eric Weinstein is a friend of mine says is this the year where the debate is some something to terms of is it appropriate to bring a loaded gun into a place where you worship now to protect cuz you've been so many attacks on people and synagogues and churches and mosques and black man that happened today there was two smaller ones church that was insane this weekend the synagogue in San Diego this weekend but there was another one like this morning when I was reading the news Los Angeles yes juices that walk to the synagogue police officers a military facility in crowds at the Santa Monica Pier I think there's another one to there's another one somewhere else might might have been outside the country today so I can f*** like this s*** is ramping up yeah it's getting worse and worse than guy I have guns Owen same a gun guy but I have them hunting or like to know I have safety guns likes private in-home personal protection guns is that I hunt with a bow and arrow mostly but of course I'm not opposed to myself course he was in another country that's alright that's enough there's so many right now I know you just numb to it also chart targeting places of worship now at what f*** man do you have guns now whichever one they make me uncomfortable like I'm not like the hell I'm going to die on but I think what's happening with the with schools and churches is reprehensible and its we are the only country where this is really happens he knows not anymore it's happening around the world but it's it's much more off in here yeah yeah real problem is that the guns already there so how do you what do you do when you live in a country of 300-plus million people with 300-plus million guns and how do you ever eradicate that how do you ever how do you shift half that we seem to be on what do you do I mean everything is like people talk about this and then like you know but how how do we do with what is it the culture is it is it and turn on the TV and it's a video game commercial or comercial from movie and it's just a supermodel spinning around in circles shooting everything she sees you like you don't think this is having an effect has make it looks so cool that if you want to be the hero you got to have a gun you know about John Wick John Wick 3 I do not like this is the most dumbest glorifying gun shitt ever but I love it like I love it I mean I wouldn't say that like video games Amino make this video games are making people more violent I don't I don't believe that I know if there is evidence to back that but I mean I've always loved you know James Bond movies you know things that way with guns are a big part of it and it's never maybe want to pick one up well there's a real argument that that alleviate some of the need for violence that people like seeing it and in seeing it and something like John Wick it actually relaxes people is real argument for that and is real argument that you can make with that with video games too but that is not with everybody the problem is certain people are very susceptible to influence their susceptible they're vulnerable to being influenced or excited in one particular direction whether it's so excited to become radicalized and become a white nationalist want to shoot you know what ever figure out the whatever the group is or whether it's under certain people that you know they'll see something in a movie or video game it'll make them want to act that out but they usually mentally ill mean that's that's a real problem the real problem is mental illness that the type of person that could go into a synagogue and just start shooting people that's a mentally ill person that's regardless of whether or not they have a gun or not that's a sick person so we have to figure out like what's causing this massive amount of mental illness in this country cuz that's a big guy in Aurora's a perfect example I got was they knew he was sick then they knew there's something really yummy PC photos of that f****** sit with the quote no man chooses evil because it's evil the only mistake it for happiness I got believe that I took a quote Yeah they mistaken for happiness or they want other people to feel what they feel they want other people to suffer the way they're suffering with people you're going to have a broad spectrum of people's experiences and so you're going to going to have a broad spectrum of people's experiences and so you're going to have a certain number of people that are in the low end of experiences the worst experiences all the time sexual abuse physical abuse violence mental illness pills drugs this that boom</div>

Of time where it seemed like he just missed it like it was like it was missing weather is his personal life is off or whatever it was they had this whole rant that was like f*** this and it was like and f*** Israel and f*** comedy clubs like you saying f*** comedy clubs like this is like this whole bit news reading enough of a yellow legal pad and the horns like standing like not understanding like where this is going like we're waiting for the jokes where's the hilarity where is it and it wasn't just didn't exist and my friends were mad at me I taken them from where we live we lived in Revere we all drove all the way up to New Hampshire Liquor can't really go see George Carlin's going to be awesome it was terrible it's funny that Louis CK and like an interview years ago was talking about how he took the pressure came off of him to have a good show audience members love saying I saw George Carlin once and he was awesome but they really love saying you know I saw calling once and he was horrible they still get the experience and the story of it and they said that that's if there's forever to worry about doing the bad but Sebastian well if you are Carlin fan you got to see those if you want to seem like a bunch of times that he had those rough spots man you know what some of those things if you're going to do an hour of stand-up every year you going to have some rough ones there's no way around that sell hundred percent it seems like that's just it can be done I think you can be done mean I think you can put together like I'm 6 months in from my last special I think I could do another special in 6 months but it wouldn't be as good as my last one I don't think yeah I just don't think it would I just think you need time yeah want to hear is crazy Jimmy Carr touring the writing jokes and just putting them away so at the end of the tour when it take the special they have all these jokes they can go through and look at and then start the new tour from that that seems like I like to sit in my side and I just wanted to be focused on that always be writing the next thing but some people who are just like I'm going to go up and talk a lot now I think would like the prevalence of Netflix specials people just want the money and they're famous enough they can just go up and just get this is your legacy why would you want to put on a bad special ever I don't care what they're paying you and make sure it's great I feel the same way and I feel like those people that watch that when you do do that and if you don't acknowledge that you f*** them over there never going to trust you again if you don't say hey that one wasn't a good special I gave it a shot just wasn't right it didn't come out right I thought it was pretty good and then the taping didn't go well and if you don't listen to your man this is my best work this is my best work but busy all this your best work well the f*** you can look for them once again I'm in right now and just did the same material from the special like people would be like okay but they're not coming back the next time you know yeah</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> help me actually develop this one piece that I was doing and that the like sort of a rounded rounded out this one piece I was doing because I was trying to figure out a way that I could speak splain it to someone who might have a preconceived notion about who I am like the tutu say it in a way that makes people that were hesitant laugh and I mean versus Savages at 11:30 on a Saturday night that are hammertoes yeah so when you coming crowd wasn't into you're anti-feminist the punchline was good and I had a place to go with it and the place to go was ultimately mocking men's rights activist that was the the real thing was that the this the setup for that joke is I don't like anybody's in the one thing and I go put the witch rides me the most f****** crazy is men's rights activists like every men's rights activist I ever met I just want to Grab &amp; Go dude we got them all I only believe that the real thing has rights activist divorce in you have child it's for child custody those things are those things are real like guys really I know men who have gotten really f***** over in divorce where their wipe hard f****** killer lawyer and they drag them through to think about and I learned this from Phil Hartman unfortunately but before he died was trying to tell him to get divorced and I said just give her half I'll make more money he'll stick not have it was his two thirds it was a f****** lawyers take a 32 goddamn scam you know he like he was Furious about it cuz apparently he'd been trying to figure it out like how to do it but I had a friend whose wife ex-wife dragged it out on purpose cuz she want him to pay the legal bills so he had to pay for her lawyer he had to pay for his lawyer and then he had to pay for all of the times that decided to change the goalposts and and renegotiate I just know no one can say that you can't renegotiate so she would just renegotiate and just drag things out and hurt her goal was to try to drain him financially so she was doing this on purpose like Target so he was essentially paying for the general of the army that was plotting to murder him and he was slowly going crazy and I was watching my friend go crazy and it took several years for completely resolved and he still paying her he still he's been divorced for I think 12 years now and he still pays her she didn't have a child and he has a family now he's married with Children now he and he still Pays His person still pay like he f***** her so hard she can't work 12 years later yeah it's so that's where men's rights activists have a point because if you are in a state that's particularly Progressive liberal in regards to alimony and child-support I love Roseanne more than I love Tom Arnold but I do you know so like it bothered me that Roseanne had to pay him like broke it the person has to pay the person they're getting rid of what he's used to her lifestyle that's that that I'm used to it is is the crazy thing yeah that makes sense of the children they're your children you guys had these children together you have to contribute to the the the the money that it cost to raise a child hundred percent I get it what what I don't get is alimony we're not together anymore know how we were before we were together you didn't have any money and then you met me and now I have money and then you you got used to having money what you have to get used to not having money because now you have any money cuz that we're not together anymore or take some time to get back on her feet but 80% of them if they've kids the wife accuses the husband of molesting the kids just for visitation you know just just like my friend was warned of when his wife were splitting up like is your wife malicious will she you know make some sort of a baseless accusation and he's like how so and then they went into that yeah man is evil people out there that thing that happens when people break up with someone that someone doesn't want to be with you anymore someone that you deeply loved and cared about you you want them to suffer that's weird weird it's normal so I guess it's not that weird but that did Evil vicious jealousy what happens when people break up with someone that someone doesn't want to be with you anymore someone that you deeply loved and cared about you if you want them to suffer weird weird it's normal so I guess it's not that weird but that did Evil vicious jealousy</div>

As he got older yet so he wasn't always remembered Apollo is on my favorites you know when I would see him on TV as a kid and I know I'm a little bit now but the right things seem to come up more and more in the past 10 years he was always an angry guy but he became like an old angry guy that's really into Politics as he got older yeah I mean I guess part of it is like it works warm like it people love to hear it like there's not a lot of those guys like who Nazarite have to bank on in terms of like Comics that they could go see Tim Allen barely does he do stand up anymore I think it does like I think those of the Laugh Factory does he thinks yeah okay so maybe he's one of those guys like got to be more there must be I mean Norton kind of leans right a little bit more libertarian but he doesn't do a lot of politics jokes he'll talk about it is like no one but if you want to do like left-wing comedian so you can start with Michelle wolf and work your way up that's because her show Netflix was called The Brick like it was called the break-in was everything a break from all of this and just talked about like other things going on in the world we don't need to be so focused on politics and after that after The Correspondents dinner it was like the opening show was like her going after Sarah Huckabee Sanders near like oh you got forced into this you know Mitch and just talked about like other things going on in the world we don't need to be so focused on politics and after that after The Correspondents dinner it was like the opening show was like her going after Sarah Huckabee Sanders near like ouu that forced into this you know Mitch</div>

They do that though they don't tell you to do s*** then I'll tell me to do s*** I don't think going to tell him to do but maybe hadn't been doing a lot of stand-up you know like I don't know how much that guy works out I don't see him anywhere no I was wondering about those guys like the guys who you don't see in the clubs you know like Bill Bill Byrd saw a special one day and we were doing a set together the ice house and he came into the Green Room like frothing-at-the-mouth and it is like the f****** guy I forgot I know who's talking about tell you later buddy into the Green Room like frothing-at-the-mouth and it is like the f****** guy I forgot I know who's talking about tell you later but he was like the f****** out into the club anymore because it is watching this cringey b******* like angry and clubs</div>

I know I'm trying to develop material but also like when I'm high I'm stay just like a cow Cactus going to but then I also really worried that I'm going to be boring but I want to be I know these people paid to see.

		<div class="paragraph"> video seeds good for everybody is great Fighters everywhere but right now I still think the number one and all that is in the UFC in terms of prestige there's no contact with you get the UFC title you're the best there's no question about the Billet or dismiss because the Bellator chant at the top of the Heap is that is that motivating to you to just ramped up and even order because you realize that the guy who's a champion your division is not just the best light heavyweight of all time maybe the best martial artists of all time that rents have so much like riding a bike in my basement and I got the air down bike and stationary bike I don't realize until I can go to break it down and iHeartRadio do you want to call it up his past you know I'm done with that have my words their the fact he kept using God and Jesus mrs. Miss, God-fearing got read my Bible every morning I don't like the fact that you can that he would do that another time my words was the fact that he did that and then I want to thank God that kind of wrong and then we flew the plane together and he was acting when he came on a plane going into a fight that was something on my shoulders by posted something because of UFC called me right before I got in a fight if they don't come on way to Vegas now she's 8-months pregnant 30 weeks where she can't travel that that's what got me mad trying to save money for my flying people because we thought we was literally walking down the runway to the plane when they called me Jesus Christ turn around then will you come here but we can get you to get your wife to be like week of the fight to think of the things that you have to think about do you know I can with that and then I get there and they said when you get make sure you got your workout don't have your workout schedule to pee I already get there go do it I did mine like a month and a half ahead of time y'all call me two months ago told me to set my schedule to come ahead of time I'm really giving walks my Uber is outside you said I can't come now like I'm sorry I know we can do is John why can't you work out the same place with jobs working out exactly that you want roast in like you heard somebody say but you can go to the cargo room in the voice but you can't use upstairs with a cage in the bag of stuff is you can't use them I want people to see when I'm doing a basement security I don't know you got to think about how much death threats that guy must get how much s*** he must take you know I like he's as popular as he is as famous as he is it maybe just has overzealous security maybe they just want to tighten it down so don't want nobody up there what are you doing I need to work out my coaches meet me there from the airport but we can't do any by Cory is the guy kept hanging up calls going on call me back I was like so distresses I'm sure it's like all that my baby Hello Nurse really you would see her and she acts just like rose before when she was Invictus haven't changed I don't want special treatment from anybody about the champ directly behind Jon Jones Nazi hair barber shops looking at my wife and she's like string like falling asleep but shutting faustina look at the top of the head the back of head just like it's time for a change of torch and my brother always said good and you know you can be there if you doubt yourself just a little bit you ain't sure that you can get them you know you good but you feel like this is before you get there and you you feel like you don't think you ready for that if you can do it, Bob and all the frustration was on my sister in the morning had to get up and catch a plane cuz this guy is missing his show up on time he still was late to that I know just like I don't want this special treatment if you tell me what sign up ahead of time and keep your schedule I expect that a first-come-first-serve first come first serve second person on my way to scale and John was walking down the stairs fully dressed we're going back to the commission room people in blue shirt cancel hold up hold up and I'll send John come in if you want to steal he was out first to be Koreans like what do you think you need to do and if anything different in your life or in your training or where do you need to get to where you think you could beat him just keep getting better by fight must have been a big boost login boost been getting beat up Joe I've never been a fight where some buy milk or juice morning I get this never been one side of my free with somebody straight man hand on me and push me around and I mean I talked about this but at the same time I was thinking of you said but what about crying I think I finally found two years of my career and I mean I would say the guy beat me but in my head from his highlights on Instagram Thomas and I'll let what people are saying in reading and seeing you don't have to think it just got touch with me he's going to put me out and when you going to fight thinking that I literally got touched in my mind was already set like if I get hit I'm going out I think so consciously like walkaway number when I can see clearly and I thought to myself like they happened is that grew up in my mind if I got hit it happened that's what that was it was like I can take anybody and I think OSP was more dangerous than Jimmy cuz he can kick his explosiveness is named punched. Did everything right and just took them to the punch the wrong way but I was mad because I didn't have the discipline yet in three years I can win 12 minutes of it all but one mistake and it's all gone with these experience of making those mistakes and realizing what they are and then when those moments come up again and you deviate from the game plan and you do go to your right and you do move the wrong direction you know you'll you'll catch yourself you realize it's the experience of competition for fighter is there's nothing that substituted he can have great talent you can have a great minds have bad experience of competition can you do move the wrong direction you know you'll you'll catch yourself you realize it's the experience of competition for a fighter is there's nothing that substitute it you can have great talent you can have a great mindset but the experience of competition is like nothing else</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I think it's a weapon now you know where you at right now in terms of like what when does the UFC usually come to you with an idea of what we going to fight next Memphis Lee you beat Latifah he was top five yasso your and if I mean 3-day put me at 6 I don't know if they put me at 6 like I'll be going over and went to 6 by time I fought I was ten Philly top 10 you know whatever number that is I mean it's a you going to murder is real people in that division in Elso date when when do you think they'll come to you with an offer for us my babies doing that was March 15th to do day of my baby was March 12th but it's too close not risking it you know about June 1st more or take it literally my baby came out everything you still want to go June 1st you want to do it I'm your huckle let's go London I'll come yes, you know I want the fight let's do it Ali call me it's on his managers call me we want to fight let's do it June 1st same training pay no raids are nothing whatever I was getting let's go text Dana they call me today before on my way to hospital get a call from I want to fight I call you after we figured out what the f*** what's going on and that that made me mad then they called me for Luke rockhold like I'm back like I want to hear what they're going to say cuz I guess if they told her they gave me a new contract going to Publix I don't know anybody who would help you in Rancho quick Ascension from devastating Knockouts and fighting like awhile Maniac like he does he's at Wildfire to watch very very entertaining guy that's all it took. But who was in that he didn't have to be a big name guy I think he be on Jimmy I'll be going to start extend appointment stop by I'll Be lyrics Stevie Ray says next to Beat the Champ whatever might be him they still don't give me credibility because once you lose me it's not like you're nobody I'm sorry for that other day habitat a****** coach when you're in college is it is in the same way back to tweeze and s*** cuz in my head things like that that I've been through used to call him back when I was in college trying to discipline me if I like to piss them off here have Kelly come in and try to beat me up never happened like he couldn't beat me up like that and he's to get pissed at that so the fact that he thought he had like a hold on me with this transcript and I got out and then I end up fighting Kelly on the show he said that you and I want to hit children anime he would kill you in anime where the opportunity came and I'll beat him in that somebody told me like that he wasn't happy about that I'm sorry the extra juice in the gym I mean I'm as motivated guy anyway highly motivated when I wake up it's time to get to work so you Sons born the Anthony Smith coming ahead of you know and he's been survive against Jon Jones and especially early on you look good you no-showed good technique show that he's at he's really a world-class fighter and I think that they just think that that would be probably said yes when you said no and they gave it to him you know why you were waiting and you so much being born so now you just waiting for another call like I said no interview with Ariel helwani and they said the day after he fought Jon Jones they called him about they were just throwing it out there and at least I guess they offered to Johnnie Walker Johnnie Walker manager made a post I seen that but I'll offer this cuz I can just throwing it out there for whoever has to be the first person to say yes it will probably have a bunch of people say yes and then they sit down and then go over it like what looks best for us like what do we have</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's why I made it tweet somebody Falls before I got to see how Corey is steady dropping down the rankings when you got guys like down here if he beat Volcom who is for everybody said he lost a fight but he's actually sound like that before I was worried about that point I'm going to keep Bean hoodie put in front of me and eventually and if you try to put these guys at the fight John like off knockout things to Andy Smith he knocked out Rashad Shogun and then choked out Vulcan he went up to see UFC giant underground all the extra stuff imma take you down and you ain't have no answer me if you don't have everything tested by the time when I go to championship fight and you can't do that to me seems like I mean he's a very dangerous guy but almost like so aggressive that is almost like a Kamikaze guy like he's do or die like killer be killed he comes in just swinging throwing Hammers and if he connects it dangerous if you can act as bad for everybody but it might not connect and I don't mean to stats kind of how he is he's he's he's a wild-card that's the best way to put a cocoon connect on John if John Fox around and I don't think he will I think he has never before except for the gossip since I don't think he was prepared as much as he should have and we saw that in the second fight we just dominated him but I think that if he makes a mistake to the lights out on anybody swings Payson himself is none of that dude he comes out hard but it's like I think about him as my fight where they latifi going into that fight we do a hundred percent everything is going to be if I make him Miss talking robots I think they got their hands up and they blocking just like always not hit me before gloves for Ryan Bader &amp; Johnson &amp; Johnson move movies when he so long he can put his hands out and keep your distance and hit you with those quick fast loan kicks and stuff and I just like you said I don't see John messing around he knows it's dangerous he's smart as he sees what's going on really well yeah he knows how that that he can go out there and try to trick stuff at times we know I can try this stuff right here and get away with it he knew he said I'm a different breed on longer on Fast and Tricky by think we're coming guy like Gus you didn't do all that stuff they knew we had to stay long and if a punches and get to take down and hit them where you can buy T-shirts metal right surely can take it and then winning the championship rounds even if I wasn't really properly prepare for he showed that in the Vitor Belfort fight you can be on the cusp ID showed his mettle right she'll need to take it and then win the championship rounds even if I did wasn't really properly prepare for he showed that in the Vitor Belfort fight to win the armbar he overcomes adversity is not just a hammer he knows now he knows how to do it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is it going to snow in the blood he knows lot of people I know that's one thing I'm not good at I don't like you could take a shot like you just don't see it I don't have to but I will you need to worry though when you're trying to finish fights versus just trying to fight your best I think I should just fight their best and if the Finish comes it comes I'm of the opinion that I'm of the opinion that when people make big mistakes and I wouldn't discourage anybody from going crazy if someone likes to go crazy like the fight wild name and that's you that's your style is how you express yourself nothing wrong with it but if I was going to give some advice they said what should I do long career as a professional it take fight your best don't worry about the outcome to spite your best and if you fight your best and if you connected someone gets hurt and you put them away that's great but if you just win that's great to just fight your past the more the more you can do what you can technically and take as little damage as possible that's a good fight and fight and Mark said it OSP fight and Gian villante the two-faced Mark called only thing I can get knocked out with he said was Yvonne to the only thing that can knock you out with his overhand right he said you got to bring that job right back after you got a good job of bringing your hands back to these times at overhand right so smooth and even in between rounds is a heck that left kick if you stay close to keep your pressure keep more cage when he's down he's end up bringing back down don't listen to the famous people going to go ahead and make you want to strike trying to get in that fight that's they want to see we just trying to get the win don't go right and keep pressure not go right and keep pressure if you watch that fight the whole two rounds pressure not going right go on that put into the case taking about keeping down there around I took him down is there any fights damn fine I backed away for a second so I can move my God I misplaced my house a little bit and I went right right into the head kick and I was like in the back like you look great you just went right everything was beautiful a fight that was your breakthrough fight and you just went right for going to go back and do better I know you will and I was just like after that but like you said when you wish I was going to listen before you say IV Liberty shall be there but you don't hear my name is because I'm not trying to do stuff that exciting anymore I'm just went in my but that's cuz you not a mixed martial arts and your friend ever knock out some fancy stuff one punch what are you going to do I mean so nothing I say right now I'm not finding it and we going to fight I don't know but I'll be ready so I can do everything we were just talking about Johnny Walker he's in surgery now he had to go through surgery for perfect flying knee looks fantastic and then drops to the ground just playing around and blows his f****** shoulder crazy that's the game everything happens like that damn man you're so promising he's a he's a mean what would get people excited when people finish fights right when people KO people and so a lot of times people try to lean towards that but if that's not your style you know you should you should fight the way you're if I was in your corner first mate listen to Mark Henry everything and then sucking allowed say don't change man what you doing is perfect just just fight the way you're fighting the way you're fighting is just your winning you know what you went and I just think that it should be what it should be emphasized always to fight the best you can fight intelligently and you got to decide and everybody has to decide when is it time to take a risk when is it time to close a distance when is it time to put pressure on someone in and throw yourself into the fire to try to get it finished and if you just think you should just fight Tech black man f****** Floyd Mayweather's done that most of his career especially like later on when he was Pretty Boy Floyd earlier on his crew is trying to knock a lot of guys out but it later on in his career in most of his big fight with Pacquiao and a lot of the guys he does win Twins and you make more money than just wins we're going to try to work on putting little more answers on the punches and not shoot right away blah blah blah underground more ground-and-pound don't worry about Jiu-Jitsu submission just hit this is when it come time to fight when the lights come on Saturday night and Joe or Bruce Buffer and then you still decide it's a whole different game thing I know what I can do I know what's right and that's why I get into a spot street fights I feel like going back and watch them those you can't say I'm one-sided because at Lear Lear more powerful in a better rest are you working for whatever race from Albanian world team he couldn't take me down and I'll show you know you want to go back I'll go over the finish and you just forgot it's over and you cannot carry out and got them out and had his back had every position on him so you can't I don't have so I can come there and impact comes over the hills to NCAA D1 All American Assassin SE DC at OTC he'll be going to kill Corey wrestling. Just take down and set the record with 13 takedowns on him who had the record at 11 it's like I don't understand the fans everybody got something to say</div>

funky been in play my leg bro I tore my shoulder I got some issues I wouldn't be good I'll be laid up too much and I didn't like what you think this is Miss deny deny deny that my senior fifth-year senior been comes up you start work with me and bills are my man wrestling parties and shake or like you got something by you go to punch she's not there in wrestling and I used to try to pick his brain how do you do this Spotify, new frontman the king of the f*** I am here coming Craigslist and stick it off put his shoes on and you just look like a sloppy guy like how he died in or anything about him he doesn't look physically imposing. whenever Hannah Marcos Bowl frostbite olympic-level working together and when they see me as I go about making his label meet me here at this address and we'll work power blah bring your gear I get up there but outside of the bank and still downstairs football kick making some photo for the magazine or whatever and you got like Pascal crew ass and Sergio plays you got been answering it was a few of the error code other UFC guys don't practice brought that you can be good at the try if you don't if you don't like it after that we'll go back to wrestling blah blah blah decent in some way with my wife now hour-and-a-half dry hold your memory so that you could pitch talking with are you a b**** cuz you didn't do that yet and you're taking you a b**** I didn't do that so I get home until been like I'm sorry I didn't try but like do it again amateur boxing fights Xbox One codes my knee and one curly half machine I can already hate you they got a mouthpiece of yet so we going to spar with being something you're not taking it easy on me on me I defended in Ms different I can spoil a hard I will that's a big Ramy the movie the heavyweights and I was just like everything you did was punching Ben and you took him down and took my ass to do everything just got your size and I just hit him with a bunch of crosses on the punches like a lot of guys you can be in UFC and three fights I like that I like the training I kept coming back I never was against this was 2012 and you only been doing it for seven years I was in the UFC with 7 months fight after my first fight seven months and I was in top 10 within a year so I'm learning I have three fights Ultimate Fighter one in that top 10 of all MMA training that's it throwback picture be me and collagen 2007 it'll be there in like 30 for them and they fight it's like and he's got to still amateurs I'm 29 did you still not even really in your Prime 132 like but he's what you did is as impressive the fact you hit top 10 with a year of MMA training that's bananas my even in the tub house I'm going to be like here in the kitchen with all talk about stuff with four or five months experience have my three fights back like a back and I'm pushing it that third 535i you pushing so hard I ain't going nowhere they call me Monday night like you always at work I work night shift after 1 and we get off meet me at my house like what like I'm not that was a fantastic opportunity sounds man you taking everybody not your doing good use that and I left when I went there whatever my clothes like just go do what you do I have no doubt they're going to take you but the reason they pick me one the same day pick me thinking it was going to be easy fight for whoever but it's backfired them cuz my work ethic they didn't know me you got musically in this and give him an easy fight in and I'll look it kind of backfired like cuz I didn't know who I was didn't know that person and I name-dropped Matthews nothing that was the only reason why I got there he was here and Maddie dictate where the fight takes place the superior wrestler gets a diss everybody start standing up and you have to know how to strike but a superior wrestler guess it dictate where the fights take place and you see that with guys like khabib you see that with so many Superior Grapplers when they get ahold of a guy it's their dominance is one of the most important aspects of fighting so you did have all that I have to strike the basics strike and like I said when I came to meet Mark Henry that's what took me into a martial arts 2 years even two years in like 3 months and I guess that's why I didn't have it in March so people sound like when you hear him say it because he came here with nothing I need a hat nothing the gym I was at we literally I got that roufusport for a little bit but I got to college coaching job and had to leave so I met a group of guys to Mark Fiore at time but end up leaving to go to overseas and it was probably six of us and we had a fight a guy who owned the warehouse you can put Madison here in just the train we didn't have you just to practice practice note I practice ground-and-pound I mean Andrew's going here just be the shovel until it's over there was horrible no heat in about this big on the quarterback and we've Illinois at least amount of fights that you're the only one I can ask you work and make us look good on their unique Mark Henry you want to win and then you go from there you go and move to New Jersey's every channel we're home Aliana

notice hecs it's especially with birds birds in a bird can navigate using a magnetic that they use like the magnetic pole in electromagnetic fields has been proven the birds can register and they see electric sense electromagnetic field and they dead birds in particular and then sea creatures to like if they use it with scuba divers and and spear fisherman and people like that is a suit that blocks the electromagnetic signal that your body gives off and put the supposedly particularly affected with turkeys who you know are very they see very well and they see things movement and they're very very skittish to see any weird s*** they just get the f*** out of their butt Mike slinkard who's one of the guys who created the heck suit he hunts turkeys with no blind he just sits out in the field with his HEC suit on that blocks the electromagnet magnetic signal many puts camel on over the HEC suit his videos of him doing this man's got crazy and this is sitting there on time if you were right in front of a turkey like that f*** out of Dodge Dakota fit over but he's not he doesn't have that they don't got decoy in his hand but I think animals can sense something is not everything right and you still can't be downwind or upwind you know if you if your wind comes and Kelly's down there going to smell you and I going to get the f*** out of there but it's enough see if I mean it's the perfect type of leaves the perfect angle the perfect lighting with a little very controversial thing but people smarter than me say it works it really works as sea creatures for some reason with things in the water because you know animals they have that lateral line or fish rather have that lateral line and they they sent elect call signals that are coming off of creatures that are in the water and so the scuba diver swear by this f****** this suit it's interesting stop I don't work for me tonight maybe she's I'm doing something wrong and they come and show me and it still don't work until I got I don't believe before work do you have a particular camo company cold water immersion test they've done with their shed and he's got a rewarming drill they put online explain to people what you do if you're in cold conditions and you fall into the water like how to rewarm yourself get a whole video where he did it they jumped into this icy River and then yeah and then climbed out and you know that the suits are designed and the lot of clothing is designed to allow you to survive in that sort of a situation but you know you have to know how to do it how to go about it so here's is John in the sky that he's with and they just dumped it is John the right and they don't themselves in this freezing f****** water and then get out and then they put on sleeping bags and got in at Anton right now that's in wpsu well he's educating people that was actually what he's in the military that's what he did he taught cold weather survival he's he's so thorough to and you know and he's one of the reasons why Sitka gear so well and should be redesigned because they got a guy like him that's telling them how to design thinking he's a hunter to Huey hunted with me last year I Y A Hundred elk with him in in Utah how cold you're not going to get cold like about yourself so I'm going to Saskatchewan Canada for Whitetail in November told me as he said Anna Nicole the different cold you know those people are Hardy folks out there in June for the bear hunt asking me my day in the mornings it was cold then come out he had to go up to the top of the viewing point and we look me how my day had this pain stuff we both binoculars I just look for a black guy you see some you tell me and I put a scope on it and see if it's real or a beer we can get I hope you still in that are grind and I mean like that we came across we came across all kind of stuff but you get done up there was gone all day till I get home cuz it was so far into the mountains and it was great a lot of walking I get pissed you I never had a guy athletic as you walk most overweight or not you want to go a little bit it's time to go to trip I can you I can test you out but you said you did a black bear hunt for a few and then or rifle bow in north of Alberta with some of my friends are John and Jen the rivets up there they got a great Camp up there I just don't have the time to get away for that many camps you know what I prefer elk hunting in a year for this year for this year to Elk one axis deer and one mule deer don't worry about Saskatchewan Whitetail you seen those what would you what you do it yeah we do it scheduled in November already more than one month I'll get divorced my kids will beat me up I'm on taverns it already but I get it I bet it's one of those things that just takes a lot of time items you going to go on a hunting trip at 7 days away you know you have 7 days and you're a going to be probably somewhere where there's no cell phone signal but for me man it's very valuable for my head I resent her out there I get it man there's a f****** animals chasing deer and do things are trying to survive and it just puts everything in perspective for me but I'm sneaking up on an elk and I'm going I'm just trying to get inside like 67 yards to get a good shot off and I'm trying to make sure the wind is ride and I'm not thinking about anything else man nothing why draw back and I sent him my pin and you know and I put I'm looking through the peep sight and everything's right and the housings level I've got my Anchor Point and I'm pulling with my back muscles and I'm just concentrating on that spot aim small Miss small it all at the world goes away the world goes away finds that Kris and sinks right through then you see those fletchings disappear and why would you be happy you killed an animal cuz it's so hard to do and not that you're happy the animals die you happy you did it it's a relief it's so hard to do it's like people don't understand like to maintain calmness and Stillness when you're drawing on an Amazon like a rifle that shot things the rifle and it's not easy it's more hard but think it is but it's way easier than using a bow not even close wobbly people wonder why I'm so proud of my kids not being spotted holding Bowl that's hard to and get up to just sit still the wind blowing up and you can't sway you said everything has to be right beside art to it people never know but they will never know unless they do it it's one of those things and many people that get mad at people to do it are meat eaters which is in two drives me crazy they think there's something wrong with killing wild animals like that that's the best way to do it because these animals first of all they're going to be going to get organic real wild meat it's better for you these animals live the real life they're not like Katie end up in a butcher shop, I can't believe you no longer how could you dare go in and kill a bear to eat it we going out and getting the most natural way ever if you love animals you got to kill beerus cuz they eat everything 50% of all the deer fawns and they get killed by bears 50% of them I saved the picture where you can't eat them yet but I saved the other while they have this perception of it from movies and from those rednecks stupid TV shows where you know they don't portray hunting in a positive way and so people get this negative impression about it but I think more people IQ Elite athletes that are getting into a boat Jackson is a big bow hunter you know there's a lot of boners now that are you know that's just athletes and they realize like wow this is thrilling and exciting and then it's the best meat in the world so you have so many pros and it's the most. I think it's the most ethical way to eat meat cuz you're going out and getting it yourself Supermarket Hitman you're doing it yourself one a black guy Community to jump it was more than just killing I got so far the 118 oz of turkey hunt this whole week I'm out there I didn't kill anything Place more show me ice more and you see the deer walk up to the sun coming up sun going down I put your little Link at the beginning tactacam people are you now but you share you help advertisers I'm just want to get as well as other people cuz I see all the time I love when you see me like I told my wife I'm the first person on Joe Rogan shoe to take nothing with Jordans or do re I would have bought it don't work that way jewelry stores that do rats true I got them both you got the combo you don't have to be the typical for people see you soon country got cowboy hats cowboy boots kick shitkickers in the truck bed and that's the guy you expect to be a hundred and got to walk around a camel that one somebody see that's I love that you love it man it's it's it means a lot to me man I think the positive role models like you or what the sport needs to change people's butt went to say sports don't think punting a sport that's called it this whole letter a culture to change people's perceptions of it the positive people like you that are Elite athletes and just for people to get a chance to see like hey this is I mean I'm not encouraging everyone to do it but I think there's a lot of people that would love it and never tried it cuz they maybe don't have an understanding of what it actually is you will see the videos are you doing like Chad Mendes with deep he's deep are but that's all I want to do I mean he be he basically is fighting to pay for his hunting career you know. I'll have Maven hook you up Brandon Weaver way yet I actually met him I'm a great like Jersey Shore Guido type guy but I got both 15 weeks ago couldn't he kept messing up the difference between a shop in the basement and everything you level your third access that's great man I love it guys at A&amp;W Labs right now for like attracting we're not giving both cricketer to I use agave in wi Ave NW and I'll pump sister know cuz I got more followers than you so maybe somebody else click the link for sure where they give it a try yeah for sure that's awesome and there's a lot of careers right now in the hunting world like a lot of guys make videos I post videos and they basically make a great living just making hunting videos yeah for sure that's awesome man you have a perfect attitude and I would think you know there's a lot of careers right now in the hunting world like a lot of guys make videos they post videos and they basically make a great living just making hunting videos</div>

Going your opponent start to slow down a little bit and then you wrap it Like A Little Too Faced perfect example that was a great fight for you because that guy's a tank to tank very scary dude hits really f****** hard strong as s*** but he's a he's a guy that relies on that explosive power is like a sprinter in a lot of ways and you can only do that for so long and you can see like somewhere around the second round it was real obvious that you weren't slowing down at all and he was taking a big deep breath this is hard for him if you always have that kind of cardio I mean I got it in the wrestling I guess I was beat you know and I was especially when I got to 300 lb and I'll still working car you trying to get down as a heavyweight to wrestle and be always study little guys films you know like they film the s*** like that when I was in college I see what I watched the guy was beating me what 15131 Morton take me one of your third point in throwing around he gas and I was still going I came back and beat him in overtime because I can just keep going I was the mindset guys are going to break about the seven eight minutes like 15 crime as you go 30 minutes while I was doing I'm able to walk shake your hand and go grab another partner or get on the treadmill because we always push as a big guy so we got imagine when I came down at 2:05 it was like it was crazy today that's fine gave me three new partners went and it was tired I'll still good luck to your car has a crazy just a mystery when I'm tired I never show it so I got to act first and get through it, last so long my father told me if I ever leave you some weird thing isn't that your your mind can give you more energy like you know that feeling sometimes you're on a treadmill or something like that and you're running and great song comes on and I'll sign you like what that one beat that are you going to start dancing in like 3 to 5 Minutes Alone that song as you like it then you really feel you know you wondering how he's doing and how is he okay is he tired and my own who tireder me or him and there's that switch in your mind that if you could just access that all the time and keep it on or nothing about think when I got I looked up to now then cuz you know he was past Steve Prefontaine that's why I just do our time has quotes to do anyting anything less than your best is a waste of a gif you know my Garrett here and he didn't is cross-country guys tried a patient and everything he said I'm sprinting and I got washed all his movies the movies on him has mindset even that one reason he was floss spring they said he was going to give he gave a ride for the Finish Line like I rather go out that way then Payson my whole the whole time then tries to friend in and fell because I wasn't ready so I can start off so fast I'm going all out. I'm getting tired I'm going all-out you not there's no fill out. We're going to take lunch I'm ready to move and I already know like if I'm getting tired I know this guy's entire he might not be so I'm thinking he's getting tired just keep pushing cuz eventually he's going to break you going to break before me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I feel like that's a part of your motivation yes it's always been that way but you're also your motivations obviously excellent there's no way it could just be a prove someone wrong as hard as you were no but that's what that's how I got to the mentally and a work ethic I guess cuz it in high school I wasn't like this they load the bus and left me sitting it because you got beat the way I be messy didn't want to bring you home or what I got beat to I got to also girl Joe I was fat I was lazy at time growing up I love the outdoors I love video games I love eating junk you know I didn't always has my appointment I wanted to do good and I was trying to take my first injury a very first energy sophomore in high school before Congress I snap my ankles cleanser and I remember everybody I was going to hurt first find me to take me to the train or in the Train by Springhill be fine once the dock my dad came and got him when do his X-ray and do it like this mole hole in my foot too far for that after injury and you know my mommy I can't run and I did and I was scared I was going to break again but I made it to where I was going so I can do this it's all here now that's my everything because I realize if I put my mind to his work at my dad said it to that's think my dad pushed on so you're at such a young age my brother got it he was a star athlete but he didn't get the job openings in the opportunities I had you know because he's always working for my father and working here working at 8 to have the time to do Canton All That me being the youngest is a little easier for me I seen what he did what he told me or my brothers and my sisters and teammates not giving people around me had done to get somewhere but being it will never go to my I want to be engineer I love building club houses and s*** like that house where I wanted to do it all that open doors I wanted to go to school to University Wisconsin Platteville for Engineer program but just like sports my grazers ass I didn't say I didn't try once I went there to hang out my friends and be cool when I applied a dressing got to go get a win their third whatever but they said you can't get here before I go to Junior College you get your GPA at we can get you in again I went there I didn't plan on Russell anymore I love wrestling I cry when it was over but then I got Dave Matthews is Old Coach that's how I met Matthews do Lincoln College he reached out to me money and I went to excite it determined getting everybody State you're not going to do good this is me again I was motivation from right there going to school I don't think I can do this statement my grades aren't good enough education I'm not good enough for sports don't think I'm All American I cut up but it's not my leg in three thought it was over again go back to the first one. Injuries with change to where I got tired of people singing I was faking so because you were injured for real in people thought you were Faking It you realize something was wrong but I feel that I realize I have been lazy and my father my whole life you go to my old house right now in the garage is still carved in there I never get there by like 9 school night my dad woke me and my brother to help him do some stuff on the boat and we tired you know a person that don't have an education of he he start his own business from the ground up he's living the dream hunting property for everyone he can do it and that's where I got it from but it took me forever to realize this and I'll never forget the day to that comes and don't think about he stood up on the garage door not standing if you know him the way he works he's just turned 59 Tuesday and I could end his voicemail said you had a job there working got a bunch of twenty-year-olds 30 ought Works everybody 59 years old I think like like 45 minutes and you realize you've been lazy so what what's shifted in your mind what how did you change your just stop worrying about excuses to get out of practice in French as I was healing you know I was on bed rest for a while and so bad and people come in and out my brother's to come over at time he's playing football and whatever and watching his games just like sitting there for so long away from all the sports in all your friends just didn't it just yourself and I just realized I've been doing it since I've seen the stuff I know the moves I just don't reply when I get back I could cut up enough that's what happened so what was the first step when I came back you was with that first run I was really my dad's shop is probably $200 for my house and it was raining that's all it wasn't like I had to cast off like five six months so now it's a terrible it was like it was because I was like trying to move in a wrestling stance in my boot and I slipped my dad had to tile a little gloss over and I was washing the cars one day and I was like it was a whole process I was laid up now why the two I still got the two long screws they take out the leave the 7 to go up to see nor the tibia for the two long was it supposed to pull out but the middle when I split they broke in half so that made the bone heal slower cuz now is just a little spot that drill through it opened up like that much that much more they had to wait for all that the hill before I could actually walk to take the screws out and put new ones in there so you're broken screw Bank won't the swelling where there is a triangle cold out everything everything everything when does Umbro didn't get hurt but not enough to stop stop last alarm 15 minutes that's nothing it only lasts so long I last so long for my boss that sound keep going yeah so you get out of the injury you have the cast on you for 5 or 6 months you realize how blessed you were to be able to move around and that feeling once you get your your leg back Hyundai and start moving again what what is the changes you make how to how do you start to move your life in this positive way I made it because I told myself I can do it I made it here is no injuries I'm fine. I was just slow and steady just start hearing fighting like a good little here to take down dummies and hang on the wall is go there and move and I'm not nothing fastest working and fighting kind of gradual egg working my shots in and out in and out in the morning before practice knives to go watch the guys for offseason practice study and then I came back it was just directions to work with me then the other coach to come work with me and got to a point where was like in the morning I was never for school and I was there after school for practice and I'll stay after a coaching drill different stuff no black on black family there so we have racism whole life and I mean dealing with that so that's another man that was the mental dimensions of mental f**** of it all like no matter what I did you going to be wrong like I wasn't even worse and he was actually Troublemaker so when he will get in trouble they would always come get me out of the classroom Corey Stevenson I'm Corey cease Corey Richard but they always pull me in there cuz I was high school in the fact that I never did drugs cuz I can assure you I don't want smoke a good kid but to deal with that stuff to get pulled over for no reason I had a nice truck S10 drop their Grandma rims and speakers to get pulled over by search the car looking for something all the time every time you leave class if they got pulled over on the way here I'm seeing her classmates the song like no he's telling truth me StarStruck song on side of road like he always gets pulled over cuz nice vehicle black think it's something dealing with that in the mentality I finally figured out that's why I think I proved wrong because I had coaches in high school when I was doing good I knew I was doing good headblade team is sex I didn't start and I mean a laser the starting lineman out or beat this guy in this net in this neck and I never got the position or something was around it and then I came back after I make sure you say that that believed it was a wrestling coach Marty made everything possible to make let me meet Dave Clem with my junior college coach who let me to trust David let me the Ben askren turn everything I've been blessed with the people my life to bring me to Frankie and Mark and Ricardo and I got like two awesome people around me like my mom says you've always been blessed to have a good circle of people in the one year I had a bad coach in college I think my mom said we can have so much good don't let this one close to Fiji Jason Valley I'll put his name on there that guy he's the toughest man I could because no matter what I did he want to make sure you could break him he had control over me I was 16 hours away from home in South Carolina no family no money behaving on the fluoride he was just use that I got you here you here cuz of me you do this but I'm going to cut you you can't do that because I beat the starter I'll beat him bad 13112 but you still the first week of school not be them every time but you got to let me start know cuz he pins people and you only get points I don't like fighting with you knock you out and you only win by decision so I went to Whitewater where I'm at being everything else again went there was nobody before I was a benchwarmer turn here but you not wrestling today my prayers will be like you're not arresting it like what's mine is yours. Wrestling like you got me a towel from the school my parents are allowed at the wrong and what was his problem we don't know I got teammates now and got to steal everything he had them there academically if I was going to short-term short credits they had a crazy graduate lycos I need help what can I do you don't mess with me no more cuz like bro I'm only here but he can't hold you back and spine I'm out I left like a mother for school and he showed up at my house on where you at I'm at your house like I'm gone bro know what you mean I'm going like I'm done I'm transferring you can't sign the papers. How did you get that I went behind your back I got it done I'm out of there 10 fader the coach of Whitewater remember put it in my house almost then go back to school cuz it kind of got in my head that I don't want to go nowhere else and waste my last year school doing the same I can't trust anybody at 6 to you before injury but I was beating everybody you know I was like I don't want to go somebody going to screw me over full ride but in this guy pulled up in my driveway when I was working one day they only record I seen him before I didn't really know much about them and we went to lunch whatever he like I know your story but I can't give you for a ride cuz of D3 we can't give money I want you to Russia from this is missing people know we got we going to wait till the 1st home do and I'm let you loose in the first one. Number three doing your country I never forget that we can that you really like what you mean like it's the time you get to come out gave him a single like you radio show out like you know I'm ready dog number three guy out by like 12 points yes I'm finally home fight in the bin and just like I said the people around you it is mold you like I'm blessed with anything about it and it makes me feel good cuz all the things I've been through and everything all worked out the money if you eat but that one that's what it was for me I'll let you know I went to school as a walk-on pretty much and I'm getting full while I was maybe we're and I'm going to the number one school division 2 they give me a full like I thought that was something when I got that figured out what you meant I want you for you in a leader in and I first got that even though you told me wasn't to let me wrestle he let me run practice like the first month cuz he couldn't teach it before season got that I don't want you to like run practice this isn't it cuz you got that mentality that you can help this guy shows you didn't get you no more school you can show us up here and I end up being the first NCAA All-American or NCAA finals at school and 22 years you know that the team and takedowns all the way up until like the regional tournament in my room maybe we had a competition Behavior ways do the way I shot the way I rest with my mentality I'll always working condition before practice and before did more like Siri where Santa conditioner not going to class at 1 I'll be in the gym lifting it don't start raining till 3 anyway from just me to me and my teammates I mean my roommate to the other teammates that people will see how you doing it and it was before he was like six or seven of us working out berghain and everybody's like I go on there I thought about conference like that froze Suge Knight in all that someone got Fredo shirts Hood us and it was like it was so cool to have three guys from the same school with grew up right down the street from each other when we all went separate ways when when he had one went there we live in junior college together with me and one guy at the very last year we all end up together as a team captains senior years I last time to do it together hoorah we brought been there he brought me to this thing and I didn't want to fight again I was I had a doubt in my mind I want to go to that but I want to go back to your high school days when you made that big ship did you sleep at all like you went from being a guy who's kind of lazy and unmotivated to a guy was very disciplined that it was like night and day but was there ever a time when you fell back to your old ways I mean it was time it took a lot of motivation in pep talk to myself to get out and do some every time that I wanted ethical workout go play video while digging a dirt bike and four-wheeler and like when I get off the bus you can hear the dirt bikes come to my house at the motocross track my bag at me and the neighbor he had a freestyle dirt bikes and I've got the best of me thinking like I'm about to go do my homework and do a little work out lifting something and you hear I'm coming Monday Logan something this morning next person in a little by the time I seen your camera around is kind of like I still wasn't all in but I was a little more I didn't get all them until I said second injury in college injury Brandi Maxx super sticky and I have brand new wrestling shoes are super sticky and I remembered your coach morally high so don't work to the chain wrestling shoes single-a you get the single back and I should have W bumper to hit you snap to your shot. Single day Emma down one spot three spots is like screwing up your whole legs no injuries just snapped freak access I guess it's a freak accident what do they do then I go to the hospital but you got to get plates and pins to set this straight now and I was out for again I was October 27th and I came back after released back January 13th to 14th got kicked out of school whatever so 3 months ish I wasn't back but I was clear to start drilling.

it's going to happen often just got to toughen it up and just go through it yeah you have a extra vulnerable spot have you been low leg kick there a lot just a pesky injury you feel it but they'll go in after it's healed up and take the plate out I retired would you all that but right now there's no problem wow so you have this shift in high-school you you make it to seeing your and you're a different person night debut still not the Corey Anderson of today so the second injury what is the second injury do for you when you snapped it the second injury that was just I mean that just because I didn't get to show what I can do and motivate me that much more than I come back I got to be undeniable I got to show up I got to do like nobody knows I can do because I didn't make it to State my senior in high school but then we went to 10 State independent got it to 4th and state so I knew I could do it but it didn't make it there so when I got here my freshman freshman that was the year I was going to show people Korean sandwich are used to know what you think this is Miss and I got hurt me back iPhone my own school work and it's not figure out I can do school work I finished my freshman year at 3.25 GPA after missing like 3-4 months how to make up everything and take tests and then I realized I can do that too so that was more thing I got the thing I got out of that injury not so much that motivated to work even harder next year about found the fact that I can do school work if I want you to take the time to study I've never ever homework it was our fault somebody's homework take somebody knows how to fill in answers just to get something to see us completion credit but when I had nothing to do I couldn't wrestle I couldn't I couldn't run I couldn't go play basketball in the back but everybody else it was at the time I came back my GPA drop like to point something because I haven't been in class for so long so I had to get all that up a fight before the end of the year and finish with a 3.0 at least 3.25 for that call American was my that was my highlight of my freshman year I didn't get the rest on American but I had to academic All-American That's a Some I can work on because of the kid my parents should my mom and eighth-grade bet me $100 I wouldn't graduate my own mother and she's my mom my biggest motivation for myself before my son came in my mother was the hand that push me over everything she's always my dad comes to work ethic my mom is always make sure you do things right you can do is always help me she's helped me learn how to read faster read better and do things to the best of my ability and academic for it because Sports and hard work is going to be there but education so you can always fall back on so but I was just so bad I used to live next door to my house so I messed up from school homework I don't know why I was going to get away with it messed up at school call me she had me a summer camp I had to go to summer school one year when I passed all my classes because she wanted me to get that fact like just cuz you passed they let you pass, you did good you pass but you don't know how to work but that was nothing I didn't have the mentality that my mom working for academics and stuff skip class and fell out so I had to get my grades up if I won the wrestling next year so it's probably been something that was bothering you already didn't bother me your athletic career wouldn't be there and you need you need to get this education Friday cuz not and have the help I had in class when I was asked Lee and help you a little more when I do not wrestling it's kind of like my GPA doesn't matter anymore I have a missing from school for so long when I came back from injury then you get your academic work in order and you start being disciplined in all areas of your life and you feel like that carried over everyone's lennox's wrong thing works together by everything works for one thing and I got nothing about that first thing we learned orientation College athletic scholarship but she here at the student-athlete and I'm never going back and coach at the same college and him given the same speech and you write on the board student-athlete I'm making two parts first part student-athletes after that next priority Athletics to me after that you got your family then is making sure you stay out of trouble and that the last thing the very most important thing going to come to colleges your social life the rest of that everything else comes first and at the end then you worry about your friends and trying to be cool and all that stuff in trouble but not pay attention in school not worried about cartoon part I'm just asking if I ask questions act like I'm struggling and they trying to help me out you know by now they're not going to give me an F because I'm I'm trying by really wasn't I'm asking questions I'm sitting in front of class so I'm not going to give me an F but I got to make sure I don't I'm eligible to rest if I'm not going to fail right so running can't stay without a big eye-opener for you when you realize that you can do good at school today cuz in your whole life when you didn't try you didn't care and have that No Child Left Behind pretty much what a major official thing is always there. No I didn't do enough in school but somehow I graduate every somehow I graduate cuz it's always one teacher one person I looked out for me I've been blessed to have that and middle schools Miss permit to this day we still talk I go home we have lunch breakfast whatever somehow I graduate cuz it's always one teacher one person I looked out for me I've been blessed to have that and middle schools Miss permit to this day we still talk I go home we have lunch breakfast whatever will if it wasn't for her I probably dropped out of high school. School is very cool</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I don't know what I'm fighting again so but now I'm I'm ready to be active that was a big part of my decision to go there too and stay there a year as I want to be active this year to two fights but training where they have you right now I don't think I had you don't think you weren't even top 15 no definitely not what do you think you should do in terms of the next level of fighter your face like what what kind of guy would you like to fight that's crazy I don't even ask myself those questions what do you do just wait for the call yeah I usually just wait for the call and whoever they usually offer to they like two options really yeah usually they offer like like the last time it was okay there Sanders or there's a guy like I didn't even know his name like this guy is going to be new coming into the UFC and Erik Anders is like coming off a loss Bubba blah time I okay well sucks I know Eric all the stuff but I'd rather fight Eric because I've already lost three times the guys were making their UFC debuts and it's just not good for me but I mean like obviously they're tough they're hungry they're trying to get into the UFC it's going to be a really tough fight and so that's kind of how I made the decision the last one as I kind of want to take the risk of losing another fight to a guy who is making his debut his three times is enough for me is refreshingly honest and that's what you were talking about earlier about boxers having managers that have a strategy to keep them undefeated as long as possible give them tested have them decide like when's the right time to take this fight once you know what's with the right thing to do and as a professional how much of an visit to know what a guy does know who he is have seen him fight a bunch of times been around them it's I just like just for instance like I Fargo con sake and then and they offered me Johnnie Walker and so like Johnnie Walker was coming off Contender series but still nobody knew like not even we knew we saw that highlight but would like I will like this look at the competition that he's faced you know we didn't really get to see much of what he was capable of some like a okay if that's all you got then I'll take the fight but then Here Comes Johnny Walker dislike raging Beast you know it'd be like the guys huge so yeah it was just it was weird like so I went from beating go contact you to losing Johnnie Walker thank God Johnnie Walker has been as good as he has in his made a name for himself but still like yeah I just didn't want to be like a I guess I go whatever they call it like a journeyman yeah I know your foot in the door or something like that Anderson you have the spectacular result and now you know people recognizing that you made some big Improvement but what caliber Fila cool who do you think would Propel your career what would be the best next step I mean definitely I think it's time for me to break somewhere into the top 15 you know for sure nothing nowhere in the guys that are at the very top because they're all kind of tied up there are pretty tight you know and I definitely think it'll be a while before I can actually fight Jones because just like how things are how things are laid out like I know for sure Johnny Walkers ranked and he's already kind of like in talks like he's the guy to beat Jon Jones so sure they're going to try to set that up right and there's a set of guys in the middle room thing supposedly supposedly call me and like I just see this Johnny Walker guy down down the bike on the street everyday I guess he's back in Thailand so he did that flop around thing and then he couldn't when he got up and couldn't move a shoulder dislocated it right now but he could have a little after your fight with him he's made quite an account of himself. Last fight with a flying knee was insane so I'm sure I'm sure before I get to the top I have to fight ever again right what's up yeah I would imagine he is currently recuperating from shoulder surgery after dislocating a shoulder surgery to shoulder surgery bullied and warded reward had shoulder surgery and came back better than ever but he's also got the best doctors tour to Mundelein time to fight the winter again that's a great fight Anthony Smith and Gustafson that's a great fight and you know Anthony Smith account he really held his own like you made a good account of himself in that fight didn't win the fight but you know he showed everybody how technically he is special in that first round that real real real good and sharp Johnson's better just John just better you know I mean for now he just has his number I mean in the Jon Jones UFC now so Jon Jones it sort of has like a real goal in mind they really like doing anything about it right for a long amount of time so I think it's I think it's pretty cool to be able to see this version of them and to be active around this time maybe you know maybe I'll get a shot or maybe he'll still be around at the top like whenever I get my shot went and how it goes if you had a timeline in your head when you think you'll be ready to challenge for a title when do you think it would be I can give it yeah I didn't get one one more year year-and-a-half of good solid fights in to really solidify myself and just in the UFC and and just put in the work and everything that that that it takes to really embody what I think it would be like but I think it would take to to be a champion a successful Champion. Just like get the belt you don't like me get to Belen then and then just be a champion for you know couple months like not to actually be a champion and and and hold it down I think little over it's unbelievably talent-rich weight class right cuz the Cormier still kind of in it Jon Jones the champion you know he just got out the Anthony Smith fight Anthony Smith Gustafson Gustafson still a beast but no one is really standing out as being like this person that everybody wants to see challenge the title you got worthy Challengers there good fights but there's no one that you're seeing them except for me it was the only one we Cena versus John you like what the f*** is going to happen here what's going to happen here and that's what the division needs I think I know definitely that I can also see and that's something that I also want to do for myself I just I want to be the best version and I'm starting to find out what that's like especially like the happy like being able to do what I what I want to do in strike I want to strike and stuff so now like let's get some some fights in there to mix it up you don't really like test that test if it works test if that's really going to be able to just have stayed and in what it takes to get to get there he don't even like the best Grappler in the world think that I'll have no chance with the ground okay cool or if they want to put me against will they already did they thought I wouldn't stand a chance against go con sake and like I was very happy for that because I go I'm like okay cool I get to test the best of my abilities like the game to Legend I didn't like I knew that I had everything it took two betta but I I didn't think like he's going to destroy me no never want to continue to be tested it's interesting you approach I wonder if the fact that you were such a non-confrontational guy and you are really easy going and helps you and that you have like less conflict in your head I almost wondered because even the way you approached like these different matchups and everything you like you can put your ego aside you looking at me like what is the smart thing to do here a smart thing to do is not take this fight against this newcomer guy already lost newcomer guy the smart thing is okay we we realized that Tyler was extremely beneficial looks Thailand so you doing all these like really really smart moves where you know you're looking at it very logically but you have confidence you so but you know you don't like a braggy guy you know you're getting everything done with your work you know you're getting everything done with your results it's a it's interesting to see me because you want to see as many different kinds of Fighters as possible and you're like a new kind of thing that's the most important thing though man like I don't I don't really tune into much UFC and like what's going on because of that reason why I don't care about what people have to say in this I don't watch fighting to hear what people have to say you know I didn't fight and think it's not about talking about fighting Bryant and the only thing that I can prove it have to prove is what I can do with my skills that's it you know so like if they put me like they put me against any type of other fighter like it let's go the roots of mixed martial arts let's go back to the roots of UFC like when guys weren't even the same size and they were just matching up different martial arts I'd be down for that I mean I consider it and if it if it if it had to happen now like yeah I definitely think about it I probably leave more towards doing it since a no YouTube UFC like when guys weren't even the same size and they were just matching up different martial arts I'd be down for that I mean I consider it and if it if it if it had to happen now like yeah I definitely think about it I probably leave more towards doing it since saying no</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you know the hill game not enough to really play it but spent a little bit of time picking picking the brains of people who are good I like it I enjoy it yeah I think I can I think I can actually pretty good at it it's like the basics of it seems pretty simple as just a matter of getting comfortable there a partner that's not an a****** just like really wants to like learn together or whatever and I'll do it after 3 in my life was two years ago two and a half years ago just like a high enough level grappling that they can compete against really Grapplers and Jiu-Jitsu matches don't know like Chad Mendes remember he had that that match with Jeff his name Glover I think they were using the Eddie Bravo Invitational rules which you start on someone's back yeah you know in overtime and go to a certain distance is that Chael Sonnen submit is its Chael sonnen's organization in which case I'm pretty sure they use the evi rules so he got his back through sort of one of those overtime positions but he still tapped them what is Urijah Faber Urijah Faber's pretty f****** Elite pretty f****** Elite like you. Gloversville animal oh my God I love that guy super super technical you know and very dangerous and relax right and they must have set him up on his back doesn't show it to show them how the back man has helped f****** reneging right there that works all day on everybody either Jeff Glover and that's why NC Works in a little if any your leader to work save your ass yeah 3 by overtime submission so we're correct yeah yeah there's just a few guys but it's really hard to be the match of everything right after I do for you is there a bounce we like am I spending enough time grappling am I spending enough time striking doody ever like wonder what the correct formula is Urdu Tinker with it at all I have wondered and I always wonder but I can't like so a long time ago maybe like a few years ago Anderson told me like listen just you need you to like you need it and he's like it's saved my life I love to try to but when I learned you get to change my life so you need to learn it put on Iggy let's roll it right there in the living room one of the things that I learned from him is just he's like learn the basic stuff like learn the basic stuff get really good at it and then and then like use it to save yourself and Yoyo end up growing he's like just keep training you did to you don't need this whole crazy secret system at the moment just make sure that your training Jiu-Jitsu and continue to learn Jiu-Jitsu you know like that's kind of might take away from the conversation so I just make sure that when I'm training at least I'm doing Jiu-Jitsu you know like I focus on it make sure that I'm getting better make sure that I'm going with guys that are way better than me so I'm always getting my ass kicked by at least I'm always going with guys are better than me all the time like I enjoy it but I'm a striker that's it like I enjoy it I know that it's my job I know that it can get dangerous if I go you know if I go against the guy was high-level Jiu-Jitsu I know that I'd I understand that and I'm very aware of it every time that I trained and so I make sure that I do my job and I go to Jiu-Jitsu class but I'm a striker and I'm always going to be focused on that's always going to be what like my go to anybody at whether to Stryker Grappler I don't care I'm going to train striking and I'm going to change it to 2 but I'm going to miss tracking always do you think that is like you letting everybody know are you trying to trick people and then next next fight going to shoot on folks I don't need to shoot shoot if I need to like if I'm getting my ass kicked and I need to take a desperation shot you would rather just let them know that you're coming out striking because I believed you do and you're the one about real high-level MMA when you look at the guys who like Legend great examples what are things you never knew what the f*** they're going to do to you and that overloading the mine with possibilities is a part of their success it's like how much of a part it's a good question do you think that there's an argument for using skills you have which are quite spectacular with that sort of style sort of style that incorporates way more takedowns way more takedown attempt way more faints just just different combinations of things you never know what the f*** is happening at any given time or do you think better to just be the best Striker you can and that'll be enough you stop those takedowns that'll be enough for me we are just in general you but I think for me it would be the best to just be the best striker learn a lot to grow so that it's always going to get better I don't think that it's I don't answer yet bad I'm still learning a lot especially what you guys got to see like a few weeks ago and that's only the beginning like everything even before that was like non-existent compared to like the type of training I've been doing so I'm like I'm really excited sound like a lot more than just punch kicks in elbows you know and that's that's all the Striking infatuated by it right now I just want to focus on 100% yeah like there's guys like think about like Michael Venom page right and like before he fought like Paul Daley I'm sure that guy trains a lot of grappling as well and it shows like if he gets in positions like he's knocked out guys from weird you know where positions but when people watching fight they want to see like they paid trust in his stand-up in like all these guys can do some crazy stuff and I kind of Faith they trust in his stand-up you're like all these guys can do some crazy stuff and I kind of want to be able to do the same thing not crazy like you know we really stuff but when people watch me fight they know what to expect and that's just like bulletproof striking</div>

Anyway throws with both of them knew what they were going up against though like yep even behind the s*** talk they do like yeah it was a tough fight for both of them to me watching page uses distance and that crazy karate Point style in that you know she had to hit a really look out for that stuff and when he had a head of make sure that he wasn't getting ding by that stuff please come in with us like his Venom throws all this wild stuff Spencer and Pops you and you can tell Paul Daley was like really having a hard time like finding that range yeah it's it's hard to do to fight against guys that are long and know how to use your body like athletically is he fighting Douglas Lima Nexus that's what's happening over and Bellator remember seeing that Douglas Lima had a fight but I don't remember who the opponent was who's Michael Venom page finally find out that he's a spectacular them and right either he landed on cyborgs holyshit he cave the man's head and skull has never seen that whenever heading there been like 4 months he's like I'll be finding him for months and then like bro the Big Frame Brewing 417 and cuts a lot of weight but he's so powerful he gets in there dangerous f****** Striker lemus he's for real that to me is as interesting as that warrants in the Paul Daley fight I want to see what happens at Lemans a little different in like he's not like be a main event in UFC it was unquestionably that's fine Venom page is he's a real f****** hard pill to swallow man figure that guy out that can move like him you can try but he doesn't even know how he's going to move rock-solid traditional stance and now he moves real well devastating power that's going to be a really good fight like one and you know like the pfl now and it's it's great that Fighters have options super good a lot of times to like I like to just watch whatever's going on you never know who you're going to come across where is that where is that American top team somewhere cuz it was terrifying nasty combinations man he's got ruthless leg kicks two men ATT where which one there's a bunch of those right ATT how many atp's are there David Allan Coe real in this article right here that just came out yesterday Fight Club maybe saw your fight inside f*** it going to Thailand to bring everybody everybody</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the leg lock him so unexpected cuz I always thought they were a good technique if you can get it but it's not that high percentage in MMA that was kind of how I felt so you didn't see too many of them I don't know why but I think it was we didn't we had a few guys were really good in the early days like all of tartar off and you know some other guys are really good but we didn't have the level that you have what like app RS yeah diving on things transitioning from one if you don't you got me screaming do you think a lot of the times of those guys like the other guy's fault or does he really just hold too long he definitely holds too long he has this one fight from Brazil with crazy he's not letting go he's just holding on to something I forget what it was when he was not letting go anywhere trying to separate when you're still hanging on to it I think he came from a really really bad childhood and he's talked about it in-depth about growing up on a farm and being forced to eat pigs pig slop when he was a little boy the cut that he has on his chest at big scar he had sealed that up with glue yeah like crazyshit through even though he knew that they were going to matter if you didn't let go still in quiet yeah I know I get the f*** out of here they kicked him out of the UFC the first time I ever get kicked out of UFC for holding on submission so he got kicked out I think it is that who was the first guy to ever get kicked out of UFC any normal person people like enuf you know cuz that was controversial submission victory over Jake Shields at World Series of fighting Jake Shields I think he did that too but yeah that's right but I think before that he got kicked out of the UFC release by 13 that's right hook so that's what it was yeah okay that's what it was he was released after holding onto heel hook of my Pierce in 2013 yeah but look man that guy was pretty she's particularly scary when he fought cuz he was so strong and his body was so well designed for heel right he just could grab ahold of you in a rip your s*** apartment look at that he grabs ahold of Mike Pierce is. A tapping is tapping is still holding still holding but that's all in slow motion but it looks to me like he was still ripping it than the apart even though he knew that the guy tapped ain't nobody taking the Jake Shields fight there's other s*** that was happening to I think it was eye pokes I'm pretty sure it's a dirty fight what do you hear I was not was this what is it what is it what do you start off do you know what promotions so he came out of Brazil by cage Warriors I don't know man I don't know where it where what he was fighting in a Brazil is the UK watch storm Samurai 12 I want a t-shirt for storm Samurai 12 throwback real Throwbacks yeah he had a great show you how good Garry tonon is as a submission grappling because they had a great submission grappling match go back to the ER because I think that was listed there I think it turned out in a draw and Garrett there is so much smaller than him dry oh yeah that recent yeah 2016 I think it was because I remember now that was Craig Jones Okay 2018 was Craig Jones yeah cuz I don't have pictures about like how he looks now Tokyo he's got like faded like his big mustache now he's all lb MMA News there's something extra scary about a guy f*** your knee up yeah you know what's up what are the size of now I healed caught in that armpit yeah look at those put that picture above where he's screaming with look at that picture like what in the f*** man that is a body designed to rip your legs apart</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> did you see I thought Mini Maglite was going to take it that last bit too he's I remember seeing a lot he's really coming was on his striking is caught up with a lot of his grappling and he's fantastic very dangerous was that Matamoras like a few years back and now have you seen I might cause a guy that I felt like I was something changes the game there's things aren't available anymore you can't just allow yourself you just too hard you can somebody like somebody stop somebody Wagner Rocha stop somebody going to talk to them just blasted them with palm to the head was pretty rough man it's almost like we learn from Bas Rutten way back in the day to remember those days send back way further than other people and Bas Rutten would smash guys with palm strikes he was throwing like uppercuts and hooks like you wasn't just like yeah you can tell he's getting beat up the referee Mike Beltran seen enough of Palms down let a guy Mount you do something desperate to get out of that figured out how to hit people leg or something out of that s*** yeah how about you just so you got to get the f*** out of there that's a terrible place to be saying they would like him and they write the amount it sucks especially when he hired will the difference between MMA grappling and regular grappling to use to always be with the one of the big ones at least I should say was leglocks they thought you really can't get away with leg locks in is much anime cuz as you're going for the legs you have two arms committed to the legs when she's going to punch you in the face and you don't have defense for it but now you seen when imanari burst on the scene start ripping guys needs a party said I'll factor that is and then pajares are you know people's legs up and you know and then Craig Jones and all these other guys that are all over the world that are leg lock Specialists are the all these complex LifeLock systems now yeah it's a whole new world chewed up inside there that's the problem I mean some people just take it but once you start ripping meniscus apart and cartilage apartments that stuff starts happening ligament starts getting stretched out and rip a little bit and then there was going to be Wiggly apart nothing was going to scramble thing it came apart a scramble but there's a lot of those leglock experts right now that scared the s*** out and everything came from Dean Lister which is crazy why would you ignore 50% of the body and John danaher being a f****** crazy wizard that is like why would you is all these memes is a f****** hilarious meme of John danaher in bed next to a woman and it says why would you ignore 40% 50% of the body understands things like he sees them on a very complex level if you understand all the various possible exchanges and what's the best way to mitigate it like stop the defense push the offense control situation what is the ultimate control position I have to get to is that I'll get on the inside do I grab it this way I do agree with and then once they started really experimenting and putting it together and putting into a system and you see how these guys who have only been doing Jiu-Jitsu for a few years like Nicky Ryan and I wouldn't start tapping all these like really legit got like what the f*** is happening can plan as like their own I want this time I approach you aren't it outside if you go to another site like that's the same as help man you know I mean and then Fighters divides our own system I'll really often you don't have their own entries and got our own ways of Defending things</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you'll never allow yourself get back to 300 pounds can from being a guy who's like really overweight and worried you're going to die to being an elite UFC fighter like life life for me is is is happening now like this is kind of the beginning of everything for me you know it's it's really cool it's really cool and I'm glad that I found mixed-martial-arts just because it just it gives me to journeyman it's not just UFC just like fighting MMA and and diving into different cultures and Lifestyles and understandings and sometimes philosophies all the stuff just to understand just to put it all together just to have it all makes sense at the end of the day like it's it's been a beautiful thing that I've been able to meet a lot of people go a lot of places like I'm very thankful to Mary just like like I'm okay life is not a very good to hear man that's a cool thing to hear I love hearing that you're cool with life yeah you're right path man it's it's also with inspiring about it for other people is your story of being at a place where you weren't like that before and I story of being overweight and smoking cigarettes and feeling like a rat and then now you're so many people out there that gives people hope I thought like maybe if I just figure this out I actually can't I maybe life doesn't suck maybe just sucks the way I'm living maybe if I can just figure out this path in a positive direction I can change everything I can I could be a happy I could be like you right now what was the exact quote UFC I made a choice just go get healthy. It was like a short just a short step in the right direction I just looked propelled you to take the first fight you were just trying to get healthy a lot of encouragement and the first time really hearing people like being good at something that like I was like surrounded by Fighters and guys who believed to be in like who cared and like wanted to see me get better and tougher and I was getting my ass kicked every day and that was something that wasn't used to just being in that environment I had at the time learning I had a very strong team like I I started at vanderley school when he was still fighting so a lot of the guys that was like shoot the Box salads like everyone's getting knocked out every training somebody gets knocked out very hard and that was that was new for me to get in things like that and I had a very night in Vegas helping him get ready for the either was like Brian Center Chris leben and stone full on elbows in the cage notepad like we're going at it and like my jaw was dislocated everything but it was just like what we learned was just always fight and Brazilian everyday everyday now I realize that like I've only been doing this a short time and I already feel like aches and pains and stuff and I don't want it to be like that when I'm older so I'm a lot more smart about my training and do you think was a critical aspect of your success do that I'm get down through the fire like that I needed that because you were just different guys know what I was made of my dad passed away when I was younger like very young and so I never had my dad to encourage me to go throw a ball or anything play sports or be a man be a boy be a you know just be I was always like kind of shelter by my mom and she was more like protected like I don't go do that and then she finally learn to just like Set Me Free but I needed to know what I was made up man I need to know what I was made of in in the realm of fighting whatever it took blood near sweat have the same thing they say I got I didn't know what that was like I never got a taste of it and so going through it in a real way it's like actually getting my ass beat and having to find my way out of it and can't run from it still like it's people that cared about me to is like it was just a great thing to have and it now I enjoy enjoy really good hard fight when you progress to your change of who you are as a person is strengthening how far into your training was where you like a hundred percent all in committed like that I think it was after my loss to Tyson Pedro which was my second fight in the UFC before everything was still kind of very fun and games and I was like how I get to travel go to Australia fight it was a big shock to be in the UFC especially not even expecting to be there in within just a few years so after losing that fight is when I met my friend didn't at the time I strength and conditioning coach Lorenzo and he had been through like pararescue school and things like that so he helped me to just develop this mentality of like how far will your mind take you how big is your will and I'm training with him and doing kind of like pararescue survival training for conditioning that that was that was a point where I started to like say like okay I'm going to take this full-on I know I can fight hard but now I know how far am I will can go in the face of the elements and everything so like putting those two together going after it and then the fight I took after that was Daniel jolly and then I in the first round with Annie and then I fought Paul Craig in Scotland and I had the same mentality like I'm going forward I'm getting better I'm going to grow stronger better harder like everything and then the fight to the Polish guy Michael ellex a joke have you seen him lately he just beat like John Delonte and I forgot how that's right. so after that was a go-kart soccer fight so it's been Accelerated Reader to no contest so you took positive I tested positive but I hated that he was also a last-minute last-minute flight his name up Michael Alexi Joe Alexi check at the Wayans I was butcher it yeah so when like 3-4 years then and how many fights you have professionally 8383 and one that's funny that you know you don't really know your record I don't remember a three-in-one I think it's a three-in-one wow yeah that's amazing that you've been fighting for a relatively short. Of time and of achieved some pretty f****** spectacular results man don't really know your record I don't remember a three-in-one I think it's 831 wow yeah that's amazing that you've been fighting for a relatively short. Of time and of achieved some pretty f****** spectacular results man</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> to go see this one championship event in Bangkok the guy one of my friends like damn he's a he's a a stadium like champion and he's fighting one Championship again and it's like it's just 6 evening I don't think people understand how big it is either was a lot of American fans are just really they're messing it up version of the UFC it's gigantic and they got some Killers over there I'm Legit killer that's like that guy nastyukhin who just knocked out of Eddie Alvarez yep. Kind of tiger dude that guy's I remember you check with him at all know I would like a long time I didn't personally trained with him but I remember one day we were doing we were training and he was the last one on the mat and a wrestling Coach Frank was like he's like he said something like 10 more sprawls in like you beat Eddie Alvarez or something like he's just digging himself into the matter it was it was cool to watch him prepare for that fight but there's guys like that like yeah he was there all the time and he beat Eddie Alvarez so I spent a big deal I think it's a big factor over there to the day don't cut weight I think that's a bad doctor if you're used to being the bigger fighter all the time and also now you're not now no one's coming anyway and they have some sort of a system Ben askren was explaining it to me I don't really remember how it works but the summer system where they stop you from white cotton calf I did check your heart rate check your hydration levels yet you got to be the right he's correct he's smart it's the right way to do it we should have done it a long time ago in the UFC stuff like causing fighters to fight it lessen their full potential and how many fighters got hit when they shouldn't have gotten hit because if they were recovered completely fade have to not recover completely but if they they didn't have to recover from a weight cut and who knows maybe their shots you ate because that you wouldn't have eaten by especially if you some guys cutting a brutal amount of way it's entirely possible that you could get hit with something you wouldn't if you didn't have to cut weight you gain weight at 5 more offer here like a lot of fighter spending the last 3 weeks 4 weeks of the fight or their camp please wait it's a terrible way to Braga of learning un building strength and all that stuff that you can do so I don't know I think it'd be awesome the only argument for it is that the guys are tough enough to do it and cut a shitload of weight have this massive size advantage and sometimes it allows them to win and they think they should be able to do it because they're tough enough to cut all that weight yeah I get it I mean it does it's hard to do a strong person but I just don't think it's good for anybody I don't think it's good for anybody it's just an old way it's just an old thing that people are doing so they don't have to fight the bigger people you know it's crazy because I have to answer that question a lot for people who don't like some of my friends are just like all like to hit me up like hey, I can't talk this week like I got a cut weight like not a good time how do you how do you lose 20 pounds in a day and why do you do that you know I'm just like I don't know how to explain it cuz that's what we do you know there's not really that just what I have to do when you see certain Fighters get on the scale don't like Conor McGregor when he made one 45° he looks like like a zombie Man Walking Dead character different definitely yeah I want to look at the different sleep good and 16 is that right yeah wow wow you know it's crazy to mess it up the mind too cuz you see yourself so shredded right at one point your life and then like I can get maybe like 5 lb of my cat man I'm out of shape that I got to get back in shape yeah you get accustomed to it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how did saenchai figure out how to do multi different than anybody else which is of the feed-in like even the way he throws kicks is just got like a little different flavored everything done he can help it you know what I mean there's just something about a guy's character it just like his his fighting is him like he's just going like I believe in ghosts are there in fights on crazy like he seems like his fighting is definitely an expression of himself he's so good man. He's so good I like watching them just warm up sneakers on outside sweating throwing elbows and knees and I think he's a bad motherfuker man and he's you know he's not young now I think it's in his forties is he all the times in multiple times have fight good luck movement man he's something special takes a lot of f****** energy to move around the way he does to every single day what is crazy wig so good act up swipe you think of how many different people are doing it and that this one guy stands out I love outliers man so that's one thing that I learned compared to like watching Muay Thai in the states and then going there the amount of kicks in knees after throwing I'm looking at fighting like okay like when's the next punch going to happen these guys thrown kick after kick after kick for 5 round I was like okay I'm definitely not taking enough so I got to start kicking so I bet it like being in Thailand definitely help me to learn the importance of kicking so we were talking about the Chute boxe style Rafael Cordero who's is absolutely one of the best coaches on the planet it's funny that he's such a nice guy and he trained the most murderous crew Anderson Silva bed Wanderlei and would vandelay Shogun I really do not understand why that's a f****** tell another one at like Pele everyone that it's right there at 2 they were some of the guys know how are you Michael coste he was he was from that same that same group so I really am this day do not understand why more times not more popular I've never understood it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what would you think about if they abandon weight-cutting they just opened up more weight classes and a band of weight-cutting I mean I wouldn't mind it I would I would like to see that nothing would be better for the fighters I think it'd be better for the fighters and we won't let him really cool matchups yeah stop it it's not helping anybody to lose weight for a fight so you can be fit and in great shape yeah okay sure how do you go about that but I mean losing weight like losing weight and training not like massive Dia for weight cut day and then rehydration the next day for fight that I think it's too crazy to drain the guys are doing to the kidneys and their bodies that mean many fighters of told me that they're they don't feel like they could take a body shot as well and they caught a lot of weight I guess sometimes the your head my head I remember in a Johnnie Walker fight I'd cut see if he could have been from the wake up but that morning like if I even tapped on my jaw just felt like my head was just like off like rattly you know that I felt very sensitive knocked out I don't know what it was from but I remember feeling that morning when I woke up cuz usually I like Shake everything off I like you know like to get ready for the fight and I remember that that morning when I was like having myself on the jaw my head just didn't feel right dude that's not good feeling but I got checked after I didn't have any like concussion anything's you have some particular hard sparring session or something close to that I don't think close to it during that camp excited feel it all the way until I didn't have it the only time I ever felt it was like after the weight cut so it could have been from that Brian and I think morning actually ended up cutting the last little bit of my weight the morning of weigh-ins to which is not usually like me I usually cut it the night before so you said you like to start your day off with a run again that everyday yeah definitely realize that's one thing that I learned to is just training everyday not to learn but it just feels different now I have to go and train every day when I was in Vegas like I got to drive 30 minutes do you know all these things I had a lot of excuses to make up and now with the convenience of running is now I don't even make up excuses unlike if I'm tired I still 2-minute walk get your ass to the gym you know and so yeah every every single day training and then weekends off for sure so you're running every single day then you're training every single therefore more tied to mandatory run at I didn't even have tennis shoes I just showed up with my flip-flops cuz I was staying right across the street and I showed up I start wrapping my hands in the trainer he's like are you going to train and I was like yeah I think so he's like you think so go run and I was like I don't have shoes only have my flip-flops he's like just pointed so go run and I had to run like and he was like 8 km in in flip-flops before I can even try 526 km in like that I'd say like just cutting it short 5K wow in flip-flops and I was over there cool yeah I never I never forgot my shoes again I would wish it wasn't too bad cuz I wasn't wearing shoes a lot anyway sometimes you got to take off your shoes before you when you're running running with a group of guys or everybody guys girls whoever shows up to class but is it is like when they're running or they running like organized like in a group or they just is everybody running a few miles before class every time the first the first Muay Thai gym that I turned out the straight Muay Thai gym in Bangkok they run as a unit everyday 5 a.m. as a team they live at the gym to eat at the gym they sleep in the gym they are like they they don't have homes their home is the gym and her job is just fight and Eat Sleep Train fight that's it it's crazy when they'd even take on the name of the gym yeah exactly that's a whole different life like that is what made me respect and learn and love moytie so much it's how these guys trained and just they live together everything is amazing so they run is a group but the other the other place we all start off but if you have someone laughing you and they just one that's like it's it's totally fine but before the class everybody has to go wow that's a smart way to do it man I mean if you could really convince them to be conditioned all the time and there's like you have no option you can't be out of condition if you going to run 5 miles everyday now 5 miles around the day clenching 45 minutes a day like clenching at after every session it's like you run Knee Bag sit-ups lots of second second session is kick the bag 325 round until a trainer picks you up like for me I had to wait for a trainer to actually even like want to hold Pastor me if you just show up you'll just be hitting the bag until the trainer was okay okay I'll hold for you and then once you actually find a trainer that wants to work with you then you kind of whatever their schedule is for you that they'll create it U-Haul double pads you kick the bag of do push-ups you do sit-ups and then clench 30 to 45 minutes after it's the same thing every single day wow do you ever worry that this might be something that would be monotonous because you're doing the same way every day or do you think we just concentrate on Excellence because it's also like going to the fights and there's so many different styles so like people are doing the same thing everyday the repetition but the styles are completely dead you know like nobody fights like saenchai right when he does the same thing everybody else does but he has his own style you know what I mean or some guys will do the same thing but they don't even like to kick corny they just like to throw elbows and help Lennie guys like that where they just like you know that when he goes he's just throwing elbows all five rounds this guy just going to throw nice so it's just like which tools do you use the bends like are you an ear are you in a kicker are you an elbow guy who left kicker YOLO kicker it's kind of like what strikes are you are your thing and then you go watch the chaos and these guys are getting split open every night on the stretcher they take him stretchers on the rain man it's easy it's like not to see someone get hurt but like just the fact that these guys are all out brawl and every night every single night there's a fight at the stadium and Thursday nights are the nights that like that like that hire guys go and they're packed with people thousands of people like the one I went to there was a few thousand people there for the stadium it look pack the one I went to there was a few thousand people there for the stadium it look pack and everyone's been in the kicks they never showed up</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the biggest crowd you guys ever performed in front of I think the biggest was with Woodstock 94 I think it was 93-94 and that was like 300 380 some 1,000 people I got to see this f****** insane that is insane. I just cut my hair right there I was like you know oh my God see the little guy next to mugs he was our our our our our miniature knockout guy he knew Jiu-Jitsu Taekwondo Shotokan he trained with with my boy Kenji and he was he was like he was like our unofficial security little guy I mean he even did a even did a few MMA fights some years back almost lost my s*** right here because you know seeing three hundred and some-odd thousand people jumping around to your s*** you know it could give you some equilibrium problems is ever performed in front of in North America for sure all of human history was one of the biggest how do you get it more than 380,000 people together it's it's crazy I mean every band they had on this this particular bill was huge at the time you know so it was pretty crazy trying to get in through boat some of us had to get in through helicopter Mexico state that started parking on the roads like the old schools with stock and they jammed up the highways and stuff like that they parked with like they pretty much shut the s*** down yeah and I went into helicopter and some of the other guys went into the clothes cops on the ground and then you watch the cops and helicopters Spotlight to stay in the car entire time but naked in with mud smeared all over their f****** bodies and it was like people went pro all right there they were have mudslide Mauritius people made babies that day in their tent I'm sure they did I'm sure they did those people out there totally hippie doubt like straight-up butt naked in the email and there was a good portion of them I mean not not in terms of the whole concert ever has a small percentage but like Racine just naked people walking around free out there it was crazy as f*** it likely like are we is this really happening in the mud was so thick man it was the type word like if you walked through it with your shoes and your shoes weren't tight or you weren't wearing boots it was sucking the shoe right off of your clip it happened to me a number of times health and not show I jumped into the crowd cuz normally I would jump into the crowd and he knows floating you know States. Stopped but I would still be doing the song and on that particular show they took my shoes and socks and I got back on stage with no shoes and socks and you know about 15 years later you know I had one guy with once you come to the show and so I can have me sign it and then the other shoe some up some chick had it and had me sign it was later so if I caught up with what about the socks didn't catch up with the socks didn't catch up the stocks the shoes yet caught up with them do they have a limited amount of tickets for Woodstock me what the f*** do they do when you get that many people I think they probably started with it some sort of limit and Kim K and then it became chaos and you know like that's something they couldn't handle I mean it would be live there and that s*** to send it on yourself I know they were pissed off and 64000 tickets but the crowd estimated size was 550,000 okay b******* I was too short with 200,000 show now it and it it's you know it's it's a great part of their history because of me and you know that one was a good one where no one got hurt and there was no crazy no crazy s*** happening like the next one after that I mean they had some Welch it they had a bunch of women said they had gotten raped or molested at at the one the following year and Spires bunch of people lost their f****** mind if that was great bands do so you know it so much for water and like they couldn't they couldn't get to the bathroom like you were asking like there's didn't have the facilities it up as well as they didn't have adequate facilities for what what the f*** with popping to me you know you know a thousand thousand people is not going to cry the highway right there a shutdown the f****** highway they just park their car they made you have they made the Highway 2 parking lot set the expected you to leave right away because the next wave of bands was coming and they were getting your spot so like if you had a dressing-room once your set was done you were expected to get the f*** out so you have a helicopter out of there if if yeah it was best if you did because if you didn't take the ride when when it was when you were supposed to you were getting stuck there they couldn't guarantee that they could give you the ride back to your s*** after that you know because that all the other bands to think of him they might not have room for you when they take the other bands so it was like yeah it's never that we played for another five thousand you know I'm 500,000 people screen much like that Viking chant and then you go do a regular gig afterwards does it feel weird we just came from Woodstock but fortunately the smaller gigs that we had after that you know in terms of plant festivals ever like you know in between 30070 thousand hundred thousand and we felt it that gave us such an experience that we can handle any f****** stage so it became easier for us to do festivals after that and the reaction that we would get at these festivals were smaller versions of what we did there you know and it was it was a great experience cuz we had we had been doing like a a couple European festivals before that so it's sort of prepared us for that but we didn't we didn't I mean the f****** numbers we would definitely not prepared for like whoa what the fee for us you know cuz it's a mixed bag right bunch of artist and you're winning over people if anything get your your your they're playing for your your your base of people that might have come to see you but you're winning everybody else over if you're doing it right and for us it was like a victory because we saw you know half a million people up there jumping up and down to all our s*** and they knew the words and they were singing with us in it he knows it was like a big knot under the belt in a boost for a confidence knowing that we in front of anybody play with anyone and get that reaction at me because after that you know we're getting booked on metal driven festivals and stuff we're we're the only hip hop on it but it's all straight up metal I mean we're playing shows co-headlining under Metallica right and Metallica Cypress Hill biohazard Deftones Fear Factory in and all that stuff playing those festivals with those guys in with hip hop music and you know the Boost that it gave us in the confidences it was like f*** that we can play with any of these m************ it doesn't matter who it is in and we went to those metal fence metal festivals with our hip-hop and got metal reaction moshpit stage-dive everything what you know and in it felt good to be able to hang up there with a metallic I mean yeah what they do to a crowd is crazy but we realized it if we were playing on the same venue going before them we can end in a festival form we can talk and hang with anyone in India that's that pretty much put us over the top with doing festivals like yeah we're we're going to f****** rule this s*** people are going to have two people are going to have to up their game when we're on that festival with them that's the way we took it as you can sleep for days after that the adrenaline was crazy I got to tell you the address only was crazy and then will you like what the fuk just happened we were tripping out man to me we were like totally in all of of the response that we got and the email the enormity of the f****** crowd man I mean it was f****** huge in to be a part of something that that that mean that's like something that no one there is ever going to forget we took it for granted that got to tell you when we f*** and when we got there that's when we saw just how f****** crazy it was it because yesterday and there goes there goes the first shooter that happened ridiculous and there is no f****** security that can stop 500,000 people save all that s*** no mercy of the fans you're not really thinking you know what's in my pocket and shake like that but yeah you know throughout that I had chicks trying to grab my s*** for sure for sure that was a little you know crazy for me you know but it is what it is if you can stand close you know like this happens right a119 yeah I did I had since I had like an ounce of weed in one at 1 show and I jumped in that totally forgot I had it in my pocket boom so I can take my goddamn weeks I hope you enjoyed that I bet they did admit it did when that one show and I jumped in that totally forgot I had it in my pocket boom so I can pick my goddamn week I hope you enjoyed that I bet they did admit it did</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> everything I did like you know that bit that I did outside of music when I try like for instance paintball when it went into paintball there was a price on my head everyday everybody wanted to give me extra shots Corso like if I got hit while I'm walking out I would get 10 20 extra paint balls to my back you know and we'd give it right back to them you know in the very next game when we played them guys again we're making sure to give him that right back but oh yeah I was man if it's a dick thing that I got to tell you if there's any physical activity that is addicting it is paintball cuz it's chess with guns because it's so fast and so close and you got to think of a strategy you know it's not all shooting straightway it's all shooting angles and getting your guys the positions to get those guys out to keep moving up to get their flag wipe them out and bring the flag back. you can't shoot above 300 PSI think it's I think it's the highest you can shoot as maybe to 85 to 90 at least at the time I have if you go balls-out if you wanted to get the ultimate paintball gun what is that man it's it's it's hard cuz we were using different guns at the time because it's it's like a each year a better gun comes out technology gets better so you know we were using it first when you started these these guns called angels and then we went over it you are these other guys f*** I can't remember the name of them but they were like I mean the best thing is to have a light gun with with the trigger that you can fancy cuz that's technique to get it to shoot like a like a Uzi right you're not supposed to be able to pull the trigger and multiple balls come out with one pull it supposed to be that the the gun shoots as fast as your your your your two fingers or three can toggle so if you get a rhythm you can shoot that like a f****** Uzi you know and everybody has a different position do you know like mine I was like one of the quarterbacks which is the last three on the line seeing it's like a football field right you got the 50 and there's obstacles at 2:50 and in between and it's mirrored on the other side the quarterbacks play the back and they shoot a whole bunch of paint so that the other guys that are the front and mid guys can get into these different positions to shoot the other guys out so the guys in the back were shooting the mo paint so you have to use that Fanning style Fusion 3 fingers 3 fingers cuz the trigger where you're at the base where you're pulling the trigger you can fit three fingers there yeah it's really for 2 but you could fit three yeah this this was our team right here barriers and show these are all blow up their ears right here yeah that's what they would replicate like a football soccer field and you know you put all the these these obstacles up these blow up obstacles and they're all just positions to try to take to get a better angle on the other side and the other side out but you get them points getting their flag and bring it back to yourself and you know you get points for how many guys on your side that are still alive so you know you would get 100% if all 7 of your guys were alive you killed all them and brought their flag. Oh yeah tears right there's the pros there's a semi-pros there's the amateurs there's the August birth of rookie and each each each tier had at least 200 teams competing in this per tournament in these guys back in that time I don't know how it how it is now cuz I don't compete in a long time but they would do five tournaments a year one would be in Huntington Beach the biggest one and it was awesome they would throw it you know right next to a surfing tournament so like it would just be cross people crossing up watching the Surfers and they come and watch the paintball Kennywood headset you know Boston and Florida and Las Vegas and one other one other place I can't remember but we would do these tournaments are out doing them for like 4 or 5 years in the guy before me that was the Ambassador was one of the one of the Bee Gees Bee Gees that the one who passed away first. shorter one so he was a paintball games with paintball being like myself he he owned the store he had a team I think is based out of roughly out of Miami and he would compete up until when he passed away he was like the Ambassador and I kind of I came in and took his spot when he's Maurice at least 20 paintball bruises Nino Perdido in one one sitting and you know you're look like a Leopard coming coming off after that you know who else was a big paintball enthusiasts was William Shatner really yeah he would hold these crazy tournaments like in Truckee style where it's a scenario game meaning that okay here's the castle I'm going to be in the castle right here you guys got to see to the castle in it if you guys can come get me out of here you guys win around and they would sit through the three days they'd set up different scenarios like there you go soon as he run he can't run and Gun Shoot sometimes he would go out there but so you would just stay put. He would stay so you would have to protect him old man paintball he would fight to he would fight too but he would be would you know I would be trying to protect him that's so crazy wow and I mean there's a bunch of celebrities that Dip paint bald man Will Smith was paintballing before he did iRobot he did that he came down to the park where we would practice at we will play with Tim and his team but it was a scenario game of Joaquin Phoenix and Mekhi Phifer I mean you'd be surprised how many Butler competition team you have you have 11 for the roster and seven play at a time and you can be no switch guys out but now it's different now they do like five men in three men teams don't know anything about the new style but you know they they constantly call me back cuz I'm in better shape than I was when I played a little bit heavier then that's why I was at quarterback mental always get hit on my DM on IG or Twitter like a man when you come back to the PayPal feeling like when I get time which is probably never but it seems like I have a big time sucking loved it man I love to play in the game it was so addicting it was hard to pull away from it I would even at times be coming home from from a tour straight into a tournament like I get off the plane I'd have somebody have my paintball s*** ready and boom straight to the tournament can't tell you how many times I was doing that f****** crazy it's it's funny when things get in your blood right they get your bones yet that got in my blood like martial arts did cuz I was always like an Enthusiast like you know for a long time you know and when I finally started training I was training like 7 days a week now wouldn't give myself any time off cuz I wanted to learn fast and I wanted to absorb it you know I'd like martial arts did cuz I was always like an Enthusiast like you know for a long time you know and when I finally started training I was training like 7 days a week now wouldn't give myself any time off cuz I wanted to learn fast and I wanted to absorb it so you know</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I don't know why you guys were so far ahead of the curb do you know I mean you you were you had weed songs like when like what year that was the first album was in 91 and we started writing for that album probably for years prior and you know the weed songs those came about because we're weedheads you know we just f****** let's be ourselves right different things for people that were we're fans upset cuz when I was listening to you I was just getting ready to move from Boston to New York and back then you would hear about new hip-hop bands from my friends like yeah sound like a typical West Coast you know group running a lot of a lot of West Coast boots at that point you know what the labels were looking for where NWA genotypes and you know things like that like either you know gangster West Coast gangster rap they were looking for that or either the Kid Frost Chicano type bugs be in from New York to sort of blend both world right so you know we went with with the East Coast type sound with LA genotype of slang mixed with with East Coast slang and so people you know they were like when people thought were from Cypress Hill New York cuz there's a Cypress Hill down there and you know people just didn't really know it first because we're one of the first groups that didn't put our images on any of our first do you know any of our singles are or our art comes we never did like the the shop like that were existing at that time where he hits a clean shot of the group or the artist or whatever we were always on some no cuz we are metalheads to do you know before the Hip Hop we like the Obscure metal album so we didn't we were like we're not going to put ourselves on the covers which school do these crazy obscure covers and make people you know try to guess who we are being mysterious it's crazy you know we we didn't expect it we didn't know how long I run would be we just kept working you know who always had a strong work ethic we are never the types just to sit around we're always doing something you know mugs is always making beats you know I'm always riding to something I'm always into one project or another so it so it was always just about keeping busy and in that that suited as well crazy when you say 28 years and years later from you guys never dropped off for a second. Once you were always there so you have to be consistent in hip-hop you know it in music in general especially like if if there's a time where radio stops playing your music or you know as MTB stop playing music videos and it went for more reality show type programming you got to you got to stick out their so for us it was you know we doing shows we didn't put out as many albums has we could have but we thought less was more and you know instead of like driving the music into your heart like a steak or something like that would just let everything breathe for a while and it was there was a time where you know we sort of let go of doing everything it was like a six-year. Work we just kind of took off we weren't away completely were still doing like sporadic shows here and there to keep up the for a while and it was there was a time where you know we sort of let go of doing everything it was like a six-year.

		<div class="paragraph"> we both been busy crazy and in the meantime we became legal yes you guys were at the Forefront man you guys were way ahead you were ahead of everybody you know we took a shot you know that's how you start like you know your friends is a man try this or you're the one who says try this right it's one of the other and you know eventually you start getting into the High Times Magazine's and stuff like that and looking at the Eno to centerfold pictures of the weed but also we like we like to read some of the activism aspect of it as well and that's when we heard names like Jack Herer who pretty much opened our eyes to everything and then you know I think we became real Advocates you know at first you know we thought we were you know sort of Riverstone is so we thought we were Advocates but like in Reading what other Freedom Fighters were actually doing out there in the protests and rallies and all that stuff we really weren't Advocates like we thought I'd we became that later for sure because he was a Goldwater Republican smoking weed yeah and then also needs like Menace is f****** amazing God why am I such a dick what's wrong with me who am I what am I doing with my life absolutely 8 flipped his life around him the emperor wears no clothes the f****** great book man yeah it holds it holds strong to this day because everything that he said in the book is sort of happening right now all the stuff that they let you know that they try to prevent from happening through all the anti-cannabis propaganda you see it now quesitos Berry companies try to get into the industry if they were always on the outside of their waiting you know there was always at the launching block not quite ready to run but any minute now it's going to get legal yeah exactly I mean do you know that they're lying in wait with Fields like a courage that no one can ever come close to probably right but yeah I mean the thing I heard maybe like 5 years ago before it was legal in Denver bit longer than that before we got legalization here that you know companies like Philip Morrison in Reno company like that were already buying land in already trademarking names you know for some of the Cannabis that we know today so that when they come into the game and they have ownership on some of the names and some of the brands and inserted in trademarks and stuff like that to that and obviously that to you know Provost sums of cannabis who knows how true that is but I don't doubt some of that I don't need a sneaky Ohio Ohio was they were trying to make it legal but if they're going to make it legal there's only like it was took two companies that were up Jamie from Ohio like for butt crazy you don't ya because you know you had like people that got those licenses or permits or whatever that had no knowledge on on on the Cannabis culture or business how to cultivate and and how to run retail stores or any of that they didn't have any of that knowledge and you know Dale usually give it to an Insider because they know how much money they said to me that that's like if there was just one distribution center right and everybody has to go through that Distribution Center how much money does that Distribution Center make it cuz I got to pay for your s*** to go there and then you know who knows if it will you know if it passes cuz you know as a cultivator what you did so you'll know it'll pass cuz it's clean but you still got to pay that fee every time and it's got to go through them fortunately here in California you know they allowed people to have distribution license is so that there is not one disc consider because that would be a monopoly for sure and that's what they wanted to supposably you know the lobbyists that they put 64 together we're trying to stop it from being a monopoly in corporations coming in and taking over and stuff like that you know so it is such a non corporate drug in on such a non corporate thing that these corporations are trying to get a grip it seems obscene you know it seems it seems disgusting yeah it's it's a little out of place you know I don't know because you think about where it comes from and it's been Outlaw for so long it's kind of like you know the way out alcohol was fruit for so long but it longer than you know you have people trying to come in and throw money into it and it got the you know in some of these guys don't realize it's if not about the money until you got to do the diligence on what this business is you can't cut corners on a cultivation you know you can't cut corners on quality because people you know they're there there's more information out there so people know even if they're not a connoisseur as a consumer you know they can they can read about s*** they can learn about stuff so if you're getting over on them or if you're putting some s*** 40 product out there I mean people are going to know it in and all that money that these guys put into to try to get into the Cannabis business or just throw it into the fire some of them will come out of it you know their partner up with brands that exist in in people that have knowledge but you know it's it's the corporations that come in in the next 5 years has it's going to be it's going to be interesting because I do think that it's setup them to come in the taxes are so high right now for the consumer and for the cultivator for the retail shop that you got to survive this wash right now that's happening in order to still be you know doing business when the corporate structure comes in because please believe they're going to Lobby so that those taxes come down because the margins are not right you know as it gets 40% taxes California if you do 40% in just pull in and get some weed raise should give a f*** some drinks if I could just pull in and get some weed race should give a f*** the comparison to alcohol like how much it cost if you go out for a night for some drinks that cause way more you get high from month depending where you go those</div>

Do something different otherwise you're going to write for sin cos and had a good voice this ship was locked in my voice I was rapping in a voice similar to the one I talkin and all of the Rhymes were good it didn't cut through on the style icon you know on the Beats if you just sounded like no some regular s*** so you know I don't want to be someone's Rider you know I wanted to write for myself so you know there was a guy that we used to listen to coming up with name is rammellzee he was on this record called Wyldstyle and who's in the movie use this rapper who is very obscure but he was artist to you know like a graffiti artist but then also an artist artist you nobody was also a rapper and what he would do is heat wrapping the regular like his talkin boys this is the brother they call the ramp Valley had a deep voice like that and then he would have flipped right in the middle take it uptown to Cypress Hill with the Shotgun by like that and you know we were always freaking out on that he had two Styles so I tried throwing my voice in that sort of similar style and it ended up sticking I didn't really like I didn't think anybody was going to like it I thought they were going to be like fart out of here with that but they ended up liking it and take the first song that came about in that style was song real estate off our first album it's that you know that was where I tried it the first time they liked it so then kill a man came next to not try that song in that style in hand on the pump and it just became a flow after that and I really did not feel it at first I was like f*** I can't believe they got me rapping in this boyfriend and it if it took it took a minute to get used to that you know like doing it live because you know I had attended to be up as as rappers you know that don't know cuz there's no school for this unless you have somebody who done it and they teach you okay this is what the get down this and we didn't have that really it was all Hands On Learning I email through the first few years man I was trying to do the voice and I didn't have you know getting overhyped because the crowd is hype and I start yelling the versus instead like wrapping them like on the record I throw my voice sound my voice would get scratch I'd be sounding like Busta Rhymes and s*** you know me and it took me five years to actually harness how to actually do the shows with this voice and I had to go to this opera singer coach a lot of folks but she she was like to teach you the operatic way of I'm singing which is the diaphragm tighten the stomach take little breaths but those little breaths make your lungs expand you know a lot and it's less projection from your throat and more from the bottom and she taught me that technique and I never went horse again after that I'd like with you know people often compliment me on the you know sounding so close to how the records are there once in awhile where I might get excited and start saying it louder than it might be but I'm always right there and I got it you know I got to give all props to her cuz if she hadn't showed me that technique I'd probably still be yelling and screaming my s*** out now walking up my voice you know see because if you try to keep your breath in in in sustain a long note like that from your chest you won't sustain that no long enough but if you type nothing from your diaphragm yeah if you type and will you breathing from the diaphragm so that's what she taught a lot of singers and it's another method is to cheat the word like pronounce it you know like you're kind of like this it's like with these Mumble rappers do when they they pronounce the word in that kind of Mumble Italy sorta cheat at you know what the word is but they didn't pronounce it all the way so so in other words if she's going to that you were going to sing the line come heat come with me it's it's so at 7 cleaning say gum with me but then the way you would say it is more with the G but it's so tucked in that you here come with me and it's just a cheating way of saying it to get the line a little bit cleaner and in f****** now you know in the brat and she taught me all that s*** and it work for rap I didn't know if it would because I mean it was it's the she primarily taught Singers I'll probably the first rapper that she taught this technique and it's. Matthew find her one of my friends had heard of her you know because that mean in the in the industry meet you know the you become friends with other you know of your peers and stuff like that you know and I know a couple singers and they they they were you know noting my problem is Destino screaming my versus and coming back with the raspy voice so they were like here at lunch to try this person right here this person taught or gave this technique to so-and-so and it was another thing I can't remember but I thought well you know what have I got to lose some mean if it doesn't work it doesn't work but it may be I learned something from it that I could use somewhere else right and Foxy she taught me the warm-up she taught me you know the certain words that you can cheat too too you know for for certain breath purposes cuz the way you pronounce certain things you know sort of add to that and just did the tightening of the diaphragm at like if if I hadn't learned that it would have took me a lot longer to do the shows the way that I can do them now so do you warm up before shows I don't necessarily need to like from the first song on what my voice like gets in like the first few bars it warms up right then and there and and it's not really like singing where I got a sustained notes and stuff like that so I don't have to do those I have to do those same kind of warm ups if I was going to sing some s*** yes I would definitely have to get my email get the pitch right and the throat warmed up to to do those different Nino melodies or whatever the hell but fortunately out of sync</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is there any evidence that there was other species of human beings that existed in the Americas like we're finding in Russia and there's too many of them that are being discovered all over the world now these subspecies human beings in America before and what first drew me into it was Dennis of a K in Siberia I think everybody's heard of these days I think everybody's head of the denisovans well I guess a lot of people haven't but but first of all let's take the Neanderthals for a long time it was held that the Neanderthals were stupid primitive subhumans shambling lacking symbolism the latest scientific evidence with me how to breed with another species they they clearly were human beings but they looked rather different from us and that's why certain populations in the world today still have three to 5% of Neanderthal DNA then in Russia in Dennis of a cave they find a single pinky bone from a little finger and they do the DNA testing on it they're able to get a complete a genome from it and what they discovered is this isn't in the end of Thor isn't an anatomically modern human being this is another human species who they named the denisovans I think that more closely related to neanderthals than they are to anatomically modern humans but that clearly another human species and they also into bread with anatomically modern humans and denisovan DNA survived interesting enough it survives of predominantly in australasia in Papua New Guinea and the monster Exodus book I went to Dennis lava cave had an amazing actually just incredible trip to rush it I hadn't expected it to be like that at all Siberia I mean America is Rost but my God Crossing Siberia this endless rolling plains you know this area where you going to be stopping off at so what I found that I just did so through the internet was it was a local guy called Sergei Croghan who had a little to a business in in in in Siberia in the city of novosibirsk I got in touch with him he found a translator to translate my emails and I said we want to make this journey to Dennis over cave and can you set this up for us and get older and his translator who turned out to be a Russian student who spoke good English joined us and we did this immense journey across Siberia and who actually do know how to survive what are the count and pull down my throat I wasn't it was delicious beautiful place to visit it's another it's another example of a missing chapter in the human story that is beginning to be pieced together it's obvious now that we were not alone. There were multiple other human species who was human enough to interbreed with us and leave for leave DNA was a 2000 some very recently it's a very it's a very recent discovery and I did they let behind art did they leave behind art that have been that they they left behind certain physical objects which are extremely hard to explain one of them is a green stone bracelet bracelet is in the form of a torque which was left with slipped on Sideways onto that is not a full ring and has been drilled through the bracelet I'm from that hole is been possible to reconstruct the dependent was hung then the archaeologist that is then the archaeologists started to take a look in detail at the drill marks on that hole and what they discovered was a huge anomaly that that was drilled with a stable fixed drill and it was drilled at extremely high speed it's at this is thought to be 40 or 50,000 years old there is not supposed to have been any technology and not. It was capable of drilling with a stable fix the drill and yet there it is I'm very to peers so that there are also incredible very fine needles bone needles that the denisovans made very long ones which suggests that they were stitching very heavy stuff together in the suggestion is being where they making skin boats for example to to use to navigate that would explain how they managed to get themselves to Australia which is where the largest amount of denisovan DNA today that's one of those guys one of those needles so that there are indications of strange be out of place technology amongst the denisovans which is 20 thirty thousand years earlier in the human story than it then it should be those kind of needles. Kind of bracelet you could expect to find them in what archaeologists call the Neolithic but to find it in the Paleolithic is very puzzling and I'm very old and it suggested the denisovans would certainly not gambling sub succulents that they were refined creatures can you find out what year discover the denisovans Jamie can you Google that real quick by that 112 Satan mm but I mean imagine that human beings been around for this long here we are in 2019 and within the last decade or so to figure this out discovering new stuff about our self we're discovering that our story is much richer much more textured much more lead than we thought it was it's not a simple story it's a very complicated story and we ourselves are hybrid species we are we are the result of interactions with all kinds of different looking human beings on the end the end result is our cell so it's not just that we carry Neanderthal or denisovan DNA in a sense we are Neanderthals and denisovans three of our ancestry the notion the notion 19-7 1970s the real work that's being done in Dennis of a cave has been done in the 2000s from from 2006/2007 only to anatomically modern humans that we told the story of our past and went where raises the question how much else in the story about pasta is there that we are not aware of that stop being so arrogant so sure of ourselves so competent enough findings that be more tentative let's keep an open mind and see and see where it takes us that's that's the main message that I have from from all of this and I think and I hope that this will be an effect of this book I'm not I'm not kidding myself that the archaeologists are going to jump on board overnight particularly so jump on board overnight particularly so since I'm very critical of American archaeology in this book and I'm critical of it specifically and explicitly because of the dominance of the Clovis first model so long which prevented of the research taking place</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how to say archaeologist like to insult me by calling me a pseudoscientist I can't think of anything more pseudo-scientific than the club is first Doctrine which locked American archaeology for 50 years in a particular framework which we now know was totally wrong nothing good about it at all like a complete mistake what I'm hoping the book will do in the long run is that it will lead to more attention being focused on the Americas this is a very neglected area of the world as far as deep and ancient archeology goes it's the recent history of the Americas has been relatively well study but the deep and ancient history has not being has not been well studied and I think America is going to contain Revelations for us about our story and about our pain that I'm serious when I when I suggest that America is the most plausible and the most likely home base for A Lost Civilization if you're going to propose A Lost Civilization you needs there certain preconditions you need a you can't have it on a small island that's got to be a large landmass with enormous resources and the ability for population to grow into those resources to be to be mobilized and what I suddenly realize u r t l e y i y I started to write this book at old is what the New Evidence is pointing to is that the Americans have been wrongly neglected the tape we have a giant continent extraordinary resources but I just been ruled out of the story of human civilization but once we take account of the fact that there was a giant cataclysm over North America 12800 years ago and once we start looking as I do in America before at the incredible deep in-depth similarities between for example the religious system of ancient Egypt and the religious system of the Mississippi Valley then you realize that you're into a Global mystery here and that the answer to that mystery may not that will be in the old world I'm a very much be in the in the Americas they thought I mentioned Moundville earlier on it's kind of odd that we should find what is essentially the ancient Egyptian religion manifesting in the symbolism of Moundville sent to arrive at transit to the Milky Way the journey along the Milky Way babies are very specific idiosyncratic ideas on what makes bubbly on is Mom deletion. Hold Moundville as a site is about 1000 years old ancient Egypt had already been gone completely from the world for at least six hundred years before Moundville was created the end of ancient Egypt built for this Monday and we're looking at me all day in the in the in the distance a complete circle of Mounds what what is all about we tried the system of ancient Egyptian ideas in Moundville 500 years after ancient Egypt is gone from the world at did the Romans that the Romans were the end of ancient Egypt by 400 ad ancient Egypt is gone Montville doesn't even exist them but six hundred years later it is created and it manifests the entire set of ancient Egyptian ideas clearly it did not get that as a result of direct transmission from ancient Egypt unless they would time travel is the only way I think it could have dumped it is as a result of a legacy passed down from a much earlier civilization that tidbit influenced and affected many different parts of the world and the characteristics about civilization this the shamanistic haunted it the use of Altered States Of Consciousness the focus on those are among the reasons that I would suggest that America is the place that we should be looking I'm the big Mysteries are in the areas that were so devastated at the end of the last ice age up in the north of North America the channel scablands in particular and then the Mist Vale the whole story of the Mississippi Valley yes Moundville is a thousand years old but then you can go back to public point in Louisiana which is 2700 years old you can go to Watson break in Louisiana which is 5500 years old you can go to sites like Conley which a 8000 years old the system keeps on going back and disappearing back into time and I I think the most fruitful new work on exploring the origins of civilization is going to occur you sold the system keeps on going back and disappearing back into time and I I think the most fruitful new work on exploring the origins of civilization is going to occur counterintuitively in the Americas the very last place on Earth that archaeologists have ever thought to look</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> this I guess this is kind of my pet phrase we are a species with amnesia my favorite friends of yours we have forgotten so much more about ourselves than we remember and what the process of history and archaeology should really be about is a process of remembering we shouldn't be imposing our ideas of what we should have been on the past we should allow the past to speak for itself and when it does so it speaks eloquently one of the sites we visited explored for America before was Serpent Mound in Ohio is an amazing 2017 we were there on June 21st 2017 my wife's aunt is a photographer and we acquired a drone for this specific purpose and she flew the Drone up 400 feet above separate mild and we suck it up there watching the sunset and what happens on the summer solstice and you can only see it perfectly with a drone that this pictures of it in the in the book hear what happens on summer solstice you can see it from strepitus pointing directly at the niche in the distant Hills through which the sun sets on the summer solstice on the longest day of the year so it's a it's a sky ground alignment Perfection that is that is taking place there it's a beautiful it's a beautiful thing to see to watch that son majestically sinking down into the reisman see this awesome figure of a sip and gazing directly at it with his Jaws open almost as though it's about to about to swallow the Sun and then we remember that there are other sites around the world which are also aligned to key moments of the of the solar year aligned to the winter solstice for example the Temple of Karnak in Upper Egypt that kilometre-long access targets exactly the rising point of the sun on the winter solstice what are the interesting things about serpent Mounds that's the moment that's the marriage of heaven and that's when sky and Ground United in Majesty at that place but one of the the mysteries of Serpent Mound concerned how old is this mild really you've done much more third third work who attributed to the Adena culture the thing about which goes back to 2,300 years ago or so there's evidence for an earlier Construction Enterprise it looks like the site has been continuously reconstructed and remodeled as we would do with any sacred side if it begins to wear down you remodel it and then you get later organic material being introduced to the site that make it to the impression that the site is only been told what's intriguing about Serpent Mound is sounds on a natural Ridge I'm. Natural Ridge on this is entirely an accident of Heaven on Earth that natural rage the head end of it if you like is naturally oriented to the summer solstice Sunset somebody a long time ago noticed that natural orientation and they decided to monumentalize it here was a place where whispered to Sky the Earth in her own nature looked directly at the place on the horizon where the sun was setting this was a highly significant place this place matted so they've been created Serpent Mound on top of it they memorialized it they turned it into a special special place that human beings have had a hand in making to honor the marriage of Heaven and Earth and what I found researching this book is The Serpent Mound is not alone in that respect a lot of people are puzzled by Stonehenge in England is built on Salisbury Plain and there are two kinds of big megaliths at Stonehenge one of them are called sausans and the other are called the blue stones the blue stones we know for sure we're both alone way they were brought from Wales to Stonehenge distance of about a hundred and fifty miles are found in abundance on a place called The Marlborough Downs which is about 20 miles from Stonehenge but until they recently it was thought they would know sausans on Salisbury Plain a toy an archaeologist couldn't understand why Stonehenge wasn't built on the Marlborough Downs whether whether it's big sauce and Sons are 20-30 times word available locally and didn't have to be brought there very recent research 2018 research has provided the answer the two of those saracens we're naturally in position all the time at Stonehenge and they are soft Sandstone 16 on the heel stone and if you stand behind sauce and stone 16 and look at the heel stone at dawn on the summer did you see the sun rising in direct alignment with the view and the heel stone is like the sight on the barrel of a rifle targeting the Sun that was there naturally Earth was speaking to Sky the ancient sword that they decided this was sacred they went to huge lengths to bring the sauces the rest of the sausage From the Mob redounds to create the Big Stone Circle at Stonehenge and meant to put the blue stones inside it but initially what they were celebrating was a natural Union and that brings us to the notion of As Above So Below that we are connected to the cosmos that it is that it is part of our heritage we in modern cities forget the cosmos exist we have all kinds of tech that can look at astronomy astronomy programs done is to realize how vital. Connection is I'm to memorialize it time to celebrate it and to draw our attention to the intimate connection between grants, yeah light pollution sort of fuels are infantile existence in a lot of ways right because it doesn't constantly remind us that were part of this great thing connection is memorialize it celebrated and to draw our attention to the intimate connection between grants light pollution sort of fuels are infantile existence in a lot of ways right because it doesn't constantly remind us that were part of this great thing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you have anything in this book about the olmecs no not really mentioned I mentioned them briefly I explored the Olmec mystery in considerable depth of Central America everybody's heard about the Aztecs everybody's heard about the Maya but before the Aztecs time before the Maya that were a culture who are referred to as the olmecs again we don't know what they called themselves that's what the Aztecs called them they called them the olmecs that means the rubbish people because they that rubber producing area of Mexico they worked in giant megalithic constructions that what the most times for is these huge carved human heads which can be on a scale of up to 20 to 25 tons in weight curious pictures which have been interpreted variously as Polynesian African don't look like classic Native American features you better but one of the things one of the things I've realized is that there is no classic Native American features that that made Native Americans are a very have a very complex genetic story with very many different elements brought into it and we shouldn't be necessarily surprised by the supposedly known Native American look bad they're wearing nobody knows because no physical example of such a helmet has ever been found just like no physical example of an Egyptian pharaohs helmet round has it has ever been found all we see is the stone the stone reproductions of them who the University where these helmets and they all day they pretty much all wear these helmets in in in in the Olmec stone work that's another fascinating figure from La Venta 101 of the Olmec sites which is the earliest ever in of a plumed or feathered serpent The Feathered Serpent of the famous icon in Central America Quetzalcoatl who's the the God of Peace the bringer of civilization who is associated for example with the famous pyramid of kukulcan which is just another name for Quetzalcoatl at Chichen Itza where on the Spring Equinox affect boiling down the stairway and joining with the cop head of the serpent event about the earliest image of a plumed serpent in the Americas and sitting in the middle of it and I made a big deal out of this cuz I think it is a big deal in magicians of the Gods sitting in the middle of it is this human cigarette who's holding this strange bag in his hand and it's just a fact that those identical bags are found in ancient Sumer in the hands of individuals who were considered to be civilization bring us and they also show up on pillar 43 at Gobekli Tepe I called a man bags and in that case at Gobekli Tepe we know they're at least 11600 years old so I wonder if we looking at a soda Badge of office of a group of symbolizes who traveled around the world trying to bring back to life for that I have another question is did the olmecs did you you were talking about the genetics of these people that live in Native Americans that if they vary widely but the olmecs seem to have very similar features the thick lips get did noses why do we think that is well this is a curious mystery that is not unconnected to the genetic mystery it's be known by archaeologists for quite a long time that there are skulls in parts of Brazil which appear to show very strongly Polynesian or African features very much like the features that we see on the on the Olmec heads and the number of archaeologist who got into trouble with that colleagues for this have used that to argue many years ago 30-40 years ago that that the settlement story of the Americas is much more complicated than we've you know them realized I'm and what the what the DNA is doing is it's telling us that that was something really weird happened happened with settlement they you see what happened with those African or Polynesian looking skulls was that they were tested for DNA when DNA technology was not as advanced as it is today and what that DNA showed was that they were more closely related to Modern Native American then they ought to any other people in the world so the notion that there was some connection with Polynesia or Africa was dismissed but now that we have very dense of an australasia in genetic signal or Australian Aborigines Papua New Guinea melanesians with those kind of features not we have the genetic I stood me did the olmecs of it's always been such a strange image the large heads with no helmets on them and how did they University look like that Amanda all the all of the teachers are very very similar very similar always with the helmet almost always relation of Central America that they create structures on a massive scale that you can see connections between them and the later the light to Maya the whole mystery of the Mayan calendar was clearly inherited from the olmecs it wasn't something the Maya made up the olmecs use that same symbolism so the Mayan calendar is actually an Olmec calendar and if we been consider the possibility that the olmecs may just be the latest that the earliest surviving manifestation of my calendar it could go back much further than that the olmecs it wasn't something the Maya made up the olmecs use that same symbolism so the Mayan calendar is actually an Olmec calendar and if we been consider the possibility that the olmecs may just be the latest that the earliest surviving manifestation of a calendar it could go back much further than that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you plan on having any debates with people that opposed these ideas while it was interesting on your other Shoujo to to have the debate that involved Michael Shermer who's the editor of the skeptic magazine some colleague of his who came in online who I got a bit annoyed with and myself and my great friend and colleague the genius Randall Carlson I thought that was a very useful debate I felt that is pus supposed to be the first time that those of us on the alternative side of the argument about history where we're given an opportunity we need to put our evidence forward and I'm to confront so cold Skeptics while it's so cold that's what he calls himself mainstream archaeology came out of that looking really good I think it came out of that looking while they're ignorant and uninformed and a man like Michael Shermer who is a professional skeptic cannot begin to match the knowledge of a man like Randall Carlson who has devoted his whole life to walking the Walk of the geology of the end of the ice age in in in North America and that showed on the on the on that debates I think the debate was worth doing it showed that the alternative side isn't just wishy-washy stuff out there on the fringes of things that there are those of us working in this field will using really solid information on who are who are project is to rewrite history and we're not going to do that with flight information it has to be solid information I think we have the opportunity on your show to to say that. That's solid information is there I'm not claiming it was a complete victory for the alternative site 2 and they were constructed aspects about the Baton Rouge right which I appreciate it I'd like to see much more engagement and much more positive approach I wish the Skeptics welcome to the skepticism but I wish they'd be less hateful less less full of division less less despising for the so defensive with their ideas and and so and so defensive with their ideas when the possibility is there for for a constructive debate you know what's interesting to me is that as evidence piles up in seems to be continuing to pile up as more like the least impact sites and more of this ancient civilization material gets on Earth it's almost insurmountable vines that has being in control of people's thinking for a very long time suddenly falls apart and it doesn't fall apart suddenly what happens is that there's an accumulation of evidence which bat model cannot explain that Paradigm cannot explain it seems like a great Paradigm at one point but then it doesn't explain this and then it doesn't explain light like the Paradigm that says that megalithic architecture is only 6000 years old in that V megalithic architecture was in Moulton explain the massive megalithic site of Quebec Dean turkey 5,500 years before that it's evidence like that the slow accumulation of evidence that the existing system cannot explain that eventual point no matter how strongly The Advocates of the existing system hold on to it no matter how determined they are in that defense no matter what dirty tricks they may choose to deployed to undermine their opponents sooner or later the evidence overwhelms them and the Paradigm goes down and you have a new way of thinking and that is that is the story science and it is a story that I think I think we're at the Tipping Point in our understanding of the past of the human species I am not saying that I am 100% right I believe that what what I'm doing that's worthwhile is I'm asking questions about the parts that haven't been often enough I'm putting archaeologist on the spot and I'm demanding that they explain themselves I don't I don't claim that I'm right I'm offering an alternative Theory and my objective is to get people to think for themselves to think about this stuff kept the voice of authority as the as the sole medium of truth that's that's what I tried to do have you had any archaeologist review any of this work and change their opinions know and now I haven't but what I what I have found I found it interesting me during the research trips for America before is a younger generation of archaeologists who are in the field and they are quite different from the older generation of archaeologist who are running the whole scene 25 years ago or so now we have a very different younger generation and I'm a generation that has been exposed to open-minded thinking that has being exposed to the internet that itself as part of the general pattern of the younger generation is suspicious of authority I'm meeting young archaeologist on site for example I met a couple of a really amazing young minds on a slight cold Black Water draw wanted to Clovis sites did the Young archaeologist I met their we're incredibly open-minded and I'm really willing to consider extraordinary possibilities about the past and privately admitted to me that they read my books that's where I get the hope I get the Hope in this Young Generation that is growing up with the internet that does understand that there's a lot more out there than just what they're being taught in schools did they read my books well that's where I get the hope I get the Hope in this Young Generation that is growing up with the internet that does understand that there's a lot more out there than just what they're being taught in schools</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and our fears that you were just discussing earlier about how soft we are in comparison to the Past civilizations in terms of like our ability to live off the land that's one aspect that bothers me but one of the big ones that bothers me is the fact that everything is digital information is stored on hard drives you bet and if that goes down there's not much left do you have paper books and a few thousands a years imagine what will be like we would lose all of our advancement well I can I can speak to this sat at a personal level there was a time when I was an excellent Matt Reading III I could navigate anywhere with with maps my wife's aunt and I did Hugh Jenny's in Mexico back in the early 1990s in really cheap high cars with maps and we found our way everywhere without any problem today I can hardly use a map the skill of using a map has elapsed tell me why because of GPS GPS technology has come along and it's it's always tells me where I am and being a bit lazy I just accept that that technology but then I had close to us myself it's just the other day supposing GPS they won't know where they're going and it's and it's true with digital dots are the digital digital down two unlike unlike print daughter is very fragile and requires programs in order to access and interpret its that a much more complicated than simply cracking the code of a lost language case of like what Robert schoch describe the coronal mass ejection or something cutting out all the satellites that preparation is not being made for the risk of another Cosmic impact and a gain of a point that I'd like to make about this is that we are at we are in a sense in a place where history can repeat itself that there are certain Cycles at work the work on the comet impact 12800 years ago has very clearly and specifically identified the Deborah trailer. Comments about Deborah Trail is the taurid meteor stream and it's called the taurid meteor stream because it appears to emanate from the region of the sky in which the constellation of Taurus sets it doesn't it's within our solar system is an optical illusion complexion it is 30 million kilometers wide what you had was an original comment that might have been a hundred to two hundred kilometers in diameter a small Moon which fragmented and broke up into multiple multiple parts and those parts began to spread out along the whole orbit of the taurid meteor stream and to widen the whole thing white and so it's like a giant chew with debris and the evidence in the argument is that 12800 years ago several large bits debris fell out of the taurid meteor stream I'd impacted with the Earth the problem is that the taurid meteor stream still exists and our planets still passes through it twice a year and those passages take place in June and in November and each passage takes 12 and a half days on the same group of scientists who are who are looking at the evidence for the impacts 12800 years ago are deeply concerned that we may face future impact from the Torah but there are still large objects up there this is not Theory this is a fact that a comet up their cold, thankee which is part of the taurid meteor stream it's a large fragment of the original giant Comet Comet and Cupid has a diameter of I don't know 5 or 5 or 6 km 19 recognize huge objects within 200 asteroids within the taurid meteor stream of a diameter of a kilometer or more which would have catastrophic if they hit the earth and responsible astronomers regard the taurid meteor stream as the greatest Collision hasn't facing mankind at the present time and it's not something that we need to fall into despair about because it's perfectly within the level are our technology to do something about it extract minerals we can bring them back to their the same technology would allow you to move asteroids or comets fragments you don't want to blow them up with a nuke that would be really bad idea that would that would attend one large object into multiple smaller objects which would be very difficult to predict them and move them out of a dangerous dangerous turn the evidence is in the next 30 years we are going to be passing through dangerous filaments of the taurid meteor stream and if we were smart we would be devoting some resources to protecting our Cosmic environment just as with their many issues that we need to devote resources to unfortunately the one that's most attractive to our politicians at the moment is Warfare we devote Limitless resources to Technologies of mass destruction that there really is no end to the amount that we're prepared FanDuel not in terms of our so-called security we feel somehow we making ourselves more secure by having these incredible weapons and spending trillions of dollars on them but the cosmos doesn't give a f*** about any of that the cosmos is out there with these with these giant giant objects which have a far greater explosive power than all the nuclear weapons stored on Earth at the present time they're coming in 1994 total conflated explosive power of 300 gigaton if you took the entire nuclear arsenal of the world today and blew it all up at once it with you 6.4 gigatons so these objects are not producing catastrophic results on the scale that time and money on weapons of mass destruction on a bit more on looking after this beautiful garden that we cool the Earth and that is our home and it will be the home of our children and children children I'm a grandfather now I feel passionately about this we need to look off to this planet it's our responsibility as a human species to do so I'm one of the challenges is not the only challenge there are many many other challenges one of the challenges his pay attention to our Cosmic environment and to realize that the cosmos can intervene cataclysmically in the human story and that the taurid meteor stream in particular may have been a Hidden Hand in human history that they may have been other impacts in the last 13 that affect have affected and changed the course of Humanity on this Earth the Ancients were very good at paying attention to the sky we ourselves have amazing Tech to study the sky but for some reason weird ignoring this problem of cosmic in tights and that incredibly irresponsible because as I said a moment ago it is a solvable problem it is within the limits of our technology it would require a global Cooperative effort to sweep our Cosmic environment clean but it could be. I'm a side product of that Global Corporation might be a friendlier more nurturing more loving more positive human Community it is very odd that we have this infantile nature even has grown adults and world leaders that we don't we do like to ignore imminent danger as long as it hasn't affected Us in the past now there's no real moment we can point to other than tunguska in Uno photographic history modern history take pictures of thing I had a gun and if I can if I can pull as you on that very point the evidence is compelling but the tunguska event was an object until out at the taurid meteor stream that happened at the peak of the betta torrids in June 1908 but it is extremely likely that. Tunguska object came from the taurid meteor stream because we were passing through the taurid meteor stream it exactly that time and what the tunguska object is estimated to be between 60 and 190 m Diamond Lumber to scale object it's it it says it's it's big but it's not that big it doesn't even hit the earth it it's an ad best it explodes in the sky above fortunately an uninhabited area of Siberia but the devastation is huge it wasn't even noticed for some years afterwards until scientific teams went in and studied the area and discovered that 80 million trees across 2000 square kilometers and to put that in context 2000 square kilometers is the size of London so anybody who knows London is aware that there's a Ring Road around London called the M25 if that are best at taken place over Central London everything of London out as far as the M25 would have been gone completely is that what it looks like today is revealed the extent of this of this stupid not to pay a bit more attention to this especially when we have the tech to actually do something about it we have that nature the wood when it comes to climate change denial denial of the role of cataclysms in the human story there is even a word for that in science and it's cooled uniformitarianism as we see it in the world today is how things have always be so if we don't see cataclysms today and then not playing a major part in our story today then that weren't cataclysms and they didn't play a major part in our story in the past that's why I'll do it before the time of human beings when the evidence that the dinosaurs were made extinct by a comet or an asteroid first came out Lewis and Walter Alvarez a father to son team who were behind that sign where ridiculed Monday absolutely absurd of course no Cosmic event could have made the dinosaurs extinct they spent 10 years taking that ridicule until they found the crater in the Gulf of Mexico since then the whole scientific Community has accepted that the course of Life on this planet was radically changed by a cosmic impact you know I like to joke about it but it was a cosmic impact that was big enough literally to 10 dinosaurs into chickens because that's what hepatitis or line is you know the birds at the same time skulking in those primeval forests is this little mammal and it looks a bit like a shrew 65 million years ago going nowhere the Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth been the cosmo sent to them and the bottom line is we would not be here. species would not be here we would not be having this conversation if the dinosaurs have not been made extinct 65 million years ago so these are will changing events in my argument is that such a oil changing event occurred between 12800 and 11600 years ago and it's high time we paid more attention to it not be here we would not be having this conversation if the dinosaurs have not been made extinct 65 million years ago so these are will changing events in my argument is that such a oil changing event occurred between 12800 and 11600 years ago and it's high time we paid more attention to it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> civilization impulse down I deploy a concept in this book that I actually got from Richard Dawkins Richard Richard Dawkins is the author of the book called The Selfish Gene and he's not one of my favorite people because he's at he's a materialist reductionist and he doesn't believe in spirits or or any Mystery of Life that we just accidents of chemistry and biology would be enough but he has an excellent out because I'm sad that he's had that he's had a stroke so he has a good excuse for not for not doing that but he's a clever man on one of his Concepts if he's introduced into human culture is the concept of the meme where all the familiar with that wear jeans are physical reproductive mechanisms they reproduce themselves down the generations they replicate they multiply that passed on from one individual to another memes are cultural object cultural ideas that are passed on unreplicated at what I see right across the Americas and right across the old well as well is a set of memes that involved the sky that involve the ground that involve geometry that involve Notions of Life off to death I think the only way to explain these is that they have been inherited from an earlier culture that was in some way connected with the ancestors of all of these all of these cultures I think that's what we're looking at in the arms and we're looking at a meme which was delivered recreated once you mobilize a population to start creating huge geometrical structure you are also facilitating many other possibilities that an organized population allows I think that's what happened at Gobekli Tepe I think that's why they created the megalithic site there to mobilize the local population of hunter-gatherers to give them a project to do to engage them and in the process of engaging them to teach them the skills of Agriculture which word which which are fundamental to to any concept of civilization and it's weird the way I could coach you just suddenly appears in in Gobekli Tepe on this huge agricultural mysteries in the Amazon as well may I share a couple of police I would like to see it's pitiful T3 in the end in enclosure d c is there a online available all okay here we go yeah there's no you have to go about that Jamie just a little bit higher stop it in many different cultures and tends to be associated with something interpretation of those it's an Aztec god right and he's an Aztec is an Aztec god but but the Aztecs I quieten from earlier coaches the very fact that an image of the plumed serpent in given such priority in Olmec culture tells us that that system of ideas with present during all night time which takes us back at least to 1500 BC probably quite a bit earlier than that wears the Aztecs 1580 so there's three thousand years through all of those cultures and the Mayans had a name for Tazewell who Khan and what do you think that plumed serpent was I think he's very clear from from the accounts that have survived that what he's associated with a two things and in particular one of them he's a God of Peace he's not a war God and the and the other thing that he's primarily about is giving the gift to civilization this is what you human beings need to know but to move on to the next level Baptist that is the function and the role of Quetzalcoatl and it's there are very similar we could refer to the Mississippi lysing Heroes who are found in other cultures and other locations or Cyrus in Egypt plays that role as a bringer of civilization that's hardly a culture in the ancient world that doesn't remember a time fall back in remote prehistory when some kind of Supernaturals or advance human beings and I prefer the latter that some kind of advanced human beings were involved in a project to disseminate civilization I mentioned the Tucano in the Amazon who who are big drinkers of Ayahuasca Chicano have a fascinating origin myth they say that they are on state specifically that their ancestors were brought to the Amazon they were brought to the Amazon by a group of Naturals who included the daughter of the sun on an individual called the Helmsman who steered the serpent canoe in which the second mission in the Amazon was was performed in what these so-called Supernaturals did was they brought the ancestors of Dacono to the Amazon and they showed them the best places to settle the best places where they where they might find hunting the best places where they might Creek Village the best places for agriculture and then they left but they left them behind one gift and that gift was buy one wow that's the story of the origin at the Vatican up and it sounds like to me rather like the other side of the story about DNA signal in the Amazon but a group of people would deliberately settled in the Amazon by human beings who they chose to regard as a supernatural that's what makes sense to me rather like the other side of the story of that DNA signal in the Amazon but a group of people would deliberately settled in the Amazon by human beings who they chose to regard as a supernatural that's what makes sense to me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when they found that ancient Greek computer thing on what it what is that called an anti Sierra mechanisms navigational skill that is now attracts the movements of the planets the passage of time and figure out where you are it's it's some kind of navigational device is not fully understood how old is that I think that goes back to Greek times I'm guessing here because Greek times are not of great interest to me but I'm thinking around about 500 BC so at least 2,000 years old 2000 plus and we know that there had to be more than one of these things yes not creating this gear and called Machinery but that's reflected the power was not a re-creation Recreation that's a secret technology is very odd that very few of these have been found and it may be that ship owners and Navigators in Greek times were extremely careful about who they share this technology way in our world today then we must consider what's behind it what what led to that is that just the latest manifestation of something that that goes much more deeply back into human human culture and I think that is I think my main messages that we have a so-far Untold backstory that we concentrating entirely on the front story on the backstory is missing Dirty Laundry missing from the picture and what I've tried to do is to Philly and bits of the Back store</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that that is really interesting breakdown that maybe that is one of the big mistakes were making our culture when people point to the problems that we have in this country one of the problems we have is our inability to connect with each other or to recognize that we're all sharing this space and time together instead wanting to uphold our own religious or ideological ideas as being the only one way to get going the only one way to get through and one of the things that I've found these psychedelic experiences it it it really ideologies seemed if not Preposterous at the very least insignificant in comparison to human experiences absolutely experience of camaraderie and friendship and and love it did that you realize I do this is what support this is what it was or when is really not enforcing your ideas or pushing them on other people and forcing people to behave the way you behaved their dead loved I'm think about religious ideas would cause so much division so much so much hatred so much fear so much suspicion in the world today is it really what we want to do is human beings simply to accept a package of ideas that were believed in by our ancestors to accept them hold without question as absolute fact which we regard to such a willing to be deeply unpleasant to people who primarily religiously-motivated terrorist event that happens it happens all over the world people feel so convinced that the inherited package of ideas that they had nothing to do with creating and that they have never questioned that so convinced that those ideas are right that in extreme cases they're actually prepared to kill other human beings who hold different ideas are they so insecure in their own in their own beliefs that that then prepare to go to that level of actually murdering another human being threatened by the other beliefs that other human beings halt so it's an abnegation of our responsibility as human beings we should be questioning things we should not be accepting packages of ideas impact fully formed and using them to drive the way we behave towards one another that was part of the human story but we need to move on from that time it's very dangerous situation in a very complex more than weld with billions of human beings on the planet have these kind of energies be generated where certain groups of people are saying we are absolutely right and you are up to Bronx we are superior you are interior this is a very very dangerous path that we that we all know and it needs to be changed personally I know this is not a comment that will go down well with many people but I am strongly opposed to nationalism I don't I don't see any virtue in nationalism it is an accident of birth which nation you were born in it was nothing that you did for your own merits you didn't earn that you were born by accident in in a particular Nation why should we automatically feel the other people who were born by accident in that particular Nation have something special in coming with us and that we together are a group to a much more important than other groups of people I've been privileged to spend my life traveling around the world living with communities all over over the world and strongly it is that we are all one family that humans are intimately connected to the remotest area of the Amazon can find the same hopes the same fears the same dreams that we have an industrialized cities shared by the hunter-gatherers in the in in the middle of the Amazon so our similarities as human beings and what we share in common. The emotional level in the level of love and the level of heart are far more important than our differences that are defined by the nation of the political group in which we wish we grew up in the morning when I say I'm against nationalism I need also to make clear that does not mean and I hope I'm not taking out the contact by others will listen to this that does not mean I'm in favor of world government I detest governments that's another thing we need to grow out of we don't need governments anymore if we have them they should have a very minimal role in our society I think it's possible for the human race to relate as one family without leaders and government or exploiting the worst aspects of our character the lowest common denominator of our society deliberately encouraging season suspicions what responsible leaders should be doing is encouraging love and unity I'm a failure to do that in my view disqualifies them from the leadership role entirely and that's why I've often said I would not I would like to see a situation in which no head of state can be appointed to that position unless he or she has first have 12 seconds by Watsky that would be the condition don't even bother applying for the job haven't done and we have to be there while you have it now we have to be we want to see that you're drinking every dropped and we want an experienced Shaman present guide you through the through the Jenny and I suspect that would be a transformative experience for many of our political class and that they would start to question why they do what they do why they exploit fears in order to magnify their own position they thought the question that I'm to wonder about a different destiny transformative experience for many of our political class and that they would start to question why they do what they do why they exploit fears in order to magnify their own position they start to question that I'm to wonder about a different Destiny feedback about the dream I guess it's not going to happen is very very very well said</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think that people can develop these patterns of behavior that are destructive with anything whether it's with alcohol or cannabis or do you know Gatsby Sachs or anyting people get to getting rotz you know it doesn't mean that the Cannabis is badass means that you are on a bad mental path yes you know exactly yeah we need no time that responsibility over to governmental institutions especially when it can send something as intimate and personal as I'll Consciousness my view is the ancient world had the right attitude to this kind of thing the modern world does not and that we can sit down and learn a lot from the ancient world a lot of people ask me what you've been arguing that there's a lost that's being A Lost Civilization in the in the in the human story but what's on a civilization do you think it was one of the things I think is it was a civilization that use psychedelics I think it was a civilization that emerged from Shamanism but did not stay at the hunter-gatherer stage but that took the essence of shamanism an integrated it into a very different kind of civilization from our own things in different ways lot of archaeologists have said to me but we don't find any plastic bottles from the Ice Age that means there was no Advanced civilization during the night on maybe an advanced civilization I've decided never to get involved in plastic in the first place maybe they would have been a clear choice not to make plastic maybe they did things in completely different ways maybe they cultivated powers of the human mind that we dismiss and regard us so completely completely unimportant you know woo woo temperature in the Great Pyramid are 5 foot of Chambers and these Chambers are roosting floored with granite beams that weigh about 70 tons each and their hundreds of them and these 70-ton Granite beam switch to put in contacts a 70 ton beam is equivalent in weight 235 large SUV's the 70-ton granite beams have been elevated to a height of more than 350 feet above the ground and carefully and precisely in position it is very hard for archaeologist to explain how that was done using purely leverage and mechanical advantage you can say or perhaps they build the ramp and and at hold the stones up the ramp then you have to confront basic laws of physics you can't hold us a stone weighing tens of tons of a slope that exceeds 10° then you start doing the calculation how long a ramp do I need with a 10 degree slope 350 feet above the ground begins to seem like maybe the idea that they regard as observed namely that psychic powers were cultivated by ancient civilizations that they could use powers of the human mind that we have allowed to lapse that idea deserves for the consideration we have gone down a path of Leverage and mechanical advantage we used to rely on machines but we hear anecdotal reports of people who have telekinetic Powers who can move things with their minds of people who have telepathic powers on automatic reaction is to just dismiss all of that because science says it's impossible BBB because science regards Consciousness as local to the brain and doesn't see how it can exert itself outside of that but maybe we should open up to those possibilities that we dealing with a very different kind of culture that used techniques that we have a lot to laugh and maybe we could wake those techniques up a game maybe the ability of human beings to do almost superhuman things is resident within all of us but sleeping well it's pure speculation that they use some sort of a telekinetic power but but it's absolute construction just a modern accepted construction dates of the Great Pyramid that's more than 5,000 years ago or close to 5,000 years ago what they had done was leave behind something that was so stupendous so monstrously impressive that it would transcend time that you would have to look at it even thousands and thousands of years later and say hey like you dissed this defies conventional explanation this is not a simple and I've seen some of the conventional explanations of the construction the pyramid and they conveniently neglect those chambers above the king's chamber they did a big ardovini Lena Glock Tomatoes massive Stones yeah and it's because it's it's one of those things are the chambers about the above about the king's Chambers and each one of those floors is consist of a row of 70 tons of granite blocks better be raised 350 feet above the ground and only that but brought from Aswan in the south of Egypt 500 kilometers south of the south of the Great Pyramid so I am just completely fascinated by the Ice Age one shot to go back and see what it was like in someplace you wouldn't go to the construction of the Great Pyramids I think right now where I go is 12800 years ago in the beginning of the younger dryas just to see because I think that's where the whole human story changes I think that's why we change tracks from one pot to another path and following those cataclysmic events of the younger dryas between 12800 and 11600 years ago following those the signs of civilization that we see Imaging the beginnings of civilization there a restarting of civilization that had existed before the cataclysm and for that reason I would I would like to be present during that cataclysmic event to satisfy myself anymore huge climate changes this was a cataclysm by any stubs where the argument still goes on is what caused the what caused the cataclysm I vote strongly for commit multiple fragments of a comet hitting the North American ice cap and hitting Greenland as well but there are other researchers in the field like my colleague robot shakou thinks that the sun is more involved this is this is very very healthy that they should we should be approaching this problem for many different perspectives I'm trying to figure out what the f*** is this jewelry event that occurs at a pivotal moment in the human Story the end of the Stone Age the beginning of the means of lithic the end of the Ice Age the beginning of the current age of the Earth and suddenly we see the signs of civilization appearing and in places like go back to Tempe those signs already include highly sophisticated knowledge and that's why I feel we really need to investigate the Amazon there are there are three places in the world which are really lacking in the investigation right now one is the Amazon Prime and a half million square kilometers very little archeology tab another is the Sahara Desert the Sahara Desert tough place to work I can understand why there's little archaeology down there but the Sahara Desert was green during the Ice Age and had a complete different climate regime we should consider the possibility that missing parts of the human story Pebble why would we spend the money on Marine archaeology much better to spend it on looking for shipwrecks rather than looking for signs of A Lost Civilization because we archaeologists know there was no loss of life station so that's the argument for the resources there and I'm the same the same with the Amazon in the same with the with with the Sahara desert places in the very places in the world that those amongst us who are charged with the responsibility of interpreting the past have not look that are the very prices we should be looking at the resources that are the same the same with the Amazon in the same with the with with the Sahara desert places in the very places in the world that those amongst us who are charged with the responsibility of interpreting the past have not looked at are the very prices we should be looking at</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I had a thought once while I was under the influence and it was a thought that one day computational Powers will reach a point where they will be able to take into consideration all of the objects on Earth and what we know about the history and vividly recreate the past through through computation to the point where you could actually know who did what when people did things and that that mean I don't even know if this physical today certainly not be possible but with the exponential increase in computational power and technology and Innovation that one day will reach a point where you'll be able to watch you'll be able to see what happened and they'll be able to recreate what happened exactly and it disappeared something that would be me it's impossible for us to imagine that someone would be able to do that right now yeah but that one day with technology as it gets more and more advanced and we will reach some sort of a some Innovation or some sort of an invention that will allow us to go back and see literally see what what happened how things were done Tech Technologies is changing our whole understanding of the past and what you're envisaging is perfectly possible we will we will come to a time if we don't if we don't destroy ourselves we will come to a time where our cleverness and our techniques will allow a much wider opening up of the past then that's presently happened but it is already happening one of the areas of science that I go into in America before is genetics and DNA of science that was not much informing archaeology until about the 1990s but since the 2000 has become very important in archaeology because LG has been developed where ancient DNA can be extracted and tested than you can actually genotype an entire individual from DNA that maybe 15-20 thousand twenty thousand years old this new technology of genome sequencing DNA is another factor that is Raising huge question marks over the past of the Americas and one of the issues I go into in this book is the presents in the Amazon rainforest of a very specific clearly identifiable pattern of DNA which is only found in one other place in the world about his in australasia in Papua New Guinea and amongst Australian Aborigines is australasia DNA little remains are rare it has been found in ancient skeletal remains that are close to eleven thousand years old and they have this DNA signal as being in the Amazon for at least eleven thousand years the geneticists think that it came today I was enjoying the last ice age is a huge mystery because of the Americas is supposed to have occurred from Siberia across the Bering Straits down through that ice-free Corridor into North America. South America and Central America and finally into South America if that was the whole story then we would find this DNA signal in North America and in Central America we would not find it only in the Amazon my talk to some of the leading geneticists about this specifically professor at the University of major studies of ancient DNA what do you make of this DNA in India Amazon then and he said honestly we don't have a proper explanation for it at the moment but what he did say is that the most parsimonious explanation he is not specific word the most parsimonious explanation is that a group of people during the Ice Age crossed the Pacific Ocean I'm settled out and ended up in South America and settled in the Amazon and brought that DNA with them that would account perfectly for the DNA. most parsimonious explanation what that scientist saying is he likes that explanation but it's a simple direct clear explanation of the DNA mystery but then he added however it doesn't make practical sense and I asked him why doesn't it make practical sense and he said because he tell me that no human population was capable of crossing the Pacific Ocean during the ice age at which point it was not sure if I meant to say do you really trust the archaeologists and he said well in science we do trust the work of other sign if we don't read a question that we don't really investigated that's their side of the best out of the business and my view is that that's it it is rather than rather than accept rather than taking this weird anomalous australasia DNA signal in the in in the in the heart of the Amazon as something to be explained away and there's something to be for it to be tonight but it could be connected to a voyage across the Pacific Ocean maybe it's most compelling evidence that voyages were taking a place across the Pacific Ocean during the Ice Age maybe we should be opening up that whole issue for exploration and again I think I lost A Lost Civilization is the best dancer and that near the end of the Ice Age when when the younger dryas cataclysm unfolds it's not an overnight thing it's very bad 12800 years ago has about 1,200 years apart I don't think the civilization went down in a single day and night I think they were Savannah I think bits of it when left I think that project was to restart civilization and I suggest very strongly that where they try to mount that project was a month the hunter-gatherers who coexisted in the world with them at that time we ourselves are an advanced civilization at least that's what we told ourselves and we coexist in the world with hunter-gatherers running hunter-gatherers there are tribes in the Amazon that are on contacted and that we that we don't know that even exist if he on the level of the younger dryas where to occur today I don't think that our civilization would make it through we are the spoiled Children of the Earth we are just used to having everything laid on you know the supermarket shelves are groaning with with food we can get food Levittown homes with roofs ever had with shelters with everything is taken for granted I guess you are an exception but very few people in modern Western culture know how to survive they don't have survival skills they don't know how to hunt they don't know how together they don't know how to grow crops because they've handed that responsibility over to others we live in a society the tiny segmented and specialize in different people specialize in different things but nobody has the boss General survival skill that a hunter-gatherer has so in a global Catholic actually I first counter-intuitively the people who would survive it would be done together has an advanced civilization would be smart if they were survivors to seek Refuge among them together has to do to make that the place where they might try to start restart That civilization that's why I think that this Source chalazion DNA signal in the Amazon may be planted the evidence for a sort of Outreach effort that was being made by A Lost Civilization seeing the disaster coming down on it and realizing that something new not the place where they might try to start restart That civilization that's why I think that this australasian DNA signal in the Amazon maybe part of the evidence for a sort of Outreach effort that was being made by Lost Civilization seeing the disaster coming down on it and realizing that something needed to be done</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what is fascinating to me that the geneticists would rely on the archaeologist being that the geneticists have the actual DNA they can examine where the archaeologists are piecing things together that'll tiny bits of information over the entire landscape and then you consider how much information they don't have access to that's in the ground it's a it's a it's a it's an attempt to interpret the past based on rather flimsy and limited evidence and what you find in that interpretation is that the preconceptions of the individuals involved are being imposed upon the evidence which then turns out to support their preconceptions and that's not the scientific way of doing things the scientific way of doing things is testing testing hypotheses conclusions that on the further Evidence that's that's my view archaeology has been as being much too rigid and that's a climate of fear in archaeology I don't mean to pick particularly just here I think this is generally true across other disciplines as well as academics are driven by the need to publish research papers that's what they build their careers on if they can get a paper on their bit of research published in nature are the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences excetera that's good for that careers but then you confront The Gatekeepers in those Publications who regard any ocul article idea that is not part of the mainstream accepted consensus with great suspicion that most most reluctant to to enough to publish to publish that information now what is the mainstream well do the Braves and the great seafaring Adventure that is accepted by Archaeology is called the Polynesian expansion and it's a remarkable story about a car is roughly 3,000 to 3500 years ago had those Polynesians were amazing ocean Navigators they could make it across distances of thousands of kilometers pinpoint accuracy Easter Island is 2,000 miles from the coast of South America it's 2000 miles from the nearest other Island which is Tahiti it's just a little speck in the middle of the ocean by the Polynesians found it and the South are at a pH of Balto reproductively viable population their voyages back and forth but that was 3000 3500 years ago that was not 12800 years ago and this is this is where archaeology's adamant position that Imaging was begun by the Polynesians that there was no major ocean voyages before that I think needs to be strongly questions than it needs to be strongly questioned in the light of this DNA evidence from the Amazon rather than rejecting the evidence and temp should be made to consider what that might mean that the Egyptians had boats and they're so what it mean if there were both 4,500 years ago Hotel just wouldn't argue that the Egyptians have boats but but that is that is still within the framework of accepted history in it's the notion of a of a global navigating culture in the Ice Age that archaeologists can't swallow its is ancient maps which show the world as it looked during the last ice age by first explored this in Fingerprints of the Gods and I've touched on the mystery again an appendix on the subject in in in this book because I think he's a very important we're talking about maps that withdrawn roughly between the 13th and 17th in other words in relatively recent history however these Maps were largely based on much older sourcemaps which they copied and we can say that for sure because one of the famous Maps is the piri Reis map which was created by a Turkish Admiral cold. In the year 1513 actually on the corner of his mouth and survived it was originally a world map we know just have a bit that shows the east coast of South America and North America on the west coast of Africa. Rights in that map that it is in his own handwriting that he based it on more than 100 older sourcemaps some of which had come from the Library of Alexandria in other words that might have been when the Library of Alexandria had been destroyed in the fourth Century idea whenever it was some of its contents have been wet I'm broke to Constantinople which became to text capital and peris had access to those maps and he Incorporated information from those maps on his Maps as well as incorporating more recent navigational information on this is one of a whole category of maps which are extremely hard to explain all of them based on older sourcemaps now lost all of them incorporating extremely precise relative longitudes and latitudes latitude is not not difficult to technological feet but Long Beach is a difficult technological feat longatude involves a chronometer it involves knowing the time at the place you began your voyage and the local and local noon as well and calculating the difference between them you need a chronometer that will keep accurate time at Sea with the most motions of a ship and it's just a plain fact that our civilization did not invent such a chronometer until the late eighteenth Century before that we didn't know what longitude were we were at and ships were constantly sailing unexpectedly into coastlines that they for hundreds of miles further away so the discovery of the technique to do longatude was a major civilizational Advanced its presence in maps based on much older sourcemaps that I can show the world as it looks during the last ice age suggest that somebody during the last ice age was mapping the world I'm had mastered the technique of calculating longatude classic example of these maps and I make a point of this is the Pinkerton world map which was drawn in the year 1818 and it was based on the latest navigational information at that time I reproduce that map in the in the in the book what missing from the map entirely missing is Antarctica there's just a hole at the bottom of the world that nothing there and the reason the reason there's nothing there another another Pinkston map that shows that you need to find the reason the reason vets Antarctica is not there is that our civilization haven't discovered Antarctica in 1818 map in 1818 actually we discovered in 1819 and that's when it starts appearing on Modern Maps the problem is that Antarctica has repeatedly on these much older maps and it appears in the right place and a bit bigger than it is today but very much as it looked during the last ice so what all of this suggests to me is that the world was mapped and explored by global seafaring culture with the level of technology that was at least equivalent to ours at the end of the eighteenth Century during the Ice Age of Greenland that showed it underneath the ice yes there are an intriguing thing I meant I mentioned the Perry Reese map just now shown on the piri Reis map lying off the east coast of North America is a large island row of megaliths like a road of make a list running up the middle of its island is in the exact place of the Grand Bahama Banks and the longest one cities to draw things back then to and what you see running down the middle of it is this road like feature of which is in the Grand Bahama Banks and the Bimini Road is exactly where that is natural or man-made for me the mystery is but it is shown above water on that map and the time it was above water was thousands and thousands of years ago so for me this is all evidence that we shouldn't dismiss the possibility that our ancestors had achieved the level of Technology where they could explore not the world's oceans we shouldn't dismiss that it was just looking at look at that meeting that looks so man-made and you can see it it's Rob it like they did the patent that show it on the on the island in the in the map how deep is that today always been but we think that that was above water attempt on his kid was definitely above water during the last ice age when it when it finally went underwater LG has been to dismiss the significance of the Bimini Road the beach rock has been used as a construction material I repeat the key issue is not whether the Bimini Road is man-made or not the key issue is with it features on the map above water and that is a dating project that tells us that somebody was mopping back bit of the world when it was above water order with those uniformly sized rocks for how long is that defeat this house a huge shaped like letter J it's a giant underwater structures really really an enormous thing and very very beautiful dive on a very gentle sweet nurse sharks down there that you can play with us oh that looks much more like random that's more random I would not I would not seek to to claim that the Bimini Road is Absol it's a bit look high deconstructed I would not say I would not seek to to claim that the Bimini Road is absolutely man-made my time about the Bimini Road is its really f****** weird that it appears on the map above water</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> can I go into the issue of Ayahuasca in in this book because first of all I ask it is itself another example of Amazonian science as you and I are many of the delicious and viewers know the active ingredient of Ayahuasca is DMT dimethyltryptamine but dimethyltryptamine is not normally accessible through the depth we have to smoke it or or vape it to get that rocket ship to the other side of real I'm the journey lost what 10 12 minutes not much more than that and sometimes sometimes quite a lot less what I want cat does is it makes the empty available through the gut the reason it's not available through the gut is because of an enzyme in the Gutfeld monoamine oxidase not switch is off DMT on contact the Ayahuasca Vine which is one of the two ingredients of the Ayahuasca Brew the other ingredient is leaves that contain DMT the Ayahuasca Vine contains a monoamine oxidase and which switches off the enzyme in the gut and allows the DMT to be access to orally which produces are all the different Jenny from the smoke to vape DMT trip is a much longer Jenny's for 5 hours that allows you to integrate I'm to Aunt in to relate with the strange landscapes in which you find yourself amongst them the entities that you encounter I'm not making any claims about the reality status of those entities but what I am saying it's a fact TruTV entities who who communicate with them intelligently somebody in the Amazon out of a hundred and fifty thousand different species of plants and trees selected to that I'm not psychoactive on their own but when put together create an extraordinary Visionary Brew Ayahuasca means the vine of the dad and what it's connected to in South American religious and spiritual thinking is what happens to us when we die Amanda Tucano who are an Amazonian people who work regularly, no actually will give a teaspoonful of Ayahuasca to a newborn infant they feel I walk is so important that there is a hidden realm around us which we are not normally aware of and we need to be aware of it and I walked as an important part of that in there Ayahuasca Jenny's they Tucanos shamans experience visions and they will then come back to an alert normal problem solving state of consciousness they were painting depict the visions and what's intriguing and I I go into it in the book has a quite a number of the Chicano paintings of the Otherworld of the afterlife Realm of the entrance to the Otherworld geometrical and they look exactly like the geoglyphs so I'm beginning to wonder whether these geoglyphs were part of a system of spiritual ideas concerning what happens to us after death and what we need to do in this life to ensure a beneficial outcome and oddly enough that same system this is found in the Mississippi Valley in the Amazon it involves particularly Ayahuasca and the belief that the Ayahuasca Journey takes you to the afterlife realm and a journey along the Milky Way in the Mississippi Valley the mound builders sites up and down the Mississippi Valley particularly Moundville in Alabama exactly the same system of religious ideas associated with geometrical construction that on death the soul that very specific ascends to the constellation of Orion it's from the constellation of Orion to the Milky Way makes a journey along the Milky Way which they called the path of Souls and encounters challenges in ordeals where the soul must account for the life that it has lived then we go to Egypt and what do we find the same system of ideas the soul must rise up to the constellation of Orion there's an Irish and cut through the southern side of the Great Pyramid of Giza which targets directly the lowest of the three stars of Orion's Belt widely accepted the starshop Duracell shop the soul would rise up through that shaft get to the constellation of Orion which stands by the banks of the Milky Way it was in transit to the Milky Way with the ancient Egyptians called the winding Waterway and it would make a journey along the way up Milky Way where it would be confronted by challenges and ordeals very similar idea to the Dacono very similar idea to the Mississippi Valley as far as we know none of these cultures wear in contact with one another either with dealing with a huge unbelievable extraordinary detailed code involving architecture and ideas or we looking at the Legacy that was inherited in all of these different places from a remote common ancestor and I believe that that's what we what do we think the people from the ancient Mississippi Valley though they were using if they weren't using ayahuasca I would say that they're definitely not of course there are Visionary substances which are which are used in Native American Vision Quest with the Native American Church this is our quite a quite clear itself if I'll just like a very beautiful and healing experience and I love the ceremony that I'm in I'm inside of a teepee with with 30 or 40 other people in that are there specific roles that are signs of those different individuals one will keep the door and other will be responsible for the fryer which is a work of art in itself just gazing into that fire on the glowing enough to induce an altered state of consciousness expense this is a technology for accessing other levels of experience and other levels of reality and it's clear that the Native Americans had a number about advanced technology isn't in this area the Sundance doesn't use a substance but it uses austerity it uses pain to drive an altered state of consciousness the objective in every case seems to be let's just for awhile get ourselves out of the narrow rigid frame of the elite problem-solving State of Consciousness we all need that it's incredibly useful you'll need that it's incredibly useful hunter-gatherers need it just as much as people in in cities need it but it's not the only state of consciousness available to human beings I maybe that's one of the big mistakes that we're making in our culture was not made in in shamanistic societies</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how many more fascinating pieces of evidence in South America come out recently about these channels and Pathways they found in the Amazon that could not have been created any other way but by humans that are creating irrigation human creating like it appears like grids like a city grid definitely damasen is a colossal mystery and it's one of the subjects that I explore in depth in America before the mall to get some basic figures the Amazon basin is huge the Amazon basin is 7 million square kilometers in area within it five-and-a-half million square kilometers remains almost entirely and studied by archaeologists and that's the five-and-a-half million square kilometers is still covered by dense rainforest and put that into perspective and a half million square kilometers is the Indian subcontinent we just ignored India you know we've done well. He loves you but we just ignore the Amazon it's the same the same I Got 5 and 1/2 minutes away cuz I'm just the view was again there was a dog that was a preconception human beings couldn't have flourished in the Amazon it says it's not the results which area of the soils are poor it's a difficult area challenging to get to very far from the Bering Straits so the view was that humans have an end to the Amazon until about a thousand years ago I'm gradually little by little. Vue has begun to change has begun to change because of the tragic clearances of Amazon because the Amazon rainforest is literally being cut down and turned into soybean farms and cattle ranches and in that cutting down process has emerged things that shouldn't be there too for example evidence that large cities first in the Amazon 5041 5042 he was the first European to cross the entire length of South America from west to east along the Amazon he reported seeing incredible cities Advanced arts and crafts millions of people a thriving culture and hundred years later with other European see the traces of those cities what happened was that the Spaniards brought smallpox into the Amazon smallpox devastated the local population because there was no immunity to it there was a massive die-off the cities were deserted within a 50 years they were completely overgrown by the jungle and that's why they would not seen by the explorers who came in a hundred years later but not being cleared their cities are emerging and we can say that the population of roughly 50,000 in the 16th century bat size all over the opposite huge numbers of possible total population of the seated 20 million people all these people Beyonce was they invented the soil I'm not soiled has a name it's called Terra Preta archaeologists refer to it as Amazonian dockets or Amazonian Black Earth it's a man-made soil it's thousands of years old it's full of microbes that are not found in adjoining soil it's based around biochar and you can take a handful of 8000 year old terra Preta and you can add it to Barren soil about so I was instantly Comfort on its highly sought-after in the Amazon and it explains how they fed these people controlled Burns they did they one way that it was achieved was was to do wet burning of midence they would be they would be burned and smolder they wouldn't burn fiercely was just produces charcoal they would they would burn and smolder and that but what is called biochar would result in that part of the fertility of the soil that the mystery is the microbial content of the soil which is completely different from the microbes in neighboring soils and that remains unexplained what are the theories composting some sort of advanced compost some sort of some sort of adults composting but again what has not been explained is the is the mic microbial content of these salts is an issue of how two things how large populations get fed in the Amazon and evidence that there was a culture in the Amazon that was capable of manipulating the environment in such a way that it could support large populations with the invention of Terra Preta secondly new evidence previously not ready the Amazon is basically a garden the Amazon is a man-made rainforest there a certain trees like Brazil nut trees or the ice cream bean tree which our food crops which are very very valuable and they dominate the the tree regime in India Amazon they what's what's referred to as hyper dominant species in other words people living in the Amazon over thousands of years selected certain trees which they been cultivated and grooves of the whole thing is not simply a while rainforest it's a very ancient man-made environment and emerging from that man-made environment as well as evidence of large cities large populations and this mysterious Dark Earth are huge geometrical structures I go into the length in America before because I love this mystery we have in the UK structures that a cold hinges I believe in the city of bath in about 30 miles away that's beautiful Avery on another more famous cycle Stonehenge I want a henges is a Ditch Witch is being dug deep and then an embankment has been pushed up outside the ditch when people first hole these structures they wondered if they'd be built for defense but then it became obvious they haven't be built to defense because if you want to create a moat you put it outside your environment inside your environment earthwork which consists of a deep moat with a embankment outside to the Camby secular it can be square and in the UK and other parts of Europe it often contain Stone circles megalithic Stone circles as well but the henge itself isn't Italian earthwork what we tried in the Amazon thousands of hinges but are now beginning to emerge from the kid area the jungle and others that have been identified for the first time with lidar lidar technology is being employed in the Amazon his non-destructive you can see what's under the trees what is lidar at night Imaging and Detective are they moths lazerbeams down into the jungles of Hope passing of the helicopters on but it doesn't damage the rainforest and you can strip away and see what see what's there and let me give you the example of Guatemala Mayan ruins everybody has heard of surrounding that whole area where more than 60,000 structures that they haven't identified invisible being identified by lighter in a country that's just a hundred thousand kilometers in area so you have to ask yourself and not five and a half million square kilometers of the technology could be applied comprehensively what would we find beneath there and the evidence already is extremely tempting and extremely tantalizing and I'm intrigued by this geometrical figures which involve primarily circles and squares and they are classic hinges in the sense that they are deep ditches surrounded by huge embankments they're extremely geometrical for example you can find an octagon surrounding a square at a place called Jekyll saw in the Amazon you can find a square perfectly and closing a circle given to the Greeks they said the Greeks were the first people who performed at exercise but now we find in bated sites in the Amazon that this was being done in the Amazon long before the Greeks what are the dates of the earliest date that have been found in these sites now at about three and a half thousand years old about three-and-a-half thousand years old but the evidence is being constantly remade and what intrigues me is what remains in that five and a half million square kilometers that has not being investigated yet we are just I think looking at the images of a mystery the archaeologists involve to am mainly from Finland and also from Brazil still the same bet their estimate is that there are thousands of these structures remaining in the jungle and they're open as to how old they may ultimately proved to be the investigation needs to be done but what's fascinating about them is this very powerful geometry and astronomy so a number of the sites are perfectly aligned to truenorth True South true East and TruWest I'm not talking about magnetic north I'm talking about true to do that there's only one way to do it and that's with with astronomy so that tells us that astronomers word work in the Amazon the geometry is very complex and very precise that tells us that people with geometrical skills were at work in the arms and it's badly the scale of the sites of hundreds of gigantic further much further attention and I'm on yeah that's exactly the square squaring the circle so you can see the outside embankment and then inside it is the square ditch and then there's another embankment inside that I'm a circle and a circle inside that they found in the Amazon what imaging technology were they using to find all the initial e initially it was entirely failed because areas of the rainforest have been cleared economic interests that we want to make a cafe around here or we want to make a soybean Farm here so it's going to clear the rainforest in the process of clearing the rainforest they start discovering this earth works at a previously being completely overgrown by the jungle then the next step was to say what can we what can we do to find out more about this obviously they don't destroy more jungle and luckily we have a technology which is which is lidar as I mentioned which uses radar and using lidar they've been identified able to identify many more of these sites and then to get to the science without destroying the jungle and to begin excavations on them and to find that they go back in the cases of the ones that have been explored so far at least three thousand years this is an intriguing development completely unexplained in our understanding of the Amazon suggest is a Heritage of extremely ancient knowledge you don't wake up one morning and you know create a perfectly geometrical square or Circle Earthworks was perfectly aligned to true north south east and west on an enormous scale that has to be a background to that we don't know what they were used for I make the case in America before that that can but they where we did we don't know what they were used for I make the case in America before that that connected to a system of ideas which is found all around the world which which has to do with death and the afterlife Destiny of the Soul</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what was the motivation behind creating this book America before it's a curious mixture of things I have been exploring the possibility of A Lost Civilization for more than 25 years that was the essence of my book Fingerprints of the gods that was published in 1995 that there has been a huge forgotten episode in human history I continue to follow that in a series of other books and by the time I got to 2002 when I published a book called weld that followed seven years of scuba diving on Continental shelves looking for structures that was submerged by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age I really felt I'd done it I felt I'd walk the walk put put out to the public a massive body of information and I thought my role in this is over and I can breathe a sigh of relief cuz it's hot in this particular kitchen and I can go do something else and I ended up writing a book about psychedelics I ended up writing soup do meetings with the agent teachers of mankind about the role of psychedelics in in the origins of the of the human story but then new information started to come out that touchdown the Lost Civilization idea and I couldn't just stop by and ignore that information that's why I published magicians of the Gods in 2015 and then as I was researching that book I became aware of something I hadn't realized before that there's a massive new information from the Americas specifically from the Americas which completely rewrites the story of human tree that the Americas have been misrepresented for a very long time by archaeology and I'll tell just will be annoyed with me for saying that they have a way of forgetting their own errors of saying all we do that all along it wasn't it wasn't the case but the fact remains that her best part of 50 years from the 1960s through until about 2010 American archaeology was locked in a Dogma that they actually had a name for which was Clovis first invented the name for a culture they call them the Clovis culture we don't know what they called themselves they were hunter-gatherers they first appeared in the archeological records 13400 years ago and they banished from the archaeological record 12600 years ago and for a very long time it was maintained adamantly that these were the first Americans that no human being touched the sort of the Americas until 13400 years ago just animals but no human being present at an Antioch urologist to attempted to dispute that dogma and I use the word deliberately that should be no room but Dogma in science but any archaeologist to challenge that would face severe problems with his or her career they would be mocked and humiliated at conferences like it. Y'all just call Jackson Kumar's from from Canada in the in the in the Yukon humiliated at conferences insulted accused of making stuff up their research funding withdrawn basically to challenge Clovis first was the end of your ocular jakku career so now actually very few archaeologists wanted to challenge Club is first in the Yukon what was he told jacksonc Mars and interesting me the Smithsonian just in 2017 did the big kind of Mayor Copa big admission about this that everybody had got things wrong. Jax height laws have been ruined by the club is first lobby but he been right all along the site the excavated in the Yukon was reactivated 80-79 every single thing he said was correct even though they had just sneered at him what year was he when he was activating in the 1980s in the 1990s this is that what it meant was since it was the Dogma that Clovis was first that they owed Estates were 13400 years ago there seemed to be no logic to archaeologists in digging deeper you know how it is with archaeology that the the upper levels of the youngest and the deeper you go the older it gets that's why we say upper Paleolithic for the late Ice Age and lower Paleolithic for it for the Lakeside Asia lower for the older but Stone Age on the ceiling was no need to dig below lotus flower because we already know that they would no human being since before the van a few archaeologist I mentioned Jackson come on another is All Good Year from the University of South Carolina who excavated the site called topper in South Carolina now has an incredibly Rich Clovis site is full of tools that point they made a special special Flint points that we use those arrowheads and Spears great Clovis site he finished his level and then he did something that was supposed not to be done he decided to dig deeper and he carried on deeping down digging down and there was a layer of about a meter and a half of a Barren soil and then beneath that more human artifacts and they finally date those back to more than 50,000 years ago I've been in 2017 published in nature by Tom demory who's the chief paleontologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum and a bunch of other very high level published in nature magazine evidence for human presence in North America 150,000 years ago now this is really put the cat amongst the pigeons now if humans were depressed North America hundred thirty thousand years ago and archaeologists have been telling us for 50 years that they were only present from 13000 years ago that's ten times as long that we had humans in North America capable of doing stuff and the archaeological dog but has prevented any search for what they were doing until very recently evidence from a hundred thirty thousand years ago. Let me be clear about this because because this is this is something that is often misrepresented in in my vuse it is not the evidence for an advanced civilization that we find a hundred and fifty thousand years ago in America the evidence that we find is evidence for human presence and what they were doing was very much Stone Age stuff it's a mastodon it's a mastodon skeleton that was that was excavated will be found by accident during road construction near San Diego an archaeologist was attached to the road construction crew it immediately stopped construction and they investigated it thoroughly and what they found was so much dynamite in the early 1990s when they found it but they decided not to publish at the time it's what they found was evidence that those Mastodon Bones have been cracked open by human being using tools at the marrow have been extracted that one test could be left standing upright in I don't know their head be left decided that Beamer had a fever of the animal had been taken away completely from the site and there was assemblages of instruments that we used to smash and break the bonds of the conclusion that the team was the only one kind of creature could have done that work using tools on a mastodon about human beings that's classic classic human behavior so this sets the goalposts in a totally different play suddenly we have to consider that humans have been in America for a hundred because we already know that the dark magic approach of archaeology has rather refused to look at anything older than 13,000 years ago and what it does is it generates an engine of demand that we need to be looking at those missing hundred thousand plus years we need to be looking at the Todd of course the immediate reaction has not being to go looking for stuff in the other hundred thousand she is most archaeologists have responded by saying this is impossible menswear eating Bluefish caves in the Yukon 25,000 years ago that is precisely what they said to Al Goodyear who said humans have been tougher 50,000 years ago and they were both right and I believe that Tom demarais on his team you don't get a big article published in nature unless it's already pretty solidly based and pretty much. Use it has produced a reaction I would be wrong to say that it's universally accepted it's very much challenged when it is intriguing we archaeologists know bet that would no human beings in the Americas that fought back to put it in perspective it's about sixty thousand years before the first evidence of human beings in Europe it's about 60,000 years before the first evidence of human beings in Australia evidence they had masses of material to work with they did have the tools but in terms of skeletal remains just one one single skeletal remains one of the things that he was this dispute that perhaps the bones had been cracked open by the excavation material what is Israel to do so but what he what he misses. It's true that a new paper has been published which raises questions over the book called The cerutti Mastodon site which is a site that Tom Demmer at San Diego Natural History Museum excavated what's interesting ya basic basically this this this paper was in no way a refutation of the original paper in nature as a matter of fact the gentleman who wrote that paper never even looked at the archaeological remains that are in now in the San Diego Natural History Museum what it is and what he based it on is reference I'm quoting from the abstract of the paper itself reference do a three-way right-of-way map on construction plans contemporary Road building practices and where it's like photographs available on the internet and otherwise the site was not visited they simply looked at secondary references they did not look at the archaeological material and they ignore the entire argument of Tom Demmer and his colleagues who had already addressed that issue they didn't look at the bones. Look at the bones when you when you break a fresh bone it has a characteristic kind of spiral fracture does not happen when you break a fossilized bone I'm Tom Denver and his team specifically ruled out road making Machinery as responsible for this breaking cotton because they actually carried out experiments on Moulton elephants deceased elephants and they broke bones of the kind of fracture that you get in a fresh green bone is completely different from the kind of Fletcher you get enough in a hustle iPhone so unfortunately this paper pays pay no attention to that it just looks at Road Plaza very sloppy very weak and it's certainly not the answer we can expect ongoing debate and that is that is healthy but this is not a strong case at all so this points to the first evidence that we found and is there any effort underway to try to uncover more evidence that from a similar to well I'm I'm going to sites is very generous with his time I did an extended interview and I quote from it in in America before his wish is that archaeologists instead of spending all that time trying to find ways to dismiss and get rid of his findings his wishes that they would spend a little bit about time looking at deposits older than 13400 years I'm even being willing to go back as far as 130000 years that's that's would be a proper scientific response here is a put forward by a very senior group of scientists who hesitated before they published it they had the information back in the 1990's but it wasn't until refined dating techniques later than it in in the 21st century that they finally would sure what they had on that they published in nature in 2017 it's it's it's a it's an important study I think what's going to happen more evidence of a very ancient human presence in the America America commemorate thanks as well as he points out if we don't look that we never going to find if we allow Dogma to stop us looking and saying it's impossible that humans were in the Americas 130,000 years ago so we won't bother to look what a failure signs that is an addendum to spend all the time instead trying to get rid of the evidence doesn't fit the current time stop it slender mean how deep did they have to go to find these Mastodon bones this is a road cut this meeting may be pretty deep down 10-15 seat Downs of the greater is going through and flattening them it varies from place to place depending on on soil deposition the stratification the stratification of the soil but what the key to key point is that what you need to do is go deeper than 13400 years ago and you need to do so with the dedication I'm bigger and with some kind of funding at the moment archaeology doesn't doesn't see the point of fact if the paper in nature by Tom demory was a loan if it wasn't nothing else than that I wouldn't place so much trust in it but I spend a lot of time during the recession of this book with archaeologists to dig dig dig dig deeper and what those archaeologists all confirm is that there have been human beings in the Americas for tens of thousands of years not surprising that that could be pushed back to a hundred thirty thousand years ago because part of the argument about the peopling of the Americas has to do with a place that we now called the Bering Straits between Alaska and Siberia which during the Ice Age were at times lambridge they were exposed because of because of low at sea levels but migrants who crossed that land bridge from Siberia on many occasions over. The tens of thousands of years with cells confronted then by the North American ice cap which oddly wasn't at the tip of Alaska but began feather in so they was living space in a bit of Alaska but you couldn't get through the ice mountains these these literally ice mountains to 2 miles deep covering the whole of North America and preventing access to the unglaciated parts of American the thing is that what happened around 13400 years ago there had been a. Of global warming the ice sheets began to melt in a car the door opened up between What's called the Cordelia Rinnai sheet and the laurentide ice sheet the two major ice cubes in North America and it started the migration came through that Corridor with a thing is that exactly the same thing happened between 140000 years ago and 120000 years ago that was an episode of global warming an ice-free Corridor opened up on the same opportunity to enter the Americas was there at that. That it wasn't the later. Tom Demmer is point in mind is that we have to pay much more attention to that are . and that's really why I've gone ahead and understand this book is to try to put before a broad General audience hopefully in in language that that that makes sense and an assembly of all the latest information that costs doubt on the story would be tell because my goodness if Archaeology is wrong about the story of the peopling of the Americas if it's a radically wrong as it now appears to be then our whole understanding of human history has to change not just the history of the Americas it's the history of the entire world it has being an absolute Article of Faith amongst archaeologist That civilization began in the old world indeed I have a I have a book in my my library cold history begins at Sumer and it's by Samuel Noah Kramer a very renowned archaeologist it's a good book actually but the argument is that this is where civilization began in the coach of the week Marion's in Mesopotamia between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers and that it began about 6,000 years ago that Civilization is entirely and invention of the old world I have nothing to do with them you will the toll because the new world with populated so late this is this is being the this is Billy argument in this is the argument that now radically and suddenly begins to change that the Americas this enormous land mass Resorts Rich Bountiful in every way Minnesota south of the ice cap library is that are betta Bountiful get into South and Central America South America the Amazon just a huge areas of land that were very very off of great potential for effort for human occupation dog Mattis said they were no humans there now V bits of evidence are coming out that says that were humans there and if that's the case then we must consider the possibility that the story of civilization might have begun in the Americas not in the old welder tool it might be a new world convention Dogma has said that with no humans there now V bits of evidence are coming out that says that were humans there and if that's the case then we must consider the possibility that the story of civilization might have begun in the Americas not in the old world Atul it might be a new world Invention Convention</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I couldn't agree more My Hope Is that what you were saying and what we were discussing earlier about how the internet is sort of a row did our faith in many institutions as being the only or the primary source of knowledge that I hope that that takes place globally in terms of the way we view government yet and that we do that and that your idea of like I love what America stands for and what America stands for is kind of a Nation that's where people go to it was one of the morning serious problems with this idea of building walls and keeping people out making incredibly difficult to get here the reason why I'm here is because it was pretty easy to get here that's why I'm here at this idea of being able to just if you want to do better that you can anywhere in the world that is kid eventually spread out my hope I believe it can spread out and you don't I see many signs of Hope in in in America America has become a big part of my life not just because I wrote this book but because I have children who are now living in America have a son and daughter-in-law who live in LA I have another son and daughter-in-law who live in Boston American and British but America has become a very central part of my life do the miles across America close many many many different states tonight I love this country it's an amazing Place only in America could we see happening what has happened with cannabis you know they love the fact that other at a local level individuals have got together mobilized petitions organized boats and changed the law change the law my Consciousness in the inner sanctum of my own life is not the business of the state that's a very American feeling is it something that you don't find off in another countries where the state is granted much more power and might more Authority than they perhaps should be Americans unnaturally questioning of government Authority I'm about as bad as what has led to the legalization increasing legalization of cannabis which is going to change the world in lost weight but then ironically at the same time democracies is that in order to get things done in a democracy you need to persuade people of your point of user information becomes very important in in democracy of information can be abused people can be misled with information they can be told that what they're receiving is the truth whereas in fact it's not the truth and you could end up with a kind of dictatorship that the people have given their Ascent to on the basis of false information on frankly I'd rather have a real dictatorship which is out in the open and I'm clear rather than one that has been subtly manipulated into position through manipulating the the the views of the of the boat but I am and remain enormously encouraged by America it may seem like a trivial issue but the fact that state-by-state cannabis is being legalized and that is resulting from a Grassroots movement that this enormous changes being made eat at ironic it strange that at the federal level even though what eight states now totally legal for recreational 2324 State's legal for medical use that at the federal level is still a schedule 1 controlled controlled drug this is a huge state of dissonance that exist in America is going to have to put it right what it says to me is that people can change things people can get together at the local level and they can make a better world because there's no doubt that the kind of vicious and wrong and cruel and evil and ruin people's lives for decades and its people change that the people at the Grassroots level America is a country where that can happen and I remain encouraged about about the role of the American people while often in despair about the role of the American state talk about the drug laws in this country and and talking about how many it's really really opening this the idea of like how unjust these laws were and how many of these laws targeted people of color and how many people or white people have profited off of this and how many people are still in jail for crimes they committed in the air quote crimes that are no longer crying and is now going to be on the ballot actually opens up I mean what you really think marijuana is a gateway drug will guess what it is if psilocybin gets a task is psilocybin can legitimately change the world is changing people's perceptions and making people more calm and friendly and and even though what they talk about with paranoia I welcome that and the reason why I welcome those I think people are entirely too cocky we live as bizarre as you could ever imagine that book and we're just accustomed to it because it's our day today to get off for granted marijuana remove those blinders and it really makes you understand that this is a strange strange life and these a lot of these pitfalls and problems that we have in our society or do the fear and they're due to the ignorance and they're they're due to this this lack of connection with each other and cannabis and many of these other psychedelic drugs they encouraged connection with each other what we need what we need and it's an aberration in human culture that we've created a society that demonize these substances in that made them illegal it's a relatively recent saying it's just the last the last hundred years it's a it's a tiny part of the human story and yet we was so arrogant as a society that thousands of years experience and wisdom working with Apartments nothing what if what is hugin stupid mistake that is on cannabis as a quote-unquote gateway drug it absolutely is in this sense that the legalization of cannabis is going to open the doors to the SE as you say to the legalization of psychedelic because what's happening is that the population is completely waking up to the fact that they have been bullshitted and lied to about cannabis for the best part of a century and once that door people that the realization that the direct personal level he is this herb I love I have been lied to systematically misinformed by central government about this about this herb that leads the questioning of everything that central government does I'm so in that sense it is a gateway to a questioning Society the psychedelics are actually does lead you to question stuff didn't lead you to really ask questions about about everything about your role in the world about you as a person about how you relate to other people and about the whole system on this planet and that the beautiful gorgeous planet that we that we have and what we doing to it that that also enters a tent is a winner so it arose confidence and authority and it also Rose confidence and Authority that doesn't have experiences that you've experienced that's the part of the problem is that these people that are holding people back from the Psychedelic experiences they've never had them they don't even know what their Rowling play Sofia and Prejudice by simply accepting stuff that they've been told without really thinking it through and and and examining it then again it's a failure of of what human beings should should be doing we have to get where to get rid of this fear where they make their own responsible choices about their own lives where they don't say oh government must make this choice for me that's the next step for Humanity we start we need to start becoming our own leaders and making our own choices and that is that is what being revealed now that we getting to the skull beneath the smile of the War on Drugs we're realizing but it's part of a big program of lying that has been about keeping people's minds close down not wanting free I've made this point several times but our society is not against Altered States Of Consciousness as such a society will allow big Pharma to make billions of dollars with drugs that alter Consciousness like Ciroc Santa and Prozac antidepressant switch in my opinion having had some experience of them are among the most horrible drugs on the planet they are very harmful very dangerous drugs but that completely legal and they're encouraged with our system likewise alcohol very dangerous drug causes fights causes drunk driving accidents the cirrhosis of the liver completely legal and open our society is not against Altered States Of Consciousness as such it's against particular kinds of Altered States Of Consciousness that leaped questioning of the existing control system that's what's that what's going on here here here Jordans in 2011 I had a series of Ayahuasca sessions in which it was shown to me that I was using cannabis completely wrong but it did become a dominant force in my life that it was making me your speaking about paranoia and I agree with your paranoia is used to overcome it that it was making me paranoid that would make me suspicious that I approached everybody around me in a state of Suspicion and I was shown this by Ayahuasca given a very strong did you need to quit cannabis what I didn't realize at the time is that the problem was not cannabis the problem was me that I needed to fix those aspects of myself before I could have a proper relationship with, so after that Ayahuasca session having smoked cannabis for decades literally 16 hours a day 7 days a week I quit I quit for three years and then I'm on your show and we're sitting with sitting up question are you still off the campus I'm not I'm I say well I'm thinking of Dipping my toes back in the water at which point you produce a joint and we smoke it together at first of all after 3 years your tolerance is way down on really stoned I did listen to that somehow I held it together time to go back to campus but perhaps in a different way he doesn't it I need a different relationship with his amazing medicine and and if I can forge that if I can make that different relationship happen then it can be a constructive and positive part of my life and I can say definitely that that has being the case of doesn't it I need a different relationship with his amazing medicine and and if I can forge that if I can make that different relationships happen then it can be a constructive and positive part of my life and I can say definitely that that has being the case of</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> nexomon you really should you should you should eat some animal protein without it mean if you oppose the moral aspect of killing an animal which I totally understand and appreciate and that's what led me to become a hunter in the first place is that I was really uncomfortable watching these animal-rights videos of factory farming I thought was disgusting participate in this it's very spiritual very very very difficult to close in on a wild animal in mostly elk well Elks my favorite for two reasons one it's very delicious super nutritious also if I shoot one elk I could eat it for like 8 months boys going to the woods with bikes to they don't leave a scent the way your feet do you know and animals don't associate the sound of a bike with associated with it like the sound of stepping bipedal hominids like I couldn't breathe. I would love the game of being a time cuz there's nothing to say that saying come back with black holes around this afternoon and it stinks the man in me that I couldn't deal with the feeling of after it was young MeetMe install those feelings if I can handle it in the package portioned off why I feel too much like when you're doing it when you pulling the trigger you know having what's going on in your mind well you you only or hunting these mature animals that have already pass on their genes you also know or recognizing that if you're not killing these things they're not it's not like they're going to live forever the short life of a short life with a very violent death it's either wolves are mountain lions or Bears or something's going to take them out yeah what you're doing is essentially dipping your toe into the natural world and I've heard the argument that will this is ridiculous cuz everyone can't do that you know if everyone went out and hunted all the animals would be no animals left which is true but I'm not everyone so I don't you know I mean to use that it's a good argument because you're encouraging it is kind of a good argument cuz it's not realistic Sun sustainable the other thing to recognize is that the reason why most of this wild life exist in the first place why but was wiped out in the early 20th century from what they called Market hunting in the late late 19th century early twentieth-century the refrigeration and it was hard to get food and we didn't have the same sort of large-scale Agriculture that we have today and someone someone want meet they would someone who would either have to hunt it for you and you'd go to the market and get that hunted food or you would go out and do it yourself and they basically wiped out most of the wildlife in North America to the point of Extinction whitetail deer elk they've been extirpated from the majority of their range in North American only been replaced and a few other places but the place is with their been replaced it's all through money that was generated through hunting tags all through billions and billions of dollars there's a thing called the Robertson Pikmin I think that's what's called act where 10% if you buy hunting gear and Equipment 10% of that money goes to Habitat restoration making sure that Rangers and Forest people get funded so that the fish and game department gets funded and all and also population conservation making sure that the populations are healthy repopulating sir areas with elk and deer and this is all been done through the money that's generated through hunting yeah I can see that they're looking at my own feelings towards it I can say that there's a potentially on bringing a sentimentality to the idea of animals that's why I'm freaking morphic is normal and I wouldn't and agriculture is normal and I wouldn't get very far if I was so beautiful I couldn't do that because like the show of these ossified Polaroid positions between right and left starting a tightrope because it someone like me who don't eat meat don't start trying to impose on other people now you shouldn't have no everything remain I'm this this is about this is about my morality is about how I buy Bandit people said to me on think about guy and hunt in my feelings about it however I just heard that hunting does contribute apparently survived the same species and there is no accumulated quite naturally contact with Who We Are used to be if we could come over the civilized and more money from what it is to be human where that site Creed or pragmatic we don't know what human beings are Nemo we reject their own sexuality reject I'm I'm bored these we were chatting it up with trying to turn out there was any of these people STEEZ emotionless sex less meaningless creech's where is our passion where is that connection with the sacred they will go hold on I only asked about hunting when are you going to stop talking meaningless creatures where is our passion where is our connection with the sacred they will come hold on I only ask about hunting when are you going to stop talkin never</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what are things I said about bike comments and podcast and stuff like that I think one of the reasons why a lot of people get mad and I try to think this through likes my some people some of the responses so negative two things don't it seem innocuous in the outside I think it's because it's frustrating when you don't have a say get out the door you put your hours in eventually you'll get better you take care of your family that like a f****** man and it was probably people like that that they're upset that they feel like we're pontificating too much and this is all just you know just mental masturbation to write it is but that's part of how you basement light. And I've got over the idea that that they some external pain can be imposed like in a wasp like many people. We could say not using the 50 years to maximum effect because they're getting up his shooting all material goes in a many many more people have never been introduced to the idea of freedom because economically valley below. He's only an idea or you know comedian or whatever f*** you so many of us are trapped in the expectations and values of our parents to that's a real problem with people don't let their children become an individual now they force their children to follow their own Ridgid ideology they shame them when they don't probably unconsciously imposing fingernail 100% but not with guilt and women if your kid comes to you and say Dad and do I know you wanted me to be a doctor but f****** I want to play Bongos I just want to be the best Bongo player of all time I bet you'd probably like hey give me a hug and go get those Bongo and you going to go back to medical school when you going to pick up your study to want to get you a tutor and you're going to perform cuz we're all Wilson Ciara Wilson a tardis Wilson family's been Physicians since 1820 the web-like grandparents are wet by reacting to spiders and stuff guy. Spot is a scary spiders are scary thank you as my thoughts. that's why I'm not when I was 20 if you decide about the hunting or no good or bad because you can think there is but then you find circumstances like wild pigs or invasive species like can someone with small islands of Hawaii there's somewhere in the neighborhood of three thousand people in 20,000 deer it is so overpopulated with deer and they have to kill them to kill them every day they hire snipers they hire people killing people are slamming them with their cars and they're f****** everywhere and their axis deer they're not even from their they're from someone brought them over from India to give the King Kamehameha and like the 80s actually that involve to get away from Tigers so this is insanely fast beautiful dear they're everywhere they they're forced to kill well the good news is the people that are low income people the island always have meat there's this meet every where everyone can hunt it's really easy to find them you can you can find them in a few you know if you want you can go kill him killing a rat write a vegan I do feel bad I'm hungry when you're out you might be reincarnated</div>

They're not looking at things rationally to just looking at Targets particular people that write articles you know what's the best articles that came out of all this Facebook algorithm stuff is you find out that Facebook realize somewhere early on that the way to encourage engagement is to get people upset they they get way more engaged and they go back and forth and interact we supposed weigh more if they're upset then they do they agree with it if they agree with it it might give it a liger thumbs up and say hey that's great and that's it that's where it ends but if you know someone's talking about you know we shouldn't build the wall we should let everyone in and you put that on some f****** Trump guys page and you will get thousands and thousands and thousands of interaction so Facebook realize that the way to keep people and me know they could claim that it's an algorithm in the algorithm just supports whatever the people are really but what they're interested in this conflict that demonstrates my only appoint which I made up on the spot the III is not a mutual thing it is Resort from Human perspectives and cuz that is a type of that way we can get back to what we were saying about taking personal responsibility for you off like that none of us have to sit on social media apartments in probably the best short leg dog is having a galaxy with someone online and I like people do we have in the white deserve love and sympathy but until we on some level recognize that we can learn behaviors we can or unconsciousness see how there's going to be at least then we can create a Terrain upon which system can stop the flourish do you read comments listen to people's replies to my conversations like I have social media and like she gives me stuff like respond to these things put some output people to get your reaction is to say something really negative you look at some sometimes when people are not that Savvy when it comes to social media one things at 1 things you notice is they'll enter and I've been guilty this in the past before I started to realize what I was doing you only respond to negative things and people are arguing with people and my people saying nice things to you and you ignore them it's cuz you don't eat at a certain level you don't have the physical time it doesn't exist to respond to everyone it's not possible just know if you get 13,000 comments on one of your post how the f*** does anyone have time to respond to 13,000 people you can't and then you have email and you have Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and sisters no way there's not enough time in this world so you would have responded to things that caused the mall there's never been a time where people have had this instantaneous interaction with people unfiltered on moderated globally yet it's very strange to to be able to do that and to be able to go back and forth and you just it just to be able to give your comments on things to be able to talk about things it's very addicted to people yeah that's right and that's why I'm very cautious with you I have to stay in a marriage people yeah that's right and that's why I'm very cautious with it I have to sort my life out like I'm essentially a monk in a marriage that bicycle get up meditite do yoga to exercises to fix deposit if you wants the way that you're thinking</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I don't know if he doesn't as much or as often as I do but I can't cuz I do the club's I have a philosophy about what's required to develop great stand-up that you have to do a lot of sets of do a lot of numbers a lot of different places different environments and I found that out the hard way through My best performances in my less good performances like what was missing and what did I gain you I think he's at so many interesting to bite a stand-up World At Large is like that as soon as I was able to have an audience that would come and see me while I'm out thank you God crazy 2 a.m. motherfuker realize if you if a child got on top of you went for an armbar newscape you feel nothing when you're at Largo you're falling for children and women who just started yesterday Deadpool I'm in an environment they sympathetic and he's my audience biasing becoming a great obstacle I completely appreciate what you're saying but say you believe in the purity of stand-up is being some real expression of yourself as in the arrow hitting the bullseye I want to hang of it ruminations or more are believed to be the nature of Truth and I want people to come out I think they'll of validate accepted and that they put enough on that I can explode until the show these people have some type of wave aliens from the Joey Diaz in the store Ted Talk almost Fidos released locusts and the confrontation in Scotland people in take it well trying to do was like create I didn't have the skills the truck the experience than jokes was create environments that felt yeah it was, so don't you think that by prepping you all stand up in those environments that it biases you towards is limited know because you can do that other stuff to you could always perform to your crowd and you can always expand on things to your crowd but to really put it together without any flop without any nonsense it without being self-indulgent respecting the attention span of the audience and may or may not even be there to see you most likely is not if you go to a comedy club and there's a lot you know what you go to The Comedy Store 18 are the weakest 15 + people on the Marquis or on the list and the show starts at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. depending on the night and it goes to 2 in the morning and you know you catch waves in there and there's different types of comedy and in that you're you're going to deal with sometimes tired audiences sometimes people with all different varies widely and I think that in doing that you cut all the nonsense out of your act and you you developing economy of words you understand how to Captivate people's attention and keep them engaged and to respect their time respect their point of view respect that lead to love and attention span they want to be engaged in in the best possible way you can do it and sometimes you develop that through these really difficult sets or you know we're just did people and drunks and all that stuff you can develop that those qualities you're always going to have your crowd and your crowd mean if you have this this vision of how you want to put things together you can put that kind of thing together at a comedy club you're doing it in his 15-minute Trump's you just have to figure out a way to grab them and make them is really interested in what you have to say I Like Comics or like you know that Robin Williams was supposed to Christ they went they go in and accept those conditions when your you have a subject to say if you want to do you want to talk about Dementors that you have in life it's an open-ended approach you have no idea what the correct way to say something is you try it you how you write it out you say this seems feasible let me try this way and often times people never correct it or they never they never adjusted they never go back and improve it just say it a certain way and figure out how to do it when you're doing it in front of a crowd developing these things while also feeling the way people reacting to them and feeling their attention span and it makes you with proper reflection and truly objective listening to your material it makes you change and shift and adjusting and it hopefully in a positive way getting in the more you do it the more you get a sense of maybe this is clunky here and maybe I figure out a better way to say it in my grave but the counter argument lowest common denominator and what was the Journey of the night. Meaning with new bits of material keeps giving fake things that you look more confident I know a better way to do it and that's part of the problem with doing bits so sometimes you release them on a specialty of a better version of it now but my point of that was to a prospective enhancer to let people know that bit was about like understand what's happening here you are literally floating and infinity and it's almost never discussed through forever there's a fireball in the sky 2 million times bigger than Earth he stared at you go blind is trying to give you cancer and if it's not that you get sad yeah you live in a dream if this is madness your life is madness and he's wanted there's something about that particular way of a seat cuz I figured out a way to express it in short doses in short bursts if you know if you stare to go blind can I give you cancer if it's not there yet sad so didn't have short bursts like mitsunari wow yeah that is all all those things are true like yeah it's crazy there really is a fireball floating in the sky we're just used to it we live because of a floating million times bigger than the earth Fireball and when you say if you could say something like that to make someone laugh you going to actually change the way they look at things you can actually affect at least the way they look at things Via Say Something profound sometimes it registers but if you could say something and it forces someone to lap you know if they disagree with you if they're laughing like I am f****** agree with this what holyshit this is funny you put that thought deep into someone's head and you allow them to think about your thought process and and how your creative process and what you're doing to sort of bring these things out yes I like the way you just described the architecture irrefutable now here is how that affects the way we look at the world and exposes to us The Witcher ignorant with no awake to reality kiwi cornhold reality in their mind cuz it's to Voss yeah spell shame into procession very important about people coming together and laughing together and travels out to the universe or one hopefully archetype God works material a lock on the Australian TV multiple incarnations he did at live but he did he was capable of going on these rants spontaneous rants but he was a writer you know he wrote these things out and he was aiming to have an impact with his commentary I mean that was what was was he was doing it was not just trying to make you laugh he was aiming to enhance your your perspective on whatever he was talking about you know he wrote these things out and he was aiming to have an impact with his commentary I mean that was what was was he was doing was not just trying to make you laugh he was aiming to enhance your perspective on whatever he was talking about</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what I think is interesting is that the continual boys along that technological path is too much profit and I when we see those machines the endpoint is white how do we make how do we maximize profit there is no like the influence of how do we do what's right that's electrical code is not being introduced there is no regulation ultimately people will create the warrior monkeys all the most profitable machines people because the counter argument isn't being made no one is that what I'm saying I was making it that there's just there's no Union of yeah there's no clear P or using I-5 we will swimming in it I'm saying is if we acknowledge there are Transcendent Realms there is information tight and Dieter that exists beyond what we are able to receive a scientist how are we going to incorporate that into why we will connect with the requirement of the powerful that will always action and he seems like we're that's heading is Sun contact love quizzes and they are most likely to win the grey involved in establishing and maintaining the system but are they just capitalizing or they organizing it is a normal part of the way human beings operate with this constant desire for Innovation constant desire for improvement we always want to push further no no it's comfortable where they are they will always want to be in a better place and this is it's like it's built into capitalism Riley agree that this materialism which is built into capitalism also is what fuels Innovation because you want the newest iPhone so they have to design it and build it and make it and when new things come out like this new robot that apparently he's going 200 models whatever that means what that is is this is they're going to sell it so there's like it's fueling Innovation someone else will come along and compete with Boston Dynamics and then they will be there be Innovation Wars that these Innovations in place right now our phones would look nothing like the iPhone 10 it just wouldn't we had start to a sexy would look like when those who look like but there would be no no incentive for them to compete against all these Samsung devices and Huawei devices and all that stuff is fueling this Innovation but it's all being fueled by capitalism you're quite right that that eight Innovation is one of the benefits of maintaining them but it seems to me that we are excluding Ava factors throughout human cultures we all have an idea fanis off Justice monkey with so Easton Block phone made out of Grey plastic the information online. We do have a degree of individual power and individual responsibility and I feel like if enough people awaken to the possibility of different narrative that the Catholics are there of innovation and success and progress. Oldies work can be examined what do you mean Progressive Monument the Limitless Nest aware existing within then all these things are constructs this is a construct and it is good to have technology but it's possible to like at points times of Crisis such as what it feels like we're right now in every generation but that now because we do live in a truly Global culture so there is the possibility for monolids to introduce new innovation and there is nothing that can oppose it or regulate it was fun to see this kind of breakdown so I'm interested in how we can individually prepare ourselves to organize to saw it differently to be overcome pretty superficial differences Skyline in Hilton Garden Inn live peacefully not entirely Gavin I smoke a bow that seem to be hugely by saying the direction of this so-called progress I think you answered your own previous questions when you're talkin about whether or not you can be spiritual and funny and like what are you doing can you carve that pass out for yourself that what you're doing there by explaining that would influence people would give people perspective little why are we doing this and what is the purpose of this and if enough people hear those words and have that perspective introduced to them it'll change the way they interact with the world and that changes the world it really does and that's one of the more powerful things about discussions when someone like you says something like that and it resonates with people to start thinking like why am I living like this like what if I'd only have if I really do only have 50 years to live why am I living these fifty years and some really bulshit where that's not satisfying at all cuz I just want a bigger house like what is it do I want a faster car don't want to expensive piece of jewelry like what is what is the purpose of this path and I'm on now versus a path that I could be on and what is the real conflict that we all experience between each other is it how much of it is due to a lack of communication how much of his due to a lack of real listening and understanding what is what is the purpose of this path that I'm on now versus a path that I could be on and what is the real conflict that we all experience between each other is it how much of it is due to a lack of communication how much of it is due to a lack of real listening and understanding</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> why I wonder that you had some people think give him a quick dose in a liar even the traditional God of Christianity what do you do believe in God is a concept of your own definition for it that I believe that that's tight of Oneness and Transcendence that you'll talking about when you breathe DMT experiences that says in our love and kindness and loving awareness I believe that is the most real thing I think that preceded o Mater and I think that we that we can interact with it so I don't believe it Go denisovan just a guy away the whole world is like an interactive biological living breathing go there I believe that we are to leave yesterday and we can commune with it and our time for the more the relevance of it for me is that it suggests to me that we should be acting kindly and lovingly and when we think about how do we organize assistant awareness Survivor energy accessible to all of us should be Paramount in our understanding of how we opened it's like we should look at your head like we've been through as human beings have so many Advance the agriculture technology industry thinking that we would let beginner the sun went down there thinking that the Earth was flat with all due respect to any bother restart have an understanding the word that becomes a priority that thing you described like when I have come back from DMT trip I recognize this is just an illusion and it's not real I believe that we need to prioritize that I'm progressing along that line what implications of this not being the most real frequency there is how do we organize Society on that basis how does that affect how we relate to one another what kind of what happened we be governing how how does that suggest it but that should be in instead of how many f****** terrifying arachnoid with gate robot motherfuking you know there's definitely pros and cons with the creation of technology I think of this I think of human beings as if you go back to single celled organisms have very little awareness of their environment and then as it became primitive bugs you know it's as if things involved they develop more awareness but even us in comparison to certain animals animals have heightened senses of smell and survival instincts but they also color blind they don't see things they see Edge detection I just wanted things about deer they see movement so I give you wear camouflage and you know your pattern is broken up with a grid and then you stay put they don't see you yeah they're just did that doesn't mean doesn't register to them they see movement so we have a far more complex system of recognition than they do in terms of like visually the way we see things and I think that whatever skills or whatever does that we've evolved I don't think that's it I don't think that we reached the Pinnacle of it and I think that as beings become more and more evolved they're probably gain more more senses and that could be directly related to technology it's totally possible that what's going on with technologies that we're also developing through external means a way for us to see the world the way for us to be like what they've done with the Large Hadron collider's like the best exam the right what they do with the Hubble Space Telescope another telescopes uear using technology to gain awareness and to see more things and that this is the good side of technologies that it's allowing us to have a far greater understanding of all the variables that surround us that we might not be able to detect with our sense is that this is a part of who we are and then I think when you're talking about things like psychedelic experiences that's probably another realm of understanding that we haven't really achieved yet because around us that we might not be able to detect with our sense is that this is a part of who we are and then I think when you talk to me about things like psychedelic experiences that's probably another realm of understanding that we haven't really achieved yet because we're we're still evolving as as a as a species as a thing</div>

The money is weird where the money goes what's alkyd towards the biggest problem in our country is he's in impossible to escape communities it's so many people just get sucked into this trap and for every person that gets out becomes a basketball player successful business person and they have his story about the poverty they grew up in they they are so rare yes and it's not to be applauded that they got through that with it is but it's more to be we should understand the kids got a real f****** problem that we're turning out all these people that live did they start out in life with a massive deficit start out in life emotionally f*** physically abused they start out with everybody around them so loser everybody's going to jail everybody is doing currently doing pills or they're so that it's all negative and ask them to develop their own positive mindset uniquely in a vacuum is preposterous all those assholes talking about you you've never seen that you never been involved in that kind of poverty there about people that's what she f****** care about the lowest you could lives like a middle-class existence holyshit I mean obviously that's way past the expectations that we have right now for the world because like $34,000 a year globally put you in the world 1% you know I mean that's the ones you make $34,000 a year which is hard to live on man you're in the one percent of the world that stand it that you've described is I think achievable when you give just one example of how the bias of legislation is continually to support the powerful while making the just making normal gestures ^ 8 defines Us in until they're all systems codes regulations that prioritize that we will continue to live in something heading to what if not disturb your stomach moving in the direction of dystopia where the priorities and dreams are really by the mad Evil insect robot images character when you see some guy who's not he doesn't it have $1000000 like you Bow Wow got a million dollars that you must be so relaxed sweat so much money do you get a hundred and fifty billion and he works everyday maniacally and he's constantly doing new projects in new things and buying out Whole Foods and that's like Pinnacle capitalism was one of the things that scares people the most when someone just requires just insane position of power and wealth like like a bill gay take care of you who is very altruistic very very generous Bill Gates's keys are one of the better examples of someone who gains a lot of money and then does a lot to help people especially in his retirement all all they do is focus on charitable organizations and impoverished community in America in Turlock week the systems that we have are all well if you'll pull out another bootstrap modal well this guy did it look at this great value of a Kind yard until like I feel like in a sense of valve but you and I England unless we have integral relationships with one another always pull whenever we really are on a team we see someone who's completely downtrodden who's on our team and we ignore them but that's not much of a f****** team is it even that's what I feel like when I come to red lights when I see homeless people I feel terrible I'm like I feel like what you know I mean there's parties like don't give him any money cuz they know they're going to just buy drugs let him figure it out but then they're not going to take it out to health issues play on the team they probably aboard America they probably have National citizenship here you know this is our team and don't gives a f*** if they're camped out under the bridge it's like the diffusion of responsibility that comes with these massive numbers of 20 million and La 300 plus whatever it is now is like 3:20 in America about the Transcendent states that can be achieved through meditation and psychedelic meaning the beans like ice can access them type of creature type of being a little more evolved than us that would look back and say oh my God animals how you know I'm not disputing what you're saying that transpose I ain't going off hustle and bustle f*** you you if you're down by the wayside here we have an obligation to respond to the bad parts about nature Ruby farming in that white ocean have social system is always the same because if you were to change in that area it will affect the interest of the powerful it will impede the delay is an organization's to make profit coconut Reef some level access to that then we can start to organize I was on that basis not on the basis of what was the most I can get an individual which rationale for me to be involved in that other than affect me personally but not is not one person and even collectively as a group when you have mental health issues unless you want to institutionalize those people yeah but then here's a thing right if everyone has a unique and if everyone has their own ideas for what to do with the life and everyone has Freedom what are you just don't have enough people that are interested in mental health of the homeless people just don't have enough there's no resources Guaranty have a good government funding you think that they can cure homelessness what does it means I have to help my own recovery this puts me in 2 areas institutions groups facilities David they don't like these women do between people in the guy that just Wings they all be the person I'll be the person in La at Friendly House it was a woman who Peggy Albrecht but you still going to play a friendly houses up for women of Court drug addiction and abuse issues unlock this woman she was from Chicago she was 90 years old by the time like a rude and Brilliant and beautiful and entirely willing to dedicate capacitor play basketball will be a comic spot those people encouraged uppity invisible biases in the direction of profit and like the failure of certain parts of socialism doesn't mean at the end of the Alcan I think we have an obligation to look for ways of accessing around and seeing how we can organize this is a systemic problem is also the problem with homeless people in that they're adults when you become an adult and you develop from the time your child it's probably very likely that the damage was all done while they were young. Probably abused and neglected and there's a lot of issues that led them to either have mental health problems or they had mental health problems already maybe of genetic problems then on top of that there's drug abuse to eat for each one of those people to get well you're going to need a massive amount of folks I have one old lady who's rude who's fun and Brilliant movie it's optimism in the crib now Joe because I know but I'm saying it would almost be insurmountable and it's very hard once a person has developed around the community and save the future help like less people get through f***** help let help more people get through with hope and with a real possibility for improving their life versus have the sense of hopelessness that many are confronted what that's going to make less crime it's shoved in our face the forces to act but if someone brilliantly calculated the amount of resources that it would require and then also brilliantly calculate how much less crime it would have how much less how many more Innovations because people didn't waste their lives in fact they got through life and used one of most valuable resources we have which is the human imagination and creativity and Ingenuity like and we're missing that on these people that are growing up in these horrible environments where they can ask there's so f*** from there in gangs there you know the crime and poverty and violence are so f***** that whatever genius they have is wasted on this nonsensical existent they could just show them and quantify how much that would be how valuable that would be the overall culture and community of the of the continent and then ultimately of the earth mean you would have a reason engineer think about this almost has to assemble be translated into monetary value because otherwise people read it for everybody for them who live in these horrible Community want to be great again if everybody lived like a middle-class person the idea that that's impossible seems so insane it's almost seems like nobody should live like that then like either everybody should be able to live like that and that's what everybody really wants right you want to be comfortable like an intern your ability to exist and then all the things you're doing that you struggle with should be a good percentage of them other than emotional and friendship type thing should be of your own choosing you choose to take a difficult path you choose to take an adventure you choose to try to enrich yourself with his difficult experience in the challenge of it and try to overcome that challenge instead of your challenges not to get killed by a gang you know your account is not get f***** by your uncle again I mean I mean this is what people have to deal with and you're you're missing these brilliant mind that don't get this chance to come through and and sneak through that f****** salmon ladder you know get up to the top passionate about this and I think popularizing these ideas is important because I feel that then people will be familiar with this kind of language and will recognize that when there is a political discourse you're passionate about this and I think popularizing these ideas is important because I feel that ban people will be familiar with this kind of language and we will recognize that when there is a political discourse how fat and empty it is</div>

Blood unique process Chappelle does and he can turn over an hour like no one I've ever seen before and I was talking to Donnell Rawlings about it recently who was on the Chappelle show with them just like we both agreed like the he's the best ever at turning over a new hour he can have a new what he can release a Netflix special and then have a new hour within a couple of weeks make sense I don't understand how he's doing it he's in a great space do you know he's in a great mindset to do comedy you know if if you pay attention to how you know when when people study I can you read outliers how people when people study why people are great at what they do what makes an exceptional there's always a variety of factors and whatever the factors are with Dave he's got this easygoing personality this like very carefully Carefree way looking at things he's also gone through a lot of bulshit in his career with you know the the leavings the Chappelle show and you know abandoning 50 million dollars and going to Africa and it really understanding what it was real motivation when he was caught up in that world where they were trying to change him and commercialize his television show and he handled it as good as anybody that's ever handled it he handled Fame and Temptation I think better than anyone I've ever heard of you just said f*** you he just went away you went away and then didn't do gigs for years to understand he would show up and do stand-up places but he wouldn't book anything so like he wasn't getting paid it was just he didn't stand up Dave Chappelle did stand-up in the park in Seattle he brought like a little amplifier and a microphone setup and just started doing stand-up a people just gathered round and he did this just to sort of get him back in touch with his route cuz he used to do a lot of street performing in New York I saw him do street performing in Montreal we did a club and then we came out of the club and Dave I think things like 18 and 19 when I just started doing stand-up on the street and put his hat out and people put money in his hat mean he was constantly sharpening that sword and he stopped doing stand-up for a long time in terms of like booking gigs and then after why so f****** imma come back again and then he started doing these gigantic gigs and then of course he did his two recent specials were among his best work ever and you know now he's working all the time he's constantly popping Into The Comedy Store in The Comedy Cellar and all these different clubs all across the country and constantly doing stand-up and no social media does not not involved in any of that stuff doesn't do anything just to purchase performs just doesn't stuff yeah that's interesting when he eats like off and ignited lightsaber Yogi or a priest or something even in a list of prior to the crack back there in the world I think he was 18 I was 21 so it was somewhere in that range maybe a little older maybe who's maybe it's like how old is Dave 4647 but he's five years younger than me is that correct 46 or 47 45 I was probably 25 and he was probably 18ich 2526 1817 but he was he was so like come in like he was very was your attracted to listening to him it was like like look at this guy is so comfortable in his own skin and so friendly and easygoing and hilarious but he was then and then he became is all the work that he put in you know it's like he had this base of this really you know this curious young very wise person who saw things other people didn't see in the world and they just kept going and just kept going and then of course the Chappelle show which is in my opinion the greatest sketch comedy show of all time even though it was only two seasons the best ever and then after that means he's basically just on stand up and done it completely outside of the system he's done up some parts in movies and chill like that but for the most part what he's doing is just stand up completely outside of the Hollywood System completely free just goes up just talk some s*** as a couple of drinks laughs and and and and it's incredibly compelling he's found his Groove you know that's it's a beautiful thing to watch is a fellow stand-up comedy practitioner when someone here treat cheaves this Mastery level Aquino were talking about with this Hixon Gracie of stand-up comedy level cuz that's where he's at right now he's not on social media is not a Nathan Twitter or Facebook and I mean that s*** doesn't pay attention any of it he's just just being a person just being a person and doing stand-up you know it doesn't have to which is unique to you know he doesn't have to promote things they just sell out they had an amazing example of something. example of an amazing example promote something so what do you got the book mentors</div>

Even though I was terrified in that cage tiger sanctuary in India and I like her I didn't like the vehicle I was in well the intensity of being looked at by that f****** creature with is everything we don't reflect on pages to ask don't know what that is so their idea of what the wild is is really based on two things once they're there actual Love of Animals they know right it's like dogs and cats and the animals that we know we we we have this connection with them so we think that they these are animals there's science projects man those are not animals real animals don't give a fuk about you did they do either indifferent to you or scared of you or they want to eat you that's real animals the relationship that you have with a dog is like a child like my dog is more like a child to me than he is like an animal and he's like my little friend that doesn't get to speak he doesn't talk but you know an animal in the wild is a competing organisms are competing amongst all the various organisms in whatever ecosystem there in and either they're at the top or they're there somewhere below that and just how it goes and every deer is looking around cuz there's cats and the cats are slowly sneaking up on them every f****** day of the week and if you go in a place where there's deer you best believe there's going to be mountain lions there cuz that's how it operates and when you see that in the why it's so rare it's so rare to be around that when you see that in a while then you get a deeper understanding what it means to be an animal what is factory farming with perverse and disgusting is the way animals are treated when these lives these livestock companies pompeys animals these warehouses and make them stand on their own s*** all day and then abused them and their horrific nature in which there is that all that should be illegal whistleblowers get arrested what goes into your food and those people are being punished for that all that s*** is being punished cuz it hurts business that's how I feel about it I don't think there's anything wrong with even if they if there should be standards and how cows are raised how chickens are rates let him live like actual cows I feel useful and there's a way that they can do that where people like Chris Pratt Guardians great guy he has he raises sheep and he eats them and he even gives them out to people as butchers that take care of it these sheep or treated like like they're loved and not scare people and then literally they get walked into this room have no idea what's going to happen a bolt gets put on the top of their head bang in the lights go out and you could say that should never happen and no sheep should just live forever okay you could I can understand that argument or you could say boy if you're going to eat me and you going to eat the meat of an animal that you know how it lived and there was no horrific moments in its life it just one day the lights went out that seems like the best most ethical way to do it perhaps more ethical than hunting hunting an animal it's you know what's out there in this is crazy state where it's always looking to get eaten these sheep have no idea that can be eaten they think that everybody is everybody and then one day they die so you could do that same like thought expand with people like want you to see people want to locate a person live in perfect life to put a bolt in the top of there at a bank shut the lights out and then they turn into barbecue look at yeah that's a very pronounced and Vivid wipe all excited and it says we will be like we're being commodified imprisoned in closing the very fact that Lord has been made to prevent people regulate in a revealing the truth around that is dealing with us</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> anyway I think that one of those coaching jobs this podcast has performed this is not whether deliberately or not is it demonstrates that they old political lines that we used to comfortably applied within a starting to sort of breakdown cuz you know like something like an obvious signifier of a particular type of person. Now we have to accept you that needs to be Denny's disgusting they are going to bed we have complete and total agreement when we both can see that the way that legislation is set up is biased toward Cooper interest commercial interests and profit for me the things that I'm making a genuine difference to the the white people are living life and it seems to me that the one of the parties is in the new Global landscape that we live in with what are the dominant forces and what are the goals of the dominant force it and how detached those ghosts from the lives of what you might say Ordinary People the majority of people to use less complex time and what's probably most horrific about reforming the system is that the people that are going to suffer the most of the people that have so like if you think of like fast food in particular right there's a lot of rug really poor people that would rely on fast food because it's very inexpensive if you go and you can get a lot of calories for a small amount of money right but if you go from the fast food restaurant and then you go down the line to factory farming and then somehow they eliminate factory farming and they said they're not going to raise animals you have to have the same sort of standards that we would expect if we knew you if we were are we want pastures we went to animals living in the wild we want me know you don't fenced-in but like living like an actual animal not this crazy Warehouse bulshit you guys are running well that's going up our operation crossbow then that's how it's going to be so then the beef becomes far more expensive now to beef becomes far more expensive then what a fast-food what are the restaurants do what they're going to have to make things more expensive to so who's going to start for the poor people who's going to suffer with cheap meat and Supermarket for people that can't afford it what happened to Joey's you stop to put you and start to pull a Fred that reviews the how the fabric of our culture is corrupted because it shouldn't be more expensive than the reason is more expensive because everything is put into a capital-based Audiology we're already on the show you discussing Universal basic income this is not the beginning of looking at alternative economic models and everyone has the right to fire everyone has the right to a safe house yes I'd like it if we stop prioritizing those ideas about these organizations have to write to maximize profit maximizing profit table and then there comes your counter argument about Innovation what if Innovation slows no problem because we've all we've decided is a culture to prioritize housing and nutrition for the majority of people now you can still say that you know that haven't you have to we have to break down centralized system whether those are corporate centralized system or national the time is gone where there's too much stuff to take Sanders We are tearing to unconsciously or otherwise use these groups have the right to make so much money that is very kind and to interfere with that is on American or on British or whatever it was cuz you know I'm sure so we have to rule out the Porsche whenever that conversation start get shot down because even in a capitalist system wouldn't it be more ethical if everybody started from the same starting block well that's what's wrong with the world right what's wrong with the world of some people or not they have a terrible hand of cards have been dealt you know and my point about food is that the people that are going to they're going to suffer the most are the people that rely on the cheap food gets pulled away then a lot of those soup markets in a lot of those fast-food stores that rely on that factory farm food you know they're going to be in a bad situation things going to be much more expensive and if things are much more efficiently if they make animals live like what is that guy's name polyface Farms Joel salatin yeah he's a fascinating cat I had it on my podcast before you sort of a farm reformist and what he believes is that these animals should live just like animals when he has he puts them in a fenced area but he moves the fenced area everyday so like the pigs move to a different spot until they just constantly forging and eating acorns and but there you know they're living like a pig they're living in a nap they're not living in some crazy Warehouse same with his chickens he has his mobile chicken coop in the moves it from pasture to pasture and this is how he operates his entire Farm we've told by Alia that we like if we look at that no one knows what's right so perhaps we could try and do is replicate what we do not truly Caroline anybody else for your food well then you're not participating in that s*** at all you think that the spirit of Entrepreneurship could be turned to designing these systems do you think the only thing that incentivizes people with maximum profit leave in time I talked to him physical top 10 Littrell toxins and toxicity cultural toxicity and how am I to protect my children from cultural influences how can we start to recognize look is it time to look at different systems for living and I feel like people want to be involved in that in the Power Systems that affect them like you have a group of a hundred people that want a big bathroom run their own schools run their own cast systems about the subject when capitalism reaches a certain point people will be glossed Eileen I ate the food like a cog in the machine no one will have no pride in their work none will know what it's like to make a whole bicycle and think that makes the potatoes listen to Neptune PSN to understand that there are limitations to what socialism and Marxism can achieve but just because you know capitalism is better than feudalism that doesn't mean that the end of the conversation that we shouldn't be looking for therapy</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm interested in where again in with your own do you feel connected to the person you were as an adolescent did you know is in your own parenting do not receive in the type of choices you might cuz they make something for yourself you operate within it and you are quite protected and you are independent and not forced to deal with too many negative outside influences set me as a father and dealing with colleagues and stuff like that do you experience a lot tension anxiety what what happened to that guy transcended that cuz I do that when I'm doing bothering my child self if I cannot cuz I wouldn't doing those kind of things when I was a kid on tricycle with just going to BJJ class just relax what you doing with that there's always going to be very different to who I was when I was young boy I mean but I'm just a totally different human being I remember it but I remember it with humor like I remember a laugh on my plow so silly I was so weird back then and you know with life experience and developing confidence and understanding of who you are and why you had those feelings why you were insecure why I had so much self-doubt martial arts help me with that with that tremendously because it was the first thing that I ever did but I didn't feel like a loser in the first thing that I ever did wear like respected and they liked me for it you know I'm like wow this is like something is it was a feeling that I was completely unused to in the 14 previous years of my life all the sudden there was this this feeling that I was unusual I was unique I was special and I was appreciated early on so he allowed me train there for free and just so teach classes and teaching classes help me a lot as well because when you teaching your breaking down techniques and your you know you when you're showing someone how to do what you really cementing those Pathways in your own mind yeah yeah that's right connect you to the beginning of the journey would still you know the do the Journey of Jiu-Jitsu is a fascinating one because unless you're someone who's you know a saulo Ribeiro or John Jacque Machado or just a true Master who's dedicated their entire life to it the journey so long it's so long it's like if you're a guy who runs you like to run a 3-4 days a week no big deal but then you know your next-door neighbors an ultra marathon runner is preparing for the the Moab 240 are you going to run 240 miles never going to catch up the same amount of time so you should always defer to that person when you have questions about running and that's how it is what you did to it cuz you know what yeah I'm a black belt but I'm not a black belt like John Jacque Machado is a black belt is it there's levels to even to that so I always have questions so the journey is never over it's always long is always a better way to get out of an armbar or a better way to set up a triangle or whatever it is they're one of the beautiful things about Gigi to is that it's so flax there's so many variables there so many situations and interactions and exchanges and entries and defenses and and and wait a chain moves together and that the correct way to set something up to three steps ahead to know that if you grab their lapel this way the guys going to try to shake it off that way and that exposes this which exposes dad and then the next defense was both discs and then you keep going and going and going and going until you get them it's so beautiful to watch Network rid of interrelated signs that will work together unlike as a white belt buckle three stripes now dive Pool Pass be another people at the hands and feet look different to my hands and feet different from mine is mine waffle is like there is my ego comes back in 24 hours are you going to have to get used to that used to defeat but it's it's humbling is very good for you and you know I don't know how many times I've been tapped out my life but probably more than a thousand right. Like he wasn't actually applying a submission but they're just as she is comfort of having someone there their Pulte this weather that's hilarious feeling it's also very satisfying to defend against something that someone used to catch you with like save someone's a really good at taking your back and showed you a couple times and then one time they take you back but you defend and you get out you like I doubt there's an escape I can make this I'm getting better my love being in the spice because never bother trying I'm not good at this stage in my life because do something I'm not good at this competitive Bible on the hotel Grace Iran UK my teacher gave me a blue belt that would look good man videos like a manipulation gives out a bad belt it's very bad for their integrity it's the deed the school would lose face so badly in the community and you meet someone who's Hixon Gracie brown belt that motherfukers a Hicks and Gracie brown belt he's as legit as they get they don't get any more legit like if you got to that point of Hixon Gracie gives you a brown belt it's I just it's irrefutable and that's how it should be in this a beautiful thing about the art form is that it has the self-correcting sort of aspect to it that when you roll when you spar with each other your ability or lack of is exposed and there's no other way around it yeah that's good to know avoid. it your ability or lack of is exposed and there's no other way around it yeah that's good to know avoid that and keep going</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but I'm interested as well with bringing up the subject DMT like what however I'm a crafty bastard when it comes to stop and I'm always looking for an in you're not going to see your kind of best treasure trails over there when I ate some yes you said that right is a lost dog stop holding my hand now the cbd-rich Cannabis softgels cloth Bennett inflammation which tends to have a corresponding impact on on your anxiety mg of THC does that mean Relax Inn Franklin anxiety I will say that I'm interested in the house how many philosophical connotations underwire that he uses the information he's getting from hallucinogenic to speculate on how we should organize to start a war it was the invitations are afraid of his refusal to accept that there was a certain kind of experiences they should be prohibited that is ridiculous. Should be prevented from having relief Weber's premeditation or even sport sex being relieved of the burden of the constantly thinking mind when I hit like those vivid descriptions of DMT realm or I West something in the Hunger Hunger you worried that you're trying to get intoxicated you worried that you're but you're trying to find a loophole yeah cuz I am doing that problems with addiction that I've done psychedelics and didn't have a problem but I'm sure some people have had problems and I don't know about that DMT is interesting in that first of all it's very quick the experience is only about 15 minutes 20 minutes max and it's also it's not necessary it's not intoxicant in the way that you think about traditional you still you in the face of this experience and I think I think it's some sort of a chemical Gateway and that's what I think I think there's a Gateway in your mind that can lead to some other dimension it's probably there all the time continually existing realm that human beings on accessing because of that particular by a chemical formulation of Consciousness as it is in this point in our Revolution like eight more real and more real stuff in there dribbling basketball you can look at you and read meaning into a had an emotional quality they're made out of something in the move they change like they don't stay what they are there constantly evolving in front of you into something more and more beautiful you feel like I knew nothing that was the most profound aspect like the all of the stuff you concentrate on everyday is nonsense and there is some other thing that's connected that's probably influencing World probably went with people see when they have near-death experiences they depictions of the afterlife I mean that's probably what it all is and religious experiences oh my God I went into this realm this beings I told me we were wandering Moses's experience with the burning bush to the acacia tree acacia tree which is Rich and DMT the burning bush is with God was to Moses and that through this Burning Bush she came out Ten Commandments of how people should live their lives I mean that easily could have been just a very convoluted sort of translation of a DMT trip call HJ become as gods and since that is some realm that we can reach through that experience with sink that puts into perspective everything else we spirits in the material realm I'm not feeling seems there in your words be emanating love and understanding while ever-changing completely formless and communicate and love and understanding that should become a priority LaserShip without realm and to bring about by experience I don't even mean in a little while cuz even Terence McKenna that there was some people vulnerable so he was probably referring to people at me that probably shouldn't mess around with that kind of not really talking about people schizophrenia which he believed he have by the way the way people interact with the world itself I think if we lived in a healthy World Civilization healthy relationship with psychoactive substances we probably have centers where you would have illegitimate Shaman a medical adviser and someone would take you through a guided experience we're doing that now with ketamine there's a lot of people that are very depressed that are having these physician controlled ketamine experiences that have had a profound effect on their depression my friend you'll Brandon's gone through several of them and he's a comedian a very funny describing it was hilarious going to a doctor's office at ripping his f****** balls off you know the doctors shooting him up with intramuscular ketamine states that ketamine I've never experienced what it does but it's apparently soundly the hallucinogenic and you have a wild crazy experiences on it and for whatever reason it has a great impact on depression for a lot of people I think it's a prospective enhance but it also does something to rewire the mind using as usual you need to be under that shamanic conditions while you're wherever station one fight like never world this is crazy I need some help me out we doing it with my motivation is it when I hear people talking about my Recollections are experiencing what felt like Golden by God I mean a sense of one listen to my individual identity important thing in the world I can remember when I'm driving or when I'm dealing with people or if I'm buying something off I'm feeling you. there is a someone is being seduced by fire because of my well being outside of myself and knowledge that there is an interconnection that will take care of you that's accessible I guess I'm you know hungry to Sophia get there in a flotation tank you can get there through holotropic breathing I've never done Kundalini Yoga but apparently the people to get really deep into Kundalini Yoga can literally have DMT trips I have friends that have done DMT and have experience DMT trips through Kundalini but you have to be really dedicated to me in this a lot of time a lot of time a lot of energy and you have to really understand the methods and and follow them to a T and U Steve these Altered States Of Consciousness that are apparently not from my personal experience but from people tell me incredibly profound yeah I mean do you know the difference between feeling something that's that overwhelming that gives you no choice cool mind me to Consciousness like I'm not this isn't who I am this is just a temporary experience and all the value systems of a world are built upon the Primal Drive in collaboration with a culture the lights to stratify people and manage people and operate like a massive Farm easiest keep people together operating in these kind of your name is great pace so I thought that was turning me on about the DNC and I went camping is the weight and advised that the you going to meet characters and stuff like that it's and it's going to be playing and Beyond doubt you know like you know when the prophet returns from the burning bush or the cave they come back and they say all this stuff that you'll take it seriously is not real. oh you are going to live in hell on Earth you're going to be dropping by your materialistic drives your sexual drive is going to imprison you and it turns out that that right cuz I'd like to know I suppose one off. I don't want to be continually dragged into these collect like working with institutions let you know I'm over here doing the bloody I'm glad to be a funny story about that if you wanted spiritual information starting to live I know a person is obsessed with p**** sex or drop the weather like going to be coming to become what you actually off the recognizable different your perfect realization of you is going to involve come in and order these things if creative gift access you're not the one who decides what no one with an opioid epidemic born angry lonely well I think what you can do is be yourself and what you can do is express yourself and where you can do is constantly seek to improve and grow and you are doing those things so if you're saying can I do these things can I be comedic and spiritual and what you're doing it so ready to see whether or not you're so if you're saying can I do these things can I be comedic and spiritual and what you're doing it you're doing it it's all just a matter of what whether or not you're satisfied with your progress and where you are and who you are and how you express yourself</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I thought saying that that there was a particular condemnation of Mal energy that have been physically abusive or maybe around that and you just it's very convenient and very easy to just generalized and decide the all men are negative masculine energy is negative and especially white males and if you say that you'll get props online people go yes girl yes clap clap clap people get excited but those are also people that are short-sighted like you want to make as many people your allies you can you want to make as many people your friend as you can and you have to understand that there's some people that are just wired different than you there's something there's some girly girls and there's some really feminine men and then there's a masculine man and then and it but everybody is okay as long as they were back to you in a kind of each other but the problem is we associate certain behaviors and characteristics with either negativity or Hedonism or toxic masculinity or someone being a b**** as a man and that's these generalizations are often way more harmful and just it's just too convenient and Easy in the lazy 2 year old and a one-year-old right and there you know when Los Angeles bikini line more minutes on a didn't want to sign love this kid kid regarding these things or actually construction when I say a child's bikini but there's no reason for any child of Amy sex or gender 3 wearing a bikini Costa has made me feel like I don't obviously and I know you have to stay till 3 just not put any pressure on them and let them enjoy their life and let them find their path that's with its Woods weird right it's like I see people there you know they're getting their their daughters to dress very very feminine little mini skirts and stuff in there 5 years old and high heel shoes are some little kids with high heel shoes cuz he was very strange to me I don't like it 20 year old woman wear to analysis I'm sure you have a problem with it lipstick is to emphasize the lips cuz it's rather than of the vagina the high heels make a woman seemed Obama going to accentuate aspects or photoshop text to Acuna why we live rock in it but I can't you can't see the influence of cultural forces that are not neutral but I think it should be up to the choice the person once they're an adult the real problem is putting pressure on them to dress one way or another and not letting them find their place but if a woman becomes you know whatever age you decide and she wants to wear high heels and ask her cuz she likes the way it looks like there's nothing wrong with that either are the D nation of sexualities also problem and I don't think it is almost as much of a problem as people who will pray upon vulnerable people did the people people that think there's something wrong with being sexually attractive or something wrong with being desirable or wanting to be desirable is anyone with that either and that kind of suppression the suppression of the these feelings that you have in this desire that you have is very unhealthy as well as a normal thing to want to be sexual normal thing to want to look good if a girl looks good in a skirt a skirt and high heels and she likes to dress like that who the f*** is anyone to say is anything wrong with that there's nothing wrong with it if that's what she likes that's fine which is it which interesting to me is particularly in really Progressive ideology they look down upon women who wear short skirts and high heels and a lot of makeup and you know open tops that show their does he think that it's they're playing into the patriarchy or that there's somehow or another falling into these gender traps but yet they celebrate that in transgender people they celebrate that and trans man the transition to women and then they they they really doll it up then they like you go girl and they're celebrating the fact that this person is embracing these traditional aspects of Womanhood will you see that a lot with you know people that are celebrating trans women very fast what would be sexualized dress like a expression expressive jewelry in that like that it's the typically the lover down the claw claw structure you are the more likely you are to dress in a way that is exhibited wave not liking a women afro blue color background dress in Weiser exposing revealing men have Larry kosman loss-of-use in jewelry expressive why is it demonstrated wealth Sol Y of condemning particular types of Womanhood that might not just be sourced from dress this way for the male gaze it can also be a wife and dressing that widen indication of a lower class background or the particular type of ethnicity and there's a lot of women that just don't have the type of physical body that looks good in a short skirt with high bills and you know a low-cut shirt and they don't like when they see it another women because they don't they're not comfortable with their own bodies did that there's a reality of that me women get as much or more hate from women as they ever do for men and it particularly if women find you to be too overtly sexual with the way you dress or behave that you are you're you know you're damaging male-female relationships are damaging the dynamic particular office Dynamics there's one girl in the office at Tramp it up you know when she's in all the guys are paying attention to her when will get mad at her I did an interview why would I why so talked about like parenting our kids me and my wife have a parent kids and I said like a few months the most dominant parent she's much more practical than life is my wife you know regardless of our respective sexy is the more efficient dominant parent she's much more likely with fly with me if my dog has I will not chocolate fountain for me text phone addiction he's amazing and he says because if you're having anxiety and pain from your own childhood with no disrespect to my magnificent parents like you can't handle seeing your kids suffer so you'd like straight why you by Ayo and do what she wants to stop that's what happens I think your multimedia is like trains what you say then you have to defend

		<div class="paragraph"> I stopped to wonder your who is it that she's involved in this stuff starts at what is where I'm at now is all we even capable of belonging to groups units tribes of 300 million people or 60 million people with so many diverse so I did is this a time to look up federalism differently to stop breaking down well you know they exist Diamond are you running on me and build roads if people are starting to operate in smaller units but I'm thinking we need to have a real sense of community and connection call let go of looking for ways to eject to and Jaja paper was some so primary for wire forming around a tendency toward some sort of understanding that a lot of these boundaries and these clans of states and countries they were all staff without our consent before we were born and we're we're just we're part of a system that we just were we didn't agree to it we just all the sudden found ourselves in it and we're trying to make it fit us yeah that's right appealing a world cop I really Correo English perfectly financially in time speak to I am an individual and to root for your team and a root against other teams it's it's so deep-seated in this it's and it can cause so many unnecessary conflicts for no reason just it's it's so it's so escapable to it's it's somewhat so if you can effectively analyze the way human beings behave and interact with each other and go why do we do this let's just stop doing that if we disagree on things how much are these disagreements actually affecting me on a daily basis. That much can we just communicate can't someone say what they think and I say what I think and we just decide like what makes sense and what doesn't make sense based on her own interpretations is not possible he seems like it's that's the direction we go ahead and aliens who like on the subjective you know individuals like when she says stuff like a people should get over slavery or see if it didn't happen I didn't agree with that I feel like that had a massive social impact but it's the toaster tistics and not coming incidents the number of people is Sutton ethnicities in prisons in Emporia whatever issues delightful. So funny and sweet and it seems very young if you really stopped to think about 28 which is amazing and she's so much more than I was when I was 28 she said no one would ever listen to my opinions on anything Congressman she's so I caught her a lot of slack with some of the things that she's made like missteps on but I think sometimes when people say those things like people should get over slavery it's like it's almost like you're saying things that you think other people want to hear more than you're saying things that are really rational the weather now we should get over slavery shirt slavery was over more than a hundred years ago but the repercussions of slavery The Echoes of slavery still exists and they exist in all these different Southern State cities in all these different neighborhoods that I've been a part of systemic racism where they literally Force black people to live in certain areas and didn't even allow them to buy homes outside of those areas they made the laws and those laws are in place to place like Baltimore and you know I had this guy Michael Wood on police officer was it they found papers that were documenting crimes from the 90 Aldi's in Baltimore anywhere in the same area the same crimes that he was facing in the 2000s when he was a police officer so he was looking at this going what in the f*** like this is am I just a part of something that's never going to be fixed and never going to be changed and you know as he learned more about the city in the city's laws and how these these systems were set up to keep people in certain places and how the crime and the violence in the drugs call Justin this one concentrated area that's always been there and no one does anything to change it you realize like wow this is a is it crazy echo of a horrible past and that's what it is I had a couple of conversations that made me recognize how powerful systems and institutions are and their ability to maintain themselves it regardless of an individual do what for the British diplomatic service at the time of 9/11 was privy to confidential information about how that was handled on the military and geopolitical level and he said like he's come away from that thinking corrupt wife-to-be shoot-around objectives control with Cara murder in each of them raping each other simply not true that's one of the means by which the state continues to justify its existence people will buy the closer they are to self-governing Community Health, and community we didn't he wasn't here as he went Greece had that mad Revolution he was like when the leaves of a party so rich so I'm from minute it was like you screwed if you are the German Finance Minister you got the power. German Finance Minister hide you can't step out so I didn't start. Robinson why don't we do this more than we do that the system itself is beyond individual decisions and I'm sure if you were really interested in changing the world you have to participate in systems are outside of it yeah, it was a trophy on its own I think also change yourself and when you change yourself becomes evident to the people around you and if your change is beneficial and attractive people they gravitate towards that idea that you can improve yourself and you can change your perspective on things I think also change yourself and when you change yourself becomes evident to the people around you and if your change is beneficial and attractive people they gravitate towards that idea that you can improve yourself and you can change your perspective on things</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> races that lady's going to run and don't run those race you know it's a good it's a good question I think it's we're really going to go through like a cultural change on how we think about that you know it's it's morphing so quickly you know what I mean I'm very much because I am of this opinion that there is no such thing as like perfect fairness and when we make those distinctions were always choosing who to allow and because I think we should choose to allow like trans people to participate in society I'm for an inclusive approach where you know we're able to like find a find like a model that allows those folks to compete fairly in a way that everybody's happy with I think that's the I think that's what we should do you know and that to me is like that's what makes me like sports more you know is those comparisons like you know another thing that pissed me off so much was like a f*** what's his name Runner who then killed his girlfriend about this guy that his that his prosthetic is an advantage with those things is you put you seen him right they don't even look remotely like feet it's a crazy because mechanics work is that a spring you put energy into it and you get a little bit less energy out right so cuz that's the laws of thermodynamics but you can get more out that you put in except a muscle does give you more than you put in because of muscle converts food into energy for a brief. Right and so he does he have Sprint Springs he doesn't have a machine in his leg the way there best deal that creates Force out of food question is whether or not the lower half of his legs which is what he's missing could make up for the the advantage the mechanical advantage of the shape of those things which applies all sorts of really unusual leverage when you're running totally or not yet mean I don't I don't know if it's if you took him with full legs and took him with those things they run the same amount of time but the thing it we can run fast as fuk with those things well he could write but where's all the other double amputees who are like you know, Henry running track and field how many of them are trying to connect Paralympics is huge there's like a ton of paralympic athletes you know like I've been told that it has a mechanical advantage with someone who actually should know what they're talking about but I want them I would like to look it up do those legs pistorius's legs and stuff at the time from whatever I scientist I said that it didn't so that's the point that I was trying to make was looking at that Olympics event with that guy in it you know I'm so happy he was in his right if it does give you an advantage Wayfair competition that would be designed by God to be perfect and be perfectly fair right brother always making choices about what kind of competition we want to have and who we want to allow into it and what's her outcome we want it have you know what I mean just like in baseball too many home runs move the mount up or down you know how they change the rules a little bit cuz they want more home runs same thing with same thing with track and field we change the rules a little bit to allow this person that allow this person right I didn't know were talking about people we should always try to include more people not less we should you know if any pay your double-amputee you can get your way into the Olympics you can make a plausible case I think we should try to entertain that notion and we should try to find a way to get that guy in there right as far as trans athletes go you know we could have we could sit here and talk for 3 hours about like all the different ways that hormones might affect your body might not affect your body and I'm not an expert on that I don't want to claim to be right but a sports with a trans athletes who are you competing with the with their gender right that is a sporting world that I'm more interested in right and I think we should find a way to make it happen I know it can be really complicated complicated and messy right and just be a lot of bad about it and it's going to make it to be uncomfortable you know there's a lot of arguments but you know I hope that that's the world that we've moved forward to that's my that's my point of view my point of view is that there's a reason there's a distinction there's a reason why we make the distinction to have male Athletics vs Phim Athletics the reason is that mail have a physiological physiological advantage over women so in most sports most physical Sports we do not have males compete with females the question becomes when someone who is male Transitions and becomes female do those same physiological advantages apply and what what are the what is the evidence will the evidence in competition seems to be that it shows that it does apply particularly in weight lifting rugby mountain biking power Heavy Sports that that favor larger people stronger bodies males that transition to females have a significant advantage in their breaking World Records so if you're a woman and you're a natural woman and you don't take any extra hormones are male hormones not taking steroids or any sort of performance-enhancing drug you're doing your very best to compete in your at the top of the heat but then someone comes along that was a man for 30 years and decides there going to be a woman this has happened and literally transition of 2 to go and compete as woman and destroys records and dominate you in that sport that's b******* and that's not competing on a Level Playing Field that's a person whose biological email and who is a male for 30 plus years of having testosterone run through their body and effects are 10 strengths and affect the shape of their bones and the mechanical advantages of the male hips versus the female hips and then they're competing with smaller people who've been a woman their whole life not fair it's it's is as much cheating as taking steroids when the other person doesn't or taking performance-enhancing drugs when the other person doesn't maybe even more so maybe even more so because you also have there's a bunch of advantages in terms of reaction time that males enjoy it's like it's some significant difference in reaction time between males and even untrained males vs female professional athletes AimPoint being the one that I already made right that like I don't think that there is such a thing as a perfectly Level Playing Field I think we decide what kind of Plainfield we want to have sure where we don't allow men to compete in women's division and I think that that distinction may be breaking down a bit right and I think it may be time to break down the distinction first of all the there's there's a lot of stuff to make out of my head one thing is a particular person who decided to transition at the age of 30 right and they were very big and strong before right and they decide to transition out that is a type of person that exists right I think over the next certainly 30 years we're going to see you know now that I understand that being trans is just the way that people are right there just people who are trans you know and this is something that we're going to accept and support right you seen folks transition much much earlier age you know and you know working with those hormones you know from that age right they're not going to have the other their body situation would be very different than the one that you that that you postulated right I also know from my trance friends that the the effects of the hormones have on your body are like really profound you know like really really profound like we're not like a surprising degree right and so you know I have look if the question is how does you know how does a person who start taking hormones in a particular age right how does your body change and how does it affect these of BFF performance I don't know we certainly are in one particular we just scratched up on the idea of kids transitioning in the very early age I mean there's been more scientific evidence appointed if kids don't do that than it when they want to be Transit early as they just become gay men and that there's nothing wrong with that either there's no reason to give kids hormones and there's no reason to decide before a person's frontal lobe is completely completely fully develop assessment take place to their 25 people don't know who they are you you won't even do people even give her seven-year-old phones you don't let them vote you're going to let them decide what sex are going to be here a little wiser the research that I've seen and again I'm not an expert on this and it and you know I'd love to visit conversation I'd love to talk about on our show and I specifically love you know this is before physical topic where I really want to make sure that I know the research and you know also wore in the transpo Casino in this conversation but soda touch on just what I've you know my I've seen the research I've seen is that trans kids from a young age they are incredibly consistent in their went me know when your expression is gender identity and a big giant was in a lot of human beings like you know it was research that was surveying and tracking like trans kids who declared died and become a young age did it change the answer was generally know it really didn't and you know I have a friend who has a leather trans kid doing the kids attacked age but you know we're in the age Range Rover talking about and you know he's explained that like well you know my child from a very young age consistently like said I am a girl like and has never contradict themselves never chase find enter the Humane thing and the thing that he thought was going to do as a parent was still like Embrace that choice on his child part right and yeah that's her choice meaning hormone really like like Embrace that identity on the part of the child till like a Indian way that being being gay isn't a choice you that's who they are if they think that there are girl why do you have to give them hormones to make them more of a girl because I'm so I can you expand on the question what's a simple question if you say that the child thinks it's a girl so you going to give the child hormones If the child thinks it's a girl Let It Be a Girl Like You don't have why are you adding if you're shooting hormones into a child and UF acting the Child Development you're saying that's not a choice this nonsense of course it's a choice you're choosing to chemically change this child's body fat using to inject things in this child's body on a regular basis that are going to radically affect the physical development of their body and you're saying that this isn't a choice was definitely a choice to do that so so what trans people Express and again I'm not a next this from me talking about transparency and you know seeing what other kind folks say is that the Universe experiencing being trans and not receiving or mosrite of not having the body that you identify with the feeling of dysphoria right is extremely like painful and is a condition onto itself right and that the the feeling of not belonging with the body that you have about mismatched right that seems to be in the bra add variety of humanity the way that some people are born right where their inner self write the self that they argue like I am a1502 they're not sticking their women their like this is the person that I am doesn't match the body that they have right and that gives them extreme distress right and that leads to you know suicide that leads to you no other damaging behaviors right and the best treatment for that that we know exist is to don't have do gender confirmation via hormones and that doesn't affect the suicide rate the suicide rate for Trans people's very high post-op and pre-op it doesn't get affected by whether or not you treat them well the operation all I can do is defer to The Experts that that I know about this right so you know Francis Thursday author name Brynn Tannehill who's a former military helicopter pilot just interviewed her for my new podcast that's coming out soon called actually I'm doing it on Earwolf and it's like a long-form interview podcast by the Trump military ban on trans service and she wrote fantastic book called everything you need to know about trans that like she's a she is now a researcher right and she wins a really deep detail about like here is all of the Medical Science here is all of you hears all the signs about it and so at this point. Conversation I was on confirm their gender identity who they feel they really are I'm all for you doing whatever you want to do when you're an adult when your mind is formed but people change their mind they change their opinion they change their thoughts there's nothing wrong with just assigned to be a game and there's nothing wrong with your body as you grow and mature and develop you growing out of these ideas to some will and some world and the ones who won't they always have the option to do something later on in life but if you do something to warm only block a child very very early on filtering back from that will let me see it let me see if you think of that first of all it's not wrong to be concerned about children and there's a reason this is the most intense part of this conversation and I think it's correct right because we're all very concerned about children right but I do want to say first of all I don't think it's correct that trans people if they don't receive more money from a young age they simply become gay men because I know it happens very often I know trans people cuz it was a big article that was written about that recently about whether or not gender affirmation surgery and hormone blockers on young children is ethical because of this fact and this was what they were talking about where people at one point I wanted to be trans they listed several famous example and then as he became older just decided to be gay including women who wanted man who just became gay women I think what's that girl's name that was in John Wick Ruby Rose she was one of those she wanted to be trans when she was younger and now she's just to gain woman so I know I know quite a few trans folks Ren and I'd be honest none of the ones that I know where I don't know any trans women personally who are gay men up until they transitioned right I know quite a few trans women who are straight men right or who you know live their lives as presented at straight men right and then transitioned right as an orca is that I dunno also among the transpo planner the trans people who speak about this that I've heard so many of them say I wish I had access I knew this about myself at a very young age and I wish to God that I had that we had I had had the ability to receive any of these hormones at a young age my life would be so much better and I'm not going to argue with those folks that have gone through transition surgery if you're looking for anecdotal evidence and you want to be objective you kind of have to look at my side until we can find the anecdotes I'm very curious and is what I go consult my friend or my reasoning to be such a brat Tannehill's I'll work on this to see how many see how many are in each group right now. Which which which sets of these go to the outlier I think the folks that you're talkin about are probably the outliers but I can't you know confirm that have potential crossover according to a Swedish study of 324 patients 341 when were born female surgery was associated with considerably higher risk for mortality suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity than the general population so that's people who got the surgery I am curious with 3.41% of that I mean the details right because how much is the is the higher risk what does it mean 3.1% of female female male to female it's only saying a small percentage of them were born female to transition to male but the larger percentage was mailed to transition to female and that the surgery that they received was associated with considerably higher risks for mortality suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity than the general population sure that's not healing them that's saying that having that surgery is associated with higher risk of mortality suicidal behavior and psychiatric morbidity but it also says above lower gender dysphoria and improve sexual relationship you're looking for something that confirms previously established I'm sort of at the surgery another thing I know from from speaking to transpose to that surgery is over. Besides right and that and that surgery for for those folks is not the you know we as heard of traits of people to put too much emphasis on the surgery yet or not you know and really it's more about what are you living as and what is you know what service it for months do you have right but I would really one of the facility with the topic I really want a shout-out videos made by a friend of mine are her videos are called contrapoints her name is Natalie Lynn and she does these increases a former philosopher philosophy PhD funny videos about isn't nothing about transitions about all types of things should really great one. Comedy recently but you really breaks down like a lot of these misconceptions right and is really change every time I watch one of her videos I'm like learning new things and like new ideas are like you know and I think she took him out and really fascinating person it's an incredibly complex subject for who transition from female to male which is also a different and interesting thing then she fell complete and I don't deny that my entire concern is that you're making decisions for children that this is a completely new thing with no historical precedent we've never done this before does not like a history of hundreds of years of hormone blocker blockers being used on young children and whether or not that is healthy and promotes a positive life I feel like if a child thinks their girl let them live as a girl but you don't have to hormonal engage with their body with chemicals it just seems crazy it seems ill-advised it does it seems like this movement of acceptance and Progressive thinking in in in many ways is a fantastic thing it's a fantastic movement but this seems to me to be a leap and that you're making this leap to confirm your ideology and to confirm that you know you're 100% cool with trans people in your hundred percent and you you're going to recognize this child is trans but you're play something you're you're doing something this child's body you can't turn around and if this child decides at whatever age we decide that you can make rational decisions to transition is trans let them fully developed first let them be a person let them make these decisions based if you want identify as a woman and you want to keep your penis that should be fine to there's nothing wrong with that if you want to keep a functional penis you want identifies woman not even take hormones do that do that stepping in to a developing baby that's only been alive for 6 years and you're shooting chemicals into its body to change the way it develops show me the research show me the Decades of peer-reviewed studies on one of the most important things that we know of the development of a human being where you're going to home or or mortally interact with their body and some sort of a random doctor Frankenstein sort of Alexa what evidence do we have that this is a powerful absolutely look like intelligent smart way to handle a child's life over the long-term like when these kids grow to be 60 as opposed to kids who don't get the the hormone shots when they're six these these people are 15% more happy there's nothing like that be a people jumping into it because it seems like the thing to do because it seems like the tide of society is moving in that direction well I don't jump into it for that reason I do sad when were talking about an issue that affects those people right the first thing we should do is listen to those people who children for them to say I was that child that's nonsense you a similar child in a similar situation you are not twins by its environment they don't know how much their thoughts and expression to be encouraged by their parents they don't know that child sure so my point is when were when you and I are talking about this right now we're speaking pretty hypothetically right we're talking about a child that is not in the room that we don't have we talkin about a fictional trial right so what we really care about are the actual people and when we talked to the actual trans folks write and talk to you no say hey what do you think how do you feel and you know include them in the conversation I think we have a different conversation about it you know we do a man conversation but we also have a different conversation we talked to people that have regret from transition surgery cuz there's a lot of those sure but we're not we don't have either of those folks in there wide range of impression I wasn't I wasn't talking about specifically the impression that it wasn't saying we should reason from anecdotal evidence right I'm saying that look the last conversation I had with a person about this was a was a trans military veteran who is a researcher who wrote a book on on these issues right comprehensively look at the research and told me that the research shows that the evidence that you're asking for exist maybe not on a 30-year timeline but there have been studies of us and here's what we know about them right about children yeah I mean that's that is my understanding that I have not looked the research myself that you know I don't like on my shows the positive benefits of children transitioning I don't think that exist this is something that you know if I can get done on our show and I had doubt driving the recent War I could tell you more it was I know it exists but I can tell you what I have been told Exist by people who have made it their business to know you know so so you know but those are including those folks in this conversation is a really critical part of it for me so what's a conversation the world needs to have for sure and I think it's one that we will have and you know again just to bring it back to Athletics right I think that the undeniable existence of trans children to teenagers to adults who want to compete right and you make a compelling case that they should be able to compete right he is going to be selling that we're going to have to Grapple with easy answers to it and right now yeah I mean I think the real the legitimate solution is a trans leak or a trans division that have a male division of female Division and trans Division if you want to compete athletically that's fair to me that makes sense and the Paralympics is really like it's divided you know how they do it where they do like they got all the different levels for you got this much amputated are your this mobile and you can compete in this why you no answer that's really great to make a way that ProScan can't compete on his level is a plainfield's we can be given the the manifold variations in human bodies right but I would hope that whatever organization we come up with you know allows for the allows for humans in all their variations to compete in the main league as well write on a bionic legs like Steve Austin from The Six Million Dollar Man that want to win so bad they would cut the bottom of their legs off to get Bionic prosthesis then wouldn't really for sure would would you know I wouldn't but I'm not crazy there they are the people who have that feeling that they're supposed to be disabled is so insanely strong and some people if they found out that the hey man I will get the f*** about your feet in your calves man they're going to look just like feet and calves except they allow you to run 45 miles an hour band that regulate your tell me a dude is going to tell the entire world I am not an animal woman they're going start dressing differently they're going to take hormones they're going to like live with the stigma right there going to be in America that women in the bathroom also can happen is you could get some creep who dress up like a woman goes to the mail to the women's bathroom you can get that I mean I'm all for Transit now I'm all for but if you have a bathroom that allows trans people and you get some creep who says I'm just going to pretend to be trans if you don't think that's real then you're crazy of course people do that of course there's any people there and went into the women's room and harass women this is it but it's not in the bathroom and they're creeps and they they probably wanted to go into the female bathroom anyway but they just couldn't do it before and now that there's trans exclusive inclusive bathrooms some creeps have been arrested doing that they're not trans people the real problem is the creeps the real promise of the trans people using the women's room they should force field using like you don't need a lot like it is so if they're not trans people right they are not supposed to be in the bathroom right even if it was not exactly the same way everybody wait you to the bathroom and in the dress versus them being trans see what you see a trans person oven temp trans people look very masculine there's no there's no need to hide we have to ask her dress all we have to ask ourselves is if the hypothetical or if the extremely extremely rare situation that you're disgusting right is so horrifying to us in such a such a big problem that it's worth disenfranchising millions of people from the ability to Simply go to the bathroom when they need to you know if if that extreme Edge case hypothetical case right are we really going to are we really going to you know all of these actual people actually just in case I just needed goddamn go to the bathroom you know in a in a place that is you know safe for me right and I don't think I don't think it is you know like a tweet we can talk about that one Edge case all day long you know what the end of the day when more than one case but I think the question where were there more of are there more trans people or there more sexual predator 100% more trans people than sexual predators were specifically going to put on a dress and in order to go into a bathroom specifically because I'm sure it's a negative she wrote a book that break down all these statistics Minefield of a subject you know soon as you start bringing this s*** up people go crazy cuz it's complicated and and people they dig their heels in the ground and both sides you know I try to have a conversation that's based on you know what I try not to say more than I can I think I can say that with you know which charity and you know but my basic principle is man I just want to defer to the humanity of the people that I'm talking about you know what I mean and rather than take what if what if we were to come down to come up with thought experiments about it you know there's some people in America they're making a polite request can we use the bathroom please go ahead you know that's that that's my that's what I default kill the Pervert so you know how many hours I think there's a way with sports again right I genuinely think hate might my default understand his problem I understand you're going to have female athletes who who are who say hey wait a second to spare right I think we can go forward with good faith and find a way let's find a model that works for everybody you know I think we can do it let in in a way that respects the humanity of the trans athletes and desist athletes I think that we can do that and that's that. That'll always be my female athlete forced to compete with trans women who used to be men foremost their lives I think you have a different opinion cuz I think they have a distinct physiological advantage that's been expressed many times images of the water records have been broken by trans women who are now weightlifters and that one who's the f****** dirt biker who's was a professional dirt bike professional Rider before as a man and then transitioned over to a woman's his dominating these things it's just I don't necessarily think it's fair thank you. Just like it's not fair for a man to compete as a woman I don't think that all those disadvantages or those advantages rather go away when you transition especially in a short time. I just don't think they do and I don't think there's any evidence that shows they do there's a diminishing amount but how much so and in fact there's a doctor of board-certified endocrinologist dr. Ramona krutzik I think we did a whole article on this about Fighters about male Fighters transitioning to becoming female in the female which has happened and they're saying that not only does the estrogen therapy it actually preserves bone density did then doesn't just turn them into a woman or turn them into female or this other hormone profile similar to females but also preserve their masculine bone density because one of the reasons why women lose bone density is a lack of female hormones they maintain this male bone density now there's also arguments that African-American female bone density is in many cases similar to white European male bone density so that's the argument about the outliers in about whether or not it's a Level Playing Field cuz it most certainly is not answer that that's where I get back to the idea that look could someone show that a athlete who a trans athlete who wants to compete is going to have a physiological Advantage because of their history of transition right could that be the case sometimes probably so you know I'm not going to argue that so let's compare that against every single other advantage that every other competitor could have socio-economic advantage you know whether or not they live in Denver if they live below sea level you know like all those different things right do is it Humane to draw a line around that one unearned Advantage right against all those other on our advantages you know at what point does our fantasy of having a level of having a true Level Playing Field end up hurting people you know end up end of excluding people and that's a conversation that I that I think we could have around that one unearned Advantage right against all those other on our advantages you know at what point does our fantasy of having a level of having a true Level Playing Field end up hurting people you know end up end of excluding people and that's a conversation that I that I think we could have</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I had a really great this is just the beginning of a thought right but it came up just somewhere I was talking to some people about this and in sports one of the things our assumption that men have an advantage over women right in sports in sports the fact that so many of the sports were designed for male bodies right they're optimized for male bodies right basketball for example right it's like the the the height of the basket you know the the way that the ball moves around you know like like differences creating Sports and in this portrait of tuned to the physiological differences power-speed athleticism all those there's an advantage gymnastics right I would say that like women for the events that are in a women's gymnastic competition might have an advantage over men write women women don't compete on the ring whole thing and don't compete at Summit crazy you know bar s*** you know what I mean like so that's a women's gymnastics we actually created events in that and like competitions that like only women can do right and optimize that's Portmore for a female body right what if we did that was a lot more sports right and how about this what if we were able to do is against the rules of the game right or not absolute the rules that game of things that humans create right and so why do we like maybe part of our something that men are better at sports than women or men have an advantage of porcelain or that we have constructed most of the games that we've constructed are actually it's worth of biased towards a male type of body right at the sounds ridiculous first of all reason why gymnastics is why women are good at gymnastics for their flexibility there lightning also they're not competing against men in a one-on-one type of situation like once trying to defend the other one turn attack like a game of basketball or game of football or any other sort of team sport compete against the basketball what people trying to defend your trying to Juke left and then go right you're trying to be sneaky you're trying to shoot from the outside there's all this s*** going on in a lot of it involves your ability to move fast to close distance that the physical strength to LEAP up the air and huge physical advantage that men enjoy this is not cuz the sports designed this way it's because the sport is very simple there's a basket on one side a basket on the other side you got to get it in here get it in there ready to go if you're faster and you're stronger you'll be able to accomplish that better males are faster and stronger there's a reason why there's a male and a female division it's not that these Sports were designed for male is that men are physically bigger and stronger and faster does a gymnastics balance beam event where women are going to shine because they're lighter and more flexible and they could do things with your body that men can't because of the shape of all the Macon but that's rare that's the outlier I don't I don't think we actually disagree that much the reason it's rare is because historically we've created most of our Sports around things that men have the advantage and you're not wrong that sports are most sports involve speed and power most parents but why men have an advantage in speed and power I know but we created those sports right when we possibly be able to create where women would have an advantage that athletic event where a man speed and power does not give him an advantage I'm in this is not again like I said this is the beginning of a thought right I'm trying to use this as a thought experiment assertive like a a possibility opening device right but so you you postulated hate but now you make a fair point that there's a difference between individual athletic gymnastics I'm thinking this through myself as I'm talking about right but like I don't think it's impossible that you could come up with a one-on-one competition that privileges that that is that is designed around the same athletic qualities that make a women make a woman give her an advantage in gymnastics event I don't think there's any reason you couldn't do the same thing for a find a one-on-one competition that did the same thing right there's also what could it be for instance I believe I'm not sure I'm not a 1% sure but I believe in like shooting events right for example that women and men are on a Level Playing Field correct or or that like you know through air rifle sort of thing that like there are events right there there do exist where you can have men and women in direct competition with each other right where that would that event is not designed around a particular facet of a you know male or female body right so my point is look men have do you agree that men have run the country and the world for like most of civilization like and almost every country Sports so the fact that as you say it's rare that we have sports that are sort of more designed around a female you know what the difference is between women at the man right I think that might be because men have been sitting up and so I just want a sports that women gravitate towards the sports that women gravitate towards that they like women's volleyball she doesn't have traditionally gravitate towards gymnastics as you said earlier is there a real female forward you know female first sport has the volleyball was at cuz the girls have to dress like hoes like even in the Olympics play some music and remember I don't know but I mean when I tune into Olympic volleyball my team is girls in their underwear pretending they're at the beach they're not even at the beach the choice and they might be a lot so I wanted to get back to watching baseball is you get to choose your own baseball pants you ever noticed that likely get to choose when you look at them some of them are really tight baseball pants and it somewhere really baggy baseball pants and I just love imagining I like clothes I imagine him going to like the baseball Taylor and being like dude I want to like Sag My Pants I want to you know a little swag but yeah impede your performance think the tight would be better as you're running like a shave their bodies to be more aerodynamic mean how much really if you just running to first base how much does like baggy pants the wind catching the baggy pants without a real a little bit with his baseball pants maybe a big ass by the only feel good with the baggy pants what I was trying to get out earlier because I know I was getting you a pretty Spacey place my point is just what our show is about so much is about showing how the things that we take for granted in our world like the way the world is how much of the time is just something that we built right and we can question it and so when we say men are men everything is over Sports in a different way right that would allow more people to compete in sports right I'm not going to say that women should play in the NFL against man right I don't think it's very bad for people but is it like he's our assumption just based on hate these are the sports that we invented we happened to invent Sports That We're Men have the advantage can we imagine a world where 90% of sports are ones where women have an advantage would we be having a different conversation and if that's the case sports that like everybody there's no physical Sports I think but I think yeah you could come out with competitions were women and female traditional female characteristics would have an advantage for sure you could definitely be done you know it's just the ones that exist now when that involve running and lifting things and moving fast is a lot physiologically males have an advantage yeah that's why we have these distinctions what is division over hundreds and hundreds of years ago you know what this just not fair so I'm there you know but you know I mean it is is it the like that's the definition of fairness we have now you know I think the interesting thing about the question trans athletes is it's going to challenge that Notions going to leave the conversations like this one you know that's really cool and that's what I think we're sort of we should be down to have as a society but you know I mean it is is it the like that's the definition of fairness we have now you know I think the interesting thing about the question trans athletes is it's going to challenge that Notions going to leave the conversations like this one you know I mean that's really cool and that's what I think we're sort of we should be down to have as a society</div>

we've never done this on the show cuz I so I'm not like you should have fully boned up I would like to I've thought about in the past cuz cuz the the divisions it's like the rest of the drug war write the divisions we make between the things that are acceptable and not acceptable are so arbitrary right example I always use is like okay why don't why don't we like it they're bad for your help and we think they're unnatural right okay so right like how much your how much oxygen your blood can hold right if you train at high altitude then you can increase that right so they're these Runners the American Runners right they live at a high-altitude they live super high up you know in Colorado or whatever right and then when they're not there they train their all year round by a place there and then when they're not there when they're competing somewhere else they sleep in a chamber that simulates low altitude right how is that not the same thing as taking performance-enhancing drug it's not illegal to do that right now because not everybody can afford one of those chambers and it's bad for your health I don't know but it's certainly as weird for your body is taking a drug I would think right so why it's not because the UFC just had one of its champions because of testing positive for me and then we're just finding out now they don't test for EPO and everybody that it's very expensive until they do it based on The Athlete's biological passport and what they think of changing variables that you know whatever reason triggers their their interest it's a big deal twenties India cycling of gotten strokes and died for me PLS ain't yet but there's no help negative effects of sleeping in altitude it just can you afford to live there can you write route your life know if you can't yeah it's an advantage for that person over you like now that they think the best best course of strategy is to train at low altitude and then sleep at high altitude think that when you train at low altitude you have more output so you're putting in more repetitions cuz you get more oxygen so you have more work then you get the same effect by living at altitude so you get you get up there and sleep and you don't have to train up there and if you train up there it's actually slightly less valuable than training at low altitude staying up there because whenever I'm whatever whenever I'm staying somewhere I'll deliver it like I just a weekend in Denver and I was like going on a run up there and was like an obviously torture compared to like being here in LA but I was getting strong cuz I'm running a high-altitude that's not true that really sucks with me while you just really not what you may think you when you're living at altitude in training at sea level they think that that gives you a slight Advantage because you can put more work in especially for Fighters they think that skill work and repetitions and drilling is one of the most important aspects of it and you can just simply get in more repetitions drills being yourself and then turn up in competing you are engaging in this activity that significantly raises your red blood cells significantly raise your oxygen capacity changes your cardio vo2max changes and we have this idea that there's some kind of Level Playing Field human that we can just say what you got to get the Baseline right now and humans are so variable you're always going to find these weird cases and when you try to adjudicate it gets really weird like you know about you know Caster semenya you who she is no I believe she's South African she's like the best in the world at the 200m Prefontaine classic in Eugene Oregon with my dad to like watch big track meet your best in the world people Olympics you know not qualifier but it's like the 11th caliber Apple he's like one of the best in the world she's got a sheet her whole life has faced accusations that she at her that she's a man basically because she has like an elevated level of testosterone natural body all we got a we got to do a do a sex check on you just humiliating in like also completely unscientific you know like what were they going to do and it's not just look at their jumping you can tell right this is a real phenomenally 1% of people are intersex right is a physical physical outlier and now the iaaf which is the organization that runs autistic FIFA for track right they run all track they have tried to put for to rule I don't know what the status is right now cuz it's being challenged but they prefer to rule that said if you have a testosterone level over a certain amount you have to take a hormone changing blood to change your hormones and she's going to fall under that and so they literally want to change the body that she was born with because they're saying your body what is unfair how far is that right that's crazy it's really really f*****-up answer the thing is when we make those decisions about what's fair and what's not fair there's no Baseline human is always a value judgment and when we were excluding some people that's almost all we always need to look at that and say are we discriminating there definitely is remaining is caster semenya always me look at that they are we discriminating there definitely is committing us cast WrestleMania</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> never get so you know it's about how the moon landing at the moon landing could not have been faked it would have been harder to fake the moon landing then it would have been to actually go to the Moon because the technology to fake it did not exist like when we talked to a forensic film guy right he's like spends he's got like a guy f****** Oscar for you know analyzing old films right and you walked us through the Shadows are parallel right diverging you know the clothes lightsource the Shadows with different but one of the big Arguments for the moon hoax is it the Shadows intersect the Shadows indicate multiple light sources well that is because when that is a reflected light used to be a full-on moon hoax or I fully believed we never went to my tuna breakfast mentary that was on Fox TV while I was on news radio is like 1995 or something that I was f****** content my favorite ever by the way that is a unacknowledged classic I watch the whole series like three times that show is soaked I'm sorry just go ahead back then Fox News actually aired a full one hour show called conspiracy theory did we land on the Moon and it had me fully convinced yeah it was all this s*** they showed like the same background being used in multiple Moon missions That was supposed to be a completely different parts of the moon like how is is possible it supposed to be like nowhere near each other but they have the same background and that is it looks like the astronauts around wires and it looks like the light sources are there multiple light sources in the shadows are intersecting and that you know all the f****** astronauts when they came back they did this Apollo 11 Post flight conference it looks like they're completely full of s*** I was all in dude all in all in and now you're all out but we also found that they did fake some things for publicity purposes photographs that were used that were photographs from tests that they did inside a warehouse with all safety equipment then they blacked out of the safety equipment the background and pawn those photos off as spacewalk photos but I think that's overzealous publicist it doesn't mean no one went to space what's the simplest explanation if you did fake some footage Seattle to Bainbridge Brandon did you actually go outside on a sunny day when you have a single point of light like that with light-reflecting you will see two Shadows of yourself going a different there's one dominant Shadow and then there's a there's a secondary one but if the shed if the sun is actually far away right for the main Shadow you will see the same set of parallel set right light like that you would need lasers you would and you would also be Blazers because at the time all that existed were red lasers right they had not existed in that invented anything other than red lasers right so NASA would have had to have multi like multi-decade Advanced laser light technology in order to fake this another part of it is that cats with no Cuts you know and at the time that was something you could do with TV but you literally couldn't do it with film that there was no way to record film as this right there's no way to record TV at the time get live TV and you had recorded them right so if they were going to record it in advance right and then play it back they would have needed a 6-hour long reel of tape right commercials and I don't believe so and so they would have had who was but you know you would have needed like an enormous film canister do you know that I didn't exist but if anybody's going to have an enormous film canister would be those f****** posters at Nasa of the Moon argument is that we and Technology to go to the Moon. They had decades ahead of its time film why can't you accept that they just went to the f****** Munoz at the end when you go through all the things that would have to happen right in order to you having really go through and look at what is the simplest explanation of the Moon cuz it would have been easier I don't know if it would have been easier if it was impossible to go to the Moon it would be insanely difficult to fake no doubt but if you had an incredible budget and if you had someone who really had the very top of the food chain knowledge terms of special effects what you did in 2001 when was when was that someone come out 171 or something when does that come out in 2001 the even given again this is like filmmaker saying this technology of the time the specific features that we see in the moon footage are not another part of it is Princess the slow jumping right to slow boom boom you know you're on the moon right the big argument that the Moon truthers make is that it was regular speed footage and it was slow down right and there's this dude on the name of it but if you search up Isaiah filmmaker on YouTube right now just breaks down why I like the ability to overcrank and like shooting slow mo like that like didn't that wasn't helped them cameras work at the time you know and so you know who slo-mo back then you're good at your good ask questions cuz you asked me to get into details so I don't have to put up my head that's the argument that the dude next formal back then you're good at your good ask questions cuz you asked me to get into details but I don't have all of my head but that's the argument that that the dude next</div>

That's actually even more ridiculous and they try to create like a if someone if someone who look there are anti-semites out there right they do try to come up with like ways to indicate antisemitism to each other that other people want to text so you know what I mean you know slang basically a nurse line right and at some point someone needs to be able to say so but the contract the contradiction that all of these platforms have right is the early days of the internet member the early days it was like people were really concerned that people would start suing website because what was on the website right like like thepiratebay the big torrent site you know like you're going through cuz you've got DVD screeners on there because they would DVD screener you know what I mean and so that was a big concern the other days the internet right and so we established this President I like none of these sites or don't have responsibility for that right there just to help people connecting two things they're not the people doing the bad shed right you never be able to win the pageant not the people who made it possible to find the bad shape right now though we're in such a place where do all these businesses built themselves and they do have YouTube right we don't make anything that YouTube we just give you a place to upload your videos right so at first find a way to take down the anti-semitic you know white supremacy videos right or right but now they're so so many of them right and also not only that YouTube algorithm is directing people towards them and YouTube is selling ads against them and making money at them right and at the same time like these B's music fest right and at the same time they're still trying to say but we have no responsibility for that happened and you are directing people to that content and you go to system that's making money off of that content did you guys have a little bit of responsibility now I agree that the question of who polices it or whatever that's an extremely complicated conversation but like that's what I'm to say but he's coming to have it both ways they're trying to say we have no responsibility for what's on the platform but also we've allowed this kind of content to go up you know I don't know if you two prophets on anti-semitic video so I don't know why what I talked about in my show they demonetizing aspect of YouTube that affects people whenever anything even remotely controversy controversial they started they started doing that up until like there's a case of talk about him I show a year or two ago where they were like running Under Armour brand Under Armour ads on like white supremacy YouTube video so you know what I mean and then decide what kind of look good on a day say obvious anti-semitic things in these royalties we're obviously not that anybody would be pissed off about it yeah and so that's where the demonetization thing came from right because oshit now the people actually pay us the advertisers are pissed off right to okay let's put a Band-Aid on the problem and lets demonetized videos right here's the problem now they're doing that they're just right there you shouldn't that's ever happened a ton and a lot of s*** is still could get in through the cracks you know and again there's an okay we did what we did what we had to do you guys didn't solve the f****** problem because now people are pissed off again right so that is the vine that these companies rent their based on this premise of we don't mine at moderate anything but when you do that a lot of s*** comes in and now you're in the position we're sorry it's still your house has happened in your house dude take some responsibility for it and I know you're the one who do the party totally unmanageable on YouTube and how many different countries are uploading videos and you know some of the Isis beheading videos I want to do the party that's a good analogy the scale that's about 200,000 kids in a house totally unmanageable when you think about how many different people are on YouTube and how many different countries are uploading videos and you know some of the Isis beheading videos and they stay out for a little while</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> problems that men have are different than the problems those guys think men have right so for instance we did a segment on stereo. Wheaton upset on stereotypes Uncle Adam ruins of sitcom where we talked about different you know we talked about Siri text via you know survive a cheesy 80s but we only had a stereotypical dad you know like a home improvement type dad you know and what we talked about is like those there are ways that men are being harmed by the sort of narrow idea of what a man is you know for instance men have a very high suicide rate right and specifically loneliness is a health problem for men like older men like my dad write my dad's he doesn't have a friend I hope it doesn't hear this you know he has like work colleagues he's got my mom you know he's got me he's got answers that people he's friendly with you know anybody is the best friend you know who doesn't who comes over to watch you know the Red Sox with him terrifying to me yeah and the thing is loneliness is associated with early death know and with disease right and like when you look at the way that we bring up man men are social I cannot have relationship with each other you know yeah I mean my route like we talked about from an early age so briefly on the show but we could have gone into a whole episode on it from the early age researchers have found this that little boys when they're very young are very close with it for very close friendships that are physical right oh that's not how boys act right and girls are still doing that with their friends are still holding hands with their friends you know they're still you don't have any close relationship like that boy started a little bit of different distance you know and easy to say when your teenager that's being gay and you're gay but I haven't even younger than like kids have a notion of that you know they're really seems to be a deep down way that we bring up boys of like I don't get too close to each other you know what I mean that's a little weird just a little weird for boys to do that would you die from eating at the very subtle and very subtle but it's Universal I mean in America it seems to be and you know I even thought that myself like I've often had an easier time having close close relationships with women rather than men almost all my good friends are guys have a lot of good friends I mean you're lucky if that's the case certainly am not getting really into it emotional at you know if you don't feel that way that's fine I felt that myself are pretty tight with people well when the point is that like there is a trend especially in older age right it's a male or female is more likely to have less friends than my mom's age I mean I think that's one of those things where I would hesitate to make a big conclusion but I mean we can draw a link between that and you know that men are sort of like socializing I have you suppose friendships but that is a serious problem that men have been in face right another one we talked about is stuff like no drinking and smoking friends since those are behaviors that are much more pushed on many others are much more advertised right and those are dangerous hurt you physically and can lead to an earlier than the and can result in bad Health outcomes for us you know and it's so funny how the store look like men's rights people you know they're they don't talk about that stuff quite as much violence and and you know people being hurt at work and stuff like that like men having dangerous occupations and that's and that's tough true is true as well but like these are the more subtle ways that you know men are are hurt by the sword of narrow expectations of what a man is that we put on then he met her like this you should be like this you know and some of those Herman do you think we still do that then I'll still put a narrow expectations of what man meant totally that I told him that you I think we might be lucky here in La you know because we can sort of like live anyway that we choose I mean you clearly live exactly how you want to live which is great you know and I get to as well but I think that you know we're lucky in that were so self-actualized you know what I mean that that maybe we Face a little bit less pressure than then you know your average Joe Cross the country I don't know of anyone who's putting pressure on men to not be friendly with other men that seems so ridiculous to me but the two ended deny camaraderie obviously in the military it's a huge aspect of military service is the Brotherhood men for instance in courage to not be emotionally vulnerable with with her friends friends since like I think that's something that's like going to bring it up when you argue multiple things are real things are real that is real to be intimate and to be vulnerable and explain how you feel but then sometimes you shouldn't be just f****** complaining about things and go do something and it's not necessarily you being emotionally vulnerable as you like to say it in such a normalizing way might it might just be being a b**** I need some pressure I think most men need just a little bit of a motivational shove in the general direction of success and happiness in a lot of that is overcoming laziness and imply or applying some discipline to your life I think those things are very manly attributes it turned out to be good for you you know I think there's a lot of I don't disagree with you about about some of those aspects being good for you blanking on the name of this podcast I can I can look it up if you want but a very wonderful podcast about philosophy philosophize this talk to you about it but I'm really wonderful podcast where they were talking to this guy who was in the military and PTSD about how the idea of a man right was just a phrase that he would hear a lot in the middle and nation is the name of the podcast episode called dma on hi-fi Nation really wonderful podcast about philosophy and talk about that idea of being a man right what does that mean in the military and to overcome adversity right don't complain too much rice got a problem solve it yourself the same thing that that idea can doesn't give men the tools they need to deal with PTSD right I can actually exacerbate PTSD because it means that they're not trained how to reach out for help you have those problems situation it doesn't work so well when you're out of that's an arrow idea that can lead to a bad outcome sure but that's basically what we were just saying that you know you should be emotionally vulnerable and know how to express yourself with your friends and be honest about how you feel about things we all should know when you're being a b**** and he has to stop every 5 minutes cuz it hurts like come on man my foot hurts to walk which is not what I had in mind when we started hiking I got to be a b**** right yeah yeah yeah but let me just Soldier on being tough is exclusively a male we would like to equate that to one of our best attributes being a f****** man what if you're on that walk with a fun to hike with a friend right now and your friend is legit afraid of heights I've been on we had some very narrow but he was able he felt able to share it with me right if we creating an environment where you're not here yet but hey if you really in distress or you can share that with me and some men feel that they can't do that and I remember when I was younger you know feeling well I really have this problem but I can I said to my friend because they're going to make fun of me right and that sucks and so my goal is to and what that segments that we did about Manlius was about was saying hey if you if you're a man and being a man to you means you know being confident being assertive and stuff like that great qualities not bad qualities at all right but we want to expand the notion of Manliness so it includes all the different ways that want to be a man that is as wide as possible right because shut it down right that's the problem cuz manliness like instantly becomes handsome aggressive in a muscular Hotel commercial idea and womanliness is more like soft and kind yeah we know you don't think of it sexually right but if it was so let me just give you my example I personally I love taking care of other people right with me and my me and my girlfriend been together 10 years one of the main things I left you in our relationship is I really like cooking for her you know what I mean I like taking care of her that's like something that I enjoy right that's the part of my manliness that's like how I am a man do something for and cook for you going to associate it with you and providing goes back to that you know classic sort of value that I was brought up with a black that's a manly thing to do right is still like be kind and be nurturing you know what I mean but play means a lot to me. It wasn't what I was brought up with and so to me it's important to like expand you know my notion of what it was really a big deal for me to like realize that that was part of what being a man was to me and I noticed that like you know for instance like let's just take the example of like young kids entertainment like growing up you know like it's cartoons and stuff like that like the female characters are the ones we're taking care of other people and the ones were kicking ass and I like kicking ass sometimes too but I realized at one point I was like I didn't have like model to that as a kid of like here's a man who takes care of other people emotionally or you know or in a caring way you know that's a pill the did the idea of Manliness or like what it entails and the problems that people would have about that on the outside it's almost always problems that are being imposed on them like with the ideas that are being imposed on them for people who don't like the way they live I don't like who they are or want to mock who they are how they live in someone's too emotional if someone's too introverted instead of celebrating out of that guy's different cool instead of that it's the bull the mocking and in cheating on them the jock type Behavior yeah we associated with being the negative aspect of masculinity totally sick masculinity is which is the phrase it gets tossed around but I think this is a human's I agree that's really where the problem and it's not specific to beautiful advice column just guy who this guy doesn't ask Dr nerdlove but he's does a really good advice column in and said hey I'm with a woman she's you know a little bit bigger like how you know that I've dated in the past I really am interested so cool but she's not my type I'm not normally into women like this and that bothers me that she's not my type right even though I'm into her so much she's not my type what do I do about the she's not my type and I loved answer he wrote back and he said dude she's your f****** type you like her right you're into her you think she's a sexy woman right the problem is you were brought up in a world where it's not okay for men to like women like that it's not okay to still like women who are her size and you've ingested that your whole life and now you're hating yourself because you were told something that is about what's okay for you to like and what's not okay for you to like I really related to that you know because I remember feeling that way about girls I dated like I'm into her so much but oh wait is she not is she not like attractive right Am I Wrong to be dating her because she doesn't fit what I owe you know the sort of like set of parameters for what an attractive woman is right about what people say that they've been told is wrong right I really related that I was like man that is really a good point I have been told that my whole life and it has I've allowed it to control who I'm attracted to to certain extent you know and that's a mental person that I want to get out of you know and you know now have the benefit of little bit older you know and I feel like I'm in less mental prisons that I used to be I feel like you're in no mental prisons at all at all I feel like a lot of your listeners you know I have broken out of them you know but especially you know I have broken out of them you know but especially I think back about like when I was 16 years old and yeah you know you're swimming in that s*** and you don't know the question that you have a lot of time and effort are shows about of getting people to question those assumptions and those things that you're being told without even realizing you're being told them</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> 1 people got really mad about this is this really the one we got the biggest reaction to and then I'm a little hesitant talking about it cuz it was such a shitstorm every time I do I don't know actually kind of done as a topic and like we've gone through it is really it is really backing it is big but no we didn't want alpha males we know about dating and we did one on how the idea of the alpha male doesn't it shift in humans like if you talk to any Anthropologist any biology sociologist right then be like are humans organized in a social relationship where there's alphas and betas pseudoscience that you hear people tossing out and people went ballistic on the internet because people that sort of like built a edifice of ideology in their minds about like their self has their Spade as I'm an alpha this is what now is like this is what it is like you know and dominant and more confident and and then men who are introverted and shy and more nervous and anxious and then scale and some in some situations you know the situation so confident male and an introverted anxious male who has problems with social anxiety is going to be the same I don't think so necessarily but Alphas right in animals what is that it's a social hierarchy right when people using to describe when they're saying alphas and betas they're saying like confident strong secure people and people that are anxious and not like people talk about alpha males and beta males right there specifically bringing in the language of like evolution of biology and zoology of evolutionary psychology you know and they'll start saying stuff like welders alphas and betas and women are hardwired to be attracted to the alpha you know because that's what it's like in nature like they would be using that language and there were pointing out if that's not scientific right it's not. yeah you don't think that women look at like pro athletes in like big strong athletic men and you don't think they're drawn to that for evolutionary reasons I didn't know I don't actually I think that men are drawn to women with small waist and big hips and large breasts for evolutionary reasons easy I think what that is is that's an easy intuition to come too if you're like looking at the way people behave right but one of the things by evolutionary psychology is it's the most common mistake to look at the way that people do behave and say the reason why we behave that way is because Evolution says that the best way right that's their argument for instance argumentative essay argument that was like that were used to justify slavery right that like oh because you know whites and blacks have this hierarchical relationship in American society certain shape of bodies dismembered attracted to different ones and do that I don't think that's very attractive but that hourglass shape has been throughout time something that men are attracted to I think that hourglass shape has something throughout our recent cultural memory that we tell each other that men are attracted to right that's when that's when we're that's what were told from an early age to this that this is a sort of women that men are attracted to truly are you don't really yeah I wrote this route. But that doesn't make any sense to me that's so non-intuitive I'm all about the where do you think this does narrative of men being attracted to women with large breasts and a small waist and a big ass where do you think that started because this is like evolutionary biology is pretty much settled on the idea that the reason why is the large hips would indicate that the women be easier to give birth having large breasts in a large acid indicate the he has she said she's fertile and then she has a Tampa fat storage in the right places if she's going to be pregnant and carry children does all these like evolutionary biology reasons why people attract a certain things why a woman would be attracted to a tall muscular handsome man good genetics very strong and confident to take care of her always things are based on evolutionary biology question is this is an assumption that we the public make about how evolutionary biology works right thing that we sort of agree on while we we is like there's a there's an idea among the public at this is true I don't know if it's a scientific idea that's it that's like you have I've had conversations with evolutionary biologist attitude tall men that are muscular and confidence is because that is what so we saved you throughout history with only makes sense doesn't it it it will just because it makes the point of our shower right is that just because something makes intuitive sense doesn't mean that it's necessarily true right the truth of that simply because that's what you know everybody agrees upon Ryan if you ask girls like what are you into didn't you say a few that are you into tall muscular confident man were also nice to do Jesus Christ that's going to be off the charts like most of them you know I'm really not sure that's the case of women and the men were equally kind and equally intelligent and friendly you don't think that more woman would be sexy attracted to these tall handsome men with great bodies I'm not going to I'm not going to say that like the first of all you're positing like a value judgment in it that the bodies are great writer like are women attracted to attractive bodies if that's the question and then I would say fit look I mean it's a it's a hypothetical certainly athleticism right is something that is attractive right that's not that many people find attractive not everybody finds that attractive and I don't think that we can necessarily recent backwards to at like a specific evolutionary relationship right because the truth of what those evolutionary relationships are is like often a lot more complicated than you know our immediate intuition about it physically pushing back against in that segment is like the really sure of unscientific you know about Alpha and beta exactly where people you know just internet forums lecture to doing amateur pseudoscience right saying like this is how the relationship between men and women are like designed evolutionarily a very very simple level like the alpha and beta social hierarchy Theory right that like humans are organized in the social hierarchy Annapolis Road Metro even someone who is the person who you deposited right the person who is athletic and confident right the high school football quarterback right versus the high school football nerd will take those two people and then put them in a different situation right of course the high school quarterback is like on the top of that social interaction right looking at the sort of you know classic Wolfpack model they're the one who serves her to run in the show any other guys like hanging out in the bleachers talking to his friends right or talk to nobody cuz he's a he's a beta in that situation right if you take that kid and then you know send that kid to like Nationals or whatever you know and that kid is so I take the the quarterback character and you know she's suddenly like you know from the little Podunk town right he's not from the big school he's like way down the totem pole right that person is no longer going to be in that Heights social hierarchy rent and if you take that back in your take echinacea set dungeon master of his you know dungeon dragons group right that that kid is going to be open in that situation right that's how humans work humans aren't organized intuitive like little pods that stay together for life in this one person is down at the whole time and that's the simple point that we were making in that piece right that when someone is told somebody a fact when somebody stole the fact that contradicts like a really deeply held belief it can often caused them to disbelieve that even when it's true right in fact that fight back even harder if the fact that is being debunk is literally part of your identity like that you believe a really really deeply it's incredibly hard for you to just believe it right the classic example of this is like you know Shawn hand Sean Hannity doesn't believe in climate change right well you know what actually don't know that specifically what Shawnee Sean Hannity things but climate change was just a somebody who's made their whole career on climate change doesn't accept all their friends are in the anti-climate change Community right they met their wife and anti-climate change fundraiser you know what I mean they make their money to write a book every year right now climate change is real risk of ending all their relationships changing their whole life right because if they were to say okay you know what actually I'm convinced climate change is real it would lose all their friends their wife would leave them they would lose their revenue stream they can't possibly come to that conclusion right and so they fight back so super hard right and have built their whole lives on the edge of the alphas and betas I'm an alpha I'm not going to be a beta right and so you know maybe they had were in a bad place in their life and through this model of alpha versus beta they started working out or they started you know improving himself a little bit right and maybe they started acting will it work on another in a relationship right all those things can be true with the idea of alphas and betas in humans not being scientific right let's do when I tell them that they fight back really hard furious people started this is political likewise Adam ruins everything getting political map I don't know what the hell they're talking about I have no idea I have no idea what people were saying I guess I guess you know for some people it's become that but because they see it as part of like I don't whatever argument there in their heads are having about feminism or something like guys in dating right in life like this is not a real concept if you want to say I'm going to tomorrow I'm not going to tell you that's not going to help you out you know and you know I am a little bit reticent to make like a broad conclusion about evolutionary psychology right but I can tell you again go talk to any other products any biologists and eat you know sociologist is there such a thing as alpha males in humans done so confident people versus people are not confident I think you're correct and I think obviously humans operate on a giant spectrum and if you start going around saying Alpha and beta and that the idea that all Alphas of the same overall bettas in the same it's just as ridiculous as the idea synonym confident men's rights guys yeah cuz I'm like listen we have all the rights like</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> alright thanks for having me. I really appreciate it I think we we came up there with the name together you might have been the first person to say it but thank you I'm really lets you know it lets you know that hey this is going to know you a little bit. Like I'm going to be telling you s*** that you don't want to hear that's going to make everything a little bit worse you know people watching show it grinds your gears a little bit to find out something I thought that was crap you know but then at the end we show you why you're actually better off knowing that thing and you're always better off knowing the truth in my view is was there ever and it was it was it 1 episode of Stan's I was being one that people got the most upset about there's a bunch of them I mean people get upset with us for a lot of different reasons we did want about how breastfeeding is in better than formula feeding its know they're both like formula feeding is fine you know and if the promised one of the things become a stigma to stigmatize now and there's a lot of people who can't breastfeed or who for medical reasons you know and the factors that form formula is like a scientifically proven wonderful way to feed a baby and if you know someone's choice or needed to do that there's no reason to stigmatize if we go through all the reasons that that that's the case and yet people get a little is that for me the formula is like a scientifically proven wonderful way to feed a baby and if you know someone's choice or needed to do that there's no reason to stigmatize and we go through all the reasons that if that's the case and yet people get a little young people who should have an ideology about that you know and don't want to hear the truth about it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> where is an interesting cat man a bunch of things rolled up into one because he's a he's a legitimate Catholic but yeah really Catholic despite all the scandals and kid f****** and all the craziness and then on top of that he's this character but now he's not the character anymore now now he's like a guy not totally playing the character with character comes in and out like a little Shadows yes it does what's your real thoughts on things cuz I know you is Colbert know you from The Colbert Report is hilarious fake Republican guy and now I'm seeing your mom not sure what's going on here man yeah I mean in late night you know I play a character on my show to that's like a heightened version of myself that's developed as like a very extra nerdy it's almost like me is Pee-wee Herman a little bit rock it's it's it's me as my younger self and it different what I do on stage and you know I can only imagine even though he's still he's like his big thing for late-night was like I'm going to be myself I'm not the character anymore still build a little bit of a character for yourself you know Surfer late night and so he had the same writers from from The Colbert Report and so he was like we're sort of like creating a new character how does this character work but I got to say the old show I mean he's he's great the old show was probably the best performance ever made by a single late-night comic because the way that heat when I watch it now if I go back and watch Clips I like the way he would do like three or four fast little turns and you know you know single line where would like mean one thing that would be some subtact said he would slip around he would do it like it was like watching like a figure skater who triple Axel so you know like watching him do that it was it was really impressive I'd like you more on The Colbert Report then I like him as a late night talk show hosts in the box that character and he was looking to do more and and I get it I also feel like man that cold air force more interesting than the Late Night show to me as economic and there's a comedy writing fan because the late night shows her just promotion shows that's all star all they are is hey Adam about what happened that day so the smartest thing that you're John Oliver right he was up for the Daily Show he wanted to do The Daily Show he was Jon Stewart pick for the Daily Show said this in the in the oral history book of The Daily Show and then Comedy Central didn't close the deal with Oliver and instead you know and John we have to just talk about what happened that day you don't have that much you don't guess what you can't have as much of a complete thought in 24 hours or in realistically the six hours you have between when you show up when you take the show right you can't say as much it's it's harder and so being on that you know weekly schedule and he's only doing 30 something shows a year right cuz they hiatuses that's what allows them to have those big long complete thought that Everyone likes so much you know I'm pulling out apocracy great I'll show it takes us we take us like 3 or 4 months to write an episode like we're riding 16 at once but like you know that's how long we have to think about it until we're able to take twists and turns you know we go into it thinking is going to be our angle and then we're we're diving in the research we have a wonderful research staff and is actually this is the more interesting part of the story and then we are have the time to go chase it that way instead right where is it we're on a daily schedule oh s*** while we don't have time to Pivot cuz we got to show rain overfilled time constraints like in terms of like the subject matter that I like matters like very very involved yeah I mean we try to do the most difficult topics we can't you know we don't hold back from anything but the only constraint that we have is at the show we got 21 minutes and then in between got commercials so we going to buy some for 6 minutes before we have to move on right and so that's the that's the only limitation that we have difficult topics we can't you know we don't hold back from anything but the only constraint that we have is at the show we got 21 minutes and then in but we got commercials so we can we talk about some for 6 minutes before we have to move on right and so that's the that's the only limitation that we have</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I want to hear the truth about it we did one about trophy hunting animals about how can people people get so mad all look at the sky shuttle lion right and the truth is that in some countries not a hundred percent of time but in some countries they are effectively using trophy hunting as a way to to protect the animals because you know that that's how they are able to sort of like monetize you know in that place and you know get money coming in in order to protect the anime they're very specific and strategic about it and it can be part of a good you know Sherwood animal Management's you know strategy and it's being used to some success you know and yeah people don't want to hear that right it's still really hard and that's a weird one to me and I hunt yeah yeah I thought the whole the whole Lion and elephant thing like right right and if we organize these hunts what you got to pay half a million dollars for the rights to even go in there cuz I have to withhold male elephant was the issue with that giraffe that that woman that got it was really dark and unusually colored and was dark as was very old and older the giraffe apparently the males get really dark is really cool looking but she shot it and everybody crazy on the internet because you know she was posing and smiling with the after out but apparently that giraffe had to be killed because it had killed at least two maybe three young males and it was no longer of rabble breeding age so they they were in the situation where they didn't have the money to take it and bring it to a zoo somewhere and they would have gotten money from having this woman come in and shoot it yeah they did area where you know one of the problems that you need to have a reason for the people who live in the place to care about the animals kill one animal right now we've got a way to hire guards we've got to wait this is now a resource that were protecting right and that it sounds a little cynical but it is working in some places and both cynical in effect an effective and we have a we had we had a woman on from the iucn international Union for conservation to make big conservation group talking about is effective note some places you got a corrupt government what is going to park at the bunny yeah that's bad right but the point is just because the mere idea someone going overseas and killing and is not necessarily the worst thing in the world we have to look at the details the situation and it's a hard for animal lovers to hear animal everything like to hear that more than anything is that there's no other options not like a bunch of people are donating a bunch of money to keep these areas Clean and Free of poachers and the amount would be Nassif can donate money but yeah yeah that that's the when you got a problem that big and intractable as how do you save these animals you know and against habitat encroachment right again you know people want to farm on that land people you know people have lives right they're not sitting around going around going and so how do you get how do you get those people in that Society to to Really protect weather in some places are having success with a strategy and that's something that we can understand you have to approve of it and every single case and we can take that's really tough for us as animal lovers and that the character I'm talking to on the show says I still just hate the idea of an animal being killed right and I said yes to the Y right we try to dramatize that emotional you know resistance on the show like an emotional reaction that we have I also don't like the idea of an animal being killed brutally you know I think I'm uncomfortable with the idea right but main goal is to preserve the population these animals overalls that I'm going extinct maybe I need to accept that this tough true that once in a time once in awhile one Kathy shot to the head with a rifle maybe I need to accept that do the ride never heard of this movie that's a great movie the ghost in the darkness I feel like it's from the 90s but it's a really good movie about a true story about this guy that they brother bought the Michael Douglas character was brought in to hunt these lines that were systematically targeting and killing these workers that worked on this railroad this team of lions work together and start eating people wow great mode Alliance yeah there is Darkness biting tension that is a great hunter Val Kilmer's looking good there does pre Fatso Val Kilmer free when he went up to do yeah there it is Ghost and darkness fighting tension that is a great hunter tell Kilmer's looking good there that's open</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> been around for a long time my friend remember the first time I ever saw you fight was a backyard bare-knuckle fight in the Kimbo Slice days does the first time I heard about you and then I saw you fight Yves Edwards in bodog bodog fight well yeah Mike Brown what happened with them they went under because of the the whole gambling rules online change drive from what I heard what I heard was a spending budget this is what I what I heard Calvin are there was the owner both he put up the huge budget and these are just rumors from what I heard from the people working you know it was like a hundred million dollars for XYZ amount of years to get them publicity so people would see the fight and then go to the casino and got blown out looking through the years is what I heard and I wouldn't disagree cuz they used to pay me really good and give us super perks that you should give us some super perks you know take us to Exotic locations to fight be there for two weeks you plus two they fly I'll take care of you they really really took me very good carry so when I heard that they blew out a hundred minute and 30 years older guy could be enough but they were fighting on the beach with hot girls in bikinis and wandered around dancing but you were on the beach like in the Sun like what the f****** ideas to fight in the Sun but let me tell you the training session is it went on there were some of the best that I've seen the world cuz they so you would go and you bring two of your corner man and then somebody found that and then before you know you had like four people of your Entourage going with you from whatever team that was and everybody was doing that and we have a training place in what they had done was laid out tarps and mats and it was huge so we have like a hundred Pros 50 pros from all over the world just training and on you two know each other and it's okay you want to roll you know it gets competitive you know it was some great training sessions that I saw and that I that I took a part of me now why the world needs more of those they need more 1 FCS we need more Bellator as we need more you know competition whatever the professional Fight League is called now will they call themselves out as they used to be YouTube World Series Downs pfl I think pretty sure most the same organization yeah we need we need more you know but someone of that ilk someone like a Golden Boy promotions to start getting involved in MMA putting together to get some guys that aren't signed but are super high level with a big name with him to contract comes up needed more you know nothing you know that that's probably never going to happen again after the Tito and Chuck fight and doesn't look like but someone of that ilk someone like a Golden Boy promotions to start getting involved in MMA putting together we could get some guys that aren't signed but are super high level with a big name like him the contract comes up and they decide to do something with a big-name promoter you know it'd be good for everybody</div>

Because if that's what you did in your imposing and winning awesome but when your sole purpose is just to hug somebody's leg as hard as you can and then I don't know what you think about the Robbie fight but he didn't win Mike Myers you know Robbie was asleep several times we wash up by several times I thought that robbers asleep for a second and then Usman showed it to me and then I change my mind and then Herb Dean came on talked about I change my mind again because her peeing the saying that what he was concerned with his way the arm dropped and that it was a cervical locked essentially when you have a bulldog choke puts puts of some serious leverage on your neck he's like and he seen guys go out from that and their whole body goes paralyzed and where that happened to and he came back he is he got his movement back again before why I was pretty f****** scary who's getting choked out and about getting his neck pinched it was pinching down the nerve he was worried that was happening with Robbie said the ways arm dropped because it wasn't normal and it goes it and they gave me some serious concern Ben askren said that he let go of the choke a little bit when herb came over to him cuz he taught her was going to stop at cuz he thought Robbie was out and he thinks that during that time when he let go Robbie came back to life which could have happy I don't know it's hard for me to say but I feel like in her being situation I think you did the right thing cuz of the arm dropping was f****** weird and it was a little weird but he wasn't out I never seen nobody go to sleep doing this you know that's all down in that position feels or was it this did he do this or was his arm down I don't know only Robbie knows whether or not he was out he says he wasn't so we have to also say he's in the middle of War Brian if it's up to me I want the guy to go pee sign with herbs natural defense maybe Robbie cuz you seen this guy do it as a f****** a thing you know maybe Robbie can be put to sleep from those guys that are weird like that. Just sharing positions they can go 30 minutes you're choking them in and they don't go to sleep maybe Robbie's I got all I know is he wasn't sleeping Michael chiesa said that when Kevin Lee got his back and they stop the fight before he went out you said I let my hands go cuz I was concentrating on my neck I was just tightening up by neck and and trying to to keep my blood flowing I think that was a little different was over there naked you know you're going to go to sleep but that one's not going to put you in a wheelchair non-special not from Ben's ass man so your take is on all of this trash talkin media hype s*** that you see going on now you don't like it I don't either don't I think I fast forward it's not like it's distasteful right now but if you just fast forward to the guys like me when I was 14 years old watching the sport now you looking at the door you're going to go up and think I got to do the same s*** I just got a f****** talk a shitload of s*** I don't we got to go to the gym that much just got to have a banging the lit social network account and I'm f****** golden you know and we see it you know Sage Northcutt for example you know great time and stuff but what he was getting paid out didn't make sense for a lot of Fighters you know why was he getting paid so much because of social media is but it's really bringing in those people into the chairs and into the TV because you have a lot of likes Universal things that are 1 than that not like to disagree with nothing but sometimes girls have like tremendous amount of followers you know do those numbers translate to viewers on the TV or or like butts in seats or any of that like I would like to know you know a lot of times when I've asked like people in the UFC Ceviche know those numbers on translate so why did I get my money you know I'm not the girls get more money in guys that they have like a social media presence of just getting more money certain amount I'm sure it does I'm sure it does guys like Colby translate mean he's he talks so much you know about the fights there's something to it I just appreciate being honorable and fighting their best and find the best fighters they can fight and they don't emphasize that s*** talking at all they emphasized the martial arts Jon Jones in a DC I love it cuz you can feel these right like each other feel it when Max Holloway fight the best in their weight class min-max is the best hundred 45lb ever and Dustin Poirier is absolutely one of the best 155-pound is alive and they're going to go after it and it was on something dog was beautiful with no barking just biding their fighting Shakin hands full respect before and after lighting up fighting Shakin hands full respect before and after and I get a lot of people like to have that I hate you syndrome wanted to fight so they don't want to shake hands a f*** you I don't like you know but when when they're giving so much attention to that WWF stuff and pushing you to the Forefront that you know and just to think that the kids watching it going to be even worse they're going to do it to the next power</div>

Potter to the blitz you know I did it all the different ways you know and I also called him a lot with like over hand and left hook as he was coming in special in the second one I caught him I think maybe twice with that, so f****** talk but you are a guy who doesn't cut much weight at all like how much weight do you cut for 7 by the time I get into shape shape I'm around 182 lb 180 lbs will fight week and get away then I'm like 8 pounds away some seven pounds away and it's nice at 55 everything went right 174 173 pounds 5% body fat seven pounds away and I also like yeah it's nice I don't got any at 55 and everything went right when he's if I 255 I got there at 174 pounds 173 pounds 5% body fat the rest is just water Manu f****** kill me so I always feel that was too big for 55 you know I love because the competition was stiff there but it was just getting harder and harder once you took those IVs away forget it was no way for me to make that way</div>

He survived the one where it's like fighting you watching a fight and one guy is really f****** a guy up and the other guy never does that who do you think won that fight you right you can't but do you think the guy that just moves around a touches them with the Jap not saying this with Whitaker did but just as a what if I just moving around 4 for round he's touching you the job at Lake kicking you and shutting you out fight in the street but then in the fifth-round you knock him down four times you beat the f*** out of him and he's running away from you his nose gets bloody you end the fight with your hand raised without a mark on your face either guys faces Pizza baby I think of my boys like Tampa. where is moving right right right it's a good question cuz I quit how much is that round were as a sport. Yeah right what is it cuz as a sport a scorecard you have to be like how much is it worth for a guy to really take it to a guy and almost stopped empty I don't I don't get to be more draws I don't have a problem with a draw right. It's worth more than a point I think it's worth more than two points I think it's worth a lot it seems to be like 1017 big deal right around where it's like a lot of feeling a lot of touching you know this and then that and you don't poke example first-round Anderson Silva vs stylebender for sure but it was it was around where they were feeling each other out of the way it was not one big moment worst oh my God stop and just taking over this fight is almost done so that's 10:9 but yet another fight where a guy beat the s*** out of a guy and doesn't drop him and they have exchanges but the guy gets rocked and hurt that is that 1099 barely survived but if it is 10 a.m. I think anymore tonight at ten 6 or 7 then get dropped its energy argument against what I'm saying against it Frankie Edgar vs Gray Maynard the first one right drops him as a badly hurt in the first round Frankie manages to survive and come back and went up round to win the fight with exceptional but it is except but the only thing is your fault that you haven't they do at 10607 right then get dropped if you got to get on energy argument against what I'm saying is you're going against it Frankie Edgar vs Gray Maynard especially the first one right Gray Maynard drops him as a badly hurt in the first round Frankie manages to survive and come back and went up round to win the fight at 6 after know it is exactly what kind of like if you gave him like five points</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> she's apology yeah I did what you think well I mean at least he's just straight-up admitting that you have to do your kind of guy f***** up about it and oh I do have to correct something someone wrote an article that said that Cody garbrandt found out the TJ tested positive for his Fight 2 and Cody went crazy I think I got duped by a clickbaity article we all got to the Articles like I should have been more responsible so my apologies to TJ so they had I don't think there's a been another one that they tested tamales positive but they're looking into it now here's the thing movie up to it this is something that I know EPO is not always tested for correct Andy Dana would he say cuz you saw it as expensive as f*** you a whole lot you guys aren't yet he didn't know you every time we paid this much money for you know not to show up guys at 3 in the Dustin you're not testing every time we paid this much because I had no idea yeah well, can't see you everything's been looking to have to take it from here to be cool bro next thing you know everybody's back looking thick thick &amp; Juicy going to go back and see if they sell the samples for when he did beat Cody and test those pretty PL this is what you and I were talking about we were at the store when like how far do we go back dude I'm telling you Joe you don't want to go down that road Stephan bonnar UFC 2 that the snow fight that catapulted the second cuz you'll see this but then again test all the football players test all the baseball ball screwball documentary narrating it there they're telling the story and they got these little kids playing A-Rod and playing them in this f****** great marriage story that you know what man when everybody makes an agreement to not cheat in there testing you all the time to try to make sure that you're not cheating don't you think that the environments different now than it was before you saw it was in was initiated it. good thing I'm putting words in your mouth sprays that question out a way to cheat what does PEDs in sports is no different than a referee or judge or gloves they go hand-in-hand people at the always done PD's or enhancements was in every aspect whether it's football basket music surfing tax it's just what humans do especially when the odds are so high that this little thing can help you achieve maybe it get you a victory but you know and then also what with with TJ dillashaw's thing granted we know EPL is illegal with this is this one's a little different tested positive for like steroids or whatever so I kept straight up steroids because if you and I engage in a fight and we have eight me to train in go to Mount Everest or where the f*** you want to get your red blood cells higher and then fight me back at sea level but I just stay here injectors red cells you know the difference is that if you operate at sea level and you're taking EPO you will be able to work much harder and get more rounds in and you'll recover much better if you are up at altitude the problem is living in training really at high altitude you can't put out as much output with a night of the fight working at the sea know why do people have more way more yeah I've been closed have a stroke from that stuff made me about young cyclist that there were just having Strokes when the boys I think is Lance Armstrong that maybe that was sick that was my friend salami to know bike racer in the middle of the night to discuss how guys think that's why I got it. Everyone was doing it no I think other people are taking EPO and they're hoping they don't get caught that's what I think I think it's still cheating correct and I think I don't think everybody's doing that I think there's a lot of guys who are doing it honorably A girl's got to do it honorably you know I think you could get it in your mind but I don't diss it just is what to take for Max Holloway it is what it is right it is what it is what it is it's cheating he did admit it. He did that's what it is but I mean I don't even know if have a point I don't know if I do either but it's but it's the guys trying to I was going to say the guys trying to provide for his family but so is everybody else Cody garbrandt LED you to this because his card has been great since he was a child with his brothers wrestling background at what point along the way was it 6 years ago 652 go to do think you need to do this in order to beat these guys well let's we could look at one thing that we know that he's been doing he has a rigorous strength to get a shipping program that training will have that drink Edition program please don't you have an issue with that I understand your issue but that s*** is off-the-charts crazed if doing wild stuff and medicine ball work and Plyometrics on the stuff in TJ looks like a f****** beast when he's doing it as workout with with his with Mike yeah they do crazy s*** today yeah yeah I mean I'm not justifying it what I'm saying is that in order to do that kind of work like to put out that kind of pace your body's going to have to have some time to recover in between workouts or if you take EPO that time of recovery is diminished quite a bit acquainted Nowitzki guys to put in more work so it doesn't just give you more cardio it allows you to recover a dinosaur so you can train harder and you know as well as anybody that sometimes the difference between Victory and defeat is just having a little more in your gas tank just having a crush it that little longer Camp not being injured of the last couple of weeks we lost some cardio you know those awful feeling well if you had the opposite of those awful feeling of not instead of being compromised being at hand Dinosaur Train harder and you know as well as anybody that sometimes the difference between Victory and defeat is just having a little more in your gas tank just having a chat that little longer camp and I'm not being injured or the last couple of weeks we lost some cardio you know those awful feeling well if you had the opposite of those awful feeling of not instead of being compromised being enhanced here to help you think</div>

I would rather see Stevie but you know I cuz you're a purist and I like you but not me I'm Express Hilton me sir out of respect cuz I know he deserves that he won he defended the title more than any human being has ever held it he's the number one guy in the heavyweight division so you have to rate him the greatest heavyweight of all time if you even look about accomplishments he's the grey UFC heavyweight of all time trial just because he's done it four times okay you know DC beat him obviously DC it supposed to mean if you if you had a rank him you know like right now 1 through 10 think I'd like the all-time greatest most accomplished heavyweight we wait it's deep that you got up to eat out will Cain never defended as many times as deep a did the question is did Kane beat the better guys then he be Junior dos Santos when Junior was young he would vote for a been through those Wars with Kane right because by the time they got him Junior had been in some more than Junior has look really good lately looks amazing but you can never discount the that damage I'm not saying that he's not as good now I think it's still phenomenal now fight knock knock knock knocking that m*********** out in the way he did it looks good man is JDS Francis of ESPN card that's not a pay-per-view I think that's f****** is ESPN I think so much do a f****** and he stopped I'm going to watch it knocked anybody out like that to it's hard to say what the problem is with CPA the problem is is DC spot what twice since their fight Siri just been chilling when you rightfully deserve a rematch and what if you get hurt while you're taking this fight was he you know you had this fight and you get hurt knee surgery then you're out for another year and the DC loses it and thinks he retired he wants to fight him again and the way to fight him again is to hold out without the smoke I don't know I'll see the UFC wants to fight DC again that's the way it seems all now in hindsight cuz reservar happened challenges not going to heavyweight but he's throwing up third choice in all this waiting for that just f****** with everybody he's getting his name out there he's learning from Connor C I think there's more to it I think you'll see was fishing with hey you got into fights deep Engine with you f****** stupid and let's fight Johnny Depp John I think it's more to it maybe they did have some preliminary discussions as to whether or not the to engage in fisticuffs maybe they did that's a great bite big fights man but the guy doesn't deserve to be forgotten no not at all but it was one of the most impressive heavyweight title defenses a because Francis was on fire he was so dangerous but just be disrespectful boyfriend's his head world have to be</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> hellbender in Jon Jones why are they talking to each other and started it yeah John did it originate start start with John he came out the interview and goes. Boehner's looking good he's fine 8520 matter of time before I think we cross paths which is silly and then stylebender I think TMZ asked him he's a guy or one goat and another one started but if you're John why you been engaging in this well scraper John because you want to let everybody know hey I'm the best m*********** on the planet has a car that's about some of that mean he's active now right now right now right long ass f****** career as champ and it's the best ever correct when tested positive that long suspension all that time off should have made all the Legacy that he could have laid down and I now I think I think he's just f****** Jason Isabel about it however talking to 83 Pounders kind of silly to say that an interview I don't think that's that I don't either Jones is the hot Cheeto senior in high school in South Bend is the new fresh when you saw it and it's like Mean Girls like f*** that dude it's also I wonder how much of this is like they all agree is good for business entertainment these s*** talking back and forth into publicity for fights they are there is real s*** talk in his psychological warfare but it also people up to know and like the khabib fight all the craziness that led the obviously that backfired when khabib try to plug it was it was talkin is irrelevant it was yeah it's worth something to wear something green hit the style bender and Jon Jones did decide to fight one day if that's worth something to both of them agree agree and 205 doorman to John's a giant 205 in the world with these could beat up by six of them in tonight so find out 183 or it's weird yeah well obviously wouldn't be 103 stop and it was going to do it I'm sure you want to put some put some weight on the magic just that such a nightmare but that's what makes stop in a special cousin the same as Mash Halloween cuz I'll fight anyone in this is not a knock on Santa's or you know the Olympic competition at 2:05 is really nothing there you excited about is just not you look at the other divisions Santos going to be a fun fight + 700 + 800 so you know yeah it's it's one of those things now where you got to find contenders for John right because no one's really standing out cold would be cool at 2:05 so just beat who did he beat volkan oezdemir know that he did but neither one of my record not ready for John not even in the same room right so but we were looking at Dominic we like that kids really talented super potential and I still think he does well yeah tell this lady who does I mean he's he's put away to top-level guys pretty spectacularly and look at the way he fights to he's loose and weird and then jumps on you and if so special they wanted this fight the thought it would be a good fight with Thiago and I think one of the one of the things that's a good fight one of the reasons why it's good fight is Thiago shut anyone's lights out he knows he can shut anyone's lights out that m*********** throws for the bleachers to fight at 70 now 85 85 right 8585 John is not going to fight him the way man will find you know John is going to keep money outside of those kids and it just won't take them down John's ground-and-pound is horrific is top games off-the-chart missions agree submissions everything elbows Hurt From Hell from the top careful is that that Tiago dude Thiago Santos will swing with everything evil throw it all in there John's I need engage in that opportunity. Wake County start great coaches they know what the f*** they're doing he's going to go in there is going to kick that dude if you decide to clinch with them do you have a giant events in the wrestling but he's got to be careful on the way a man that do double swings will try to kill you do tree swings in a different way swings like this ain't making it to the 5th round there's no fifth-round he's not even looking to get he's that guy is just every shot he's trying to take the lights out and I'm definitely watch it I think this is an interesting fight Jon Jones should be should be a giant favorite but it doesn't mean it's not going to be interesting because this dude style cuz he's so f****** while question can be how he perform how is he performing you when that octagon door shut and you look over you see it's Jon Jones and title fight the title fight is won the pros is the talking about it right cuz we probably want to talk about him for Santos on this show right it wasn't happening it keeps him releve you know he is it keeps them relevant if you know he is probably the biggest name in the sport now outside Connor the guy who's the most active him and could be for the biggest names and I can shoot to stop enter actual thing to help stylebender to write cuz now he's associated with the greatest of all time he wants to be the greatest of all time but when he just did and it's going to get there and I can't f****** weight when he goes I am ready for heavyweight Francis can I do</div>

He's so f****** top and even after all that I mean stylebender was teeing off on him in that fifth round and Calvin is finding a way to survive I'm going as a great chance shellfish I think she'll be so we saw a Sonia get hit get knocked down some get taken down we saw it happens when he's off his back with pretty f****** good is triangle transition locked up cracked super small for Darren till can make 170 lb so can count to this one thing us 55 or fight something like that you know he surprised it went do it probably still wouldn't do it it's some of those things were like I think they like it the way it is if it ain't broke don't fix it yet but it doesn't make sense versus you have to bulk up or have to drop too much weight and compromise yourself happy medium for a lot of guys that are not they're not hitting that happen right now when I get the best performance about so if there's a small 85 85 hours like you look at Jacare you that you'll Romero fascard just it just as you're able and backup timer 60 lb lb division said he needs to make serious sacrifice to get there he said he cut out drinking alcohol when he knows and ran 20 miles per day to make the weight by the time he stepped in the Octagon 236 yet balloon back. female fighter 5e fought the beat in his last fight at sharp off it's a beat got him in that crazy arm bar from the Batman Lego that which is so nasty from filthy mouth feels nasty there's two that night I know it's crazy as a crazy move right I think of 185 or think of Luke rockhold</div>

While it's like everybody it'll be something where there's a technology what were the outside you you can't see things when the inside you can and then he'll show you images like the in front of you on the lens glasses show you things right right in front of you like I I got one that I heard that I don't know if I understand and believe that this is real but I just Googled it and I found something that makes it seem like it's so the next version of the VR headsets are supposed to have brain tracking in them and that sounds stupid but it's already like being implemented and tests how often. Play we thought you were a regular person but you're beating off a hundred times a week imagine if they want to have a talk to you like mr. Papa you watch 14 hours of pornography this week yeah that seems a lot yeah I think your mother would think that seems like a lot but we can't I mean I don't want to talk to her share only good stuff that right now but a weird thing that like everywhere you're going there picking off your face and then you're going to be able to they're going to know exactly what you are and who you are and do you know it's a strange it's strange but is it any more strange than our lives today in comparison to people that live the 1920 like we were talking about earlier. This is way weirder the way we've waitlist super weird weird weird weird town already for sure you just need to get into the hands of people that can really mess with you do you have a Alexa in your house or yeah yeah yeah my kids do like my one friend is always trying to tell me just get that out of your house it's listening to everything that you say and everything don't say it about in that room not everybody should have this we're good at this point right here how would you ever deny people something like that the Moss they might be really expensive how would you know you can't deny people that want like save someone's coming up and they want to try it and everyone else has it that would do we create a giant problem that be like if you said that would sell phones too many people have cell phones and cell phones become a big problem with that why I just want to think that if in the theory that you're going to let thousands of people have instant access to the world's knowledge at their fingers out of thoughts like instant that becomes too powerful in the wrong hands and the people that might have it first might see the future problems of that I'm just so I was wondering I was thinking way too far and the people that might have it first might see the future problems of that I'm just so I was wondering I was thinking way too far</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what about Julian Assange getting kicked out of the embassy in London you don't find out about a million different stores that are in the news it's a fun story it's a cool story but do I need to know it I would seriously what can I do about a lot of these you do look I think it's good that information flowing and that moves everybody for you know for me sitting in there trying to tell some jokes and feed my kids is like do I need to know everything every trouble spot going around the world to all the events of the world and to act like how much responsibility do you have outside of voting and do have the responsibility to vote cuz there's some people are very interesting people that don't vote yeah you know I don't agree with that yeah it's a participate I understand that but I don't think Michael Mouse votes doesn't he just did he say he doesn't vote I think he said he doesn't forget his reasoning but it was very logical you should be trying to participate I think his perspective is that as a commentator on the world would be better off if he didn't actually vote but just look at it how he really sees it on both sides right if I'm partial level and try and take care of your family and work hard and be good with people and help your community that's kind of the extent of what you can do and hopefully that spreads out but you know why Julian Assange tell me why is that you know well like all those people that were talking about that generation that only got news during that six-hour you know where they less citizens of the world because they only got that little dos I don't know there were less informed and the ideas that more people can get away with things I should be able to get away with like what's happening right now with Julian Assange Julian Assange in anybody's estimation if you look at what he did he distributed information that was extremely in thanks to most people in the world that didn't know about it right exposed a lot of scary shut ya suppose a lot of corruption exposed a lot of I mean what what corruption did you expose I know it's supposed it was that video that was the one of the first ones I showed them shooting that shot at these guys were they thought were soldiers and they were they were reporters way they dealt with it was very scary for people-watching to someone could just like dehumanize accidentally killing the wrong people right I make it like that was the military there was like you know hate but you kind of have to be in that mindset to be with a gun people down from the sky in the first place but put yourself in their respective someone wants to do that job and you take a regular person and then you train them to do that job and then you ask them to go and pull the trigger people did they're going to develop a coldness to them they have to but to see it so what Julian Assange did is he showed it to us and then released all sorts of I mean I haven't embarrassed to say that I haven't really studied all the files and what was released in what was it apparently when Ben Shapiro was here and he said that people's names got put out hacked into Wikileaks release that information before they could redact the names what I've been told by multiple sources I wanted but again I didn't look into it I don't know if that was correct so they're going to say that he was treasonous or that he was I don't know what they're going to say I think that your first thing was a sex charge that's what they're trying to say that he had sex with a woman they where he wore condom and then they had sex and then they had sex in the morning with no condom he didn't consent to that that he just kind of did it or something I think it was something like that think they called it surprise sex I'm sorry but the didn't make sense like that they would be going after him that way about that if you want to get somebody to go after me for whatever charges now story that I caught the little poetically describing what the embassy must have smelled like a Julian Assange dirty catshit walking through the Halls crazy ass hold you have staying here we won't leave Pamela Anderson comes over every now and then to get their freak on on skateboarding and Ecuadorian Embassy in London has been linked kinda okay crazy name it's like being in under house arrest dude I mean it's amazing that he lasted that long but they did they waited them out and then when they were never going to wait him out he's going to stay in there forever and then you guys got sick of them they just get sick of them the Ecuadorian president I think he took a photograph in front of like some lobsters and s*** and was from a leaked email in that photo got out and it was very you

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Jesus sorry I hurt his retired right you know how many cars a master showman interactive like how to keep people interested in him and I just think he just got way out of line with all this computer stuff you don't like the way I like the way he takes his losses like the way he goes out there and talk smack whatever when I think I like as a I mean like from a sport psychology point of view I think he's he's developed there you know images of any reason to you know how to talk s*** like he he didn't just win he smashed and tap to like it was only one or two moments of the firework honor was taking control with some of the Striking stand-up you know that's another joke that's another misunderstood choked out fulcrum choke you do there's a lot when you're there's a lot of it generates a lot of foreskin yeah there it is right there you see you with khabibs long-armed we had against the back of Connor and then also yanking on that that is ripping his f****** neck apartment cuz you never know until you felt one at the same time yeah you got a kind of Hillary been smashed by then to you know you've been hitting it with so many big punches from the top he takes a great shot though I'll tell you that I'm just one of those things where I think in order for him to really have a real chance at getting another shot what he's got to do is beat somebody big and say something that makes could be considerate you know but not and not in the way of what he's been doing in terms of you no talking s*** about him and tournaments Mac I mean I think the only way it's going to be public demand like he's going to have to get to a position where people want to see him fight for a trial began to see that the result may be different this time and then maybe if you could just f****** communicate something to him so you know I respect you you know all trash talk aside you know I'd like to test myself against you one more time and I think I earned it I think it's only a couple of fights beat some real big name guys and then make it to the something that could be he's actually interested in well okay so I don't know if that's the only way but it's the way that would be that I would like to see they already offered it off like that path that you're talking about sounds like a one that one that fits good for me I'd like to see it that way don't hear it's hard because it's not it's not always what I want to see and it's not it's not the type of person I am but not everyone's going to be me that's not Westwood makes the world go round people want to see it and also sometimes it does bring some energy and some you know when it's well done it does bring some energy and some excitement to the fight and to the sport and at the same time not every fight what Sage wedding really interested in was really excited about the UFC is that there's a lot of fights that people want to see that have no bearing on the title right and so there's something to that fight such as people want to see anything trash talk sometimes makes fight two people in the same yeah for sure it's great for selling things is great for selling pay-per-views but the question is like is it good for the sport overall then should be something that we encourage or Hollywood and that's the thing is how do we decide what's good for the sport from what way right how do we decide is it good for the way the sport you want the sport to look at as far as martial arts and being respectful thing and people looking at us like that maybe not is it good for the sport of the growth of the sport and four more opportunities for athletes and far athletes to become names that that draw attention from other people that normally didn't know about it I don't know I don't know either but yeah so I don't know that I'm torn I like both I like to type character that's very respectful and the house and never talks trash and fights like you know just a world champion caliber martial artist and I also like God talks mad s*** I think it's funny yeah yeah exactly enjoy it it's like I like press conferences for that very reason you know guys are talking s*** to each other and they're just looking over at each other on the podium and you know what's funny come on if some of them some of it is hilarious yeah Jeremy Stephens asking for Pfizer who the f*** is that guy was affected when he was like okay I don't have time to insult everyone so let's he's a f****** character Michael Myers isn't that weird situation that where he really never has to fight again so you got to wonder what his motivation is you know like he has a hundred million dollars he has a gigantic whiskey company that proper 12 is murdering it that that place is killing it that the company is there they're moving in other countries now and they're killing it have to do a thing ever financially to eat Diamond sandwiches basically do whatever the f*** you want for the rest of his life and just live off interest but he still likes to fight yeah I think so I mean that's what brought him into the TV fight you didn't have to fight khabib but just know how much does he want and does he want the same way a guy like stylebender wants it or Kylie Calvin Kelvin Gastelum want it and also I think that you know part of wanting it is different to maybe maybe just maybe people might want things on their terms too uncertain terms of way you get it is what it's like like some people I call you want it I want it anyway I can get it some people might want it and say well now I want it this way by Cowboy that was a fight that they were there basically trying to make that he was going to have to be a co-main event and because of that I think Connor was not interested anymore he wanted to be a main event you know and I'm like Jesus like is that really what kept us from Connor versus Cowboy can you guys come up with some 160-lb title or some s*** just come on man do it for the title titles left and right how about you come up with him when that was going to Milwaukee title just come on man Cowboy for the title</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I get happy when your referee in a fight song Oh that can be handled the I mean I agree with you on virtually every single time you and I've had a discussion about what should or shouldn't be done much of a struggle it is where I try to sleep clinch work exactly I had a guy Up Against the Cage they're working for something they might stall each other out but eventually someone might break down running in this is how a guy like nurmagomedov wins fights against Elite guys this is how Randy quotes when a lot of fights it's a legitimate tactic yeah it doesn't look fun for you you know I like a guy beating a guy Up Against the Cage just short elbows knees to the thighs you might think that that's not enough but that's that's that's a good way to wear a dude out and you keep doing that until eventually you break them especially when you're someone likes to pay or yeah what I expect and expect from me and you know any so I don't want to I want to interfere as little as possible and so that's that's my goal and so are you not giving instruction by telling you a work work or what I expect and you know I expect you to do something to him looking for big shot to advance your position and then do ask me like well how much how long will you leave something stay or go with what is still out there both sides relax that's still but like you're talkin about even up against the fence and especially that's where a lot of things are really getting excited how to really see that app layout you know especially by the guys are you know if they're they're striking each other maybe in some of the other weight classes you know then they don't have that one punch always someone guys do but not everyone does and that's where things are going to get cited in that Clint if there's a tension if there's a tension that we need to see where that's going to go and let you know work itself out I'm so glad you said that was the perfect way to say it and then that's absolutely 100% agree and there's there's moments where is the course of the fight was really unfortunate Union referee commercial ousmane Demian Maia did you and I don't think so whoever did that one we don't even have to pull it up but there was a moment in the first round when Demian Maia got a hold of Tomorrow is trying to take his back standing they had like one hooking in the clinch and he was hanging on to him and the referee decided not enough was taking place they separate and I'm like oh you can do that so hard to get ahold of that guy didn't my about to get you back and no I know that's not going anywhere. Sarah went crazy you know he has that that podcast he doesn't Jim Norton things like you just don't do that to the guy like you got a hold of him like he he might take his back here like like you know you saw what he did with lime good when he takes you back yeah the beast but when Damien especially early in the round got his back already and then any other lot of interesting take down from there to while he's like he does goes back and forth with halfway taking your back and then one you're defending the takedown he starts taking your back and yeah when you go back then he's back working on yet so now he works really he works at a really interesting place there you know it's stunning to watch him go through guys like when he went to Rick story of Jesus Christ Fresno's like woah yeah this is this is a heavy f****** squeezes guy ass and then he did it to Carlos Condit who else is done to his uncle a lot of guys he gets hold you just said we just don't like his friend when he gets on top he seemed so heavy on magni when you have ran through Neil Magny yeah this is this is a heavy f****** squeezes guy ass and then he did it to Carlos Condit who else is done to his uncle a lot of guys to get to hold you just said we just don't like his butt and when he gets on top he seemed so heavy on magne when you have ran through Neil Magny</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> have a love-hate relationship with conspiracies I love some of them some of them are fast anytime I'm like okay what the f*** happened there you know but and then some of them like I can't do this anymore I do when I was younger I used to think about it but then I think when I had a kid what's the Illuminati exactly I'm busy I got to go but I get how people get sucked into that rabbit-hole you know that the other day but with aliens I watched three alien documentaries in a row I watched this one on Bob Lazar who was the guy who claims he worked at Area 51. Very compelling very interesting that the top us and when he would suggest yes Area 51 and flying saucers I think it's called is on iTunes it down the f****** good because there's some things that this guy knew that if it's almost certain that he worked where he said he worked that he worked at Area 51 the question becomes he told the truth about all these things that have since been proven to be true weird so he gave he gave first cut at those troops right long time ago it was Nevada Temple heard about this yet he was worried about his life would happen apparently the guy was working in this area doing research for whatever the government wanted him to do at Area 51 what did there who knows he gets fired from his job and then takes his friends to this viewing position in the mountains where they can see them flying flying saucers telling them they fly them out phase I'm going to bring you guys we're going to watch it he's this video tape this on old-school VHS tape you can see these flying saucers flying around Area 51 and he says these are not not being piloted by by aliens these are being piloted by human beings but that these are real devices these things are real there was a rear vehicle and they got this real vehicle from some other some other civilization from somewhere in space and they had nine of them it's total horseshit when you hear it then you watch the video and so the question is, how did he know that they were going to be flying these things up their how do you know they were going to doom on Wednesday how do you know where I could see it and how did he know how did he know about the biometric data how do you know about Element 115 who's talking about this element is man-made element that it's a real element that they now identified but when he was talking about in 1980 no wonder what the f*** he was talking about or 1984 whatever it was when he was when he I interviewed about this so when this guy is bringing the stuff up today and people are looking back at all the different things that he said that have since been proven to be true especially the existence of Area 51 that the government had to at some point time of the 90s they had to say that they own the base and say that it did didn't fact exist the top secret area or the like they're so do not enter zone or they'll pull you over do if you get past a certain spot they wanted to broaden that area so people couldn't be watching their craps fly around like Bob Lazar was and when they did that when they expanded the territory that's when they had to actually admit that the base was real so he was proven to be correct on so many different things that he said like to explain how they get them out there explain what their research was and he said that they had these things that run on some they they manipulate gravity in some way and they're very small because aliens are very small little creatures like a child like a ten-year-old child it makes you know what the f*** man he saw them operate how could he have known them if he didn't work at Area 51 of the most compelling aspects of it and the fact that area 51 was at one point in time by the government's take it didn't exist and then it was like a legend this is when he was talking about it and so watching this documentary and seeing this guy 30 years later still basically saying exactly the same thing with a bunch of things have been proven proven Cynthia yeah that isn't it's a trip Matt me if the government really did at one point in time have some crafts that it got from another planet what the f*** man but the thing is like how would we take that how do you think people would take that if they found out I think that handle that if they really knew there was something that was so sophisticated that I could visit us from another planet he'd be here in minutes and the White House lawn and shoot with bullets how would people take that I think that people would just keep going on like with every other scare think so there could be a meteor that supposed to hit us right right people take it I mean if they say could have been anybody know if he's coming or not if you saw one cup is because you don't see the alien come in if people realize that you have these guys could show up right I don't know I'm really conspiracy that stuff going on is the hand those out right now until people that he's was a hoax not a hoax that it was like all the staff member I always got it yeah government cuz yeah yeah yeah I was making that HIV does not cause AIDS we had them on way back in the day early on was that guy's name dr. Peter duesberg yeah he is a professor at the University of california-berkeley I believe think he's a bob biologist and his take was that HIV does not cause AIDS that would causes AIDS a compromised immune system that HIV is actually a weak virus and it shows up in the immune systems of people that are already compromised that's why you're finding these people that it's not the cause of their immune system being confidante compromised symptom of it and that with these people are really dying from is there their whole system being f***** up by drugs that either they're taking AZT which destroys our body and it was a cancer medication like a chemotherapy that was so powerful killing people quicker than the cancer was and then they switched it over to using it with people that had AIDS cousin in the early days they would call AIDS gay cancer and it was all these different like they're trying to figure out what it was and what it did and early on this guy was saying that so we had on the podcast and people got so mad their they were so mad that giving this guy on platform to spread his his propaganda in his lies and was like Wow but he is a professor righty has unlike legitimate cancer research he's you know I mean don't you want to listen to him and I wanted to get someone onto debate him but nobody wanted to debate him it was like trying to get someone to debate a holocaust denier wants to give them a platform which I understand but those those kinds of I mean it's very highly unlikely that all these doctors are incorrect and are hiding the fact that you know and then now the fact that they've got these HIV medication to basically they can take people and make them hiv-negative now a couple people of tested hiv-negative I know that I'm not going to watch some of those things you know that some of them are like meet up with the statement then we all know and we know there's some like I don't I don't know too much to know yeah yeah yeah there's nothing like weed it starts your gears turning you start thinking that's where a lot of people start taking conspiracies against them to write you get high and they start taking the world closing in on you everybody's watching you surveillance but you'll probably don't feel like going to get high I just sometimes I kind of like it though you know I like it cuz it ends and when it ends you feel great it's almost like a brutal brain workout like you you go digging deep into your psyche and find out all the things you're scared of you know it's like with work yeah you like to come look at you so good about me from that angle before</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> a bummer if you don't know what we're talking about TJ Dillashaw tested positive for injectable EPO which is serious performance-enhancing substance and in some circumstances according to Jeff novitzky it's giving people strokes and I'd heard this to that like young guys doing like Tour de France type shyt would have struggled you because they were taking too much EPO cuz he's supposed to take one take two right right right right right right to do that you know your blood and we're always getting away with things beforehand right and try to maybe try to do it in a way where there won't get caught but I think that's like it was this much as good when trt was legal testosterone replacement therapy where we would hear about guys tested like 14 1470 like which isn't saying it's like superhuman no person has ever lived at us 1400 like a natural walking around testosterone level is crazy hyper human but they just get these benefits from that will tell me people who walk around naturally if they've never been tested though that's true freaky living room looks like he was born on Stewart and legit genetic freaks does not that would be crazy there's some people that just like yoel Romero I mean what in the truck it doesn't matter how many steroids you take it doesn't matter what you do like to do look like that you have to be a genetic freak have you been looking around yeah what's his name probably a lot of meteors the TJ thing apparently they went and tested his old fight pissed with Cody to and that tested positive for EPO as well and then Cody start freaking out what do you do if they if they go back and say f*** it let's test all the fights that finds out that he was doing it like five six seven fights what do you do but then the whole nother can of worms to because like all the fights and then what about all that because right like we can test everybody from 10 years ago 15 years ago like what if they could use you solder style testing Jack Daddy and the past I'm so glad that all these things are above my paygrade in charge of that program you have to really wonder where is the line you certainly want to test a guy for a fight that happened a week ago you certainly want to hold me now and check is if some new testing methods come out if there was a fight from a year ago you certainly would check that how many years back do you go especially if it's not expensive like what if it's easy and cheap to do the last 5 fights and then you have like 400 bites that you now have to like change the result of yeah I don't know I don't know either look we all know at one point in time performance enhancing drugs where she was part of mixed martial arts and that's why the UFC stepped up and decided to Institute this program was a big part of it I think it's a big part of professional sports in general sure so I think that we're going to be it's going to be coming up regardless anyway so I think maybe that's why the notes of the USA took a position right I think of the other sports I mean guys get caught doing things but a lot of other sports regulate themselves right yeah I don't know I think the NFL regulates itself Wheatland Electric something different on sport is involved in baseball they have like a three-strike rule if the first time is like somewhere in the 1025 game range and then the second one is like half the season third one got for a whole year if you do it again your band the baseball are NFL if you have a big money maker in your sport and then somebody outside of your company just comes on says here on the government might have the right to touch this guy I mean that's that's a perfect example he is the biggest star right now other than Connor and Connor is not active and Jon Jones is fighting all the time he wants to all the time that if that's where you ever find out what's really going on as you hire a bunch of werewolves and they just let him loose right when I let it go check this go go out there cyborg attested a lot a lot a lot of people got tested it's just a little crazy and a lot of them up a little bit posted where you going to be at at then yeah I promise if you training hard that 8 to 10 is so huge you might get hit with a punch if they wake you up after like six hours or 5 hours it's possible that a punch might connect on you that wouldn't have connected if you got eight that's not brush it at yeah that's that's real I did I did hydrate it's just not smart to stop athletes in the middle of the training camp wake him up yeah I mean I get the testing but I feel like you could get to them at noon okay just you can get to them at noon you got good testing now just but we don't we I mean I don't know that I don't know cuz I think the best time maybe at the earliest earlier the better by maybe I don't know nothing about this EPL apparently in this is Shabbos telling me was that they didn't it didn't used to be detectable the way it is now they've got these new methods of detection and epl's 1/2 that apparently from what I've read don't listen to me I'm not a doctor they can absolutely tell that you injected it it's it's injectable day comes in the injectable form that's what the there's no chance of a tainted steroid supplement it's definitely EPO so that's that's f***** up as a giant Advantage advantage of powers really hard and then be ready to go the next day what do you think the answer is for me like this is all stuff that like to be honest I don't really I was out of my wheelhouse to deal with but also it's hard to have an answer like you said they do we go back and keep testing them when these new things coming so what do we do with the NFL Hall yeah yeah it's just it's very interesting you know 10 years or more command I don't know man which is but if you find out that TJ tested positive for the Kodi fight to watch Kodi sure as an argument there and what if it's the fight before that was because a lot of that was a lot of people have arguments yeah there's a lot of guys yet so it's a fan and I'm a big fan of watching him perform but just attained his legacy that just does his no way around it when can you get caught cheating which is this stuff is there's no way it's not cheating on this is just cheating and this isn't any accident its dictates your legacy take away from the fact that these amazing PJ's an amazing fighter but f*** man that did test positive for EPO in the Henry sahuto find is also crazy to watch the progression all the work he did and how much you know he was getting better every fight until he came just yeah but you got to think how much like if you're on TPO how much does that really allow you to train extra time how much is that allow you to recover what's the Bennett like what is a quantifier benefit it must be pretty significant cuz there's a lot of you know the cyclist lot of lot of heavy-duty endurance athletes use it to try it and she'll like that for bragging rights an epidemic of you going to notice that you're able to like like the other day you can barely finish a roll of loop around the Rose Bowl at three-mile Loop and then you start taking it and you can get wet 5 6 miles and wonder I wonder I think what it does is it raise your threshold if you're already in Elite endurance athlete to I think for them that's what it is like they already looking for that extra Edge so they're already in Elite endurance athletes already in the Tour de France and they take that APL inside there more oxygen they Don't Ride juice and Frank I like TJ his style so Connecticut so much moving explosion smooth dances like he needs that juice it's not like a calm easy game where he's around everything's fast fast fast fast fast it's crazy it's hard it's it's a hard one to swallow uncomfortable talked about maybe some hard stoppages talk about some heart-stopping it's just going to be more take away and then everything I could say or think about I can't think of anything that solution or yeah I don't think anybody I think we're in this stage right now where they're probably looking at the data going okay what is this signify and how many more people should we test once once they develop a new method of testing that's the whole reason why they want to keep the old sample anyway nice new more sensitive methods of detection and you know about this stuff cuz I know the truth you're a science freak and you're saying with many people about it and David Sinclair was one more recent ones who did this discussion about life extension and different anti-aging Solutions in different things they're coming up with but when I come through with is at the other end as there are probably hundreds of thousands of people that are involved in either legitimate supplements or legitimate molecules or testing hormones on people or you know trying all these different things to try to figure out how to get the body to perform better some of them are legal and some of them are you legal and that's where it gets strange to get like the guy with the ball Coke I like to Conte comes long as I live I got one just rub it on but but why big you know people just started Rec light and come on man look at me Sammie so so look at me in the eye what are you doing you know when they all lived there all like exhibited these obvious physiological changes where that you could tell them whatever they were doing was really effective stop working on that right now all the Trap trying to get it better there's probably thousands of people that are trying to come up with stuff that sneaks past this testing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> last fight man if I do die blocks that fight I watch that finish like 10 times trying to figure out what happened or whether he's out or what he wasn't out I was pretty convinced that at one point time he went out and then come out Rosemont change my mind tomorrow Usman showed the we watch the video tape together the bathroom Tracy this thumbs up was the thumb going up or was it Thumb in a thumbs-up position going this way right arm drops was that I'm going to be okay so when I get a job for no reason whatsoever and so that's what I that's what I'm have to work with cuz that's what you know we don't know what someone's feeling whatever we just see if they're doing something that doesn't make sense when you see an arm go limp at that time you're going to assume that the person is unconscious we assumed the broadcast like you do you see two guys going up the leg locks you see your noodle massive legs and you know you got to you're going to have to help one guy out and figure out who's tapping and make sure you're on the right when I seen some naked choke specially got in the back face up I took a sigh relief my job just got so much easier this guy you know it's not like you're going to go out and then a second take some extreme amount of damage he may go out I have a second to make sure it's not even a second a half a breath and make sure he's okay and let it go out and he's not going to take any other damage a bulldog choke we haven't any other choke or somebody's where where there's pressure on the neck and they're spending been the c-spine backwards like that that's a that's a rough situation for me so I see someone go limp and I know that on top of it they're no longer putting tension on their neck and their neck is being bad I can't I you know I can't see that I should do something different than that cuz that's the talk to people about this I like to talk to people have opinions about fight especially people are interested in who they know what they talking about because if I always have a situation if I was having a mindset that I'm always doing the right thing I can't get better so I'm going to have to look at something and says there is no a teachable moment there is there a way I can learn from this and is there anyway I could do something different and no I don't think I think what that same situation with an arm going well with that type of a choke on someone I don't know of a defense that required to arm I would think the arm should be doing something else at this time I don't know I don't see that I should do something different you know I'm always interested always looking and always I love these type of conversations but right now I can't think of you know him tell you something it was an amazing fight yeah it was the first time I seen before and you know when you're his pressure or something special and the way Robbie dealt with it and Robbie had him and he had him in trouble and I was so close to stopping that fight when you're on the ground yet so many times that could make you have a feeling that it's inconclusive but I can't think of what else I should have done but you know I mean especially for that that fight for those two guys yeah you always wanted yeah the people to have a feeling of conclusion there when we talked about on the phone when you brought up the the damage the possible damage that neck with a bulldog choke you might be cutting off nerves and you might be bending the spine and kind of a f*****-up way I really hadn't considered that we're not what I was thinking of the choke when he grabbed hold them I was just thinking it was a blood choke but you're right like the way you lean in on Rudolph choking lean back yeah that's a lot of pressure on the neck sunchokes where there for you to fight where a guy did one of these moves I know you had to move for it take me where he's been in the spine back order it wasn't a question that I think guys have a name a lot of people doing it before right well we we started doing it in 10th Planet a few years back its I think people have done it but it is basically folks it's like a guillotine from the back it's like taking a video of Allegra naked choke hooks but instead of choking guy this way which is how you would do it which is wrap your forearm underneath his neck and wrap the other arm behind his head instead of doing that you wrap your arm all the way of front like a guillotine hold the from the back and you have ungodly leverage right it's ungodly how much pressure you put on someone's neck and Zara front Scott Epstein he used it quite a few times we called the Executioner is that it there have a have a habit here for you the something like this this is a little different this guy had arms in this is different but it's similar farms in joke about it but what he would do if he wanted to do an executioner is he would get his hips underneath the guy and get back position this is just a really good north-south choke and he once you have the guy he sat up and pulled the guys body up onto him and almost a sitting position and then put hooked right before where y'all roll the guy to the side and I'll come just to walk it through and figure out how it work you put hunt and I was sitting there was like okay this isn't illegal my stop this fight it's not you know it's not an illegal move but I don't want to see how this plays out and the guy got one hurricane and almost a second it was about to go in the guy tapped and when I pulled him off the guy couldn't move his neck was f***** up yeah he couldn't move you know he has some sort of thing I don't know what's going on he was he was he couldn't move he was terrified I was terrified guillotine yeah I've heard of that yeah so so that's why would some submissions you know especially some of the trucks is like okay at things are slowing down in okay things are got a little bit easier for me with that one things are not easy at all that's not something that I want to I want to play what I think it's kind of disappointed with some some people have a platform I don't want to mention any names but some people have a platform of kind of tossed it out if something Sensational say oh look at this is he drawing responsible when it's dangerous techniques like that well I think you really pointed that out about the neck in a very important way that and I think that's something that people should really take into consideration when you see someone if you seen people have you ever every time we got caught in a twister yeah it's a horrible it's supposed to be leaving for the back of the way it's set up because it's not like it's it's not like a fast thing that catches you off-guard it's a long road to it feel so terrible and there. So then is Defcon 4 when you take a rear naked choke grip from the Twister position oh yeah and I seen representing that when I think it's a difficult situation. So I've seen other harder situations by then I mean like yeah she jokes are out and then let her go and she's she's asleep from the Bulldog choke and Ashlee evans-smith steps up covered in blood and it's crazy that was crazy but there's that one didn't Chris lights out Lytle catch Tiki in a bulldog choke I think you did but anyways we're going to go to Leon chokes out Pat miletich cuz this is for the title and he caught him in a bulldog choke and it is like that was it that was used to call it a schoolyard headlock that was that's why I say that reference of the hardest job cuz you were you in that situation you do have to take those things into consideration what kind of damage is doing this guy's neck is he out is when his arm went limp okay when do I still got to get it I got to save him like you know you were evaluating situation is always there's different do you know you're evaluating the threat to the person you're evaluating if there's a threat coming you how much how well can they deal with it has a lot of stuff going on there you know we take it really serious I take a really serious it's to me it's it's I feel that I have a sacred trust I feel that it's one of these positions at like stupid people a lot of them could be doing a lot of things with your life and they've chosen this path to and they take time from their family they take time away from other careers where they could be progressing and all to meet their dreams and hopes and I need to balance that with your safety so it's something I think about a lot even in the way I talk to my friends and I mean to always you know I'm always on time I'm always working as a referee anytime I'm out in the streets are with friends people going to ask me what I think about this fighter who died thinking me better and I because of his job you doing you don't longer have the the luxury of having the you know of talking about mixed martial arts in the front way about who's going to win and how's this going to happen because who knows I might referee the fight and everyone's going to be on the internet like hers referee in the fighting we are having beers yesterday that's what he told me right round right right yes you have that attitude what is this one right here Lowe's had some spectacular grappling real Merrily on man while transitioning his his his explosiveness is agility and he was he's so athletic he was doing stuff that no one else had a really high level submission game early on in 96 and I didn't have that kind of Game and Fish Commission it was tight that the Matthews when was crazy remember that Corey had him up and he's yeah that was he put them to sleep as they get up Matt Hughes like his and hers car saying like stand-up you one you wanted like what happened Raiden squeeze that you squeeze it so Matt goes unconscious he's out cold he doesn't know what's going on with no one knows what's going on so Carlos his head hit the ground when he went down like that knocked him out right right right I woke up from the choke and then like you want sing about this Robbie Lawler Ben askren fight like whose mom was saying they got to run it back and I was like it wouldn't be a bad thing to run it back I mean at the same time you know we got to be honest here like as far as running back how many fights are is that happen the UFC are there because it's exciting what people want to see Joe most right so and what people want to see Joe most right so Brock Lesnar DC's perfect example right so that's exciting as people want to see it and then tell me the excitement has been generated by throwing me under the bus but cool</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> walking up to a car that's freaky enough you don't know what's inside the door like you're playing roulette you don't know what's inside that car you know light luck there are some bad police out there but as just put yourself in that spot where you're a cop getting out your car walking to a car with tinted windows Yep knocking on the window you don't know what you're going to be don't know if it's a barrel with shotgun you don't you have no idea you have no idea and people have to rely that tension they carry with them all day they might have 20 of those interactions absolutely all day and it'll really bad yeah and if you have any b******* or don't appreciate the respect that they're immediately going to go okay yeah you f****** a****** into that you're the enemy now and it's horrible it's horrible that we give a person the kind of power that police officers have when they have used it but it's all so horrible that we create this relationship between Fellowship the purpose of cop is just a citizen one of us where we are the enemy if we're not following the book special in the book of stupid like at the pot laws or something dumb like that like Jesus Christ you know I've been pulled over a couple times you don't I even been profiled and I would like and I'm half-black you know you don't know what I really am a lot of people but I've been profiled so I know when I see when I hear the stories and I've been in cars with my friends that are dark-skinned black and they've been pulled over and it's a thing where you're upset cuz you feel like you're being profiled but man wants that cop walks over you need to show all due respect because they they control that game now it's 100% their game once pull up to your window you're in their car they are entirely necessary for a civilized society 100% And if you want to be able to call the police or some s*** is going down you should appreciate them when they're there and you know this does not discount all the bad collie yeah absolutely discount all the things we've all seen the shootings are unjustified punching syringes for this is what we have to keep though perspective because there's so many interactions there's so many cops out there to deal with PTS all day long because for a decade or two decades of their life they have been dealing with crime and violence all day long everyday and they dress like the enemy they're not just a cop there cop was to wear cop outfit so everywhere you go like when you were playing quake and you play entombed cops like bad guy see cops as the enemy you're being need to be the enemy even if you've never had an interaction if you're a bad guy and that's a cop that's the enemy and that is a crazy position as people to be that even for people that don't have interactions with cops in a lot they still considered the enemy sure because if they pull you over for Speed Of Time over the top where it's like come on now let me ask you this what if everybody agreed to never speed like we made up like a six-month agreement in this country where we would never speed and no one speed it and there was no more traffic violations in terms of speeding tickets what the f*** would happen he was like people just get laid off left and right it would just file it department they put quotas on you cuz you're a glorified Revenue collector we not supposed to think that's a problem though like when you're having people over and I think that it it all look the problems with the police in people start from the court and that's major problem if you have to pull over people even if you're a cop and go they're not really doing anything bad but I have to meet my quota of tickets that starts from a very negative Place terrible terrible terrible terrible place in terrible place for both parties she's writing someone to take it for no reason like you catch someone speed limit 65 or 6169 you told him over like it though really even pay attention like there's no way unless I'm not looking at the road like it less have cruise control I'm not looking at the road might get to 69 on my back up to 65 again even though I'm trying to go the speed limit play automatically act you just got jacked it in your mind and protecting it we all know he's writing a ticket just to write a ticket it's probably the 27th or 28th of the month yet and I got to meet their quota any so the police Radars you and then a cop car pulls you over here yeah yeah and that was the last time we went to date I went with my wife and son and we got pulled like a cop car came out of nowhere and my wife hears the difference you know that this shows that my wife is white from Wyoming right and this is the big difference that's real like that that's what I Pilgrim that's like Casper the Friendly Ghost white Cowboy White write Cowboys up their Wyoming Cowboys on a ranch no sitting at Gillette Wyoming Gillette Wyoming and this is the difference in cultures we have in this is why I try to tell my wife when the cop came over his name let's see officer Andrew he comes over I'm very polite I said yes sir you got it no problem I was speeding no problem my wife and the cop goes with pulled you over by Flame so give me a ticket I like hey officer and have a great day is like you too sir my wife is in the backseat with my son rolls down the window when he's walking away scuse me whatsa black SUVs passing us and it's from a plane are you serious I'm about to die the cop turns back around like comes to my side of the window says excuse me ma'am and but just a privilege to be able to talk to a cop like that because she has no idea she has no idea that's the real one soundstage know you f****** s*** I know that's hilarious and I'm like who should for sure I will but I will it's it's just it's scared me cuz I was scared white people okay okay so she warns horseshoe like about a plane and she's given this cop attitude all know like you almost killed me she's like stop being ridiculous I'm like no wrong place wrong time wrong history wrong background wrong state of mind that he's in like a black dude wears a white woman for sure but now she gets that cuz we have a son you know what I mean so I think once you have a multi-ethnic son now she's like oh I'm all about marijuana I'm all about she doesn't look like she's all about the ethnic cartoons not in the family is trying you know anybody has to ever worry about getting accidentally shot by a cop and the problem I think is not going to go away until the problem crime goes away and that's not going to happen either so what do we do to make life safer for everybody that's a real good f****** question I think they're black. Black lives matter did that people don't want to accept but it's really important is became an ass thought yes it's not just another story in the news it's a national salt like this isn't a movement to try to eradicate this and all the times that you seen guys plant guns on after they shot them like Thomas crazy videos yet you see videos of black people with no guns getting shot and then here's a problem they go to court and then the cops are innocent she the one with the guy throws the gun down on the ground was it was it a taser throw down on the ground it was like he shot him and then as he's coming out to the body drop something on the ground when I was growing up at least I don't know when it changed the cops were supposed to shoot not to kill you but to handicap you like shoot you in the leg shoot you in the arm because I'm not that good a shot there's a lot of cops are just not good at shooting guns and there's a lot of that are military trains that are there professional very serious you are but it's like I watch the video the other day of a guy getting it all altercations off duty cop got into an altercation with this guy and he tried to pull his gun out the guy grabbed him grab his rescheduled not know how to fight at all and probably only knew how to like shoot people he gets taken down the guy obviously knew Jiu-Jitsu mounted them took the gun from him through the gun away and beat the f*** out of them from the mount Townsend turns his back he gets his back is beating the s*** out of them it's horrific because this cop thought he was safe and pulls gotten one example but just because someone's a cop doesn't mean they're well prepared there are those out there for those are also some slobs like I've seen some guys that are other cop make bro you can't run a block, are you okay you know if this is a ridiculous position for you to put yourself in and anybody else you trying to protect your handicap by gluttony but but at the same time we do need them we need them to be more respected and appreciate it did not very respected and appreciated by a lot of people I think that's and see what I need to be serviced what I hate about this conversation whatever side they're on with the cops are going to pull whatever they want cuz we've talked negatively negatively said some things about and I hate how we're in such a polar place where in the form or what I hate you can't have a conversation anymore and that's where we're at right now it's like you can't say anything wrong with cops because then you don't support the cops if you support the cops then you'll get attacked by the other side anything wrong with cops because then you don't support the cops if you support the cops then you'll get attacked by the other side going oh well they kill innocent people I know you're clip of anything you said today without you further elaboration because most of what you said you further elaborate absolutely he could take that one snippet and just put a little clip up somewhere or worse yet quote it</div>

I go out there the next day it's just blood stains everywhere in his wife is picking up his hair that stuck to the concrete and I remember it so vividly I was next door neighbor with Eric and we were sitting on the curb watching this lady pick up her husband's hair that was cut in and that's the first time I ever saw death and it was was bad never rode a motorcycle because of that reason to ride motorcycle other than it's awesome motorcycle safety classes and then two of my friends wiped out one of them got hit by a car and one of them fell going around a corner back to shoulder up after that accident probably about six years later you know when 3 wheelers with big back to ya and my friend same friend that was on the curb we were three wheeling and and where I grew up there is bunch of dishes to it going and he thought he could go down in the ditch and come up the other side but I think you forgot that it's flat on the bottom of real dishes literally we're going and we hit the bottom and I flew out in literally have my face was like just wreck it was in the hospital and and we didn't have helmets that that farts and cuz we're young and dumb and where I grew up there is bunch of dishes so we're going and he thought he could go down in the ditch and come up the other side but I think you forgot that it's flat on the bottom of real ditches literally we're going and we hit the bottom and I flew out in literally half my face was like just regular than a hospital and and we didn't have helmets and cuz we're young and dumb and stupid stupid</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> right because it's all like crystals and healers to tell people looking to be spiritual if they've given up on on traditional religion but they seem to need that sort of vibe until they they get into like spiritual stuff and channelers and healers have you got it all day long I've been believe this more more lately though that our understanding what are memory is is very limited and that the reason why people are scared of things but some things is probably because there's some sort of genetic memory of someone that they knew like I bet your kid will have somehow or another that knowledge of that motorcycle accident and that feat this I think she goes through DNA you know why is kids scared of monsters why is he scared of bullets or fires or you know what you might want to see if they're scared of something that I was scared of growing up nowadays animals used to eat people yeah that's what I think I think we're monsters represent like Jaguars and s*** like you going to the Jungle try to get some water and get jacked that's our ancestors all of our ancestors every single human being on this planet came from Africa all of us one hundred percent of us everyone all of us got eaten all of our answers so can our DNA is wired afraid of monsters in the dark Blues are cats Man by cats like all the time. I don't know about that this is very scared for a moment but I don't believe in that thing can animals have instincts right look here's a perfect example of what kind of animals have weird and thinks that they all sniff each other's assholes they all piss on spots for other animals did they don't teach my dog how to do that my dog is 6 weeks old and he pees on it but he learned from his call people that like when you remember he didn't know Jack schitt so he learned that from him I never loved no I think it's in his DNA that but what is the DNA like doesn't your DNA carry some traces of information onto your own children like what I noticed in my children okay they share certain weird traits that I have that I don't fit like like obsessive-compulsive traits that I don't think they see because I don't really bring that home especially the workout stuff and the Simpson things are really good kind of psychotic about martial arts stuff my my middle daughter has that in a crazy wet and I'm like okay this is me if I was a girl okay if I was a little girl this is me like my memory that's in her or is it do I have like some weird obsessive Gene and looks like he does certain looks that in a my wife goes he's acting like you right now or is he knows in his head that that's how I'd like that a lot of this stuff he does I don't I don't even do oh oh come over to watch him to go you know he's just like you when you were this age and it's so wet and yeah it's in the DNA it's in something right whatever it is whether it's in cellular memory DNA some sort of genetic information gets passed on when their parents their child</div>

And you know they have reasons to back it up and turns of like the economy what they think is happening with job creation all these different things that he's doing that may or may not have devastating implications depending on who you talk to this next button on that one but there's obviously maybe I'm too stupid I don't understand that stuff but I'm saying doing that may or may not have devastating implications depending on who you talk to this next button on that one but there's obviously and then they also people say wow this is a trend that was actually going on during the Obama Administration he's just riding the wave maybe I'm too stupid I don't understand that stuff but I'm saying there's in terms of numbers it's not like the country is completely imploding right now I mean maybe some people buy some people's metric it's not doing as well as he would like to pretend it is probably</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I used to be so agreeably a big dude you're strong that's why Nobody messes with me and all that stuff today I don't know how would react like I don't know I used to be a bouncer at club play college football like I was a tough dude now after my Park Gym find little bit not to fight people but what are you so you don't worry about it I never worry about it okay well then don't worry about it I'll be home at 8:30 so f***** up and got tackled Jesus couldn't but Josie you think anybody's going to jump on stage when you're on rational people anyone okay so so say I started to go to a fight just like where would I start at like what I do I would say you should try Jiu-Jitsu cuz it's fun as really good exercise and you'll learn some stuff like that you learn how to do it it's it's a technique based art where is like say if if you like there's there's guys that I will do just respond with call rolling okay guys I will roll with that are weaker than me smaller than me and tap me everytime I roll with them and I'm a black belt okay that's reality like if there's there's nothing that a hundred and fifty pounds that I can roll with that I know will tap me virtually every time we roll because their technique is sharper they train more often than I am there more Focus than more in the group but I also heard you say like one of your podcast you got to watch out who trained with because they might just try to hurt you spot just a little further than that in Tarzana okay machado's where I got my black belt Jean Jacque Machado a train there sometimes and he said play some Malibu but it closed down because of the fire but they they have an outstanding Jim's like one of the best in the country and it's in that area would like as far as teaching top-notch like but there's a lot of really good Jiu-Jitsu schools now it's not like I like when I started in 96 it was hard to find a good gym there's a five of them in all of California right now cuz it was just starting out like 93 is when Jiu-Jitsu sort of emerged in the public Consciousness because the UFC and then there is the gym started are popping out popping up I was really took my first class and then Crossing Gracie's I thought they were the same but then like a couple other places how long does it take you to get to a black belt like for you some guy took me a long time I was a brown belt for eight years but it was just because I wasn't training as much as I should have liked that you don't they don't give them away like you have to be a real black belt what it means decides what is somebody just watch as uterus and you do know be in the back of the store and I was like dude this motherfukers on fire he started hittin that Groove that where will you go and sit down you want to watch is set and I think when that happens in Jiu-Jitsu it's the same kind of think I start talking about like to do Mike has been tapping everybody he's just his ear so sharp then you know like this guy is on the quest and you'll see a guy go from white belt to black belt in three years but they have to be super exceptional like really unusual athletes unusual mindset unusual discipline it can't happen most of time ago garden-variety estimate is like 10 years is realistic white belt to black belt for a regular person if you really train hard and you really dedicate yourself but freaks can get there quicker like BJP he won the Mundial switch is the World Championships after three years of training three years of training with a black belt when the world will be doing that to BJ's a special guy though I just also got legs are like arms he has leg dexterity like no one on the planet longer limbs like a Rodger Gracie is a perfect example is a really tall long guy doing the best Jiu-Jitsu players ever they can do things with those limbs that are short of person can't do in terms of like Leverage from joints to buy this like disadvantages to every frame like there's a guy who's Tamar pajares a famous like tank of a guy 757-200 plus pounds and just rips guy's legs apart and he uses this like short style did dive in on people's legs and ketamine heel Hooks and cars and rip their legs price terrifying that style heavily-favored is being built like a little tank where is like that long like you are you're a tall long guy you would have like good Darth chokes good rear-naked good good armbars good triangles unit of length in The Leverage with that link special with triangle cuz long-legged guys they can like sometimes a guy like me with short legs I'll get my legs crossed and I have to adjust a Lot bill sent up by triangle where's you might be able just close it up right there so you'll have like more opportunities for triangles because the length of your limbs have you would you have ever been in a point in your in your career when you were doing Jiu-Jitsu where you how would you have been in the UFC light at your Prime like I've no idea I have no idea I would have had to have gotten way better like when I was fighting kickboxing kickboxing in the first person was Taekwondo and then would kickboxing and by the time of UFC came around like on the ground I was useless okay with us straight Wipeout I would get ripped apart every day I would go to the gym and if I if I tap anybody like it was like a week went by and I tapped one guy black brown belt smells guys would always have me so that's just how it went for a long time when you are you know unless you're some kind of freak like some big ass football player or something like super athlete you're probably not in me behold these guys off then they're going to choke you and that was it true you're going to fight Wesley Snipes that was way later though way like that was a brown belt by then and I've been doing a lot for you and beating them I don't know cuz we never did everything for a real martial artist the thing that must have been exciting though I was thinking like I knew that he was a real legitimate martial artists like he throws kicks and punches and it looks really good like he really does know his s*** but I also know he never fought and there's a big difference between throwing kicks and I haven't fought in a long time but I probably fought a hundred times so I've been felt that nerves I know what that's like it'll be crazy as f*** to do it and that's what I was thinking maybe it'll probably scared the s*** out of me but I think I know what to do but I think I know how do I get in there and start fainting start giving some movement and see how he react and then the worst-case scenarios like I might in a scramble I'm going to strangle this guy just comes to a scramble cuz he really doesn't know how helpless they are until Jiu-Jitsu black belt grabs ahold of you and then you just go oh s*** like I'm helpless in a fight that you really think like you might be able to punch a guy like maybe trying to me and he's swinging at me and I'm sweating him and I hit him first you really think that but just don't swinging if it's a Jiu-Jitsu fight if you if you guys get into some sort of a tussle that guy grabs you and trips you and Bone and he's on the ground with his hand on your Jack and Annie on your chest can crab and you just going to your f****** neck and there's no way you're going to avoid it and there's no way you're going to survive that you're just not going to that's why you don't fight people like like it's so big right now some guy fought off of a guy in the subway that was attacking with a knife with some moves that he learned watching UFC never even trained before he just knew what to do they like knew what to do because he's seeing guys like get the mountain and drop ground-and-pound he'd like new what to do based on watching it so you would feel better about yourself in case danger comes here's the thing right if you don't know how to fight and there's some drunk assholes who doesn't know how to fight either but he might come over and punch you in the face is going to punch you when you get hurt you or knock you out from your woman you want to be the one who gets to decide if I'm in a situation and some guy and he's like reasonably close to my size and he's being an a****** he's drunk and he gets aggressive with me I can decide what to do with him but I don't want to hurt anybody but I'm not going to let you hurt me yeah and you get to do what to do with them but I don't want to hurt anybody but I'm not going to let you hurt me yeah and you get to decide like you don't want to look you've ever had we've all seen these 7-Eleven f****** parking lot or yes on YouTube some a****** and both of them don't know how to fight but he might kick him in the face while you down you don't want to be that guy definitely walk away whenever you can</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah but I don't know if you heard of this green deal where they want to take 70% of anyone that makes over 10 million out of 70% of their income that's hilarious I hate rich people that's the problem we're starting at hate the reason why you think it's going to pass because you think people hate rich people see it and that's what you got to have a conversation in competent use of funds like where does the money go all the problems with existing create more jobs to be more red tape we going to do is figure out a real plan for engineering our civilization better that's that's what people have to do and they should be like real discussion from like real experts biologists historians people who really understand who is psychologist people really understand human beings really understand what's wrong with our society today and we have an open discussion but that can never happen Corsican government because they here's the thing what you mean that can happen at 8 we have to look at it until eyes of a real priority but no it goes by it goes by the whoever parties in charge their priorities it's not a like my problem is to make it a priority for the nation impossible but until you have a person that I believe everything to be fixed this is a simple fix if you just elect a person that takes some Republican values and some democratic Cottage the thing is right now in politics or the other if a person came in if you know what I like these Republican ideas I like these Democratic ideas let's roll imma be down the middle and less well with both of being a Centrist well now we know that happens all this stuff can happen if it's not like we're not asking for Alchemy when I trying to turn lead into gold we're trying to figure out a way what you're going to get the system that that is is you want. There's a new system the new system is the system of public opinion which is readily accessible absolutely and that's never happened before there's never been a time where everyone had a say in one way shape or form what is through commenting through Instagram or Twitter or social media that's one of the reasons why upholding the freedom of speech in these things are so important even if people are saying things you don't agree with you the only way this all gets sorted out as we get to figure out a way to express ourselves and it's going to be arguments back and forth but what you got to do is someone's got to put forth an educated plan like a plan that's based on science and reason and a plan that you can debate against opposers of that plant when you have people that don't believe in science how do you how do you to the holy but surely going to end Generations is what I'm saying it's like the would the momentum of our stubbornness and our our our past and the the sort of the systems that we find ourselves stuck in systems behavior and thinking culture all that stuff is going to take a long time to sort the wheat from the chaff we got to figure out what's good and what's bad and we're doing it we're doing it but it with you and actively it's frustrating because you like god dammit this is the worst time we still have all these problems we still have cop shooting people we still have crime Wall Street theft we still have all this stuff but you know what I like it but you know what I like is we know about it now it's not hitting like 20 years ago like you heard in 30 years ago you heard NWA F the police you done a bunch of crazy s*** right you got in the car chase with the beat the f*** out of somebody before that it was a lot going on you just got to see the end of it while this guy is so you'd even know it. finger off how do you enter yeah he he had his toe removed and his toe put onto his finger with fingers to be a thumb now this is pinky fingers up put his trigger-finger so on one of his any hat curved so he could always throw a right hooks so is when you shake his hand his who'd give you like this weird handshake or he would shake your hand but there was always one finger that wouldn't Reach Out the middle didn't move good yeah because they had it was really as toe that they replaced his finger with a toe that must look weird it was weird it was real weird habit does PCP sign in Boston man he was a boxing coach do you like it hated to minimize the suffering the people feel right now isn't just for you to say that is outrageous and it's just a Hallmark of your delusional perspecta that's not true this is not denying the awful things the world all the things the world exist but if you try to look at this as a mathematical equation if you looked above he was hit while there's a lot of problems here is a lot of competing factors there's an environmental factors like what are they doing the world what are they doing to the ocean where they do the arrow and then people are fighting over what's causing it like they don't even pay attention this is madness but look how much knowledge there is much discussion their movements are moving and growing and people are even when they're misinformed it's still there's activity that all the stuff going on even when you know someone says hey everybody to make more than $10 70% people books but if you if people say while we want equality of outcome okay as soon as we get equality of effort talk to me cuz some people don't hustle they just don't I don't know why it was the way they were raised maybe they are poor nutrition but don't stay that everybody supposed to hit the right spot then everyone's going to get to the spot and then after that spot we're going to divvy up all the money so nobody in the world a better place picture doesn't make the world better now that makes lazy people happy that some f****** Juggernaut like Mark Cuban billionaire characters is like hustling constantly and Gathering up massive resources he's playing the game Monopoly 7 days a week option he can do that you can't stop people from doing that would you can stop them it's from doing in just things with that money and wait maybe you can do is like help someone like leaning towards like a Bill Gates type of situation he does so much good and so much charitable work and helped out so many people that you go home a bad thing for a guy like that to have all that money because you don't have to think of him as just mr. Moneybags like maybe you think of him as he does have access to all this money but he's also this incredible resource for Hope and change and and prosperity for some point today I think like I think people wouldn't mind giving money to something that they see being built like if there's work into it people hate the idea of just giving money and not seeing something from it people that don't know what the f*** to do with the other just going to find a use for it because that's what bureaucracy is fashionable to say it sucks it's fashionable to say everything sucks if the government is not on the same page and they're always fighting you can't you can't move for all this great stuff you can't move forward because it starts from the top job that's true but start from the top what's interesting is one of the things that's cool about the government fighting as he get to see that like even the president can't do the things that he wants yes he has to consult with people and they have to agree on something and it has to be reasonable after presented to the American people until the people have to represent their constituents and so you seeing this relief because you've never had a guy like Trump in office before so you see him say is going to do things and then you see the rest of it is going the f*** you are the f*** you are and then you watch this stalemate you watch this this go down and you watching people being forced negotiating the way Trump was forced to talk about Nancy Pelosi cuz she has so much power you know he f*** you are yeah the f*** you are and then you watch this stalemate you watch this this go down and you watching people being forced to negotiate in the way Trump was forced to talk about Nancy Pelosi cuz she has so much power you know he does the color</div>

Was when they dumped us on the water in Laughlin still send me screenshots of that because that's when I had long hair and I put a bunch of gel in it and they dumped me under the tank and literally look like a squid shoot all of them they play them on different TruTV or something like that one of those I remember I remember that when we were talking what show were you on at that time radio look at that I can't okay so this is you talking to me cuz I don't goes jocose hey I told you I'm not going to be able to make it through this.

		<div class="paragraph"> and then I watch some goofy I've been on this UFO documentary kick alien ships in Area 51 in the 1980s as time's gone on more of the things that he said approving the actually be true an element that he talked about Element 115 I think it was called that he talked about way before it was ever publicized and he talked about this thing and then it turned out to be true he talked about these diseases monitors that you would put your hand on this thing and these why these metal lines would detect the distances in the bones of your fingers the exact distances and everyone is different so I can signature thing and that they could find out if it was you or not you that was trying to go through so the way that would scan people look bioscan would literally measure the bones in the fingers and people said that was horseshit they did have that and Los Alamos I did have Dad and in Area 51 and that this technology was very very very very Advanced but very not not well known at all but very few people did this guy who's creator of this documentary is very difficult for them to get photos of this hand scanner with his hands can add it existed existed exactly as this guy described it in the 80s place they know that he actually work there there's people that worked in the same Los Alamos lab with him to try to say never work there but his name's on the Manifest it's very strange like they've tried to erase parts of this guy's past because he he filmed a bunch of their crafts as they were flying around like he knew what days this is the thing that thing right there you put your hand on that it actually measures the distance of the size and length of your bones cheap room in La I went into this documentary skeptical I wanted to say I'm so done with all those things but listen to this guy talk for a while after wild like he's telling the truth like what if he is actually telling the truth cuz he's actually telling the truth there is some part of the government that had access at least in the 1980s to alien technology there's probably some truth to that crazier things have happened and also like just your mentality of believing him is probably the same thing that made dr. Malachi Lovejoy Robinson the third become successful yeah I mean either this dude there's validity of what he saying in this documentary which I can't wait to watch or he's just really great at painting a picture some people are so good at convincing you of truth true borderline personality disorder and every sort of spectrum in between look at manipulators that is true however usually they do that in more than one Avenue absolutely not doing that but the actual story is exactly the same as he was telling a long time ago add him and watch videos about him being 20 years ago don't you think you're somebody who you said you know and I know it's about you you love space you're you're obsessed with that the idea of what we are in in the solar system and beyond like how impossible is it to think that there could be a creature that could breach our atmosphere with some advanced technology and be able to sort of chill you know scootaround scoots scoots magoots check us out and f****** piece out back up to wherever the I know you're saying around you know they're looking at us he said if you brought a atomic engine to these people that live in the Victorian era and said hey this is this is a nuclear power plant like here here check this out they would f*** with it they want of getting sick from radiation they wind up dying Noah would understand what it was or how it would never figure it out why would we assume that this is only from that one time with this one device why would we assume that there'd be some other technology that maybe we will create some day in the future I'm paraphrasing and very poorly or someone else from another planet would create that we wouldn't understand at all and he said that's what we were dealing with when we're trying to back engineer the propulsion systems at these things used if you use some gravity-based purple system and manipulate gravity in front of his Fairy look I don't I'm too stupid to know the science of it I don't know if he's like if you were a scientist you're supposed to know these things keep that are so think you wrote an essay and that's what he gave his Doctorate I think I mean all of those yeah that's possible to you know beings like us on it who's to say that we're not the most advanced maybe they're all like people from the 1820s perception of what we have been exposed to the other really interesting scenario is that they're Time Travelers is that really being from the far distant future that understands that I could come back and observe us and see like where things went wrong where things went right but do so in a way that's is minimally intrusive is possible to cagely interfere what we have been exposed to the other really interesting scenario is that they're time travelers from the far distant future that understands that I could come back and observe us and see like where things went wrong where things went right but do so in a way that's is minimally intrusive is possible to cagily interfere</div>

Of time with a complete set after the first three or four months that I spent now after the Comedy Club 3 and 4 months on that run that I take it like a small theater I see what my last feels like in the small theater and I'll do a little running small theaters and then I finally feel like it's at a point where I'm getting the laugh consistently in the punch lines are working and I flipped it back front with Ford every direction and my story is real roller-coaster and that has an ending where I feel like we get off the roller coaster and we're happy and you don't feel like you were there for an hour then when I go test it out and everything and if they are Rina Everlasting sounds the way it's supposed to then I say okay I'm ready if it doesn't then I'll go back to small theaters and then I'll go to an arena again sounds wave supposed to do I say I'm going on tour so sometimes it takes me about a year ago Gary 3 months a year and 4 months no people on sale hard it is to develop our stand-up material are you just turn on the new our it's an hour to get to 1 how are you going through 4 to 5 hours of b******* that you thought was funny you have to come up to that power that you finally say there's going to be a representation of me this year do that especially at this level you know well specially while you're always doing movies and you're always busy with a bunch of other stuff too that you don't have me you don't take any breaks watch or I actually you know when I'm touring if there's a movie I make the movie schedule around the Torso my shooting days will go Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday rap Thursday maybe I will show Thursday night and then I'm going Thursday Friday Saturday sometimes no show Sunday sometimes show Sunday depending on work schedule and workload for following week look like some information that is so when I say I'm out I'm out I'm gone so I'm not that movie out in 2 months and then when I'm not that tour schedule shifts so the money to the one that Thursday dedicated the family dedicated to the office everything then those weekends are torrent but that toured last for a year and a Half Men this year we did 157 shows on my irresponsible tour 157 Netflix the taping I think I did it three weeks before we were done so we would probably at a hundred and forty-three Jose then I'll tape it and finish it or did you always have this kind of structure would when did you how did you design them thought out individual thought out individually or Gap in between them so the two-year Gap is because at the end second-year my new special should be coming out with a new special should be coming out I'm now focusing on what the next special is going to be so that first-year is all development like right now I'm off I'm not touring but now I'm mentally in the gym and throwing all the old stuff that I talked about away that's now thrown out can't repeat it can't say it now talkin about with the new version of myself is going to be what do I want to come Haitian to be what's my thinking into taking notes So eventually now I'm going to start just popping up a random comedy clubs and trying to figure out what the next thing is so by mid mid 20 I probably doing comedy clubs by the end of 20 oz should have a full fledge concept that new hour and by the beginning of 21 I should be ready to go out with my new our end of 21 them my new hour mid 22 power will come out that seems like a schedule A lot of people are doing now the two-year schedule that's what I was supposed to get a year every year and who you're calling it every year but I think even he said that really wasn't the right way to do it for everything that I have going on and all of the different things in my hands are in within the brand the business I need to make sure them 100% shinzou staying so they have the highest opportunity to be successful if I'm trying to cheat it then it's going to show you it's not going to come out to the best of my ability and let stand up you got to you got to f****** magnifying glass on you you know you're always being judged off of what you did at one point just like a musician you're always judged off of the album that everybody thought was whatever so the biggest liability and that stand up you got to you got to f****** magnifying glass on you you know you're always being judged off of what you did at one point just like a musician you're always judged off of the album that everybody thought was whatever so the big thing for Entertainer artist whatever your cramped is is creation how you recreating yourself how you construe showing that you're growing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> digital that you would like it so much to learn that's the thing about it so it's a long long NeverEnding never-ending never-ending journey of s*** is also there's so many different variations of each different individual move and entries into new moves and defense and then the structure of it as it gets so crazy it's so it's super complicated my son is heavy into boxing and karate I got him into those so he he does them both so the reason why I would do that just like to keep up with him so we can you know do things together I have trained has come to the house and we'll work out together he loves it so I just don't want to get left behind so I can't do it the kick your ass I don't want that confident you need that but confident help you avoid things too well I'll tell my kids you know your last name puts a Target on your back that you didn't ask for and we don't go and create problems but you should always be prepared for problems if they were to occur and if they do I just want you got to know how to defend yourself so the things that I have my kids doing is just having knowledge and understanding the worst thing is just not know you know they're going up complete different when I grew up where I grew up you had no choice but to know you're not fight that's your ass cuz you won't get tested there's no way around it you going to get tried you're going to get robbed you going to get your book bag taken to Michael try to take the snakes like it's the reality is not a false reality that's a real so if you're not prepared for it if you don't have any type of heart you won't last from where I grew up heart with everything and heart was stop saying I don't care if I get my ass whooped I'm not going to be a b**** I'm not going to I'm not going to allow y'all to think that this can happen so I'm going to lose today but tomorrow I'm a complex and I'm going to find you I'm going to whatever that moment was it was about establishing any level of respect that you could and I respect eventually turned into friendship from all so my kids don't know what that was like that I'm going to have it so as a parent I just have to make sure that you have all the tools I can equip you with my present have the ability to provide me with that they want the financial space to to take me here and have this extra curricular activities xcaret that to you learn this and learn that in this is the big conundrum of success with their what made them successful is dry I grew up poor to we are on welfare and food stamps and that always stuck my head this thought like we might not have enough food like I remember thinking that when I was little I quit would if we don't have any food would have run out of food my kids will never feel that they don't understand what that is and everybody that I've ever met that's interesting came from some crazy struggle when they were young and that's the thing you and I and most people that are doing well in life you're raising your kids in a completely different way then literally what brought you to the dance to forget the hunger of not being one of those people that's left behind is what makes you successful in the first place and it's scary scared because get on my wife my wife told me she was like you know I love that you're not hard on your kids but you always make sure there's a lesson within your conversation like I do yeah I'm yell at my kids nothing's going to register when I'm yelling so I'll try my best to talk to you even when I'm at my angriest my talk to you so you can process this because you need to understand what's the problem what I had to really realizes they didn't ask to be born into this you don't even like that it's not their fault that they're coming up completely different than how we were raised Brian and we can't have anger or frustration that's dedicated and thrown towards them because they got it so much better than what we had how do we make sure we pass down the proper lessons so that they appreciate I understand and not take for granted what they have for me is tough because you kissed because students they apply themselves in school they listen they don't do dumb s*** yeah they want to play video games and stay up like any other kids his no signs of a bad or or crazy and the fear and panic is that you got to know the bed and crazy exist Fairy Tail that went in isn't real and it's some point when I'm not around when your mother's not around when your friends are other family on around you may get tested with the other side that's out here that you've never seen so I got to prepare you for the s*** that you don't know exist I got to take you to Philadelphia so you can see my kids where I grew up thinking it's going to be like oh my goodness it's so cool can we live here shut up it's so different man these were your steps the steps of broken how did you even play oh my god dad so wait where where was yours we live in a top-four not the whole thing know it's this is three separate units so the top floor was me and grandmom the middle that was somebody else that was a neighbor and downstairs somebody else three different people lived in this one thing what height should I that's the reality that you get hit with of I got to make sure I'm talkin I got to make sure that I'm constantly teaching if I'm not and I'm not doing my part I'm feeling to the neighborhood or in the neighborhood do we get little sandwiches from y'all won't have no stores like this we can't walk the stuff it's a completely different world completely different world on the street corner do them all around all around North Philadelphia all around South Philadelphia make sure they can see it we go out the country we go to these Resorts and Islands before we go there one drive around so you can see what exists before you get to this this is why we have to be good people this is why we treat everybody with respect this is why your dad likes to give everybody doesn't have constantly beating my kids that information as soon as everybody does you come off like such an a****** when you're around people that don't you don't also growing up the way they are now it's such a rare thing and they didn't understand that there's no way they'd a percentage very small percentage and that's something I never want to let go of either in the back of my head so are you talkin about how no I was going to have enough to prove you were coming up Chris Rogers joke is so great that he should tell the high keeps a bag packed at the front door cuz he don't believe that this s*** is his I truly believed in at any point somebody going to go gotcha do you are you comfortable where you are now or do you still have those thoughts like this is this real cuz you're you're at the Stratosphere of Fame and success that's this rare amongst the rare you know it's like David Goggins said you are uncommon amongst uncommon men I will be 100% honest and say I'm comfortable with the end meaning of hard work brings great rewards this is a reminder of the hard work and dedication that I put into everything that I've done I'm not content because I know where I came from and I don't ever want to go back that doesn't mean I don't want to go back to the city that doesn't mean I want to go back to the people that means I don't want to go back to living like I once was imma go back help I want a spiral to motivate I want to show people that is the way out that there is a way to do more to get more to obtain more but I personally don't want to lose all that I've been able to get so I need to make sure I do everything to keep it so I can't be content so there is an understanding but I refuse to click on the switch of what is an understanding but I refuse to click on the switch of even if you were even if you have more money than you'll ever spend for the rest of your life that's not what it's about now it's about the inspiring people in the influence and constantly giving back and moving forward in a positive way and the only way to do that is to stay active two-story man</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is this a baseball look at that is so easy you're not you're positive do you look crazy ambitious that's the thing that gets me about you and the rock for sure like to Ambitions off-the-charts like I know you're rich as fuk like when when do you think you got enough you don't have enough there's no don't know enough I don't have enough because it's not over song over and over so you know when when you put a cap on it yet you're putting a punctuation to it and the the the ambition come I'm seeing what's out there that can be obtained you know when you see what's out there like what Kylie mean physical things where you see what's out there when you see where people are really gaining wealth and knowledge from okay the business relationships that you're able to acquire the people that you're able to partner with and create certain things different revenue streams what I found is as a young black guy from North Philadelphia the biggest problem with the biggest problem within our community is knowledge we don't know that that is welcomed because it's celebrated that's all we know and I'm get that credit karma credit card up and it is what it is. it's too long they gave it to me then after that s*** is what it is I'm figured out and I put the cable bill in your name you put it in my name we can switch it up with whatever they do it then let's just put in somebody else name its welcome the hustle is welcomed the knowledge of Banks and what you can do it can't do is it's f****** you don't even get it to go to check cashing places we'd like your check cashing place the knowledge isn't given so as not to you obtained that knowledge and understanding that you go oh s*** oh this is why you put money up oh this is this is how you increase versus decrease how you earn on your money oh wow I can gain wealth by investing in what the stock world is what how many people partake in the stock world and is there a part that isn't a silly gambling is Clovis Park this not the information is in there so that's why I got it I got it I want to give it so now I'm going to give it I'm going to give it to the people that know needed most and the me that younger generation of black people that don't understand the cool thing is in financial longevity not in the now it's not in the moment the jewelry not in the moment it's in a longevity is in buildings or the end of the day you can say look at what I have look what I work for looking when I have it's mine Monopoly is real but you have to have the financial understanding and I teamed up I got chasing it would do some call Financial Fitness was just about me educating people on money how to manage money how to be smart with your money but it's coming from a person that f***** up money I didn't always understand it I holding just before because I didn't understand in the beginning I've had bad credit credit cards wouldn't take me because I'm maxed out whatever I've been there done it thank God I was able to fix it and get on the right path and I don't have the knowledge I'm going to give it to somebody don't know so when you say the endgame the end game is getting to a point where I taking all the knowledge that I've been able to get over these years and really applying it and providing family wealth all said and done the last name Hart is going to mean just more a lot more than just Kevin Hart comedy hartbeat Productions got heartbeat digital your heartbeat Ventures your heartbeat real estate there's so many things that the last name Hart will be attached to you so real estate you learn it in and you know it's such a thing where you talk about black versus white you know a lot of people do that and and rightfully so like they're there is racism racism exist I'm not unaware of that but there is a high volume of it that's that's non-existent if you had a good people and when you can merge yourself with good people and follow the paths that you see that these good successful people have taken you didn't come apart of the world in group that nobody expected you to be it so for me I now have the position to do that and take all of these relationships and all this knowledge and take it back to the future in the most like to share I don't want to go by myself now are you doing this the financial stuff you doing this in videos you look releasing their help bleeding charge the saying how can we get to the people that we filled me the financial information the most so I said put me out there like let's let's go directly to the consumer so from colleges from high school's senior classes Junior classes going out and talking to people before they go into the next stage of their life about two things that you should know before going to speak to them find content from it but I'm authentic source of the best way to really do it if they put me in a position to be heard I want to be her like like it's a different story but I explained to the the people of JPMorgan Chase just when we were talking about this in as an amazing Board of people that that'll just figuring this out in the best way to go into it and I said you can't have the white guy that's never been to the hood not from the hood I have no idea how the economy works here and what the real troubles are you can't throw that man in the situation to talk to people because I'm not listening to you from the gate because you don't relate I don't relate to you but throwing somebody in the situation that's lived it that's been in it that's been f***** up in it made it out of it and is now coming back to help it's a different ball game and that's what I want to be and you know we have other voices outside self very powerful voices that are going to do it as well but the purpose is to align ourselves to really make a change so you can either be the conversation about making change you can be actual a part of the action to do it I want to be part of the action and and doing it you also be able to understand my drive you get why I do so much you get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it in the question should be why not so you can either be the conversation about making change you can be actual a part of the action to do it I want to be part of the action and in doing it you also be able to understand my drive you get why I do so much you get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it in the question should be why not</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> like maybe just need to take a little break here if you ever feel like that I think the perception Devin perceives reality you know when looks like so much and always so much because you have a schedule and you know within that schedule there is the saying that mean the most that come in active downtime you know me and my house is down time even though it's still active and I got to be with the kids the wife in this conversation I'm running around the back foot that's still asks downtime to me like I'm shutting the work off so the phone is in the office I'm not going back to get into the morning and it's all conversation it's all TV it's all taco Tuesdays it's couch and cuddling you know baby time whatever that's my down time because I'm taking a step outside of the other s*** that's why that's that's what I think I do very well I can step outside the other s*** I can separate it so I think when you're able to do that then you're you're managing your mental you don't mean I give it if it's always one thing all the time that's how you f****** drive yourself crazy cuz you never you never shutting it off yeah and I think I do a good job of shutting shutting this off and focusing on that list I want with my payment with my family nothing is nothing enter Jackson that's fantastic that's so important to me that's beautiful all the time that's the big one right is the gift and the curse you know I think that we we shout out the gate and saw the GIF oh my God it's it's it's Community is connecting maybe the meeting waiver to stay in communication with with old people find new people as Entertainer I can engage with my fans and this is so dope and then after that you get hit with the the curse and the curse isn't this a high-level negativity that's out there that's on that s*** you know there's there's a lot of people that are you know not happy or going through things and they interjected a certain amount of negativity and hatred through these devices these devices are the easiest way to touch everybody so when you're just consumed on that s*** all day you start to see yourself being a part of the negative s*** so what I've learned to do is go I don't know pushing me to new limits if anything is taken up just creative Space by mean literally spending time going in in in navigating through what I think is is a bunch of bulshit so I don't let the device beat me in at one point I definitely did at one point it was everything it was everything you know now I separate I know you break lyrics see the bad side of it I thought the other day this is some real s*** and they made me think my phone died my phone died and I'm driving and I was using the f****** maps and other s***, get to be before the match I remember that but then before that how did you get to the places where you were going that you didn't know how to get to I don't even remember the norm anymore because the device has made everything available and I literally had to to drive to store where I can buy a charger charge up my phone to get back and use the map to get to where the f*** I was going to say I have no idea how to get there I have no I didn't know numbers by heart I didn't know who I was going to call set dear I don't know how to f*** him I don't get the wrong with your phone I don't know what it was backup phone it felt like the end of the world if the light bulb started to click how do we function without I want to go backwards a little bit going to be able to put it down and then step away from it and my kids to be able to step away from that's what I come in the house my phone is up cuz I can't I can't bitching complain that y'all about being on your phone if you see me doing the same thing so that time those conversations me wanting to know about your day you talkin to me about your day your friends who you like who don't you like my daughter you what boy who what I like somebody who Jesus here comes it's a great thing and I want to be able to have those moments and you know I think it's it's it's big to make sure that you prioritize that are you worried about what comes next hundred percent I'm worried that something is going to be way more intrusive like people can listen to your Oye if you didn't even pick up but yeah it's time you can just listen to you know that was the scariest should ever because it's if it's that easy to have a bug like that what's the thing that's not a bug that's there that you just don't know about others definitely government listening to us right now the fear is the next level of the merge intrusive intrusive now like the toughest thing for me is that there is no there is no privacy outside my own you know the the amount of money that you have to now spend just on security on you know people to to be with me security to be on my home you know it's like that then literally is no privacy in a b**** complain about it because without the fans without the people that support me I wouldn't be where I am but there's no middle ground run you know there is no handshakes anymore it's it's how you doing right right right hand shaking so much better get a moment like become a little older and wiser and just really see the times for what they are and see what direction are we going in the people and just hope and pray that we find a middle ground cuz I think right now that is it one that's what I'm feeling now know I feel it too especially the mean when you're talking about is you being super famous and losing all your privacy but everyone's losing their privates slowly but surely it's it's happening to you because you're very famous cuz you do something that's in the public eye and people want to see you and want to stick that Cameron front of you but there's going to come a point in time where what we're dealing with now which is like you have to turn your phone on you have to you know you have to reach out to somebody have to put something up that's that's that's going to be out of the way and he can be people being able to access your life activity is the the want no like like the the thing that's popular is the failure the the fuk up you know the the fight that I can catch you know that hate the moment that I can catch in post like the bad is being highlighted and celebrated that's what fux with me with the social media should now what what really bothers me is you know when you see these things online like you know the fight and there's a man hitting a woman in this captured that's bad the bad thing is that you watched that the video was more important than the actual help run or the moment to step in and you know when you see these things where you're catching people do these things the kids in this cart the moment of what you got and what you want to post in get likes or whatever on is the focus instead of the help and that and that's that's the part that is just I just have a hard time processing have a hard time processing what the lights mean to certain people will you get an extraordinary amount of attention so it doesn't mean anything to you with means something to a regular person before a regular person they can catch some WorldStar video and put it up there like that's my video video Got 5 million hit ya my videos gone viral my videos everywhere but damn it's like the point of excitement that's why when they see you like oh s*** how often they're going to run into Kevin Hart at you know Costco where the f*** you were you know by the way I went to the bathroom you could definitely tell her I had to s*** I was moving fast why you eating eating bad so I didn't he badly while my stomach immediately said this not going to happen today I get up and I go and literally like like 3 seconds I hear it as I'm walking only going to have hard and as I'm walking by a guy gets up follows me in the bathroom they said y'all got to get a picture of man and I said let me let me go to the bathroom when I take a picture with you what is the true story Hannah Bible in the Bible I assume the guy is outside the bathroom and I'm going to see him and I say what I say I get done I go to the stink wash my hands he was just sitting behind a wall and he's like got his phone out tell Mikey prop did he just take me while I was shooting about to put something up of me shiting is the bottom of my feet it's whatever but he's just waited and in that moment was so it was so important that he was in the bathroom and and soon as I got to come on let's go outside the bathroom and take a picture that's a bathroom pretty f****** weird moment man your hand look at whoop-ass autograph state was awesome to get an autograph it's been awhile it's been a minute man that I can talk in and Converse with the fan but it should be there it's normal the moments are better when it real you know and after real moment you you get a picture because you're like yo you got your nice guy or and I know I did it that you would be this calm and cool you'll even get to see a genuine of a person I am because the first thing you do you stick the camera in the face you and that's when people think that you're an

		<div class="paragraph"> able to pay attention things cuz as you said people focus on failure and negative and anger controversy as we want to see I want to see the anger and you know it is now top 10 biggest movies of all time f****** great movie oh yes it was great movie oh my God for no reason I don't know. Just like to do that oh yeah for sure and what happens when one person does it another person for no longer every two it's not cool to be positive is not cool to be happy I don't know if it's a cool thing I think it's usually people that are really frustrated with their lives 100% like that that the factual side to it before was like to think Michael Jordan leaves YouTube comments not much I hear tell you I feel right in your comment section Joe Rogan you can kiss my you know what that takes you or do you have going on at you have the time to just simply be that negative in and do it in this world and uniforms just a mismanagement of your time so valuable yeah you always been like that so we would have been nice and hot it is knocking guy man but always always a light in every dark tunnel I will find a goddamn light man I hear it all your weight on my back is so heavy of all the stuff that I deal with and I'm fine the reason why I'm fine it's because I'm genuinely happy I'm happy and I'm not happy because of the success the Seth X is a bonus I'm happy because I truly know the definition in the feeling that comes with happiness I truly know it I felt it I felt it when I said you're what really makes me happy and I look at heaven and Hendricks and I look as though I look at my wife I didn't have the family s*** when I was coming up these people depend on me I provide these people that makes me happy that makes me happy my daughter comes up Dad you're not only my dad you're my best friend happy that's my world so everything else from the outside that comes in your your your throwing s*** out of at a at a bubble that can't be popped the force field around me Hailie Mathers loves me wholeheartedly and you had that and you understand your unbreakable so you don't add to that force field if you don't make my voice feel stronger you don't you don't you don't get time for me my team hartbeat Productions the people I delete my umbrella you're part of my forcefield you believe what I believe we all see the same things you want the same thing so we march with the same beat you can't you can't shake that when you're an individual that seen that and understands that if you've never felt that we have no idea what that feels like and seasoned shake you that's why some people are easily broken being broken and not a hard thing about hard things so do those that do get broken those that do get down I understand I understand I don't do nothing for it I don't not anybody for it but I also understand is that the encouragement that can come from so many can add value to those that may need a little push that may need a little amen packaging up it's so easy to be that positive reinforcement for somebody and add value it so easy for some people choose to I decide and kick while you're down I try to put out the light of positivity because whoever's out there you I don't know what it could do for somebody else or somebody else may just simply look at me that your way to hear Embraces his kids making one be a better father this man doesn't stopped and waited every day he wakes up and just positive regardless of what's going on makes you realize that this s*** ain't so bad the way he gets up and says hey today's another day at the morning let's all be better than we were yesterday probably needed to hear that the more that I can give that out and I can take my platform to throw good energy out I'm doing my part because there's so many that they'll have to complete opposite I don't want to be a part of that and that's true latest rainbow down Windows make a good movie again I like ma'am you have a beautiful day that's all right movie it's mapping out the upside you see the other side the movie out now that ended why why why why why for what for what it seems to have been working thus far are you getting this positive attitude towards life from Life experience or you getting it from Brooks did someone teach you how to fly in this I'm getting it from the experiences and from the V real understanding of perfection. don't exist Joe with wearing the time right now we're people expect Perfection you expect Perfection I don't know where this came from I don't know what happened that this is the criteria for letting my true understanding is alright you got one life and that one life the goal for us is to live it to the best of our ability on the beginning to what said the in the middle in the beginning middle you going to do things going to make mistakes you want to f****** you're supposed to learn and then move forward with the understanding of what not to do and when you move forward like make it better and may not but somewhere along the lines is going to click and everything's I went through back here was supposed to happen so that now that I'm here I'm able to go ahead with such a ilevel mileage and I can make other people better make myself better my family something happens my dad is the prime example crazy drug addict and not a jail life was very bad very f****** bad my dad son got successful sunden took money gave it to his dad is your house here's your truck here's your monthly at this age I want you to live your life you

		<div class="paragraph"> my life and the things that grow old along with me the only thing that grows along with me my experiences my family my marriage my mistakes my UPS my Downs those are the things that I can talk about forever because as you get older things changed it gets different is all coming from my personal opinion of me my view on me and how I see Life you can't material in that state that's why I stay away from certain things because those things can become boring after awhile for me because I don't have the knowledge of everything that I should like what what kind of politics I don't know I'm joking the politics I don't I don't joke and anything that has to do with the slander of others other communities I don't do anything divisive that's my that's my biggest thing and you know this passion was was one that got a little weird because I was like you're really dedicated myself to Bringing people together like I'm I know that was my goal that's my priority. That's what I was doing on a global scale everybody people just looking to be upset about things and it did not look into looking at you Kevin Hart as just a human being like what it would it who is he over all super positive then I have been concentrating on that you think about how positive you are and yet they tried to concentrate on some jokes that you did what 9 years ago it's a wake-up call of understanding the times for me it was okay I went through it sure that the people of the lgbtq community really understand that I got I apologize program apologizing again I'm sorry I'm not the guy I don't want you think I'm that guy then it just became the constant conversation never happened but it's interesting the constant conversation then and now it is cuz I'm not only sorry I don't condone anyting to have to do to hate anybody this is no long conversation so guys I'm going to stop talkin about it because now I feel like I'm feeding into what I'm not I know I'm not the world and public should understand and know that I'm not because over this time. As shown that I'm not so the apology once again I'm sorry didn't really I'm sorry but then it just kept it just it never stopped and said that I just made a decision and I'm like guys at this point I just I'm making a decision to not talk about it anymore that doesn't mean that I'm being disrespectful to anybody that doesn't mean that I'm shutting down anything it means that for me I'm going to stop talkin about it because at this point I don't know what to do at this point I thought I thought the apology is what you wanted me to do it did it I make sure that you understand that I'm not a hateful person I know but don't hate I did that I stepped I don't take attention off of that night in those people that are there to be celebrated I don't want to draw attention to myself and what's around me I stepped out everything I did was for the better of good I'm stepping away guys because I don't want this to be a negative night or negative thing and then it still became a conversation so I waited for the goddamn I want on my radio show give it another public apology make sure that he understand and I'm sorry these words that hurt anybody I want again apologize I don't condone hate to anyone I hope that you guys can forgive me for those jokes about so now I say if you don't understand that you don't believe it I don't know what else to get I don't know what else to do do nothing else that's very wise of you because if you didn't they would probably pursue it forever outside this is something they're going to focus on what I had a I had a good talk, talk about this a minute friendly Daniels you know me and Lee Daniels Lee called me told me what to talk to you know Lee Daniels is director-producer the show Empires got his biggest shows no so he calls me like everyone talks to you and not stalking he's like look this is a time where you could speak up and talk about you know the community that's been affected by hatred and you know hateful crimes you can step up and be a voice and say that you don't condone or don't stand with any type of hate or whatever you can take that stage and do that and I said I said that's why I'm saying why don't you expect me to know what's been happening within this community in regards to hate a crabs as I am not aware I said some people can just not be aware I'm not even know I have no idea what's going on I have no idea. I have no idea when you tell me this I'm now educated and I understand so it's easy to Simply info right information is Keith when people get information they process the information when you can process information you will all wait a minute that makes sense hey if you left think that I can don't hate wait a minute I don't and anybody that does f*** you man that's bad you shouldn't I can say that but instead when this happened it was becoming I'll I become a voice that's where it was just a miscommunication that's where a back-and-forth kind of was established that I think people just starting to take things and run with it and I'm just not I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into a positive thing in a real conversation was established that I think people just aren't to take things and run with it and I'm just not I'm just not one to feed into what I feel isn't going to eventually evolve into a positive thing in a real conversation</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> they're really different like they don't want big giant houses and all that stuff that you know serve my generation in your generation. That's who you think the new generation is different in their values and being able to be connected and being able to have a real conversation and you know even be able to concentrate long enough to to be with somebody cuz of devices yeah I mean I think it's could you imagine right now if you were 20 and being like dating and swiping and kind of pay attention and or even ten you know my daughter is one of the few girls in her closet doesn't have a cell phone what the age do they got them like they're sincere like 7 no I mean movement wait till 8th kids in the class all the parents agree so they're not the only person in the class that doesn't have it it's not that it was my daughter's kids the kids in her class most of them iPhones most parents just give the kid a phone have you read any of Jonathan hates will stuff for the coddling of the American mind is just so disturbing when you see the amount of especially young girls that are growing up depressed cutting themselves self-harm what's it like 400% he said like from 10 to 14 or like something insane by the directly coincides with the inventor of smartphones and social media machine this thing where people just trying to get likes and trying to leverage their you know their social status and and try to pretend that they're living in a perfect world everybody around them and everyone else is doing it and people look at other people's lives being perfectly reflect upon their own to get depressed or somebody fact kids didn't have to deal with Canada a decade or so ago it's really really mean right like at least if I had a hard time at school I can go home and have a reprieve from it at least overnight I think from you that's been a thing with my kids is like especially daughters I do think I understand the gaming is different for boys and pouring up pornography and things like that and that whole trip of rewiring their brain and but I think with girls it's like how do you get them to understand like to hear their own voice I don't know how they're going to get to a place where they I mean cuz every it's like this weird mish-mosh of like me too and then never before had people objectified themselves more because they get them that positive affirmations what's going on with just like I'm angry me to treat me equal simultaneously to I'm going to objectify myself in the most hardcore way more than any time in history and its really but for me as a female who understands both those sides a little bit kind of trips me out because I don't like those girls that card and violence should be done I agree with all of that knows no in all of that but a certain point you know like we've had Jordan Peterson on her many times it's like biological signaling it's like a place I'd at least and also that'll do that one side is super short-lived that's what I try to tell my girls unlike you listen if you're either you're pretty girls too great but if that's the card you're playing your cards done like my timer 30 35 done Tober in a mushroom 14U Mary seven-year-old I don't know what I'm doing the m******* is that such a thing yeah yeah but even that it's like yeah I mean everything's immediate but for me it's like it's culturally I feel like I'm this weird mix of like the most I came through at the most modern time like women went to school and on scholarships and like there was no thought to being like strong not really and then but then weirdly it's like I feel so kind of old-fashioned when I see kind of this next thing cuz I'm like well strong for me with something else wrong was like you were really physically strong trying to have a strong mind you know strong bases of a person and then okay then there was this other side like your femininity your sexuality also stopped and now it's like I don't know it's very interesting with motivational quotes and inspirational things about people that they meet and photos and you get a lot of people that are attracted to that kind of stuff too it's just you're not going to get the immediate gratification of a picture of your ass that that that picture of your ass and gets a hundred thousand likes like one of those likes Express how you feel and and work it out through communicating with people and figure out how they react what you saying and how you feel about how other people say similar and how it does good things for you I could do good things for them or do you just want to have a piece of dental floss at the crack of your ass you know like who you want to be not based on what everyone thinks about you like what actually turns you on and makes you feel excited and stoked because you know it's great that you have a nice butt but there's a lot of nice butts and in the end that's not probably going to bring you that other feeling the problem is if there's a thrill to positive reaction absolutely I would like it to old people and when people get that thrill me to tell them hey that's real bad for you like f*** off mom no no I mean a bolt on to that message how about that like get the thrill but simultaneously doing the thrill maybe have some other thought about where you where you like to continue to Journey's to I just got to be at 2 and have some like cool friends that they hang around you because you're if you're the parent it's like okay you're going to penetrate so much but if you've got some like you know why they call manatees if you got some badass chicks around you and your daughters were looking they see they say but what if you don't have access to that I have a lot of pretty strong cool women around me but I don't want to say that it's just how do you help the next group try to be good example love on them but get them to teach them to love themselves that's all and I don't mean with eyelash extensions in like perfect things I mean like love on yourself yeah you know what that's the other thing to the Distortion of natural beauty and the make it to the everything has to be artificial the color of your lips the color of your eyeshadow fake lashes everything is just that doesn't doesn't look better just looks different do you think I'm always fascinated what men think like today even like debate does it even register do they know what's going on and what would well I guess we have to ask men of that generation if let's say they had two groups of women and one that was like perfectly quaffed with the lip injections another word is it like I'm talking about like eyelash extensions Joe but really done for the club let's just say and then just like a girl like hi I'm you know I'm a sweaty Runner and now I'm going to go to the office and put my hair up in a ponytail I don't know whatever if guys if they even can they tell the difference what you're into some guys just like them soft and made up some guys like I'm sweaty and muscular hardcore signaling and I guess that's maybe that's what it is maybe it's the new biology what's also that there's never been a Time Netflix specials were about this girl who's got just pictures of her ass for like 9 million followers on Instagram what is everything a person like this before this is a new kind of person like f*** f*** looking at these frogs in the Amazon and no one's going to say there's a new kind of person and she's got millions of people staring at her all day long and everyday is new pictures of her butt to Great point they decided we're going to do the butt on the beach now let's do the button next to the puppy it's like I'm so confused how they keep getting ideas with the cotton candy it's like okay I don't know why you have to stay fresh with new but ideas E-Pass to finances I know right if you have a great ass and you like working out anyway and just want to take pictures of it I'll send you have 25 million followers like damn but this is also okay however it's sort of like the communication always having which is Will what is success and for me it's that's all it's like getting people encouraging them whatever that is whatever that looks like you know you said this like oh you do the show whether anyone was listening or not most likely right until you couldn't afford it anymore but obviously the conversations you know every few months of physicist to come in here and sit down with you and Carry hours like yeah yeah I do it that's what I want to do information to you and learning to you for you part of your definition of success and so I guess that is the conversation because we always have this thing that's obvious thing of like successes it either is notoriety its power its money and then we forget those other Communications about like the pursuit of something that really genuinely turns you on but I think people get short-sighted and you definitely can get success we just have money and you just have objects you have notoriety in people viewed as a success but if you're not doing what you love it's not pure success it's a different kind of success like if you really find something that you enjoy doing and then you take that like Laird has with surfing or many people have with their passions and then you become successful through that it's a different existence because it's a it's a pure existence like when I do stand-up comedy or if I do like a commentary for the UFC it's a a very it's a pure enthusiasm it's genuine is a cross I don't have to fake it it's I enjoy doing it that's to me I don't I know everybody can't do that everybody feels like they can't do that or they haven't figured out a way to do that yet Ryan if you can if you can if there's a thing that you can do like maybe I would have made more money if I went to the stock market maybe it would have made more if I was a banker maybe I don't know we wouldn't be this happy there's no way from the same person I am now and I was in a f****** office all day making a hundred times as much money I'd be miserable and I think that's maybe when I see the thing with the girls and like I said feeling sensitive to it cuz I have daughters or just young people in general it's that conversation of like you know just keeping that definition of success open and by the way this other path that taking it like following your own instincts are desires our passions there's elements to that that are are hard or harder for sure it's more unknown you can feel insecure like it's the right thing to do when we've gone I mean in our house we've gone to that 50 different times you know it's like I'm going to do this cuz I really want to I don't know what's going to happen and I don't know if it's going to be successful I might even lose money who knows but that once you start to do it or you do it once or twice then you go for sure it's more unknown you can feel insecure like it's the right thing to do when we've gone I mean in our house was gone to that 50 different times you know it's like I'm going to do this cuz I really want to I don't know what's going to happen and I don't know if it's going to be successful I might even lose money who knows but that once you start to do it or you do it once or twice then

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> female athletes and male athletes like okay cuz fighting is a pretty exaggerated but it's an interesting thing where you know you have men and women's kind of differently but doing the same thing if you will I'm do you notice a difference in their mentality so much individually that's where you'll find even male Fighters or like super laid-back and then you find other way really intense super emotional and it's really hard to tell like there's a there's Gunnar Nelson his guy from Iceland to know is why you cannot get that guy to change his expression it doesn't change you could punch him kick him in the balls he quiste stoic it's a weird he's a weird guy he's very on one side of it and then there was like I was like Conor McGregor whose house was training partner who's on a completely different side of it he's screaming and yelling and talking s*** to everybody and they know that's that's part of we're right and I was like they vary so widely in this statue with girls to some girls are Brash and outrageous and they get another girl's faces and put their Knuckles on their nose and and they're at the stare-down and other girls bow and they hug and they take selfies together it's like everyone has their own sort of approach to it is very interesting at the same time dealing with fear like all all these things happening sign geniously and I then take it I look at it one step further with a female because I don't know I am interested to know how if a female can fight from a not not a non-emotional place but without her emotion like just like okay I'm in my mail I'm in my athlete and I'm not going to beg of she didn't just kick me in the ear you know what I mean you know like I'm only been in one fight my whole life and it's and the girl hit me in the face in when I saw my blood I was like oh no she did not just hit me in the face you know and then went crazy but if these girls can be like cuz they're so well trained as an athlete how that can supersede like or override actually like this feminine impulse of like you do reaction that's a masculine impulse to though I think it's a human impulse of a guy punches you in the face you get furious it's so hard for people to not get emotional when they get hit it's a very bad way to react in a fight to fight with emotions because you expose yourself you leave yourself open for counters you just miss you rhythm. Is deceptive and your emotions you're too obvious in your pattern and so many times you get hit a lot more problem with Fighters that that that emotion is very big problem and the wanting to break people like letting them hit you so you could show them that they can't hurt you can put some Christian thing to stupid very stupid take it on the face on purpose and then just like come on all the time it's just the smart thing to do is to fight with correct technique and a correct strategy meaning you have an understanding of how to execute best it's not just waited and let bombs fly its do you have to have to be very precise in your tactics you'll be very smart I think it's interesting though those Sports where there is that I mean listen versions of it is football you know living with layered obviously you know he always says he appreciates Mother Nature because it's like you make good decisions you're rewarded decisions you you pay price but I think it is very interesting when you have two humans strategically trying to deconstruct one another the chest the physical chest that goes on a zit like looking at it from another athletes point of view I think it's a unique person that wants to put themselves in that situation you know it's like I understand almost like a surfer and a wave and a climber in a mountain I get that like I'm going to be a part of that but I find it really interesting and even sort of I'm even more curious about women like who say like yeah this is going to be my sport Holly Holm I mean listen I saw that kick but then it's like I'm so sorry I made you these after you don't like cookies it's like okay I'll get it you know when I get back from the hospital</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so it's Ola it so Beverly Hills I live there for 13 yr yeah there was a wave there that Laird was having a love affair with her many years so we live there with you know so he could be close to his girlfriend for sure they didn't know every boy needs their girlfriend is like I don't know if you ever go through this when you go home I'll go out and Surfer many hours like hang out for 5 hours at a time and if they're Surf and he comes home and I see how happy he is like to see us and then about 7 and 1/2 8 minutes in his face like oh yeah I'm in the house with the family both of those sides like I need to go I need to be free I need to you know Chase things in like scare myself and do all the stuff and then be no comes home and it's like you know on the floor laying you know with one of my daughters and and being attentive and a great husband all these things but I always get him used a little bit by the push pole on the planets a very unusual group of people that rides giant waves water on the top of the ocean and that's a that's a crazy thing to do. I hate that he's actually even more different than some of the other guys because if you think about it he's to stay doing this for right now forty years so he's a guy who he has both so it what he wants to do is write a huge wave during the day and then be with his family at night and sometimes you know who take going in a halfway around the globe or whatever and so I think the pursuit and have to wait a lot that's the other thing these things don't come around that often it's very interesting to live with there's a there's a little bit of suffering that goes on and sometimes they will say to me cuz he's aware of time going by he'll be like you have a lot more ways I need to ride and I'm like I know like it's pretty deep calling and now that he's been spoiling for 25 years but now that they are getting that equipment better it's sort of like now we can ride places that we couldn't ride that we're not really attractive for riding on top of the surface of the water even if you towed it now it's opened up a whole other Pursuit for him yeah it's very towards that though likely has put me on a ski in front of a wave it's like 60 ft and like being on the back of a ski with him driving there's a moment where you go okay I actually and I'm sure you've experiences with other friends at taking maybe on a flying or something he is this is what he does right so I'm like okay I trust him more than I'm afraid that's fine I can do that and I'm going to surrender to that I'm not going to torture myself the whole time I'm just going to trust him and you turn and there's a six-story building behind you moving and you just think like how is that fun how is hanging like that they have these things called hydrofoils so originally there's a guy named Mike Murphy who created something called the air chair and they weren't they been playing well sounds like water skis and different funky ways like even in the 50s Solaire and his friends got an air can cut the chair off and put us snowboard boots and bindings quick-release oh you stand on it you're booted in and below is basically a mini airplane with a strut so for example yeah there's a shot of one and this is a smaller one Jamie to have anyone's of the big with the boots I think people are used that was wow underneath his what to do if you hit your head or what have you but it's basically a miniature airplane underneath the surface and if he gets into trouble if they wiped out they have a quick-release but now they've gotten is developed so that he can do it without the boots cuz that adds an element of danger that ft long that's so strange looking yeah but it what's going on below the surface so there's a miniature airplane do you have a Jimmy Jam any pictures of it slipped up I'm sure if you look on Lord stuff you can see the bottom it's like a miniature airplane because water is denser than air so it's sort of like a miniature plane and it is like the Oracle guys that do those boats do have made foils for Laird I mean you know it's aerodynamics hydrodynamics it's all of that so now what you're doing is cuz there's energy below the surface moving so we think of a wave like pushing and dropping but there's actually the energy circular energy below so now you got the oil that can ride that but you're not you don't have dragged can go there's a wave on Kauai where they're going over you know 50 to go about 52 52 miles an hour so we might if you did something will you you know dedicated yourself to martial arts it's like but then there's like a new way to do it and so he's been doing the big stuff for 25 years but now they're getting the equipment right that he can ride ways that actually wouldn't be that great but now they're super fun drag correct and it's it's actually riding the energy below the surface which you know for him he's just interested in what's the most efficient way I mean look at that you never into in regular surfing be able to ride that so it enables them so much fun you know his his pursuit of this is it's pretty pretty addictive pretty interesting relationship to watch I think it's important I mean as a female for me I think playing volleyball help me understand like having a Pursuit you know like something like you I got to go do that and I think it's something about living with a person who has a Pursuit other than like I need a bigger Worcester pretty odyssa pretty interesting relationship to watch I think it's important I mean as a female for me I think playing volleyball help me understand like having a Pursuit you know like something like you I got to go do that and I think it's something about living with a person who has a Pursuit other than like I need a bigger War chest or whatever that can be really cool</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it'll be way more interesting than Bigfoot everybody's like so into Bigfoot being real like that I don't care what's the concept of Bigfoot likely there was interaction between human beings and something called a gigantopithecus for thousands and thousands of years it's a giant bipedal existing Asia that was between 8 and 10 ft tall it was real it was basically in like the orangutan family looks almost orangutan like putting warmest and I was a real thing and they didn't find out about this until like the 1920s they found a tooth in an apothecary shop in China and an anthropologist examines 2/3 like where the f*** did you get this and they got more things and bones and jaw bones and they determine the from the job on I'm sorry they determine from the job on that they think it was bipedal then stood up on two legs and so then they said well how big would this thing pee and then in the proportion that was really interesting is that's where it would be because if it did come across the Larry the Bering land bridge like they believe humans did if that did happen the mini animals navigated from there to here that way that's where Alaska and Pacific Northwest the natural path and then if you think about how densely wooded that area is that would be a natural habitat for something that's hiding from people the problem is Lehi from s*** anymore this just in thing would catch you on a trail camera some this trail cameras are everywhere there for cat like to see those guy and his father got caught poaching a mother bear in her Den it's it's horrific it's horrible it's not just horrible because the they poach this mother bear in their den left us the baby's essentially to die but they were talking about how they're not going to get caught doing it like no one's going to tie us to and the way they were caught there was a 4k camera that was right behind them that was that was observing this this whole area where the bear was dead then they have his trail cameras now they're incredibly accurate they're so like it's so high definition super clear in the audio clear thinking we don't know everything like the magic of stuff unknown and behind eye I mean for me it doesn't have to be Bigfoot but I live I love the idea that we haven't seen everything we don't know everything but obviously we know that was space and who knows you know one dimensions and time and universe but something mythical is pretty fun what what's interesting is that there was a bunch of different kinds of humans that's what's in these bones and I think they call them the denisovans they they found a sack of this is within the last 10-15 years they found a completely different species of humans that live in Russia they found those little people on the island of Flores that was only like 10 years ago I mean there's just probably dozens more that they just haven't uncovered somewhere so if there was at 1. time some big giant hominid it's only possible they just haven't uncovered somewhere so if there was at 1. time some big giant hominid it's only possible to eat so much</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that you guys live in Hawaii that he is because I've always had this like idealized idyllic one day like a butt move to the Big Island just chilling the side of a mountain stop f****** I fly out to do gigs but live out there where everything is just more relaxed is it okay couple things I think because it is a primal environment like we live on Kauai which is pretty heavy duty as far as it's quiet there's not a lot of distraction there's a really heavy-duty nature and and so I and I grew up in in St Thomas on the Virgin Islands Elvis used to kind of being on an island but you're you're with yourself a lot so if you have things to do that are you know active then it's perfect but what you have to always calibrate is like the down time or like it's been raining off and on for like over a year on Kauai where people it starts getting heavy but it's sunny two climates on this island of big island has desert yes it has tropical rainforest it is a volcano and polishes I think it has every weather climate except Arctic I believe at least Maui and the Big Island have sort of every type of climate is crazy that just a little bit further down it'll be different be raining constantly and you could drive around the whole thing and like how many hours it take you to drive around the Big Island out of the Big Island I don't know like 4 hours or something like that I think so maybe a little more yeah you like the big island snow like to the rest of the Mainland that low pressure can also bring big and then my season was summer so we sort of went back and forth and that's a really good blend cuz you can come to California be like oh it's a busy world I can see a lot of people I can learn stuff I can do stuff and then I also makes you appreciate when you go back to Hawaii or like clean are really clean water very beautiful place some of the ways the ideas about the way they live there it's it's simple in a good way and help me in any way like a derogatory till they're not trying it they're not angling and trying to get somewhere it's like no we're living but it can be really hard place really hard place so well I think so you have like this this very intense love and you know when they talk about the Aloha Spirit generosity death and then they're very powerful people as well and sometimes if they're not living as they're in their most natural way that they were supposed to and then you couple it with you know there's not a ton of opportunities there it's hard to live there it's far away it's expensive and and sometimes you know it sounds cliche but it's like we really do at human organisms either need to be busy so like okay working from sunup to sundown for a food I used to be and then you're just so tired just go to bed and it's pretty simple and don't let you survive it or in the world that we live in now it's like how do we get people doing things that are kind of productive and you think oh I just would sit on the beach and look at the mountain and it's like in after while you get bored and if you're a warrior you're either going to go you know do something with that that is good for you or you might not so I think there's there's a lot a lot of that there I've learned from that culture but it I mean there are powerful there's powerful group and you know it can go the other way pretty quick where it's you know if there's drugs and alcohol or beefing and like it's all that so it's you know it's just and now we have all these the internet and all the stuff so now you aren't you sure think o the rest of the world has a perfect they're all busy and doing fabulous perfect things and and it's hard like you got to find people that you're like let's do something let's go I mean can you train alone every single time now so you'd have to have a tribe of people that are like let's go do this activity and sometimes it's not that easy 70000 people on the island on Kauai Hawaii is probably the least inhabited it's the oldest island so it has the most erosion largest beaches and that's where they grew up and it's it's so really go hang out over there Kinda Yeah it's cool though cuz it's like if you know if they'll be like no he got a year ago out you got to go really totally so it was a great it's just the people that live there you can't like move to Mullica 100 Axis deer it's a beautiful place in the people are amazing but you it's not like oh I'm just going to buy a house there or build a house there's no way no way at all these different islands have their own Like rules now it's like that they probably have you know the largest percentage of pure Hawaiians their school I mean pretty good like I found it like there's a big difference between the date of the culture of say Maui versus the culture of Lanai Lanai is more Island D2 me where is Maui seems like a little bit gentrified the wind cuz it was so windy Maui so windy it brought all the Europeans in the 80s to Windsor so you're also have not only Mainland us and then Japanese culture you know 80s now you're talkin about Europeans or wind and windsurfing so it has a lot going on I think Maui it was almost like a surprised how quick a developed and they never had a chance to get on top of it if that makes sense</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I wanted to know as far into this as you can tell me why you think this instead of me just saying no you're wrong I want it I want you to explain it to me I want to know whether or not I trust your process do you bring that skill home with you I mean you're surrounded by women but I mean I'm always fascinated to watch them navigate their home is it when they're surrounded by West and I just give up most of the time I'd lose every argument I think I tried to we communicate a lot while talking be themselves I don't want him to mirror my resilience and I want them to be vulnerable they want to be vulnerable but it's in terms of like how I decorate the house or any I have no say and It's never enough but if you have the right relationship sometimes it'll work that way cuz I don't give a fuk with my house looks like I really don't have a good view where's the coffee house where feels right I don't give a fuk I think it's tomorrow I mean you know like sometimes if I infringe on if it's functional than Laird steps in like you know that's not really functional but otherwise he's like I'm tearing some stuff out of my house right now and he just gives me a look and I'm like I'm this age if I want to do this support me the last and walks out I love to decorate the nervous tissue is really into it really into like design in in their own house like a really really into it like a constantly obsessing about where things are and where this was a sexuals yeah yeah it's a funny thing right but if I didn't have this place though I don't know if I like traditionally men had pool halls they can hang out or Jim's they would hang out in and they would get their dose of Titanic masculinity Pacific I said I wanted to be surrounded by women I didn't mean to be related to all of them that's hilarious guys have elevated body temperature so athletes people train a lot that they're statistically have a greater chance of having daughters because I think they hot we call Hot balls basically if he kills off the male sperm if you would ever know I think so they did a thing on a bunch of guys either in the NFL or whatever and statistically they just have a lot more daughters and I think it's like Nature's Way of going oh you're going to be all like moving and active and Ron all the stuff guess what put a bunch of girls around you do for you or he loves them so they carry away with it they can't get fired now I always say that to them my youngest daughter when she was really little like five or six should say okay so I'm not really clear with this when I have alone time I'm by myself and when you and Dad need a long time like you're together and I try to like well you know it's important for moms and dads cuz you don't have to work that I do you know you're you're always going to be dad's daughter I you know I'm we're working at being a husband and wife and then she'd keep going with it I probably would just say like hey do you want to have Christmas in separate houses and I'd see her thing for second like well maybe you know and I'm like we need alone time like you take one or two things either you have this wild animal that's tearing things apart I have someone is screaming and crying about something you don't understand Destroyer or physical and I have learned so much being a mother two daughters and I've been around women my whole life playing volleyball being around tons of women very different as a parent I mean I've learned the most especially teenagers grow so strange it's such a strange experience watching a person figure out the world from from jump and I like out the womb figure out the world it's so educational field I don't think everyone should have told you I'm not one of those zealots of tells everybody that you're not allowed to have a kid Carol soda romanticize like to your friend to either opted not to have children or whatever met a partner to later didn't or whatever because I think it is a really rich I mean there's nothing like it I mean I love my children but if I had one friend she was like got married later and she's like you know where can adopt and she's also doing a new business and I was like listen I need to come I want to talk to you and she also like to consider taking naps occasionally I was like if you so you're going to adopt and like you're going to have a twelve-year-old that's okay I really appreciate you guys thank you so much I go that's not what you know like if you think you're going to have a kid and it's going to make you happier that's not what having a kid is I think it makes you it's a makes you know yourself better in a different way and you can adopt and do something different but I think when people try to sell that bill of goods like I have kids it's like well do you want to have kids you definitely shouldn't adopt you think it's going to be easy emantic idea and I go you know you don't persuade you don't know what the what where the kid is coming from and then also you have a room I think every parent going into it has a romantic idea I did and I'm a pretty realistic person of like I'm going to do all these things right and it we're going to be you no running in sunflower fields together and my kids are never going to think my music sucks or I can't drive and then you realize tell me everyone gets their turn the barrel no matter what you do you. You have to navigate stop you're going to have to deal with stuff on the other hand it's awesome when someone doesn't. People they're really into if they know what they're getting into and those Martyrs out there in those people that are just super kind and generous and love to adopt children. God bless them where to sell it like I love the mom check when you can have number two or whatever to somebody it's like oh you know that they're behind closed doors doing it you know like they just want everyone to be in the psychoticness with them like I have three kids you should have three kids well don't you think you're a better person for raising kids does it make you feel like you're more in-tune and nicer and just more aware of what it is what it means to be a human like I feel like it's it's a forced expiration if you're trying to participate like if you just lay down a Longo hey in this house this is how we do it then you're not doing anything I think if you you learn to adopt and also go while I was doing that wrong for like 10 years amazing you know like one of my daughters 12 or 13 to revealed some stuff about what she was unhappy about about my parenting and I was like I've been doing that for a long time 30 at the Thanksgiving table I just think you think you're in control of stuff and you think I've got some discipline and work ethic I just work my way through it or power my way through it and then you realize like no you have to surrender and and also it's not just about solving it quickly and yeah it is I know myself certainly better but also it forces you if you're willing to to Really expand</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> nothing I think that we disagree with what we agree with the marriage thing should be involved I think we're people should be protected is through assets and you know that but why do you care if two gay guys want to get married so from a religious or do you think that this is how they were born this is actually just the general conservative point of God Human Action generally is I don't know meaning that for the vast majority of people have assumed that they have a biological drive to it to engaging in that behavior but the traditional sort of will point of view is that biological Drive does not necessarily match up to the activity you are to engage an example of a biological drive to impregnate a woman that's not something religion is cool with either is one woman and impregnating her but you're not cool with a man being with men so I can give you the religious explanation is that there is something different about a woman then there is about a man and a man is made better through his Union with a woman and that if you pervert be sex drive to pursue mere pleasure instead of a lasting relationship upon which the basis of society is built then you are forgoing for use of your sex drive to step in and argue against that you would say that just because someone can't get pregnant doesn't mean that they don't have a loving relationship that contributes to society guys are gay that's so that relationship from a from a religious perspective is more valuable because women have different qualities in men you round off each other's visit changes you being Mary changes being married to a member the same sex would but I don't want people to have to do it but if you were a person and we no I mean of course you can legally then people immediately assume that I'm a Theocratic underscoring on Dave rubin's marriage of no consequence to public policy in any way whatsoever but why do you care like as a person as a rational thinker it's pretty clear that people are gay and I don't really think that this is a decision they make and turned in terms of like I'm going to make a clear choice to defy God and be gay I think they're just gay that's it that's a chain of thinking that religion religion if a man is gay in your religion and they're in love with another man they should just squash those thoughts and find a woman while ideally they would be honest with the one there is there not like you would want someone you should stop being with your beautiful wife and you need to now marry a man because this is what God wants you to do so you're going to have to stoop this man and he's going to strip you and then cuz this is how the rules are set up right then there is a buying to the precepts of the religion and the buying is buying a tax correct Testament and the New Testament someplace As Romans is the idea that this is a unique area of human behavior that religion is supposed to treat differently many religion treat virtually every human activity like this sin is a failure to abide by a covenant right that's what the definition of sin going to do a Mitzvah which is a command that you're violating a commandment well there lots of Commandments that go directly against what people are driven to do just because the drive is stronger does not make it morally more morally non-callable to violate that commanded so when people pick this one out and it will this particularly intolerant for example I don't see why it's more particularly intolerant then saying you have to marry one woman or saying to a Jew that you are not allowed to eat this stuff where you'd like it may be harder questions harder to abide by those commandment but it is well within religious tradition like literally every religious tradition that there's a bunch of stuff you're driven to do that you can't now I got you don't have to agree with my program you Proclaim that you are no show on Saturdays you have her keep store-bought like there's a lot of iron and as long as I'm not bothering anybody else I frankly don't see what business it is of legitimately anybody's what I think about personal relationships I'm not imposing might be on anybody else do not want all the religions Judaism probably makes it the most obvious they don't give a f*** what you do go ahead do you think like they're not trying to waste my time learn a lot of s*** like 3 years of a grind yeah it's a long time when it comes to traditional marriage over over same-sex marriage that's a very simple calculation which is one type of marriage produces traditional children against same-sex marriage went completely out the window so you are just sticking to your rigid ideology in terms of like what you believe to be ascended not believe just be a sin based on your religion based on this very strict moral fiber that this religion is operate in that when people have a better understanding about biology like if it was proven if there's proven this is why a person develops blue eyes this is why a person is gay this is why it is nothing wrong with it is just a variation it's red hair it's freckles it's gay it's straight by twos want to watch to hook up a check but keep going the worldview generally which is logical excuse for behaving in a certain way like is it possible that these laws in this religion were written when they're what make you think wrote the stuff do you think people wrote the stuff or do you think God wrote the song even if I believe that at the very least it's got inspired and God written right but even if I believed on a cycle of a human being so I think the people 3000 years ago had never seen a gay person before meat grinder with this is also the argument against pork is cuz they didn't understand trichinosis then understand you have to cook the meat 245 degrees and pork parasites which are very dangerous for people he had parasites from pork that I'd gotten into his body nested and spraying start developing on the cyst inside of his head and they couldn't do anything about it cuz it was so deep in his head that if they gave him the anti anti parasite medication it would cause swelling of the brain and they would like it was it was so apparently people accidentally coming in contact with pigshit produces this particular type of parasites Moses was pretty, I get their attempts to sort of pink back into the Bible certain rationalistic explanations like this what do you think you was what are you guys going to try to lead a revolt against the Romans and got killed for his trouble just like that time for trying to leave revolt against bigger and bigger deal of time Jesus ancient Hebrew thousands of years ago and we're told and oral tradition for longer than that right now did the basic contention that I make is that judeo-christian values on the one hand and then human reason on the other Greek reason really that that tradition is attention and that that tension is where Western Civilization lives the basically civilization is the suspension bridge and take certain fundamental precepts of judeo-christian values on the one hand and then takes Creek reason and it pulling against each other and sometimes you have a bridge that is that is capable of building a pond that where you can actually have a functional civilization and if you lose reason in the name of theocracy then you end up with tyrannical theocracy and if you lose you lose religion in name a reason you end up in some pretty dark places because human beings don't have a very good track record of creating their own purpose creating their own meaning of creating their own systems we tend to quickly sort of the story of the the rigid ideology that's prescribed by religions that you don't allow the human beings to keep updating it and changing it because if you do they will eventually slide into chaos what is called the god of how much some of these stories that are just going to put into the into the middle of atonement where Moses comes back and he's watching from on high as a bunch of rabbis in 2nd Century Palestine are talking about Judaism and he's like I don't recognize any of this stuff has always had a common law tradition we're using reason to try and develop the ideas behind the Commandments and then try and extend them over on them and I think that's a good thing but you have to be careful not to completely undermine fundamental roots or or get rid of basic precepts and truths that exist there and then there's play as far as how those are implemented does Judaism have one of those pray the gay away Traditions note you want guys to do like what what would you do if you were not to send thing that everybody does admitting that masturbation is not is not okay according to Judaism I assume that a vast majority of young Jewish men even the Orthodox are masturbating so people sit and I mean that's that's a recognition it's it's always I will are told that when they say that something is a sin this means that they are looking askance at the people for committing the sin and that is not correct I mean what you do and Christianity say is that we are all committing sins on a fairly regular basis where we get uptight is when people start saying because I have a desire for the sin the sin is no longer to send you were assuming or influence by God right but clearly written by people well the this one you would say if you're a fundamentalist or at least somebody believes in the idea that the door was given by God was given literally by God but again that doesn't leave the logic behind the rows with no people like maimonides have tried to explicate the idea is as I said the human sex drive was made to procreate with in Asia relationship in order to progenerate and have future generations of people misuse of that sex drive in anyway whether you're talking about from masturbation to homosexual activity is there for a diminishment of the use of that drive that's a natural law case against against homosexual activity that also not cool with it or they allowed to have sex with no view of sex Sgt intersex people mean that there's no such thing as two separate Sexes there are two separate taxes and also their intersex people who have a condition of heterosexual sexual activity does not change based on the fact that some people can't actually participate in that what would you do if your young gay guy came to you for advice if someone said hey been an admirer of yours I love the way you think and follow your philosophies but I've got a problem Young Thug man and I'm gay and I don't know what to do but would you tell him to do I mean I can't tell them to do anything they don't want to do advise would you tell it would you tell him to not act out on those feelings I would take you do the best you can is a human being and from my moral perspective you try to avoid sin as best you can but everybody sends the problem is that sin though it seems to me that it was defined by people that didn't understand biology because they were dealing with humans that existed thousands of years ago I really don't think that biblical Commandments are linked in biology many men you don't think so no I think that all sin is a recognition that we have drives that we are supposed to forgo benefits to discipline his real benefits to having structure and it doesn't mean that you can't be creative it doesn't mean you can't be free and do whatever you want some of the time too but I think we can both agree that this is one of the one of the best benefits of an ideology hopefully a positive ideology ever had a conversation with Dave Rubin about about him being a gay guy wouldn't be there for religious reasons but that you would be there for Marie's like if it wasn't a party if you wouldn't go to the wedding would you go to the after-party anything that was a celebration of same-sex marriage now and again like I'm not sure why I'm not a party person so I'm not sure why you'd want me at their party haven't been to a party with you but I went to a dinner party with you</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> unless unless taken seriously taken last one seriously it's it seems to me that that Trend which is a common Trend that's existed for the last few years of these clickbaity bulshit articles and Miss labeling people it's going to go away because your perspective is not going to be appreciated it's not going to be respected if you if you're obviously making disingenuous statements like that and I think we're in this weird position where it's very difficult to find real journalism and real give take some things that aren't flavored by their ideology and everybody's trying to shape everybody and they feel like it's their obligation they feel as many people that write things that feel like it's their obligation to change your perspective on National subjects in it things that are important to us that she's not their obligation just report what's going on but also their obligation to flavor things in a way that will make one side look favorable to the other I'm conservative you don't go to my site has been on the news that's going to work and guess what CNN is liberal and they are going to give you the Liberals been on the news and that's just the way this is going to work to do see the video when the Mueller report came out and look like somebody got killed out like that Blackbird they were pumped and then he came out and was like well no collusion of Issaquah I got the note to cover up wait a minute making statements that in retrospect are probably like you could probably I mean richest person but if I was a guy like Donald Trump so many people to sue Bill Maher show and you were supposed to talk about Free Speech stuff in like 5 minutes before he's talking about Trump Russia collusion and I said what I've always had which is I'll wait for the evidence to come out and then I will make a decision as to whether Trump Russia collusion was a thing and Bill Maher's like you don't believe it was a thing protective right it was like it was like talking to him why should white candy perspective I'm waiting for more evidence be talking to anyone when it is obviously evidence is not out why why why is that in anyway controversial it is bewildering to me it's because people have this need to let everyone know that they're on the right side and they want you to know that they do believe in the collusion if you disagree with that for whatever reason you must either be a right-wing person a trump supporter who's in denial someone who doesn't look at the evidence and you're part of the problem but the real problem was jumping at conclusions there obviously seem to be some attempts there's there's obviously some fuckry with that Ira company that did the internet research agency that is responsible for millions of interactions with people online with a pretended to be right different supporters rolls yet try to change people's opinions but how much that have to do with Donald Trump how much did he ask for you got no evidence they called Vladimir Putin and then put together a plan on how they're going to swing this particular Precinct in rural Michigan are you guys high like what are you talking about what if you contribute to A good rule of thumb for Paula text attribute everything to stupidity unless you can prove malice the real problem in this is something that is very similar to what we were talking about earlier when you say something and you say it over and over and over again and you say it with such conviction and it becomes a giant pot your news narrative and then that something turns out to be horseshit yep you just massively empowered Trump yeah it empowers him in a in a in a spectacular manner they made a giant mistake oh yeah I think you're using the power of the institution you used to run to spread this nonsense and you got that from John Brennan you got it from James Clapper these are all former heads of the intelligence agencies just makes me think the intelligence agencies need to be wildly her back at these were the heads of them like the heads of the intelligence agencies are using their platform to Proclaim that they have inside information about Trump that turned out to be other nonsense I'm not sure these people should have that much power do you like I expected Mueller is going to indict as a foreman tomorrow expected yet there's a lot of that it was ugly Adam Schiff locations of people saying possible collusion possible collusion with the Russians possible Russian collusion possible collusion music that goes with it and then just cut to possible collusion with the Russians possible Russian collusion</div>

It has brought him in disability exist every year it's it's not people a check for Ubi then they will spend the extra time creating art and engaging in hobbies that they like and I just lost myself to him like people on disability what they're doing if you're on disability the people you're talking about her suffering they're not out the writing poetry the rise of the opioid epidemic and people who are od'ing on drugs and and all the stuff that's in precisely the same place as opposed to another place I think we have a crisis of purpose right now and I don't think that that price has a purpose is solvable on the one hand I change Not Afraid rules and I also don't think that price is a purpose is solvable by by cutting a government check I just don't think that that's how people are wired I absolutely agree with you that there is a crisis of purpose my concern is about Automation and my concern and obviously haven't we started this other than talking to Andrew Yang and talking to Elon Musk and a few other people that are proponents of universal basic come they think there's going to be such a massive loss of jobs in such a short. Of time from people that are non skilled laborers and it is going to go away these millions and millions of jobs and these people are not going to have anything and then it could be chaos and the average tax rate 160 problem per second which you know without taking the economy which question will we could do that we could have trillions of dollars to the budget every year and we could tell that I'm still not sure that that solves be deeper problem which is it when people lose jobs there was purpose so I'm not sure that Ubi solves that problem a little bit my little bit less catastrophic am I thinking about automation then then either and ringing or Elon Musk people be able to adapt quick enough to salute to avoid the problems will realize the jobs aren't there anymore and they'll just naturally gravitate towards other profession the overtime that people will do that a trucker being helpful examples of like how censorship stat overstepped its boundaries and becomes almost like satire dot connect with wireless Nicholas Nassim taleb view of reality which that the Black Swan ending can happen any any second so watch out for it versus the sort of Steven Pinker view of reality which is the Black Swan Inn San is called a Black Swan internet because it's a Black Swan incident meaning that it happens incredibly rare like the idea that we are on the verge of a catastrophic dropping job numbers because I'm not sure that I buy it because you still on the road a gradual transition away from some of these jobs and we can talk about Radiologists and Howe radiologist are going to be priced out of the market by computers that can do a better job of diagnosing tumors and first of all awesome I mean that's that's good for the girl that brings down cost and you won't get cancer is Advanced what what and mostly technology will will become more of a productivity Aid to two people so in this is true in factories jobs and wasps and Packers the best example for job but it's mostly to an office has been created because you have computers or office jobs exist because you got to let them fail so you figure out why they failed and we'll never have happen again if there is this thing in the government steps in says wait a minute I know you lost all your jobs going to give you $1,000 you have to figure it out $1,000 a month and some people go okay I'm not going to figure it out now where is those people might have gone on the fear-filled journey to try to figure out their purpose in life because now they're stuck where their job doesn't exist anymore so there that stuff is true with Milton Friedman main argument for Universal basic income as a replacement for the welfare system there there is another problem with universal basic income that I asked Andrew about also and that was one of the one of the big issues is that poor people very often people part permanently impoverished temporarily poor but they tend not to spend money or we think they have to spend money the average the average person who is making less than I think it was $16,000 years putting $400 in a lottery ticket service was generally just watching your money down the toilet so it's it's so how do you aren't you just going to end up back in the same place ghetto in six months where people took that money and used it in ways that actually didn't benefit them and what level of incompetence or inability do we say you no longer on your decisions until we're just going to take care of you on a permit that's that's really the question here I think we're looking at when you talkin about welfare we're looking at worst case scenario right where someone does get dependent upon the welfare state and does use that money frivolously and does make poor decisions but then there's got to be other people that are single moms that you know maybe had a kid but some f****** a****** it doesn't want to pay and it is a piece of s*** and have to hide from them and they're just trying to feed their kids for those people exist to help them out and maybe they're not a part of the church and maybe they don't have a good group of neighbors maybe they had to move somewhere for work and they got stuck in some place where they don't know anybody children and having a kid when you're young is like it's a terrible idea for your life but what do you recommend to have kids avoid that are you one of those people to think I'm out of town with that thing on it no condoms make mistakes then I mean that's what happens if it becomes less so what should what should happen so that your kids suffer so I mean how about we assume that if you are old enough to get pregnant then you are old enough to listen to about 17 or older 18 year old</div>

People have stock in Microsoft as a general as a basic factual thing he's done more good doing that and giving tens of millions of dollars to to various outside causes so it feels like a lot of the progressivism in corporate halls and in Silicon Valley is bifurcated mentally it's like people have Dolphins one side of the brain on at a time where's my other side where I show people what a great person I am by proclaiming that I'm for Bernie Sanders well parking my money offshore to make sure them there it's shielded from the from the taxman yeah well that's what I'm saying is that the evil thing like one of things that I thought was what that was like a legal decision me being Santigold they were pulled into some sort of an office and said if we say don't be evil and you take someone off the are you accusing them of evil assessment of you are the moral police social standards and I am way less of a top-down I am not here to tell you that you're not allowed to be on a platform disagree is one thing for threatening violence which is a natural by Elation of law but this crap where people like me because I believed in the social fabric built on certain judeo-christian values are not forcing it be part of that and I'm not I don't think the government should compel you to be a part of that I'm the Tyrant but the person who sits at the top of Twitter or Facebook who's saying that they get the police what you see and they're going to nudge you in the right direction nudge you in the right direction without your consent without them even telling them what you're doing right that they're just they're going to push you a little bit because you better than you and I can sort of massage you in the bed reviews if we control your channels information this something to eat Obama administration is very fond of there's a scholar and cats understand the legal scholar and he wrote a book called know you shouldn't you shouldn't because transparency is the only way I can tell trying to sell me will not just that like your your closing down even conversation if it's soon as you trying to silence this other voice if you if you believe one thing and another person believes a different thing you should probably talk about it and the way the way that I know for sure there's something wrong with your argument is if what you're trying to do is your sneakily trying to silence these voices and again as long as we're not talking about threats of violence as long as we're not talking about harassment boxing right we just talked to my conversation you just talking about people with different point-of-view if you want to silence different point-of-view I have to wonder about your intent I have to wonder about what are you going to this conversation with good faith I have to wonder whether you really objectively assess whether or not you your argument does hold up against scrutiny cuz this is also part of the problem when your in an echo chamber you often don't formula these arguments very well like when you confront people about certain biased beliefs that they have and you you ever an opposing beliefs what are you going to this conversation with good face I have to wonder whether you really objectively assess whether or not you your argument does hold up against scrutiny cuz this is also part of the problem when your in an echo chamber you often don't formally these arguments very well like when you confront people about certain biased believes that they have and you you ever an opposing believe if they're part of a bubble like sometimes they might not have you ever considered some of the things you have seen I seen that with some of your videos</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> moved in one way or another they used to be and then terrible General a general perception not only the government sucks at everything but that you got to own your own actions and also examine more of the evidence about the impact of a pot on people's lives and and there's you run your own life or use drugs drugs that legitimately ruin other people's lives or remove your ability to even reason or thing I think there's only two reasons to criminalize drugs PCP that legitimately make you violent and then you are going out of committing acts of violence against people then there's a case or if you're talking about a drug where it legitimately robs you of your capacity to reason if it were built heroin if you were able to actually crack down on it successfully but even then I'm not sure that the proper government solution is criminalization because we've criminalized it and it's still incredibly prevalent so drugs being extremely detrimental in the other part is that there is comprable drugs are illegal incomparable drugs meaning not even really caught with drugs that are far more devastating like alcohol like you could just go to any grocery store and buy a jug of whiskey until yourself with it that was not difficult open up right next to my house right there residential zoning that's fine with liquor stores though I'm opposed to same-sex marriage and I believe that a man and a woman were made for each other when it comes to government involvement I'm so stressed I don't think premarital sex is a good thing right I've been very vocal about this I was a virgin until I was married my wife is Virgin until she was married I think that's a good thing. I think the government has anything to do with any of those things no I don't I don't think you start to get unintended externality so for example with the the legalization of marriage is that the government to get completely out of business I don't think the government should be involved in straight marriage I don't think should be involved in gay marriage I think the government should be out and the reason is because as a religious person I have to drive to marriage certificates I have the one from the state that I don't give two craps about it's buried somewhere my garage and then the ceremony matters a lot more than the state saying nothing and the state isn't incentivizing once the state of California decides that same-sex marriage is only Go part with heterosexual marriage now I'm worried about the externality of I have religious day school or I have up my my synagogue my synagogue is religious institution it doesn't approve of same-sex marriage how it ought to act with regard to same-sex marriage I don't think that's the government business everybody gets to do basically what they want associate with whom they want and it's pretty good happy medium I'm so glad you talked about the two things that I want to talk to you about that I'm sure we disagree one of them being marijuana and the other one being gay people marry each other so let's start with the marijuana one do you think marijuana ruins people's lives cuz that's what is that one of your intentions it can and I think in this never had any experience with marijuana over use of marijuana I'm glad you said that because I wanted to cover that but you were in the middle of a rat when we were joking around about six and seventh graders selling pot don't smoke pot when you're young you really should it's not good for the development of your brain same thing with drinking you know I didn't smoke a lot of pot when I was a kid the handful times 1230 years old but I did drink a bunch of times when I was in high school is terrible for brain develop right especially before you're twenty-five and your frontal cortex fully formed your frontal lobe is like this it's it's it's a developing thing it did that I posted from BBC that was saying that you probably shouldn't be considered an adult until you're Thirty when I was 16 I was a champ high school now what the problem that I have with many people's perceptions on marijuana is that it's based on ignorance meaning not no personal experience with you know and come right back up the marijuana thing is in my opinion it's another one of those things where people have this this categorized box that they like to put marijuana users in like this is the category lazy Stoner stupid delusional percentage of did you get to community a does Jiu-Jitsu high they have competition party I'm telling you cuz it's not what people think it is if you've never smoked marijuana is going to be a very difficult thing to the grass but marijuana enhancers you just because it eliminates the rest of the world when you're rolling with rolling is like say if you and Jamie were going to have a sparring match that would be rolling like it slap hands and then you go and you trying to choke him and he's trying to get you in an armbar and you go when you do that on marijuana it's like you don't think of anything else other than those movements and it becomes like this very intense meditation and violence like you violated terms of most of time you don't really even get hurt and he's like you get to the point of what a beautiful things about Jiu-Jitsu so you can grab a whole someone and choke them to the point where they're going to go to sleep and you would kill them if you kept going and they tap your friends again and everybody's cool and you try to do it to me and I'll try to do it to you and you we can do it reasonably hard without people getting hurt it happens every day all throughout the world allow these people are high and they're doing this Jiu-Jitsu practice in this all almost like Trends it's a it's a Transcendent state okay so so then you know that for a subset of the population there is some evidence that marijuana is addictive but it's a subset it's not everybody who's on people just absolutely people that are addicted to Sugar that for sure people that are addicted to nicotine and alcohol and all these things we let people have comprable to alcohol or nicotine it suits of seems to be very rare when people become physically addicted to it extremely rare and what's what's common though is abuse and it's common in everything that you meant being consumed it's abuse as common as we said with food certainly, that call certainly, the pills really believe that the way to solve some of these problems is a social fabric problem like my parenting problem is social problems personal choice problem virtually every you have this community that reinforces this kind of behavior and thought and I think that's one of the major really one of the best benefits of religion is that moral Fabric and that Community the sense of community even silly ones like Mormons and other than Isis folks right to believe something that is f****** patently insane if you go and read the Joseph Smith tax from 1820 weighs 14 years old to shut that he wrote like Alexis de tocqueville talks about this early on the American Republic the ideas that what makes America very different is the ideal you don't need a big government when you do have a supportive social fabric feel like they're least oriented toward a common goal it's one of the problems that I think we have in the country right now I'm not sure people are oriented toward even a common sense of of conversation agree on on everything in order to have a common sense of the important values that that unify the country because he's obviously I'm equally equally strong believer And yet when it comes to the things that we would like to see happen in the country not on government policy level but let's have a conversation level level we're on the same page there's those core assumptions are built on foundations Sam's evolutionary biology we we different little bit there I don't want to let this marijuana think I wanted to bring up to you was this idea that if your religious person don't you think that there's certain things that maybe God put here for us to consume to change your perspective to allow you to reach new levels of consciousness do you think it's entirely possible that some of these things that are here and I know you haven't experienced they might literally have been put there by God and there's some evidence to say that a lot of the text from the Bible that it in particular there was nothing was the University of Tel Aviv somewhere in in Jerusalem or these Scholars were they were trying to decipher what it meant when Moses and counted the burning bush and they believe that it may have been the acacia tree which is very rich and dimethyltryptamine which is a psychedelic substance that actually brain produces its very common in plants and they think that this might have been when he met God and God was a burning bush that this might have been some crude translation of them being involved in some sort of a psychedelic experience know it sounds outlandish unless you had that psychedelic experience and when you have you very well could think that you were in a conversation with god this is on Earth and this is something that may very well have been lost information or this may very well have been rituals that people participated in to bring them closer together and to reinforce that sense of community that you do get from a church and if you do get from a group of people that share more beliefs and values and there's a there's a real good discussion that a lot of these experiences that became these religious Doctrine came from psychedelic experiences that was someone who's never experienced that before I know this is probably a very strange thing to try to even wrap your head around as it is entirely a until you experience it but it might very well be religious and I've heard that from other people who have been abused those kind or that because something is here or because energy is natural and therefore we ought to imbibe or therefore we ought to participate in a particular activity yeah one of the things that I that I'm very big on I'm a rationalist when it comes to religion as much as you can be a rationalist with red religion to the extent that I think that it's up to us to use our reasonable faculties to determine the proper use of things so which is why you shouldn't overuse drugs even if you're going to use drugs you really don't know what it is or how it affects the body or what's the right dose for the wrong dose and then people get involved in these terrible situations where they're taking things they're just guessing that it does also rayshun can actually be quite a good thing solo rate of alcoholism in the Jewish community in part of that is the fact that you are getting Kiddush wine from the time your kid right I mean you actually are artistic I like living in reality and I like experiencing it totally sober so I've never really felt the the urge to do any of that stuff I hear the pitch but I've never really felt the interior desire need to jump in and I think that what we're dealing with do is perceptions that have been molded by laws that were shaped by tyrants that's what I think I mean probation probation with alcohol didn't work probation with drugs is just making the cartels bigger that's causing more problems of organized crime at a practical and is bad for you is also based on laws that the government created ignorantly these sweeping psychedelic Act of 1970 was made virtually everything psychedelic that they could they missed a few things evening slip through the crack butt the tryptamines and most of them psilocybin LSD all that stuff was made completely illegal by people really didn't even know what it was a lot of that is why we based our ideas of what's good or bad for you it's it's based on what is legal and what I've done with it we all could use between conservative thought and liberal thought that particular for people that are dying it's one of the things that Johns Hopkins found and there's been other studies done and there's been therapy done on people that are dying of terminal diseases and they give themselves hybrid and when they give them these mushroom trips they have these beautiful experiences with a completely except death and it's almost Universal reaction to do it that did like the the amount of people who still experienced a positive months and months after the experience while they're dying that they they say this was an incredibly moving and Powerful moment in my life that allow me to accept the fact that my time here is done then I don't think you're going to be a happier person all you have to do is take this regimen of of drugs that you're going to take every day and it's going to make you a happier person a more well-rounded person but it going to permanently change your brain chemistry that's something that you think is good or is it something you think is bad cuz perspective there's an argument to be made that these are you need to do on yourself without outside but he said that there was a joke about there was a monk and he met boudica's Buddha came to town and he said boo. He wanted to impress me said I practice the city of levitation and I've done this for 10 years and now I can walk on water and the Buddha says put the fairies only a nickel Aid the progression rapidly with psychedelic drugs and this is something that you know what you know about maps and their work with MDMA and soldiers that have had PTSD by giving these soldiers MDMA therapy meaning they they give them MDMA which is essentially what people think of is ecstasy the street and they give them pure MDMA and then they assist them with that they actually have a psychologist sit with them a therapist and they over all these details of these traumatic events and they come to peace with everything and they've had profound benefits for soldiers and four-wheel some combat journalist that different people that have been over there and if its appearance of the horrors of war and just general PTSD maybe the people who've experienced violent attacks that is shown to be one of the very best thing we've ever discovered for helping people get pass on it but it's a complex moral equation to the extent that if you're talking about somebody who has PTSD somebody has a condition and the only way to help that condition is to use these drugs I've never had a problem with any of that stuff right I mean I pay my grandfather was was schizophrenic and by may be bipolar baby schizophrenic to diagnose not exactly who they prescribed lithium made him a lot better would have been better off struggling with schizophrenia and then be able to live in when there's a problem using drugs to get past it and and work with it is a good thing you do run the risk of the sort of Brave New World situation where you have a group of people who have a certain level of aerostats happiness that is not driven by point of view but more by just the chemicals in their their body but are you brother something for happy basically happiness is the drugs because if your scientific materialist that's what it is happiness is just a bunch of chemicals going through your body so if you can bring them in without self change but I do wonder whether that robs people of a certain level of purpose that the struggle is part of Being Human idea that you are struggling I think I think the struggle is actually meaningful and I think that's why religions tend to set prophylactic rules sometimes and sometimes for real so for example I'm addicted to my phone and there's no question in my head all the time and butt from Friday night to Saturday night is off I can't look at it and forbidden from looking at it and this breaks the cycle at least for one day a week and that's a good thing that makes me better as a human being gets a limit I set for myself and then a limit that I abide by and if you in in self-mastery what were the happy medium between self-mastery and I need a little bit of a and I think they're there is a happy medium there but I'm not sure that your drugs are the answer to everything the problem term because with these are our substances that are psychoactive and some of them can be extremely beneficial and some of them have short-term experiences that last with long-term results and I don't think that there is enough knowledge that I don't think the people that are negative against it have experienced enough of it or have looked at it in an objective rational way because I think it's something that could be here too a perspective that give people a chance to think outside of their normal conditioned way of thinking that might have been established by their Community or by their Church by their neighborhood whatever it is sometimes a little bit of a break a little bit of a mental break from what you're experiencing the end of the vibration that you exist on almost every day to separate from that and to get a look at it from the outside sometimes it allows you to have renewed perspective that can enhance your life side of their normal conditioned way of thinking that might have been established by their Community or by their Church by their neighborhood whatever it is sometimes a little bit of a break a little bit of a mental break from what you're experiencing the end of the vibration that you exist on almost every day to separate from that and to get a look at it from the outside sometimes it allows you to have renewed perspective that can enhance your life great</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you have to rape or is it really just that one raped it's a long bit though so the lot of jokes within it and I'm being raped in the joke most of the time so that's you know that because for me I'm always trying to find something really funny from the dark s*** right what it's personal experience whatever it is and the way we're looking at is Comics is worth trying to find him a really positive that is something really shity and you like a movie which is just a f*****-up seeing there's nothing positive to one person talking how some people would look at it like you should talk about things that you really care about while you're doing that cuz you only have a certain amount of time to do it you know and some sometimes laughing snow you know I'm okay I will defend somebody's right to tell a shity joke you know I'm saying but at the same time I understand if as a performer you have to engage the audience and put your finger in the air and go okay which way is the wind blowing right now the reality is you can't say things you used to say you can't say faget on stage anymore in a crowd in New York or La you can't say that word the crowd will tighten up and shut down your room whatever you want but you know I have a joke about you know my my dog I used to say my faget dog can you work in another male dogs a****** in the joke and people shut down at that word and its really trusted in New York and that's where the biggest faggets with the rest of the country is cool if you go anywhere else they don't really give a s*** about words like that put in New York and La become a particularly hard thing to you have a certain words in people's sensors off always going to be a bunch of words like that what's really interesting is what does happen when you stop people from saying it cuz it's kind of counterintuitive cuz those words become these forbidden words there's so much more power if you don't send I don't just I just don't think you ever get to tell people that you can't say certain words that used to be able to say all the time you know I the idea behind those words still the same like if you say to someone you shouldn't say retarded anymore even though that used to be like a term they would use for things being slower like their growth being slower their growth was retarded but now you even use as a technical term like in the growth was retarded people get upset that you don't use that anymore now that's a proven sound even if it doesn't mean what they think it means we'll talk about a person with Down Syndrome they don't like hearing the r word you you talk about your special I thought was a great that we like just the sounds from your face like what are we what are we doing being shity way to really clearly convey intent and that's why when someone is good at speaking their mind we kind of get we get a real sense of what we enjoy it so it's good at speaking your mind but if someone sucks at speaking their mind you know if there if they're there clunky on that sounds horrible yeah I agree and there's too many people that it was no barrier of entry and were exposed to a lot of horseshit very quickly now where is like I think back in the day comedians had time to grow in a club you leave her Bob Saget right Bob's dirty f****** filthy comic who ended up getting on the cleanest television show ever write the dad in a manner was you know but then you if it was cell phones then he would have never gotten a gig watching you stop doing stand up for a long time because that to write stand-up while he was doing that show I might be wrong but if you did do it maybe did Largo and a bridge you know PG-13 version goes on the more words they're sneaking his Network television here like s*** and every now and then I think I think you're allowed to say s*** and a****** on network show now episode 1 in my a****** though no you can't say that just to call somebody a dick but you can get dick that's the idea right Yeah Yeah Yeahs on the way out feminizing a man and now that's offensive to women f*** you b**** p**** that's some crazy woman s*** that's actually right there that's how crazy women are it's not how crazy women aren't so crazy some women are it's like like some men are f****** crazy to dealing with a giant number of people but if people find a little thing where they can pick on it and go after it like that yeah I don't know there's nothing that's actually right there that's how crazy women are it's not how crazy women aren't so crazy some women are it's like like some men are f****** crazy to just dealing with a giant number of people but if people find a little thing where they can pick on it and go after it like that yeah I don't know there's nothing there's no it's very funny to me there's no words feminizing that could possibly offend me that could ever right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Vegas are sticking to 1.1 style of eating regardless of the training style that they're engaging and so MMA athletes they have to do high intensity training session strength and conditioning they have to be doing Spartan they have to be doing pads rounds that are you crazy heart and every athlete each one is going to have a different intensity relative 222 their body type and so if somebody's doing pads it's 9 or 10 out of 10 in terms of intensity and they're doing that fasted or they're doing that without call hydrate available to do that work they can't they can't a hit those training intensive repeatedly and then they can't adapt as a response to that training so they in debt end up just getting slower and more beat up instead of faster more powerful so if they're doing high-intensity we need to fuel the body in the specific way that supports that training effort and then the longer turn adaptation to that bout additionally if they're doing lower-intensity we can adjust our fueling strategy based on what that dictate you know if it's kind of a base aerobic training session work they're doing skills and drills we want to be feeding the body to adopt differently than if they're doing high-intensity sparring strength and conditioning or pads quit whatever that might be so for every athlete we're looking at outer body uses substrate energy the energy of the using the substrate between carbs and fat and each of these intentions and then we also needed basic bass we need to pay sell recommendations on where their body fits into the division if there if there 10% out from their weight division 4 weeks out and we're going to have a little bit of a more aggressive strategy nutritionally because of weight becomes a primary factor if they're 10% out 4 weeks out then we're going to have a little bit of a different conversation and prioritization around the fueling strategies and all of these conversations integrate with inner strength and conditioning program so they were working in the concert and tying in the workload into our own system as well as the training load that they're engaging with it with her Civic training now when you very the diet that you give them independent dependent of the workout what is it what is that based on is that based on a hard accepted science of carbohydrate vs. protein vs. offense of that essential fatty acid like how do you determine that the music philosophy of system called metabolic efficiency you can call metabolic flexibility after 2 called as well and essentially the body will use different substrates at different intensities and at low intensities and a trust the body Cannon and likely should be adapted for our for our Sports athletes to two fat at rest now it depends on the sports I begin a flu shot putter or for a hundred meter Sprinter then we're going to be much more dependent on carbohydrates and unrealistic losing phosphate system we're not even getting into the glycolytic system and dunking to talk a lot more about the energy systems but essentially we're relying upon glucose and ATP for energy at their lower-intensity burst isotunes yet repeated maxor submax efforts we require blood sugar and without it we will deplete our farm initial stores and then we can't we can't make no longer hit ninety 95% of our Max we start hitting 80 + 70 + 60 + in diminishing our ability to do this high-intensity efforts anybody come in and try to fight on a ketogenic diet cuz I know quite a few guys were doing that for a while and a Bryan Caraway Matt Brown yeah that's right he has bought the Heat why talk to him I think you didn't want proof pure and then he did you know he did the one where you you know you might take insist you're 80 carbs but then you work them off and they could have. I don't know some of those guys like Zach bitter ultramarathon Runner he does eat ketogenic most of time but then days of big races Hill consume a lot of sugars and then we can expand into support the development of that kind of aerobic oxidative system and by adapting to use fat as a primary substrate we're doing a number of things one we're balancing blood sugar at rest so that we can really limit the insulin spikes and and essentially adipose development in addition to driving the body towards the oxidative and oxidative Aerobic System and then as we increase in in really driving the body towards the oxidative and oxidative Aerobic System and then as we increasing in what we do is we assess how the body adapt through the training intensities and will repeat that kind of on a monthly basis to see how the athlete changes and then as the increase in the intensity of the training effort then we will adjust the ratio of fat to carbohydrates as as this as a fuel substrate</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> did plenty of people on the roster that have an MMA coach and a grappling couch and the performances that you we we feel we can help and support those guys and we're not trying to displace the programs were athletes already have resources but I don't know of another MMA gym globally that has the capacity around assessment that we do so yeah we have we have some really great practitioners but both end of our strength coach and his team cannot write programs for 5 70 athletes it's not possible but what we can do is assess those athletes provide that feedback back to their strength coaches and have conversations about how those coaches can use that data to support the development of that athletes and that goes across the board for all of our Performance Services was pretty amazing resource because if you're a young fighter and all you have is access to the people around you if you're fighting in the UFC you get to have access like instantaneously to this gigantic group of people in forest coming up you mean you a real Pioneer that was that was not available to a guy like you I told the store all the time but so I was actually a little bit ahead of my time I had you know I had an actual strength coach that had letters behind his name it went to college to be a strength coach not there was like an ex bodybuilder I had a relatively good nutritionist to at least had a degree in chemical biology I had a good physical therapist but I didn't really have like I was my coach at the end of the day I was there to perform it so I go to Jiu-Jitsu coach wants to go hard and then you go kickboxer you're going to go like butt kick butt so you don't and then you know and you know nobody's strength coach and nutritionist on different pages so I think just understanding that everything has to work together which I didn't really understand what I'm saying is it you kind of had to pay the path because when a guy like you was doing all that stuff with a real legitimate drink Edition code nutritionist your time I'm not that many but I got to be around good people like Randy Couture Chuck Liddell those were kind of guys I got to hang out something like you're doing now for the UFC performance Institute which is very meaningful for young Fighters me you really do get a chance to give back with your experience and your understanding of the right way and the wrong way the mistakes that you've made his huge I mean that's the whole that mean that's all Genesis count from for my involvement in the P I like 10,000 mistakes I made you're going to make mistakes too but you don't need to make you know like 25 years old all things around so long are Spore changes all the time I figured he was talking about it but you know even the guys fighting 10 years ago probably couldn't compete with guys fighting to that you know what I would say is well and is not only for the Fighters first is a huge results were the best piece of technology we have is the door handle that leads from my office to office right now set to bounce ideas off to essentially beta test things from a thought process perspective and he's a huge part of the performance Institute philosophy because we can use and call upon his expertise away from people already doing MMA I wanted Combat Sports everybody that's done it has done Judo boxing on an olympic-level they've done Combat Sports but I wanted like a fresh set of eyes coming from a different you know just as you know cuz I know really good anime strength coaches I know pretty good and I met you know you know good and but get that fresh set of eyes your nutrition actually was a little different because the rest of the world does not understand a weight cut for an MMA fight it's not like it it you know we go to exercise should any high-level facility and that you said my body weight men compete on Saturday like no don't just fighting Highway class you know good but get that fresh set of eyes your nutrition actually was a little different because the rest of the world does not understand a weight cut for an MMA fight it's not like it it you know we go to exercise should go to any high-level facility and that you said bodyweight men compete on Saturday like no don't just fighting Highway class</div>

Argument with a kid you know like a sixteen-year-old kid and they got into a fistfight you know the kid came back like an hour later with the kitchen knife and stabbed him. and it's like God. It also takes a different type of person to eat to kill I'm on the I'm not the kid in the hoodie was just ready to pull the trigger and punch somebody like I'm not I grew up in a way where it's like going to talk with while you wait till they throw the first punch which is terrible strategy but that's where the way that I always was always like fist fight in the parking lot with your friends you want to really hurt each other it was a video game he went out back in the parking lot and beat each other up the two minutes that was that Buckeyes are you now willing to kill somebody over whatever just an argument to take their life completely without any just leave it do they lose sense of the repercussions of it as well which is sort of like that's something that I think would separate most people and go I go I want to go to jail just cameras a giant chunk of it is how they're but like what experiences they have growing up like what happens at male abused are they beating around a lot of violence what are they exposed to and then how much more likely are you to commit that Vibe too because that on to the next person that's really what it is minutes. The vast majority mean it's not it's not a shocker that's so much violent crime comes from poor neighborhoods it's it's like it makes itself and makes itself and lure someone like a virus I agree and I was extremely abusive emotional abuse verbal abuse always the threat of violence at the drop of a hat it was I was always immediately to I'll beat the s*** out of you if you don't do what I say even if she wasn't being violent and I do the opposite do you know with my son do a little must have never even spank him I don't respect my hand I've never I've never even really yelled at my son and I don't think that I got lucky and have a good kid I do have a great kid but I think it's a direct route you know listen to me not being aggressive with him at all and I talked a little conversations with them don't you tell them what to do take two or three times and it's easy to lose your patience but was you realize what you're you know that's why I'm a piece of s*** out of me on the first one to admit it but the only good thing I do I think it's the fact I'm creating a good little person he's a really good sweet person I think is going to be you know all the s*** that I didn't really have or you know all the good qualities that I think I like I could have maybe had if I was raised the right way I'm trying to give my son and I think that's a really big responsibility and that's why you know you'll I feel bad when you see like real Vine like that like f****** people that are like being really you are dude I know that person experience some crazy s*** you know I never lived in the worst neighborhood in the world but I lived in Shady one for quite a bit and leaving the place called Jamaica Plain outside of Boston for about a year and my parents knew immediately we had to get the f*** out of there and we only thing we stayed maybe a year a little over a year and we got out of there quick as we can but there was like a lot of break-ins lot of it was lower-income it wasn't terrible it wasn't like a gang violence shoot-'em-up typeshift there's a lot of criminals yeah a lot of shady Shish from Florida and get out of here teenage boy scary time and it was all these kids that were just there were so that they would do dirty f***** they already doing drugs there he's going to make a plane low-income white or and Puerto Rican like but mostly that mostly white and Puerto Rican was a lot of it just a lot of cigarette smokers at 13 kids are smoking cigarettes already there drinking all the time I swear to God it like a great Fitzsimmons lives in a house with two parents were Chainsmokers in an apartment and they never open the windows in the winter it was like you had to read a book and you know that my mom was 20 like that is crazy over you in the morning when you started with it if you start at 20 if you started 42 active raising another human being it just changes who the f*** you are they just does everything switches and gets weird and then you're like oh I'm responsible for shaping your life and Italy's helping to shape your life and if I do a good job you'll be a good person you'll go out there and you'll make more good people and you'll meet good people just really what everybody wants at the end of the day ever the act of raising another human being it just changes who the f*** you are but just does everything switches and gets weird and then you're like oh I'm responsible for shaping your life and Italy's helping to shape your life and if I do a good job you'll be a good person you'll go out there and you'll make more good people and you'll meet good people really what everybody wants at the end of the day everybody want</div>

Changing their their drug policy cuz it was funny listen to this old dude on just for the for the funk of it as listen to AM radio talk radio and this old dude was talking about how they their they're going to decommission some of these drug-sniffing dogs cuz they do use them on the lot like traffic stops and Virgo medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just f****** putting his dogs down while they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs when you hear about pot that's making its way no place like you talk you know principal you realize God damn pot is really you can't stop it now your jeans out of the bottle is here the revenues and you Grandma feels better got me out that the Alzheimer's the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing it in a different time and they they look it in terms of like how many police jobs are going to go away by how many dogs are going to be decommissioned so they're like it's not really my problem take me seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know I don't use we was using topical CBD oil to take CBD four wheelers for having my special to f****** dope but I take it daily I take the oil just because you know apparently all of the benefits that it has within your body back in homeostasis would make me feel better and getting back and I don't know the f****** effect I smoke weed everyday you going to another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD to 1 gram of THC like that it's one part wasn't whatever milgram's you have its but like it's 10 mg CBD 10 milligrams of weed as well it's potent anti-inflammatory benefits than just smoking it smoking it does something for you definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better topical I was using it was good but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to take but this people a lot of people find it did they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason my aunt cuz my anti-drugs and if I told her the TV to his Drive Hampshire G wouldn't take his better brightest and I gave it to her for her that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD and has no psychoactive properties this and it's not going to do is for some folks and it works a little bit that way with me it alleviate some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's that's why I smoke weed to my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time do ya New York regular beer for every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they f****** they look like they're about to piss f****** with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have announced that I just bought for my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and the garbage can give you a ticket just hang tight relax with the cops on you this is just to keep you calm and get you the Patty wagon this all the process when they put you in a Paddy Wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids let me put in a Paddy Wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed drunk kids college kid pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody still at paddy wagons and create criminals just career criminals out of teenagers</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> we actually change ourselves as a species there's a subset of ideas is known as Jean Cultural Revolution and the idea is that we create certain kinds of cultural environments those kind of cultural environments Advantage certain ones of us making those of us that are born with certain abilities better off which then leads to those environments being created even more let me give you some example of that the most famous example of this is something on his lactase persistence how many people not but half the world's can adults can drink milk the other half cannot they get lactose intolerant in our ancestral State actually off till about ten thousand years ago only babies could do to just milk only babies had milk babies would suckle at their mother's breast and have milk and then they be weaned and then it would never drink milk again they'll be no milk to drink if there was there for reason for any adults to be able to digest lactose which is the principle sugar in milk because it was no lactose in your diet if you didn't encounter melt so human beings were able to digest lactose when they were babies they lost that capacity all human beings when they got to about two or three or four or five when they win they no longer able to just milk to the enzymes in their body were programmed as it were the only work when they were infants well about between 3 and 9000 years ago in multiple places in Africa and in Europe human being suddenly domesticate animals we domesticate milk-producing animals like cattle and sheep and goats and camels and now all of a sudden there's a supply of milk around us because of our cultural Innovation because of the thing we invented we created the domestic breeds now we have milk now there for those Among Us who were mutants were born with the ability to have our lactase the enzyme that digests lactose persist into adulthood this is known as lactase persistence those of us who had that we have a survival Advantage because we could have another source of calories that the rest of the people in our group couldn't consume they couldn't drink milk like we could and we had a source of unspoiled water during times of drought we could drink milk everyone else had to drink this filthy water that they didn't have access to so those Among Us who have these qualities could reproduce better survive headed and survival Advantage it turns out that this has happened several times is when well-documented I'm yours because of Acumen cultural product we have evolved to be a slightly different genetically and it doesn't stop with cows I think that when we invent cities about over 5,000 years ago so we leave event agriculture about 10,000 years ago debated exactly when we invent cities are between 5 and 10000 years ago we start having fixed settlements earlier you and I were talking about population density and having to live with other people which is not our ancestral state we always lived his group is socially I think that is we invent cities people with different kinds of brains are better able to survive in cities so now that we've invented cities where advantagene people with certain kinds of brains and therefore I think in a thousand or 2,000 or 5,000 years just like the milk example will be different people as a result of something we humans manufactured that we made and I could keep giving you examples of this Thursday in the book I have an example other example about call the sea Nomads if they live in the Philippines these are people who don't live on land they live on houseboats that sale around the Pacific for thousands of years they've had this lifestyle and they died for their food dive so they forage on the seabed they are the world's best free divers they spend hours per day underwater they can hold their breath longer than anyone else and they they do it nothing except with weights and wooden goggles they dive down into the seabed and Fortune they hunt underwater with Spears okay they hunt underwater with Spears mind-boggling and but they have evolved have different spleens and different oxygen metabolism than you and I sold those among them that could survive the Dives fed their families made more babies and now we think this happened 2000 years ago there different the ones that couldn't died so their invention of a seafaring way of life this happened 2000 years ago there different the ones that couldn't died so their invention of a seafaring way of life their invention of a way of living at Sea the boat technology that the spearfishing technology the invention of those Technologies creates an environment a cultural environment around them which modifies natural selection and change the kind of genes of those people have</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you a lesson and Inn Express something in a way that makes you reconsider your own ideas you hold sacred I mean I'll give an example when I when I am at my wife 30 years ago I I wasn't pro-death penalty but I was I was house have neutral to the death penalty I would be like you know Ted Bundy two states and put him to death and I had all the kind of conventional reasons or I didn't really care he's a vile person he killed all these people eat them if the family will get any relief it whatever that's fine I had some concerns cuz I was a statistician about conviction of the innocent and I support the Innocence Project and I am very concerned with police brutality I have for years been Advocate there the racializing of police brutality is vile and and abhorrent and must be firmly resisted I think that I think the the the prosecutorial misconduct the way people are prosecutors lie and put people in Peru y'all there been many many cases of people on death row who are innocent. Should offend our conscience so even back then I had some concerns about the death penalty because I because I I recognize that you know we can't be perfect we're going to convict some innocent people and also let some guilty people go free that's not as bad as killing good putting to death the innocent but they're both bad so I had that concern about the death penalty the death penalty now for many reasons not just the statistical reason but also I think it's immoral I don't think the state should put it I think we can rip deprive you of Liberty I think we can make sure you're not a threat to society we can block you out for the rest of your life but I think we the state should not be taking people's lives in that way it's very strange will we we have a car serial state stalinist Russia and we have very long prison sentences which are nuts you don't need them for deterrence Ashley for non-violent drug laws for non-violent offenses should have much shorter we should have more we should hire certainty of punishment higher fraction of people who actually commits a crime should be fine but I think we should we could cut in half or less that the duration the senses I think you'll be able to deter criminals from doing things with a 3-month sense if they are very confident that they will be convicted caught where's now we have a system where most are not convicted like this jussie Smollett thing which is just ridiculous in the news and it was only a tiny fraction are convicted director and writer by the name of David Simon who I consider a friend he did the wire he was a showrunner for a bunch of other very famous wonderful TV programs and he started his career actually as a reporter in in Baltimore he was a beat reporter and then went on to become a writer to the wire and so forth and he told the story actually at Yale to students about how he had just come back from Summit President Obama was still president where he was trying to help the students to see but you could find common ground with your political opponents and that you need to listen to them and talk to them in order to find that ground and so he told the following story he said I just came back from Camp David where there was a meeting about how to reduce incarceration in our society and he said the Koch brothers were there and the students all hist and Newt Gingrich was there in the students all his tests and a bunch of liberal people were there the students were really happy about that Municipal why did you go how could you associate yourself with those evil people and he said look you said the conservatives want to reduce incarceration because it's expensive the Liberals want to reduce incarceration because it's unjust and the Libertarians want to reduce incarceration because of Liberty that's why they shouldn't be able to vote common our society with with incarceration a larger fraction of our population is incarcerated we deprived after you paid your debt to society we often have these these we deprive you of your right to vote which I think is wrong you paid your debt to society should be able to a crimes you don't let these crazy cases which offend my conscience I know a guy who got charged is already registered sex offender cuz he urinated outside in the South urinating outside that's not such as abuse or you know you have these Romeo and Juliet laws which are not in every state now thank God they are not in every state you know you have a 16 year old boy in a 14 year old girl that there had to be exceptions for that kind of sexual prime yeah they're exchanging sexually explicit images they should not be considered sex offenders for the rest of their lives that are not so I'm so I guess so all of those things is not like a huge fraction of people in prison with extremely long prison sentences compared to any many European countries for the same crime and it's costly it's unjust it's ineffective I think we should change the policies on this and maybe we will there's also the idea of reforming them it's it's they're not using all the tools within their disposal they're not really getting a good attempted it and I just don't think it does anything other than make their life hell for a short. Of time with we're hoping we hope deters them from doing future cry while they're different there's the Justice there's deterrence their safety right like a wild criminals that we put in jail we need to do that I mean to not interested in being killed by somebody who killed someone else jail for a while 20 years something about time for murder murder think they think 20 years is enough European European standards are about 20 years actually and the there different things like if you want to deprive them if your if your vision is there being punished for the killing of a life therefore they surrendered their life is certify for now I kind of Justice you would they would be the rest of their life since you know and you know we can debate whether that's the reason we're not if you if you want to provide a public safety reason people off in age out of their violence so a lot of men typically differ time we'll see about men who do these things by the time they're in their forties or fifties they're much less violent testosterone decline as they get older and wiser they're not interested in criminal in that kind of criminal Behavior many of them are not so that does that suggest you don't need life sentences for murder and I think it also depends and we have her gradations of murder you know we have like the impulsive stop that intent matters of plant on this map depravity matters all of these things are are factors and I don't think we should have a one-size-fits-all incarceration for murder yes that's my opinion what do you think I think it depends entirely on the circumstances if two men are engaged in some sort of a dispute and one whines up killing the other one that's a big difference between that and someone breaking into your house and killing your daughter yes a correct and I also think even in that like I I really am opposed to these a stand-your-ground laws I think those are if you have them to avoid conflict and to avoid you or not I would prefer is a state to require that you walk away even if it makes you feel embarrassed then give you the right to kill someone for offending you in those those videos of the of the guys and that was shot the guy on his knees and up in the parking lot in the I forgot what state it was like not long ago or two ago they got into an altercation in the parking lot threat to him and he was he was not prosecuted on the stand-your-ground argument which is not why was he on his knees he was I forgot to say don't shoot me or something so it was it was crazy didn't get prosecuted I don't think so we can look up the fact that several cases there were several cases like this but you know this was years ago was 30 years ago now and he told us the following story he he said there was a Japan and the students were coming to the dojo and there was the the best student you know and then all the other students and they were walking through the village and they passed the approach to horse that was on the street from the rear and it startled the horse and as the horse reared up and kick its leg the the best student instantly did it a kind of avoidance and the horse's leg August suits were amazed at his ability and they've get to the dojo and they tell the Sensei this is my Sensei telling me this story telling all of us this story and a those students get to this the dojo on a tell that the sentence story Marvel at the ability of this master-student to definitely avoid to strike and the sentence very angry and they don't understand why why is he so angry he said if you were a really good student of mine he would have walked on the other side of the street he would have avoided a horse halter no the real wisdom is to avoid avoidance of conflict in the first place there's no reason to seek out conflict and so on the stand-your-ground laws you know it's the choices either you just avoid the conflict you know someone someone's word you or called you an a****** or was unreasonable jerk that doesn't give you the right to kill them so anyway I don't know how we got to this as well. The penalty exactly so I just don't know how much of a deterrent it is locking people up I just I'm not sure I'm not really sure if that actually stops people from doing things I think it stopped some people I think there been academic research on this real Rehabilitation other than personal choice I mean I think that the real Rehabilitation comes from someone making a personal choice to never be that pretty that way for most of them your ear your being locked up with a bunch of Pardon criminals and you your that's your European but you're not suggesting we haven't decided which when you commit violent acts we do nothing no not no no Mom suggested struggling with this don't don't be near a f****** horse I want to kiss you very smart yeah I get out of there I'm a big believer in avoiding conflict I'm the first guy to go eat bucking horse it won't be a kick you very smart yeah I get out of there I'm a big believer in avoiding conflict I'm the first guy to go weed eater</div>

I don't know about that man he said basically that the experience he just stays mellow and calm and then if things go wrong it's really bad like you like you can't you don't want to be freaking out yet like it so he doesn't divers no panic when you're underwater and Brian lose your way my friend Donald Cerrone he's a UFC fighter told about being trapped in a cave that are watering out when it was oxygen yeah horrible crazy scary story you have to those guys are all so different either either they're born that way or they learn to be that way you have to keep calm because when you and I lose our cool and start hyperventilating or oxygen consumption skyrockets Bryant and that the opposite of what you need to do in that situation actually what he talked about you know like trying to stay, but battling the demons yeah yeah yeah you're something I watch the movie it would have talked to him he got an MRI and they said that the kids is okay but isn't that possible that that's just through development of constant pain while you're in a situation like the capacity to shoot back when you're being shot at keeping your call yes moving positions you know yeah he's not panicking but it is also the case that some people for example the most famous study in this regard was a study of London taxi drivers London taxi drivers can go from any point the city to any other point the city is called the knowledge they have a mental map of the whole city and it's freakish it takes years to be able to know how to navigate the city with that. tens of thousands of street names and they can do it by like dead reckoning they scan this is a paper about 10 years ago they brain scan these guys and they had I forgot which region of the brain but they had through learning it is felt modify that we each other brain it was possible Holland is like you say that he'd learned to be this way there's a big deal isn't firing because he trained himself but I handled Honnold Honnold sorry this way because he learns more likely I think that he Usain Bolt that was born with the credibly by preponderance of fast-twitch fibers in his legs so he can run like the wind and He Reigns as well you have both right good at least require both innate ability plus training yes and I think Donald is probably like that he's probably born with an amygdala doesn't fire so much and he's an amazing climbers. Garry Kasparov I know Gary yes I would love to see that yes she's at the doctor who studied is specifically looks at people that go under high stress and look for those kinds of has been doing that since 2005 I guess and she goes Its pages long this whole thing about his brain but it is unusual this is one thing this kid is in a life-threatening absolute fatality situation because every day I know all day I know I mean he lives in a van and just climbs yes it's what he does is really fast and yes it is it isn't it's amazing it's amazing so I mean I don't know I've never met him I admire him very much and I love this like you said at the beginning it's very important to have skills this kid is in a life-threatening absolute fatality situation everyday all day I know I mean he lives in a van and just climbs yes it's what he does is really fast and yes it is it isn't it's amazing it's amazing so I mean I don't know I've never met him I admire him very much and I love this like you said at the beginning it's very important to have skills</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> my whole head is covered with sweat and they come over white my headlight click how old are your kids and you have you have three daughters a ten-year-old a real live longer with daughters if you only few few plot dad Survival on the y-axis and fraction of female children on the x-axis survival is slightly longer for men who have higher fraction of daughters drive you to your f****** great as you're so goddamn crazy there's lots of theories as to why it happens but I think in that isn't that one of them it's framed a bit more scientifically I'd be terrified that she does just lighting things on fire blowing up buildings yes a problem that can be well we could get onto the whole generation I'm not sure we want to but I think the boys are responsible a let's talk about chimpanzees it's easier male chimps do most of the violence about 95% of the violence and murders are committed by male chimpanzees and most of the victims are males and you know I think it's there is no doubt that biology plays a very important role in male proclivity to file free samples so they are trouble so boys can be a problem that way and I think the many ways in which a society are of the cultural traits that we invent their purpose is to shape and guide those Tendencies to violence to kind of mitigate them but we don't have domesticated ourselves if you look at if you compare dogs to wolves and domesticated cats to wild cats from which they descended or a guinea pigs to the wild guinea pigs from which they descended or or horses to to the wild horses with citizen if you again and again you compare these couplets these pairs you find that the domesticated version of these animals that are much more Placid much more peaceful they also tend to have floppy ears they have piebald fur so guinea pigs and dogs and cows all have splotchy black white and brown fur why is that the animals from which they evolved didn't have those Tucanes blotchiness so and they become much more peaceful if you compare human beings and but they had those animals were domesticated by humans like I deliberately allowed the reproduction of this member of the litter and not that member because this member was was was nicer and so across time we evolve a more domesticated Shinobi ancestral species so we get you know we get my miniature dachshund from a wolf like the one like the kind of things that were photographed out in your Studio Gear crazy transition now if you look at humans and you compare us to to the Vietnam to our ancestors or to other primates for all the world that looks like we have been domesticated we are more peaceful and Placid we have sex outside non dr. sacks is another thing so these domesticated animals will have sex even when it's not time to reproduce we we are Tails we don't have tails anymore but our tails to get shortened there all these features that we have these these behavioral qualities and these physical properties that we have our are we going to feminization of our faces are jaws become smaller like if you look at you compare these two domesticated animals to their domesticated ancestors the domestic affairs are less violent so we lose a lot of the traits that physical and psychological traits associated with violence but there was no one that domesticated us so the theory is the question is how how did that happen and one of the theories of disgusting in in Blueprint and that's Advance by other scientists this is not my work is that we self domesticated and that what happened over the century over the Millennia over millions of years is weaker individuals in our groups when one individual became too autocratic and too violent and too powerful they banded together and kill that guy and so over time we were killing the more violent members of our species weeding out those people and therefore the gene pool change across time and we self domesticated we are more peaceful today then we would have been because we domesticated ourselves and this is the arguments it's also made to help explain the origins of goodness actually origins of cooperation because you had to take a few good Yentl to kill the bad person that's running everything that's evil correct is that the right occur in bonobos which is very weird isn't it together so similar to regular chips yes but they're not the same thing you know so yeah they're very conscious species that's exactly right and and and and bonobos are felt to be a self domesticate a chimpanzee so the symbols of bonobos or chimps as as they say dogs are the wolves and but there was the dogs we domesticated the bonobos self domesticated is the theory do they know why or how do weeding out killing them or what we know must have happened is that the nicer guys must have been able to more offspring so the gene pool change over time because of the differential success of the of the of the nicer guys now people have looked at this even in human societies they look for instance there's a study I talked about in the book of different Pathways to reproductive success amongst its Imani which is a group in Amazonia and other societies are similar so you can either be like big and strong or you can be charismatic and have useful and both ways you have more children so they're these competing ways in our species of enhancing a reproductive Fitness are you where I'm supposed Keys work at with baboons that's a fascinating case right cuz they were studying baboons in Africa they would eat from Human garbage and a bunch of them got sick and died and it turns out that the most violent and ruthless of them got sick and died in the change the entire culture of the baboon tripod I don't know that story each other and being kind to each other and a different kind of and I know though I I'm now that you reminding me I'm a little familiar with that particular study I didn't know that it started with garbage however that he has a coincidental extermination of the more violent members of the troupe yes yes oh they were removed from the gene pool and it changed the entire culture to the point where Generations later they were still using the more peaceful ways of all the gene pool and it changed the entire culture to the point where Generations later they were still using the more peaceful waves at all</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> why is natural selection never given us an immortal species have you ever thought about that yeah yeah I've never reached a conclusion but I always figured you live long enough especially up until recent history only long enough to recognize it was all crazy Hustle not appreciated a creature that live forever but why should we die imagine that the two different kinds of things that can kill you in transit causes an extrinsic causes so things inside your body that result in you dying defect disease isn't so forth or outside your body like accident lightning strikes trees fall and you just died and so forth because it's impossible to eliminate all extrinsic causes because some people are going to die from accidents it would be it inefficient from the point of view of evolution to evolve to be immortal because we would have all this capacity to be immortal we would have these bodies capable of immortality which lets they would be a belushin early demanding like to evolve anything like and I or a brain or strong any any qualities lactase rightly like we talked about earlier you you don't have lactase persistence into adulthood because immediate solution doesn't waste anything there be no reason for that so there be no that there would there were there would be no reason the argument goes to evolve immortality because inevitably some people would be killed eventually by accident anyway so unless you can create a world in which there are no accidents or no extrinsic causes of death it would be inefficient from an evolutionary point of view to evolve in mortality So Def the reason naturally some people think is that the reason we die naturally is that there are unnatural causes of death in the world like accidents if we could eliminate the unnatural causes so that nowhere no no time ever we ever killed by trees falling or lightning strikes her things like that then actually over time we would have evolved to live in definitely listen to Theory crazy idea is fast any but do you think that nature had that sort of sort of foresight but that's how natural selection work think about like if I suddenly magically transform your body at Great expense to make you capable of immortality and then two days when I get hit by a bus I've wasted all that effort but if you only done to one person you wasted that effort if you did did it to other people you have the potential to create an incredibly wise person with a thousand years of life and experience and education Earn to Die he also have died so everyone eventually would like for these expensive causes so for a lot in the model if it's not perhaps if in fact in fact there's a world in which you never struck by lightning never hit by a bus number for tree branch then then the theory is that we would have evolved to be Immortals the life that you live you're inevitably going to get killed by extrinsic causes yet and if you extend that life to A Thousand Years and it's absolutely going to get killed by extrinsic causes if you extend that life to A Thousand Years and it's absolutely going to happen yes there for why bother that's just living in a bubble just terrified of the world on rocks landing on your head</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> unlock me to a lot of work in my lab on AI what about sex robots like what rules should they give for sex robots and how much could that damage interpersonal relations yes that's a great question that's exactly the right question in my view so our concern with sex robots from a liberty point of view should not in the slightest be whether you enjoy sex robot your business. Do what you want jacked the problem is with set WhatsApp backup from the left about to look back at 6 children talking to Alexa wants to make your child's experience easy and pleasant and as part of the programme of Alexa because they want to make Alexa the obedient servant of your child it doesn't require a child to say please Alexa would you you know play the music for me and your child can be as rude as she wants to Alexa and Alexa will do what you want be concerned about however is not your child interaction with Alexa would you should be concerned about is what your child is learning from interacting with Alexa that then she takes to the playground and now she's rude to other children so Alexa is corroding our social fabric Alexa in this example is making children rude to each other so our concern is not so much do we make do we make you'll like asimov's Laws of Robotics do we program you true the first law we don't want the robot to through an act of commission or Omission armor allow human to come to be harmed it's that we're concerned about how the robot in interacting with you might cause you to harm others the robot the robotic intelligence create these externalities Cascade effects so in the Alexa example we might want to regulate the programming of devices that speak to children not because we want to deprive your daughter of the right because she wants but because we recognize that that robot is going to cause your daughter to be rude to other people is it really you really think yet what's the weather that that would make your story but surely I think it will contribute so this is an example it's not like I'm not arguing that Alexis should become ornately think it's so novel two kids that they know it's not a person I don't think it really right but we're using these examples to build that play the emergence of sex robots which will surely appear in the next 10 or 20 years will will be a fantastic bun they think that you'll be able to experiment you'll be able to experiment with same-sex relationships for example group sex you might learn to be a better lover so he can practice the robots and therefore you would be more experienced when you were having sex with real human so they said that you can't get venereal disease from sex robots you can't hurt their feelings so people think that the argument based on ethical grounds is that this would be terrific that this will be a benefit other people have the opposite opinion other people think that actually having sex with a robot for small is symbolically and and conceptually vile they think that you know what it did take sex and converts it into a kind of a machine literally emit machine like that you do function and they furthermore think that it would result in you in one having a kind of anonymous or impersonal interactions with humans softly the Nubian trained you know to let they want an obedient you know partner for example I don't have to stand on this like I don't know which way it's going out in a way I don't have to stand on it because what I'm interested in recognizing is that when we talked about having allowing people to have sex with sex robots not allowing that's going to happen the focus of our concern should be not what is your experience in your bedroom when you have sex with a sex robot Our concern is a state like my interest I've known steak or control over what you're doing over there but my interest is in in once you have had that experience how does that change how you interact with other people and their I think just like anything else like you can you can make all the garbage you want in your house but if you start polluting the environment you're harming me so now I have a reason for intervening in your activities on your land you can't pollute your own land if that pollution runs off on and so the similar argument can be made or look at autonomous vehicles here's an example right now we have all roads almost all roads have just human drivers and in 20 or 30 years almost all roads will probably have only non-human drivers machines will drive in those autonomous vehicles probably can be yoked together they can communicate with each other so that you'll have like like trains of cars moving in synchrony like each of them will be communicating with you we buy cars and you'll have laminar flow where all these vehicles are smoothly moving and joining the highway leaving the highway and communicating on a city-wide scale slowing traffic down miles away because they anticipate with ar that will be a jam here if they don't do that and and I think that'll be great unless you looking forward to a time I mean I still like to take my car to a Speedway but you know drive itself with stick which I like but you know but in between we're going to have a world of what I call hybrid systems of Schumann driven cars and autonomous vehicles coexisting in a on a plane on an even playing and we need to be worried about that because these are autonomous vehicles when we interact with them are going to change how we interact with each other for example do we program the autonomous vehicle to drive at a constant steady speed if you're the designer of the car you might say G I don't want this car to crash I want the car to drive in a very predictable fashion and special Yakima to the car that's what can allow me to sell more vehicles but it may be the case that actually when people are in contact with such a vehicle they get lulled into a false sense of security vehicle never does anything new so much attention to the car in front of me is not paying attention so that autonomous vehicle has changed how I drive in a way that harms other people so maybe the programming of the vehicle should be to occasionally do erratic things to like suddenly slow down or speed up a little bit obligingly to stay vigilant and pay attention is I'm interacting with that car so that then when I go to another part of the highway when I interact with just humans I have retained that vigilance once again they lesson here is that it's not just about the one-on-one interaction between the robotic artificial intelligence and the human being it's about how the robots affect us in my lab we do many experiments in Social systems where we take a group of people and we drop online we drop a bot or in the laboratory with a physical robot and we watch how the presence of the robot doesn't just modify how the human interacts with the robot but how the humans interact with each other so we put a robot right there looking at us with its third eye would we you know when to change how you and I talked different that's the experiments were doing well clearly in the sex robot realm that's going to be a problem I mean we we see the difference between humans that have Point addictions they developed is very impersonal way of communicating with people and they they think about sex and the objectification of the opposite sex in a very different reason is very different way at 8 Flavors the way you yes it makes it difficult it can make it difficult for you to have normal sexual relationships in you come to see if if your expectations are are Guided by apart and dad is going to be radically magnified by some sort of artificial life-form that you created this indistinguishable yes you can have it indistinguishable sex partner yet it is you know some incredibly beautiful woman that is robot and then you are quite happy to change their spouses for a robot's I wonder if women are going to be as into it as men because I think women desire more emotional intimacy and I think I made on a scale than men do I I think I think the jury is still out on know what what the relative balance between men and women we might be surprised that that will be replaced especially given the societal expectations and women can Farm those in and out of bed can be sure so we could go both ways I don't I'm not prepared to make a prediction who's going to be better off in the gender debate with the emergence of sex robots Peabody's anymore that that's hundreds of years away but yes I think so I wonder I mean I don't know if it is I think if they start cracking the mountain China and they start giving birth to 8 foot tall Superman yes 12 inch dicks yes we're going to have a real issue yes the debate is how far in the future so I don't think we're going to start by using these Technologies to cure a monogenic diseases so you know like thalassemia for example so what diseases are certain immune deficiencies that disease where single Gene is defective and and those will be the initial targets but once we start with that eventually I think there will be people who will want to genetically engineer other people their box spring for example and modified them in a way that you suggest maybe not 12 inch dicks but may call Billy to run faster so far smarter than one of these side effects they showed with the genetic manipulation of these Chinese babies to eliminate HIV that they made him smarter unsurprisingly is anyone could predict the technology is not good enough to restrict the mutations to one reticular region of the genome so there were other changes in the genome in these children heard elsewhere rather than the targeted region which was to increase their immunity to HIV and we don't know what those are but doesn't kill those kids quickly we could make them better in some ways we have no way of knowing yet but I think their conclusion was that increase their intelligence I don't I think I have not seen those results and I think it would be premature it would be I'm smarter is going to get like 40% more clear so human being set up for a very long time they've been inventing when we invented weapons that was a technology that changed how we interact with each other so we have previously done this kind of thing I was invented a technology that chainsaw we interact with each other and I'm very interested in and discuss some of those applications I love to study history and I love to study like how crazy the world was 4000-5000 years ago a thousand years ago back in the future I got to take our understanding of the consequences of our actions are so different than anybody has ever had before we have just a Joe up a broader first of all we have examples from all over the world now that we can study very closely which I don't think really was available that many people up entirely recently you mean I'm sorry you're saying the examples are more numerous or capacity to discern the understanding of these over the world like this is like what do you've been telling you today about these the divers and others we just have so much more data yes and so much more of an understanding than ever before yes I love the idea that we are I mean I believe that this is probably the best time ever to be alive and I think that's probably I think that's true I think there's certainly a lot of terrible things that are wrong in the world today also true but I think that there's less of that and more good no I think that's right and but one of the argument that I make is this is a kind of Steven Pinker argument that your outlining which is you know with the emergence of I mean people are living longer than they ever have on the whole plant in fewer people in Starvation we have less violence I mean every indicator of human well-being is up and it's partly due or largely due in the recent last thousand years to the to the emergence of the Enlightenment and the Phyllis the philosophy and the science that was guided they burst about 300 years ago and 200 some-odd years ago and and culminating in the present and continuing so I think I think this is not just the kind of so-called the weakest view of history is not at the progressive sort of fantasy I think it's the case that these philosophical and scientific moves that our species made in the last few hundred years has improved our well-being however as we've been discussing today it's not just historical forces that are tending towards making us better off a deeper and more ancient and more powerful force is also at work which is natural selection its evolutionary and not just historical forces that are relevant to our well-being and we don't just need to look to philosophers to find a path to a good life natural selection has equipped us with these capacities for love and friendship and cooperation and teaching all these good things we've been discussing the good life across the world not just that that's contributing to our well-being this natural selection is literally why we are in this state now and why we are hoping this trend will continue yes and we will be in this better place 50 years from now 100 years from now you know you're given five fingers and an opposable thumb which allows you to manipulate natural selection is giving you an opposable thumb culture let you use a computer do you worry about the circumventing of this natural process by artificial intelligence that artificial intelligence is going to introduce some new incredibly powerful factor into this whole chain of events that by having sex robots and sex or are or robot workers yes things becoming automated I'm concerned I'm very concerned about how technology can affect our economy that these again these concerns were not the first generation to face these concerns that was similar concerns with the Industrial Revolution that workers were being put out of work when machines were invented nevertheless work persisted people still have jobs to do it was a disruption there's no doubt about it I think Google and the information revolution and these types of robotic automation are destructive they're going to affect how we allocate labor and capital and data in our society there's no doubt about all of that I thought you were looting to just to check if you were to the debate which I don't know the answer to on whether a I will know is are we going to face like a Terminator type existence where you know the machines rise up and kill us all or not and you do look very smart people on both sides of that debate and I read them all and like I would like he's right and then they'll be the guy that has the opposite and then yes it is Nuance but it's hard to know whether or not taking over our lifetimes right over hundreds of years yes you know is there time a thousand years from now when the human beings will say what the hell were our ancestors doing inventing artificial intelligence that they're wiping us out and I don't know the answer to that question I think there's an issue with the concept of artificial like artificial life artificial intelligence it's I think it's going to be a life is just going to be a life that we've created and I don't think artificial I just think it's a different kind of life I think that we're thinking of biologically-based life of the sex reproduction in terms of the way we've always known it as being the only way that life exists but if we can create something and that something decides to do things it's through the yes you that's very charitable of you and it's a people make that plain some people think that you know those machines in the distant future will look back at us as like one stage of evolution that dated in them that we are always said that we are some sort of an electronic caterpillar that he has know that it's going to give birth to a butter be added making a cocoon we don't even know we had doing that's a great metaphor I have a hard time accepting that cuz you're a person yes it's against my interests are so flawed all these things we've outlined all the problems with those are go away with artificial intelligence it deep philosophical questions I mean I don't think it's inevitable and I think if the single-celled organisms are sitting around wondering what the future going to be like where are we going to be replaced will they make antibiotics artificial life won't have those problems because it won't be emotionally based won't be biologically based it'll just exist that's a really good story we're so flawed why not are flies worth it but there is something wonderful about us and I think that would that wonderful creative quality is the reason why we created artificial life in the first place like this. It's the Egyptian you know the the the the pyramids or other kinds of artistic expression we seem to have had a desire to transcend death you know to make things that sure that look Scott's but weren't alive run forever so I mean I think in that regard I think you're quite right that it's not going to stop at Tennessee how can stop now you're you're very is I said charitable positive take on the claim and your analogy to single-celled organisms which are just you know but a fleeting not a fleeting they're still there but a phase in our Evolution you know is something I'm going to have to be thinking about it because it's disturbing honestly what's an objective perspective race which I really can't but if I tried to fake it I would say oh I see what's going on here yeah these dummies are buying iPhones and new MacBooks because they they know that this is what's going to help the production of newer more Superior technology has the more we consume it's also based I think in a lot of ways our insane desire for materialism is fueling this and it could be an inherent property of the human species that it is designed to create this artificial life and that literally is what it's here for and much like an ant is creating an ant hill and do you have some sort of a future plan as kids and 401k plan that will we're doing is like this inherent property of Being Human Being our curiosity or Wanderlust are all the other things all these things are built-in because if you follow them far enough down the line 100 years 200 years early leads to artificial life yes I think I think that's possible and of course we're not going to be alive to test that idea there's money will crispr and all this crazy s*** that's coming down and I'll come on Innovation people always happens if you go back every decade people saying just around the corner just around the corner these things are take forever they're very hard biological systems are very hard to engineer course the people who do that kind of work will often I think a lot of them engaging snake-oil in other than want to find the receiver or that I think it's entirely possible that there's a twenty-year-old listening to this podcast</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I bring I have a golden retriever we have a week. We have a white black yellow lab and Mastiff and pit bulls and German Shepherds no small we have a dachshund to you don't have small dog my oldest daughter has a tiny chihuahua my point being is that you can see if you get a dog from a breeder you really can see how they can cultivate certain types of behavior like a good example of my Mastiff who passed away this year he came from this guy who bred dogs for films and for police training and he was the most calm most chilled-out dog I've ever had in my life he was a giant dog is 140 lb but he entrust him with a baby I'm so cold like everything was like totally hate but this guy purposely anytime a dog showed any aggression towards people or any aggression towards dogs would let him breathe so how can anyone hear the stories like that or no stories like that and not then also think the genes play a role in human behavior children should I go okay this is not this isn't each of you starting today they were born this way. My f*****-up brain you know there's something in there like they're not to seem like they don't see how crazy I am eternally how hard are working things they how obsessive I get with think there is doing and is very weird and it's very weird because you see what how much of me is me deciding to be this person and how much of has no choice about half and half I would say overall an average across Straits how much do you think gets passed down through genetics in terms of inclinations like like the nature Edition yes about half I can you look at a group of people and some are more risk-averse than others about about half of that has to do with her jeans has to do with how they were raised or what environment they grew up in so you know there's a kind of an eight and it's too many of our qualities and you can shake them you know for example you can't you couldn't make me a musician unfortunately I have almost no musical talent I can dance I think I mean I think others would even say that I can do that but that's not just like I think I can do this but I can't but I have no musical ability whatsoever bring me I don't think to be a musician but so some of it is being born and some of it is is is taught for all of these qualities yes it's a fascinating thing to watch it emerge from a child isn't it yes it's apparent you see where we have adopted like I my mother had three biological children and I have two adopted siblings that come from actually a multiracial family have a black sister and a Chinese brother and my mother was an incredible human being she died I was 25 she was 47 and we have been foster parents my wife and I and in so and might we have lots of adopted kids and extended family in addition to biological kids and so you can see you can see the play of jeans you can see the extent to which kind of inherited traits that these people that we all have and you see the shaping by how you're raised and you know so both are important and why or nurture it's both always almost in every single trait actually well that's not the case with so many things in this life we wanted everything to be buying are yes it's it's not it's a total and an inability to see any gray and some people think and I think that's what your time by some people think that we are hardwired to like dichotomies to see you know male and female an up-and-down and good and evil and then left and right into simplify the World by find it and that we like it that is soothing to us to think that the world can be divided into two categories but in fact many times not always like up and down is sort of clear and it's harder that's harder to live in the gray yes I completely agree and that's why I've always been a poem and I think it's an incredibly foolish deny that people find comfort in denying they find comforted mean tribal define comprehend them yeah us vs them the classic yes yes it's foolish and dangerous actually now sometimes and or I'll sue them there are circumstances in which it's a different survival Anatomy you know it's me or him and or I'll sue them there are circumstances in which it's a different survival but I kind of worldview which says we are good they are evil as I we've been saying a different kind of ways and different parts of our conversation is I think foolish and wrong and ultimately self-injurious actually yeah so</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the capacity to openly debate ideas and to expose ourselves to ideas across the gamut and political ideas about scientific ideas so how are we going to win the battle against anti-vaxxers like how are we going to persuade people who believe that vaccines kill people for which there's no scientific evidence that they're wrong we could imprison them but that's Force we could vote which is sort of what we're doing or saying okay well you are minority group who believes allow you to control policy or we could try to win the Battle of ideas and persuade them ultimately that's the only path that's in my view that gets us to where we want to be yeah and just an honest assessment of the actual data like what we really know and understanding how the scientist come to the conclusions and put their the problem is these Echo Chambers were people get involved with online that magnify all these beliefs and you get radicalized also true people get involved these Facebook groups is anti-vax Pacer Facebook groups or you know all of the all sorts of different things and that's how these Flat Earth people get going yes they start listening only two people that are involved in this circle that don't have a greater understanding of the science involved in a cruise to the flat or cruiser Flat Earth right now if you saw it to the wall that's a new Wrinkle in the world flat earthers used to think that the water was shown falling off the disc of the earth you know like the edge of the Earth it was just a disc now the new theory that there's a nice wall actually it is it's kind of not falsifiable that is to say you could get on a cruise and sail to the edge of the Earth and you would find a wall of ice there so you Antarctica write the you don't get to an edge there's no way there's a nice wall is what they're saying now and are you aware of hashtag space is fake no I'm not I understand myself and that's in my space is a bunch of people that believe that space is fake okay it's not real. No real space and that there's like lights up there on that this is some sort of a plan by Satan it's a lot of it very biblical why the flat-earth stop is very biblical it has to do with the firmament and they use descriptions and depictions from the Bible yeah it's super Bazaar and it was really bizarre as when you listen to the YouTube videos or these discussions that are done by people that use words that are real they string them together correctly they have like full sense as they appear to be articulate it's very confusing if you're a dummy if you let you listen to those a lot of sense he's not but it sounds like he's making a lot of sense cuz using all these words that are correctly uses no arms he's saying it articulately there's it like it everything seems like like all my bags in it this man is exposing if you only listen to these anti-vaxxers they're making so much like all my God is giving everybody all sorts of ailments. How it does that which is not its uses as you say scientific words but it's actually not scientifically correct ride do you know what does this was then does That Was Then does that they lay out a kind of causal chain is false and then there's a problem of nuance in perspective because there's so many people that get vaccinated as hundreds of millions of people in this country billions of people worldwide and then there are instances rare appearances were people have real issues against vaccination well there is are somewhere they have real issues so for example there's some vaccines which are known to cause hurt neurological conditions rarely one of the million or one of 100,000 extension more commonly is a situation in which you have vaccination is so, and everyone is getting vaccinated and often that occurs near to An Occurrence of some other rare condition one out of a million you have 300 million exactly if 3 million 1 million people with an issue is a big deal with 300 million people yes you easily could have 300 really big case it us you know 300 cases website and then you bring those in front of people and it's 298 more in his holy s*** you know it doesn't feel good if it's your child but when we look at the greater perspective of humanity and you say we'll listen you don't wanna bring back smallpox you don't want your child to get measles babies can get measles when they can't even be vaccinated for it this is one of the reasons why we need to vaccinate children to make sure they don't get measles yet children's lives a woman yesterday who is an expert and she's a medical store in an expert in Victorian era surgery Lindsey fitzharris and she wrote this great book called The butchering art and in it there's all these images you should one of them she brought up of what smallpox actually looks like when I get it an expert and she's a medical store in an expert in Victorian era surgery Lindsey fitzharris and she wrote this great book called The butchering art and in it there's all these images you should one of them she brought up of what smallpox actually looks like when I get it</div>

Chicken and waffles and chicken tastes like cat litter compared to Roscoe's also sweet Chick-fil-A could try to get this out of here I get it I love it I guess I've been there it's great Roscoe's okay I'll have a reason why does an hour-and-a-half wait on a Sunday how long you in town for just a day maybe I'll be back though I'll be back in a couple of weeks when I was doing news radio 95 you left the Massachusetts no I went to the ER for a couple years then I moved out here and I moved out here 94 radio they got it for like you can order lunch and someone ordered Roscoe's Chicken what is this good it's so good and afterwards you better have nothing to do man we got to go into a food coma son anyway we get to that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> evolutionary origins of a good society when did you start this about 9 or 10 years ago and I at the time in my lab we were doing research on friendship we were doing research on on why people have friends it is actually it's not it's not difficult to provide an account for why we have sex with each other many animals are most animals are most animals reproduce sexually and it's not hard to provide an account for how or why we why sex originated why we reproduce sexually it's not hard to provide an account for why we are choosing our mates or why we are careful of who we have sex with but human beings don't just mate with each other we befriend each other we form long-term non-reproductive unions two other individuals to come we're not related that's very rare in the animal kingdom very few creatures do this we do it certain other primates elephants certain whales and that's mostly it so the question is why so I became very interested in my lab and trying to understand the Deep origins of friendship why would natural selection have equipped us with his capacity and that's at the station for an exploring all kinds of other things in our lives like why we love each other for example why do we why do we eat when we have sex with the person we tend to become a did that we develop emotional sentiment about them that's not an essential to having sex yet we do that and then I became interested in other kinds of good things like not as just love and friendship of cooperation and teaching teaching is another crazy thing you we take it for granted that we teach each other but think about this most animals are able to learn so little fish in the ocean learned that if it swims to the light it finds more food there so the fish then learns to temperature be Tropic to to move towards the light that's individual learning some animals develop was called social learning social learning is really efficient so if I put my hand in the fire I learned that I burned myself I pull my hand out I've learned something I paid a price and I'll learn something I could observe you putting your hand in the fire you pay all the price but I gave most of the knowledge it's almost as good as the fire the social learning is super efficient learning from others but we take it to an even further level we don't just possibly observe other other animals have our own species and learn from them we teach each other that is very rare in the animal kingdom where one animal sets out to teach another animal something so the book is it is is a is about the evolutionary origins of a good Society it's also a kind of response kind of pushback a long tradition in The Sciences of attention to the bad parts of our nature you know scientist in my view have for too long been looking at the origins of of murder and tribalism and selfishness and mendacity but but I think the bright side has been denied the attention it deserves because we have also involved to love and to befriend each other and to be kind to each other and to cooperate and to teach each other all these good things and I'll shut please don't confuse the thing your sister have one way to think about this this must have been the case that the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs we would not be living socially if my exposure to you harmed me on that if I came near you and you were violent to me you killed me or you gave me misinformation you told me to lie about the world then my connection to you would ultimately harm me that I should be better off living as an isolated animal so animals that come together to live socially there the benefits of that must outweigh the cost my living us living as a group so all this attention to the ways in which our interactions are bad that we kill each other that we steal from each other that we lie to each other that we have tribalism and all of these traits which we do every centuries replete with ours I'm not like panda I don't think like in Pollyanna like how everything's great that's not me but what is me is a kind of optimistic focus on the good parts of our of human nature and the recognition that does good parts Mustin Toto overwhelmed the bad parts well they certainly have to there's so many human beings that means obvious that this is working a propagated we're everywhere you're exactly right in the argument and that's disgusting the book The Way We have achieved the kind of social conquest of the Earth the way our species is is a spread-out occupy every Niche which is also very rare most animals live in one you'll Grizzlies live in in this part of the world they don't live in Amazonia and you do polar bears live in this part of the world they don't live in in Arizona everywhere and the way we have come to be do that is by the capacity to have culture to teach and learn from each other to accumulate knowledge so in the book I talked about a lots of this famous in a story called The Lost European explorer Files about how European explorers are lost they lose their supplies they wind up dying and but they're in an environment in which other people thrive and survive because they have learned to how to live there so we've spread out around the world and then don't there's a chapter in the book at the beginning about shipwrecks so so I have this one so I have this to do in the beginning of book is ice a look it's clear that our genes shape the structure and function of our bodies it is increasingly clear that our genes also straight shape of structure and function of our minds are behaviors whether you are risk-averse intelligent you are whether you are Wanderlust these properties are properties that depend in part on your jeans but it's also clear to me and that's what the book argues is that our genes shape not just a structure and function of our bodies not just the structure and function of our mind but also the structure and function of our societies and to really prove that what we would need is something known as The Forbidden experiment in the Forbidden experiment is an experiment in which we took a group of babies could never been taught anything were a cultural had no culture and Stranded them on an island and left them on their own to see what kind of society they would make when they grew up your how would they organize themselves socially is their kind of an innate society that human beings are for pre-wired to make an Essence unethical and cruel but actually monarchs for thousands of years have contemplated this experiment so Herodotus rights in about how one of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs wanted to know what kind of language would what was the natural language we had in us that we would speak if we were not taught a language so this Pharaoh it is said took two babies and gave them to a mute Shepherd to raise to see how the children speak when they grew up and nnn. Emperor Akbar attempted this there was a couple of European Kings that attempted this obviously we can't actually do this so what I do in the book is I look at a series of other approximation of that and one chapter is devoted to looking at groups of men typically but sometimes men and women who between 1500 and 1900 there were 9000 shipwrecks many more thousands of ships were lost at sea and in 20 of those cases we found 20 cases where at least 19 people were stranded for at least two months and there's a kind of here's a map of the tell you about but here's a map of the of the shipwrecks like these are that all over the world that where they occurred and when they occurred and how many people there were and and so then I I I got all the original accounts from the sailors from the people on the wrecks and all contemporary archaeological excavations of those racks were where they have been excavated and and try to understand what kind of society did these isolated cruise actually wind up making and there was some amazing stories that were found in there so they stayed for at least two months how many of them actually established a real civilization how many do they didn't forever no no one was stuck forever most of those Crews were eventually affect all of those Crews had at least one Survivor because if they had all died then I wouldn't be able to know about them Sailors were stranded in Australia I think somewhere in the Pacific and they managed to catch a big petrol one of those huge birds that you know like the Condor and and they they put a little note in a little tiny bottle and they tied it to its feet and this petrol 3,000 of miles and landed in Australia and was found with a note indicating where the ice stranded Sailors were and a ship was sent to go find them in and they got there but they had all died they were all gone so that you want this bird a bird choice you would communicate rather than each oh I think yes yeah for a little bit but there were many cases where everyone survived I mean there was one pair of cases that I was amazing to me in 1846 in South Auckland Island just north of a Arctica south of New Zealand the Grafton was wrecked on the southern part of the island camera Big Island was it's in the book of maybe the same 90 miles long or something or 20 miles long is 20 miles long on the southern part of the island five men are wrecked in the Grafton and on the northern part of the island the infraco Rex 19 men are wrecked on the Enrico all the Grafton crew survives the in bulk who's on the island at the same time they never encountered each other they're struggling for survival it's like a like an experiment like who's going to win and for various reasons anyway so the point is that in the book I start with a series of stories about how people come together to make attempts to make new civilizations I use the example of unintentional communities with with shipwrecks I have I looked and it intentional communities like communes and then decubitus and Israel and 1970s communes in the United States in the 19th century communes in the United States actually going back to Roman times has been groups of people who said societies f***** up I'm going to go and we're going to make it a cat you know we're going to start afresh I look at settlements in Antarctica of a scientists I look at the Pitcairn new the Mutiny on the Bounty I look at the Shackleton Expedition many many cases of stranded isolated groups of people trying to make a new social order and then I also use data from experiments we doing my lab we have the software where tens of thousands of people have come and play these sweet we can create these temporary artificial societies of real people or people come and spend an hour or two and we would his god-like way can engineer the society we can have a lot of inequality or little inequality or various other features and then we can observe what happens and I looked at all of that did all those stories and say look there is a deep and fundamental way that no matter what human beings make a society's or under fundamental principles about society which are as innate as the fact that you have two kidneys most people almost everyone or your pancreas makes insulin but they're very different all throughout the world right I mean there's totalitarian Society around the world just like you said to tell train societies there's people have different foods and they have different ways of dressing and there's enormous cultural variation and it's marvelous an interesting an obvious to anybody but I think we're missing the forest from the trees to me this is like you and I are sitting on a plane and we look it up a hill that's 300 feet and 900 feet and we say those are very different Hills but actually took a step back we would see that we aren't we were on a plateau and one was a mountain that was ten 300 feet and another was a mountain that was 10900 ft and actually there is much more deep and fundamental plate tectonic forces that are creating these two mountains that are very similar but we are just focused on The Superficial top so the argument in the book is that everywhere in the world people have friendship people love their Partners people cooperate people teach each other these are fundamental common principle shared by everyone even though there's also a lot of variation 10900 ft and actually there is much more deep and fundamental plate tectonic forces that are creating these two mountains that are very similar but we are just focused on The Superficial top so the argument in the book is that everywhere in the world people have friendship people love their Partners people cooperate people teach each other these are fundamental common principle shared by everyone even though there's also a lot of variation</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> with the infamous Halloween costume incident at Yale where explain that for people who don't know what happened cuz it's kind of crazy seeing it went National how to balance the conflicting needs friends that conflicting needs I swear everyone Sarah felt welcomed as we democratized admissions to our American universities I think we should have people from all walks of life have started moving into these institutions claiming them for their own which I think is appropriate but at the same time these institutions had wonderful heritage's of commitment to free expression and open debate and and reason as a principal for resolving our differences and and some of those values came into tension and so around the country there a lot of heat about this and I happened to walk into a propeller myself and and wound up in some challenging circumstances and you know I was not it was not the worst thing that's ever happened to me but you know it was in the top ten challenging moments I've had in my life let's say that's a very lawyer like way of describing exactly what happened do I struggle I mean you can tell the story if you want and then I can correct things but here's the thing is it's my job to be a teacher and I have taken responsibility for teaching young people and it is the case that many people lost their mind semi-longhair senses and and and the faculty Dennis early do what they should have done but but the thing is is that you know my commitment is my commitment is to is to teaching more generally and I don't want to be defined by that event I don't want that to be, the most important thing about me you don't have this book or this book that we're going to talk about that is an important thing in my life and Stan she ate my values it talks about what I think is important about the world so so I'm trying to be balanced about it just one thing that happened I did my best let me let me help out here because you're being so nice about the whole thing so people know what we're talking about there was an incident that was captured on someone's cell phone where you were standing here it was an hour of footage five or six different angles so it's viral but I want to emphasize that they were many people filming that day and an hour or more of the two or three hours I was out there as available but well I'm glad that you had the courage to do that though to stand out there and those kids but some of them were clearly there's something that happens when people become extremely self-indulgent when they know that they have this platform and they have someone who is in a position of authority and they get to hamstring them in front of the public and that's what I felt was going on just my understanding of human nature I knew what you was doing what you was doing by shouting and screaming this is our f****** home you know I will you know we're supposed to be safe here I was like oh I see what's going on she's throwing up the flag of virtue for all of her friends to see how amazing she was so she's putting on a show people do that it's it's it's human nature you handled it admirably and you stood there and you you just listen to her and you never yelled back and you never raise your voice and you remain calm but that's sort of environment where the children and I want to see children they're basically adults but acting like children this is one of the ironies it people that age you know can fight in wars and that's lose their lives then so I think it's a it's a digital chance was on the one hand it's right inappropriate to hold people responsible for their actions certainly if you're 20 years old you're an adult you're still growing you're still changing you're still learning I'm not the same man I was when I was 20 but you have to be responsible for folks who don't have a twenty-year-old in their life and don't remember what it was like yeah you're not fully-formed thing yet you're you're filled with chaos emotions and hormones and and then you're at school and you're probably away from the instructions of your parents for the first time and you know you're cutting loose and trying out new new ways of communicating that way it's it's a lot of it's a mess but Ma people felt horrified watching after you were subjected to that when you're being very reasonable and also what it all came about was your wife had sent out an email saying like hey maybe you should be okay for someone to wear a f*****-up Halloween costume. Maybe it's okay to Super someone to dress up like crazy horse we had out once in our political lives in general in our country right now and then also in the in the Nuance in the way we think about difficult topics so what Erica was saying was not that necessarily that she was not taking a position on any particular costumes like this is okay in fact maybe the costumes that would have defended the students offend her what she was saying was that she didn't think the university should be telling students what to wear right and she was asking students at this age at Yale do you really I want the university to be sending you guidance on what you are perhaps you should think about that your adult you're smart you're in an environment that privileges free expression do you really want to Grant the power to an institution to tell you how to communicate and people than I thought that she was saying that that she was defending a particular course of action what she was saying was you she was saying you students really want to surrender that kind of control over your own lives to older adults and apparently many students dead actually they wanted it so I don't believe they did I think they wanted absolute enforcement of what they thought to be wrong or right yes yes I think that's right so they they they they many but not all of the students I'm part of the motivation in in Erica writing that note was that many many of her students in effect many hundreds of other students felt infantilized by this policy and there have been a big build-up prior to that event including an article in the New York Times about these Halloween costume policies around the country and weren't they kind of ridiculous and so there was a there was a kind of a government where people were saying wait a minute do we really need adults to be told in this institution to spell given its commitments to open expression what to wear and keep in mind that there could be many ways in which the costume that offends you might not might I might not know why so let's say you have been abused by priests and you were the one of the rule said you shouldn't mock religion for example was what one of the one of the provisions so so a university-wide email went out signed by 13 people saying you know don't don't black people's deeply-held Faith Traditions but what if for the sake of argument you had been a up abused by a priest and you wanted it Halloween to dress up as a Catholic priest for example you're holding up a doll and someone else who had a different route was very deeply offended by that well who should adjudicate that like the role of the institution to come down and say yes you can express yourself this way no you cannot and so the argument was let young people learn let them sort it out themselves let them learn by talking to each other expressing themselves they know that hurts my feelings here's why it hurts my feeling another person to understand or I don't understand I reject that reason and answer to buy into a kind of commitment to free and open expression that actually I think ultimately serves the objectives of righteous social progress if we really want to do better in our society or in any society in my view we have to create an environment where we can talk to each other grad good-faith listen carefully make subtle distinctions and and Free People out to express what they're thinking so we can have a real Marketplace of ideas that's my commitment or my belief wasn't wonderful believe I love it I mean that's really I couldn't agree with you more more enthusiastically that's really that sounds like the best possible environment for growing up burning as long as you have someone to sort of moderate or someone to mediate if things go sideways a third-party mediator but you do need a shared understanding of of core liberal principles and these principles doing fluid as I mentioned earlier I kind of commitment to free and open expression a commitment to debate a commitment to reason so how are you and I going to come to a better understanding of what is true about the world we could fight writing in the stronger person would decide what's right we could vote doesn't seem quite right either you know 350 Cardinals voted the Galileo was wrong that didn't make Galileo wrong or we could use principles of reason and inquiry to try to appreciate the world together right we're looking out at the world saying that's confusing you know does the sun does the Earth revolve around the Sun or does the Sun revolve around the earth or does confusing should have King have money you know should have King have ultimate Authority state or is that not how we want to organize a state so we you and I look at the world and debate and think about okay and we exchanged reasons and we use evidence and ways of understanding and studying the world that to me is the only way to truth actually that some people will think that religion is a way to truth right they think that the truth is you know it's god-given for example now I am very sympathetic to religious belief systems but I don't think that's the way the truth that it's a way to some truth actually some wisdom but anyway so that's what our universities in our society are you birthdays are officially committed to that the models of our universities are all about free inquiry and pursuit of knowledge and our country is committed to that in our Bill of Rights right we have a commitment to free and open expression freedom of assembly freedom of religion and so forth and and those ground rules than in my view make it possible for us to have a better society and and there's more ice time I'm sure we will do that again I couldn't agree with you more. I just think we need more reasonable conversations and a screaming and less shouting people down and less stopping yes very weird because I don't remember it from the Vietnam War protests to what's going on today there was this long Gap where you didn't hear about University shut down speech yes this is fairly new this is within the last half-decade or so and in our society at large where you had the right wing was you're really interested in shutting down communist like if you were a professor or an artist who had far-left political views you were screwed yes and that's what what do you win if you would want went to a communist meeting you find out what it was all about us just to educate yourself people being criticized for following online people they disagree with yes across the political Spectrum from though I don't have any Monarch is someone my friend I have a friend who really believes he's so libertarian he thinks there should be private ownership of Roads I have a friend who really believes you still libertarian he thinks there should be private ownership of Roads</div>

It's probably has a lot of smell behind it so what you would do if you would put sweet smell herbs into the beak and so you would be smelling the Senate would protect you from those evil miasma yeah you know is that a real one actually have a real one from the 17th century there's a lot of illustrations of the plague doctor and he would have been wearing my hat he would have been wearing a cape leather gloves deserved and on display at the wound are you another one Thurston made us a German Museum of medical history how much they can do for you they had a stick as well that they would swear to poke the patient with so they wouldn't have to touch the patient and kind of have them turn over and they can you know yes you have the plague there wasn't much they could do for you we did not know what on the door and so the people would bring food and then you know put a basket outside of your window with a rope and you take until they do that until everybody was dead in the house worth of the plated past and they felt that you were safe to come out into the general population so there was an idea that these things were contagious but not again in the way that we kind of understand disease diseases being spread today would not know what was going on what people do. you'd like what is it on end in people say you know all the plate Max is so terrifying and I always say that good luck you're saying that you know the big carnival that they have every year it's becoming harder to do because of security reasons so you have like a huge population of the city wearing masks and covering their identities around downtown LA what would that attach to your face cuz look straps or some other example he was showing it look like it was creepy play doctor what what do you think that would be if you didn't know</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> AHS out loud I was friends with this guy that was in prison and in prison he learned how to play chess with his words you know with it it was just in his head and he was at the place that we used to play pool at in White Plains New York call Executive Billiards classic old school pool hall playing with this kid who is like a world champion chess player and his kid would come by and play pool is really young kid like like 15 16 years old and the two of them were sitting there playing chess with each other like just saying you know night to Queen to or you know whatever the f*** means and the guy would go stand up to the six but LaBeouf and they would go back and forth like this and I was like what I'm looking at it as a grid how are they keeping track with her f****** pieces are it was humbling very humbling was a very young mare that goes like 23 or 24 I got to see how f****** smart this guy was Getty still wound up in prison so it's like okay he was in the middle of the game once and he was gambling with this guy and this is the guy from prison was like super smart. Very sharp guy and he was talking to the guy was playing you said dude my wife told me if I don't get home by 10 she wants a divorce and 10 rolls around and yells out I guess I'm getting a divorce hours later he just racks the balls in the morning it was hilarious start playing my wife has been to come home by ten toes are weird times man growing up in like a suburb of Boston which was a really nice place I grew up in this place called Newton but the real quiet and quaint little Community to go from that 30ct pool halls of New York was really weird for me very very educational I got to see all these like Street Hustlers I got to hang around with these guys be friends a lot of homeless guy I had guys that were like a pool players that one up staying on my couch and nowhere to go into a couple of them and one of them who became my best friends guy named Johnny but it was like all these weird places gambling is weird strange places with these guys who like these semi professional players playing for hundreds thousands of dollars and just be a big crowd of guys all gathered around B12 in the morning and I'll be thinking these kids are older than me don't have families like what they doing this is a whole separate culture you know when you and underwear in a lot of ways meant a lot of ways was very underworld e i was obsessed with it two men just want to play pool all the time I wasn't very good but the guy that was around a very good was around a lot of guys are very very very good and you got to see liked the excitement of these wasn't just excitement that everybody was around was also the excitement that we were bending the rules we're all just a bunch of men hanging out at the Smoky place at 1 in the morning on a Wednesday and everyone is in it together we're all just in some way deranged Daryl licks you know some weirdos from society to configure their way to be able to be at this place at 1 in the morning on a Wednesday like why the f*** are you here man I do have responsibilities no one there had to be a responsibility when there was some sort of either a professional Gambler or they had like some of the guys from Fireman who they would they would put them on the 24-hour shifts and then we have a couple days off and just come to the pool hall and hang out with guys gamble so that means. Similar to stand up cuz I know you guys are like my f***** up friends that I like it's like too many people out there think that there's like only one way to live your life like there's a there's a bunch of ways to live life there's a lot the whole lot of world and everybody want you to think that way of living life is the way you should go about it too real tricky because they all want like the sort of confirmation bias they want they want you to confirm it went well tomorrow is a confirmation desire cuz they all want like the sort of confirmation bias they want they want you to confirm they want and what's more like a confirmation desire they want you to confirm that they're doing the right thing if you listen to them then you become happy and you know they they come up to you and him and I'm really really excited that you you told me how to do it this way because now I'm just living my life much better thank you very much</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you motivated you're so successful you got a lot of money you're doing okay everything you have seen you like Compass so many things so what what makes you go to the store on a on a Tuesday night to work on stand-up I don't look when you when you get success with something the best thing that it doesn't alleviate stress but it doesn't change the motivation motivation is always to create something that I like that I can be proud of that the people enjoy most importantly there's a bunch of people that watch my stand-up I got it I got to work at it I don't want to be an a****** I don't want to be that guy that you come to see my show and Hugo pair he didn't care he didn't try you don't think you I'm not going to be that we all have bad since I'll have bathtubs I'll try my best though I fucken try my best and I'm going to keep trying my best if I don't leave leave doubt in my own head I shouldn't be there if I do my best and just doesn't work I figure out what was wrong but if I don't do my best and doesn't work youfeellikeshit yeah that's true but I think that still feel like s*** even if it doesn't work and I did my best there was always kind of this Vibe of like I didn't try my best if I tried my best I would have crushed it but I didn't try my best so I didn't really fail yeah that's what I'm trapped that a lot of comics get into when they are in front of a small crowd no more. feel good about it and one time I was at the store and it was maybe like 12 or 13 people in the audience is the most real bad it was Paul Mooney's in the background and 12 or 13 people I'm just doing my act and movie starts laughing hard like a supportive laugh like he's with you hot laughing hard like a supportive laugh but he's with you hahaha in front of all those people</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> total different world and a lot of that is his deep knowledge and understanding something in you being a smart guy I think you'd get into it because you love pro wrestling so it's like there's like you have at least you have a mindset for watching guys do things to each other and manipulate each other which is half of what's exciting about pro wrestling right some guy pulling off some crazy move even if it's orchestrated still a crazy thing these guys are pulling off on each other yeah I like that more because then I'm like all their friends and they work this out together my problem is I know they're getting hurt and then not even really fighting right maybe it's there hitting each other for sure they're doing things to each other and slam each other it's all real those guys get banged up and they do it way more so if you can watch in the guy who's fighting in the UFC they have practices that they can control so if they know that they have a hurt you no back hurt foot in La Push It in inside python they won't they won't kick they'll do things will they work around whatever injury they have with her when they're in the camp you can't do that when dudes are throwing you some you got a bad back and sometimes f****** picking you up but those guys get beat the f****** talkin to Dallas Page and Jake the Snake two guys have had on the podcast which they were amazing and especially Jake stories f****** crazy man what a nice guy big giant nice man like just genuinely friendly and and happy that everything's going well for him now crazy but that's a rough business is my point like they rather Lycra grappling I feel like real grappling for like if I was going to tell a person like what would be safer for your body I think pro wrestling harder on you I can see that it doesn't knock you unconscious in the repeated acts of those those guys are getting it all the time yeah all the time yeah I know I go back and sometimes I watch some older wrestling and it really makes me cringe has it got a lot of guys taking all these chair shot straight to the face right to the face yeah it's okay Ken Shamrock take this one to the head that sound like a gunshot it was crazy dude what is it about people getting smacked in the head Tom segura's been sending me these Russian slap championships have you seen this yet oh my God these guys stand in front of each other and smack each other in the face full clip but some of them are doing a terrible job they're hitting with their finger at again left finger they're getting fingered and then the other guys that are basically doing like a ridge hand strike to your neck that clipping guys on the chin like this and they file through that looks like a slap but this is not slap this is like a karate chop their like going like that to the head and then it turned it mean it's way harder and then some guys are or they're doing like a Bas Rutten Palm strike they're hitting like this the doing like a right hook to the head like that brutal knocked unconscious I like to see it but just with like older black moms they would take these guys arms together and let them have an MMA fight what is an MMA fights arm wrestling competition and they were taped together it sounds so stupid you can't imagine that Not only was it real but that the guy who created it was one of the original creators of the UFC like it's such a crazy idea they tape these people together their arms are taped together they can't even move away and then when they say go they start fighting how to get an armbar Sky guy's arm up dude he broke his arm on the table 100% if that guy keeps pulling on that thing he gets his arm snapped people can get I love it dude but that's real and not this is the other one chessboxing this is a legit 1/2 I think they box first and then they play chess right and it goes back and forth so they keep going back and forth that's a good move but seriously if you need who that's also be really fun if there is people who are horrible at fighting but really good at chess just lay down that's also be really fun if there is people who are horrible at fighting but really good at chess just lay down</div>

It's always good no matter what motivations positive or negative if you want to prove somebody wrong you know or you just want to do just do better have a better path you know so it's oh so attainable for so many people so many people could at least be way healthier at least have way more energy at least I understand that feeling of just being like all day and every time I like burgers and fries and and like milkshakes and s*** like that if I really go off the deep end with my diet I feel like dogshit I feel terrible and his family I think I realized this is how a lot of people feel all the time Testament of what your body is capable to adapt to you know but once you start going the other way and started really getting healthy you really in your body becomes more sensitive to it you really are like oh I prefer not to cheat you know you do you still have that balance that I fun there's nothing wrong with an ice cream or something like that every now and again some sort of the they just think that your body has to be accustomed to getting what it needs that's what it is and for too many people to running on deficit so when your body just not getting it what it needs for long periods of time then you develop chronic inflammation and all sorts of other problems and this is what were people really suffering from you know there's they're suffering from a nutritional deficiency is probably lasted for years they probably never did you know some people they just did Goten 15-20 years without even thinking about their dying as you do dogshit you just eating stuff that doesn't have enough nutrients and your body just starts to get weaker is no way around just turn that starting solids eating healthy fish and and and you know some healthy meat and just take some vitamins to take some vitamin supplements real simple multivitamins can you sound like a whole thing athletic greens or something like it get your f****** Health online and it wants you do you like mentally so much better much clearer much happier much up here so hard though cuz we love mouth pleasure to the point where people poison their bodies to get mouth pleasure and it's constantly pushed in your face everybody always knows about all the time you have to make that effort you have to be able to want to cook at home and it's not it's not made easy and that's what I think we've come as a society less cool and less appreciative of effort you know you know but this also there's something really annoying about people that want you to eat healthy talking s*** about your diet while they're pouring fresh olive oil on top of the shity salad come on man leave me alone you know email NY enjoy something gross as long as the the majority of your diet is really healthy and you can get in those f*** off days it doesn't matter that your body will bounce back just don't don't put it in a deficit</div>
