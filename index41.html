		<div class="paragraph"> is just not wise right that's just too much too much to do when people do that when they just take on too many different. I thought about other stuff like doing other stuff I've had offers to do other stuff and I start thinking about it maybe I can find time for that and then I then I give myself coaching like I'm like what would you tell yourself I'm like what the f*** is wrong with you you're not doing anything else I can barely do all the stuff you're doing now I think for me to as I get older especially like right now in my life and my leisure time very important to me like it mean something and I don't mean Leisure like sit around doing nothing but like Hobbies like stuff that I do like lately I've been shooting guns about buying a gun video game but some people get mad why you mad comments lie just get mad then wait shooting guns stop it stop it think of the children like it looks so it feels like a real pistol when you pull the trigger and it's like that techno hunt thing where you got a laser beam that shoots out and it even makes a noise like a gun like pants and you shooting zombies like a pistol so you have to hold it like a pistol yeah dude no I don't I don't think it's a good idea to have dummies like me roll around with a gun in my hand extra told me to buy a Glock 19 I was a gun to buy a gun have a problem before that thing that that was fun wasn't it a shooting when you're holding your hand is it's way more difficult it seems weird if you think it's more difficult more difficult to aim and shoot rifle so much I have shot him so much it's easy you just have Trigger Discipline just don't yank the triggers pull pull pull pull pull and I was did everything I knew that and he was like all that you shot that before but like pistols I've only shot pistols at a range with no instruction I don't really I didn't know what I'm doing at all I want you to learn like had a grip it had a hold it how to aim like you don't really hold that hard with your right hand most of the pressure of your left so it's the end of the grip is very it's not intuitive you have to learn it is something that you have to be taught correctly in there so many people there that are like they they shooting competitions and you watch them do you like oh wow Jesus Christ like there's levels to this I just got as they can pull a gun out and shoot for shots inside of a second draw pole shoot for shots inside of a second Kelly's going to be a giant homeless encampment it really if you looked at it the spread right if it was a disease a deadly disease that was killing everybody and you saw a patient zero and then it spreads like two people for people six people 10 people now La has more than 60,000 homeless people and every single underpass you go to UC campus now it's not like it used to be it's a totally different animal now like The Walking Dead when you're going to Laurel Canyon off the 101 it used to be pretty normal last night or two nights ago when I went through it was like you do with no sidewalk anymore it was wanted had to walk on that sidewalk good luck with your village and needles and all contact up in human s*** and human ships all over downtown LA to San Francisco seems so much worse than he thought it was it's so it's so beyond comprehension how many people just openly shooting up drugs shiting in the streets homeless people everywhere how do you fix that and like if you think there's something that La needed to fix out of all the things in La complaints about the homeless problem is like one of the most insurmountable problems like what do you do to curb that how do you get these people home how do you clean these people up how do you get off drugs how do you how do you make it not a public how do you make it so people aren't scared to go down streets and streets in Downtown LA where you see the street like you're at the beginning of the mouth is treating you look no Street like I'm not walking down there but this is terrible. They need to open up the Mental Hospitals again whenever they closed them down witness 70s or the 80s that's what caused all this they don't have those anymore it definitely was a problem but it seems like it's gotten way worse right like think about what it used to be 10 years ago nothing about what it is now mean this 10 years ago still decades after they close down the mental institutions I change the standards so what it was was they had certain standards where you would be institutionalized and they change their standards under the Reagan Administration just sent these people out into the street and everybody thought was like really cruel because here you just releasing these people with all these like severe mental health problems he's releasing amount of the street but that was a long time ago something has happened recently I guess it's the economy I mean what it is but another thing you thinking to seeing around this area is mobile homes like those the drive those campers like winnebagos f****** everywhere people just get enough money to get one of the mobile homes he's parked on the street and they live in those things which is just like a mobile Camp you know and get these gypsies that hang out and they cook on the sidewalk and s*** like we used to have them here they would they would like they were hanging out and sunbathing on the lawn out here and the owner of the buildings like don't walk out of here are you guys doing in the park I go to the Parc Sovereign citizens just people that don't drive they travel and they don't follow the rules and they like if you watch it live PD they have one every episode 2 every episode it's do get pulled over in like they won't even roll down the window and they're like I don't have to follow your rules cir unit didn't ever have driver's license or insurance it's applied don't think the law applies to that I'm growing so big recently that it's so many people now that do this s*** and it's the most grossest like if you watch NYPD it you'll do what is live PD live PD is cops nowadays it's but it's not anyway but I think it's way better. Columbus Ohio that they used to put is got rid of it I didn't even know this is a thing and so the Sovereign citizens like what are they saying that you're pulled over and they say I don't have to listen to you I needed to jail for just a seatbelt violation I don't need to give you a license to keep on repeating website it don't have to you know do this and that and this and then they finally have to like break their window and didn't drag them out and arrest them just wear a seatbelt violation are smart and you know they're talking about though but other people are just like watching a video like I don't have to listen to this guy on YouTube by the cops and he knows exactly what his rights are and the cops are f****** up and he called the cops on different codes and laws and the Constitution and then he wants of driving off everything that before Ada on accident are like boobs that woman who was a New York she was like some kind of high up person that got pulled over and she starts yelling at Black Ops and s*** like she lost her job the next swell because it's on camera you know that someone finds that video and still okay man you are citizen you like us I give your speeding or something like that they pull you over you can't get out and act like you owned these cops it's I mean you got to give your f****** drive drivers license so you got to you got to show them your identification if you're doing something that's an infraction or violation that's the whole reason we have cops do you want everybody just driving a hundred fifty miles an hour no ID and masks on know so you have rules for these are the rules if you do something that breaks the law they got to be able to pull you over and give you a f****** ticket and incentivize you to drive correctly and also find out if maybe running from the cops and also they pull you over to get your idea to go a man get a murder warrant out for you so please step out of the car with your hands up and this is the whole reason we have cops in the first place in these people to think they don't have to pay taxes and the laws apply to them it's all an unconstitutional good luck with that case is Wesley Snipes how that worked out but yeah it should they put Wesley in f****** jail for a long time Lauryn Hill to from the goddamn Fugees they put her in a cage for like a year right how long did she go to jail for it was a taxes thing to man they get these wacky whether it's an attorney or tax professional of some wacky advisor tells them they don't have to pay taxes and they read some internet thing it's it's actually it's unconstitutional it's only supposed to apply during wartime like listen pay your f****** taxes okay you can protest all you want you think it's unjust that's good they will put you in a f****** jail and if you're a famous person trying to pull that off especially a famous rich person like it's not good but it is what it is they're going to make an example of you how long do you go to jail for female 64 sylheti just the fact they put her in a f****** cage is crazy like is she a danger to the public like what is going on here and she owes you money how come that's the one money that you can't just pay back you know you can just pay me back and all because you owed some taxes cuz he had some wacky dude that was telling him he didn't have to pay taxes because of money they lock you in a goddamn case it's not like he stole money he held up a bank it's not like he was a violent person it was a danger to society know he owed some taxes he made money and they had their taking his you made money but he didn't give his share up to the does the government decide to lock him in a cage to punish him in to make a statement to everybody else you pay taxes you get taxed on your paycheck and then you get sales tax or getting taxed how many times you know getting text a lot well then that's why I please like Nevada people like because of Nevada you don't have to pay state taxes so you make you can save a lot of money Florida same thing like I know a dude who moved to Florida because he was going to sell this business so it's like we're going to move to Florida and stab listen to Florida for a few years and then sell my business so I'm a Florida resident and then I have to pay nearly as much money as you want a big business I can save you a ton of money this is weird that it's different everywhere you go you know like to some places just don't have state tax you don't have to pay ya Montana has different taxes Colorado is different taxes they're all I've everybody don't like a different set up different amount that you have to pay for this and then over is a weird thing that like a lot of the big Nations have their headquarters in Delaware for some reason it's like somewhere tax law for that nice little tax Haven Florida didn't OJ move to Florida cuz he couldn't take his pension that way or he owes money based off the lawsuit nice little tax-haven some I got the juice moved to Florida didn't OJ move to Florida cuz he couldn't take his pension that way or he owes money based off the lawsuit right for the civil suit but he has a pension NFL</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> why I think sometimes people need to hear from somebody like you or someone like Jocko or you know the beautiful thing about these podcast is that you get to hear people's perspective and a lot of Mirai opening now that they did they literally can change the world because they change the way you behave and you interact with people when you listen to it and that podcast that you did with Chaka when I was listening to me to change my whole day changed like how I was going to look at my day I was in instead of like looking at my day like it's a normal day I was thinking God damn I'm lucky that I damn I'm lucky and goddamn imagine experiencing what you and hold you at the time I was 21 21 years old and experiencing what you experienced in that insane firefight being locked down and how many guys did you wind up engaging with I don't know that you know I don't know I mean everyone that I got an opportunity with and just you know it was just so chaotic and mad and I still look that I think about all the time obviously it's something I could have never experienced the mean I trained for war every single day when I was in the Marine Corps Mo's what I suppose what my job was and I still could have never imagined that day the way it was or anything the turnout I could have never pictured it I could have never in any and I think every day that goes by I think there's a reckoning of it right the way that I seen it that day is not the way I see it today and I think that comes with Gino just to sharpening and just your body know you change and you you see different things in perspective but yeah I mean you know that day I mean it's still I mean it's still it's just it's just there's so many lessons that come from that day that I look at people complain about stuff here in America and it's like you know I seen him one day the best of humans the worst of humans and everybody nobody thought they were wrong and it's possibly know it's just it's just one of those deals of if you know that that day was just that's an important point when you just said nobody thought they were wrong not damn not you I walked in that day and I was the guy who was cocky who would tell you you know I love fighting do you know I mean like I like I just want to go fight you know whatever every fight I had before that it was like you're always had airplane sitting you out or helicopter sitting sitting around always had you know it was like I'm going to go in there and start to fight and then I'm going to call and all this other this other stuff to win right and that day it wasn't there and and and literally out I walked out of the room and I just think about all the time today I just think about all the time of how many generations just that day were how many generations of of people's lives were changed you know all my teammates died so don't ever have kids at Generations stopped their families for every so many lives were changed at Day by that that that piece and guess what and everybody in America had no clue what's going on like right now there are u.s. troops somebody wondering if they're going to be able to come home and see their family again that's reality whether you want ignored or not like that's reality and that was me September 8th 2009 and it was just a she was a chaotic day it's amazing how you can have thousands of days in your life in one day changes the way you look at everything one day changes the way you look at everything and you don't like the the further I go on that I look at it different you know I always talk about the story of you know whenever this guy came up behind me and I ended up killing him with a rock and I always remember just like I remember it like I see it every night like I remember like I just see his face and I got just cuz there was a point with a point that I feel like that anybody that when they whether they're injured or anything like they realize they're defeated like like I don't know I just think there's a point when you look at somebody and they know they're going to die and I never forget that and you do now I look at it and I see it and I always thanked it like this guy is a son to somebody his mother and father are going to miss him this guy he believes in his cause as much as I do he doesn't believe he's wrong this guy this guy he he could have had a wife or kids that are never going to see their father again just like you know my dad might have never seen me again if it was switched and really I don't even know that I don't hate him I don't even know this guy we're just here at this place right now because we were born in two different countries will you out of weapons will you out of so my know he came up and he started choking me my shot him once before and he got was trying to pick my buddy. I'll leave my one of my closest Afghans. Ali have been shot he he got killed and killed and I came around the stairs to get him and I was on my knee and this guy came up behind me and so he didn't have a weapon either he was really did he had a weapon and I end up shooting him from the ground and I thought he was dead when he fell on the ground and I kind of moved down and got down Natalie cuz we are still get shot at from this machine gun up on this hill and I was trying to make myself small as I could and this guy ends up coming up and choking me like I thought he was dead I thought he was dead and he ends up choking me out he starts trying to choke me out and eventually let up a little bit and I end up getting around him and I just got we were fighting back and forth and I can remember I was thinking about was like don't let his legs get on me like you and these guys are legs are uneven crawling up mountains or whole life and he was a free big dude and I just remember getting on top of him finally got on top of him and I. I was rolling on top of him he didn't have all the gear on I did and I made up my member getting on top of him like like I was straddling him and I'm just waking up trying to grab for anything I can I'm holding him and hold him down with my throat with my my forearm and I'm just grab anything I can finally ended up grabbing a rock and I just started beating this dude's face in and I start beating and beating them beating I remember remember just like finally like after hitting him you know I don't know three or four times for about X whatever I remember like finally just kind of looking at me and like just it's it's like he's like just I'm just looking in the eyes like obviously closer than me to you right now and you just see although you can tell like he knows where this is going and I always think about that you know obviously I would kill him a million times over again right he was dating me like I don't feel bad about that part of it but I just think out like in that moment if I can find a way to relate to him in that moment a man I'm taking his life we all in America can find a way to connect with each other if we don't connect with each other because we choose not to I don't care what your differences are like don't like find a reason why we can get along not why we should not get along and I always think about that moment you know this guy in you know obviously end up dying and it would it showed me was is that no cause that you have that's built on hate will survive I didn't hate this guy didn't even know him but I was willing to to take his life because of what I loved and that's what that's what we have to build our lives in her foundation on is not not being angry and hating each other and that's what that's what we have to build our lives in her foundation on is not not being angry and hating each other but because we love to cause that we believe in so much does that make sense</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> kind of resources are available to when you do come back like how do they treat people that are suffering from PTSD and be careful with it right because I mean that the last track you want to get on his is all the pharmaceutical drugs right like the pills and stuff and you'll get on that real quick the VA is notorious for it so you know Klonopin Xanax I mean that you go down the list right and and I like I went down that I went down that road and and it got me nowhere but now you know like where we know there's tons of nonprofits out there who are doing a lot of great stuff trying trying to help out you know where it was one thing that we found out and then actually studies are starting to show that this helps is Stella Stella Gangnam Gangnam blocked Scott sgb Allegheny block and you get a shot it goes in your neck and I'll tell you this like when I got that shot it instantly before the needle came out of my neck dr. Sean Mulvaney is the guy that that's putting all this together when the needle came out of my neck it instantly took me from being like like my whole life was downtown New York City in rush hour traffic 15 minutes late to a meeting that my life depended on to instantly being driving down a quiet country road with nowhere to be instantly what is it doing so basically what it does is this how it was described to me and you have like two systems you have like your your your automatic nervous system in the you have your manga right so your automatic is like your eyes blinking breathing things like that your manual is like hey I need to reach over here and grab this bottle of water and what happened to this fight or flight gets stuck in your automated there's no longer do you say I recognize this as a threat and now going to fight or flight so what it does is you've been in that so long that it put gets pulled over into the the automatic side and so what this does is it sky like a restart like it but there's no nothing that last long in it it it goes in and it it basically I think it gets on this call the sciatic nerve and it basically gives you a restart and it just took away all my anxiety instantly like just melted away how long does it last so it comes down to me sometimes I get one once a year one every six months but just comes down to do you go back and expose yourself to these chaotic situations right like you go keep making bad decisions but for me I look at it is like a it's a it's a solution to I caught the flash-bang of anxiety so like it's at flashbang that gives you the moment the separation to wear now I can make I don't feel like I'm out of control now I can I can make decisions to get get things back together what is the actual chemical that they're using I don't know I would have to look he's got an article about it that's crazy that it's so effective using stellate ganglion block to treat post-traumatic stress disorder pathetic nervous system fight or flight has been known to play a part in PTSD it's believed that extra nerves of the system Sprout or grow after Extreme trauma wow leading to elevated levels levels of norepinephrine and adrenaline like substance which in turn over activate the amygdala the fear center of the brain is chain of events results in PTSD symptoms that maybe that may persist for years so part of the sympathetic nervous system called the stellate ganglion a collector nerves in the neck seem to control the activation of the amygdala a recent Innovation offers potential and rapidly treating symptoms of PTSD for a prolonged. Of time placing an anesthetic agent on the stellate ganglion in an anesthetic procedure called the stellate ganglion block can relieve the symptoms of PTSD in as little as 30 minutes and for you it said just a few seconds before the needle is out and last 4 years the sgb reboot the sympathetic nervous system to it free trauma State similar to a computer reboot in the brain norepinephrine levels are rapidly reduced and the extra nerve growth is removed wow sgb is anesthetic procedure that has been performed since 1925 and is considered a low risk pain procedure done under x-ray guidance that's insane that use a so dr. Sean Mulvaney is the guy I've been to other doctors and he's doctor Mulvaney's only guy I would go to who does it the way you got the whole procedure set up he was a Navy SEAL he's a doctor and he doesn't have DC and and but nobody we know what most people haven't heard of this yeah so how do you feel as a man I caught myself sing in the shower this morning I got caught myself sexy guy walked out there and I intend to meet your I got your point at that point like I got to low point and I just there was nothing like there's nothing in my life I can complain about like there's nothing that I have this country has given me a life that I could have never dreamed that ever have I have no problems zero and I just woke up everyday and I was just like I just don't want to wake up feeling like this and so he's like come do this come do this and I came out there and did it and it it changed it changed my whole life that sounds infinitely better than therapy or talking through it or any any other methods I've ever heard of yeah I think all that I think all that matters like going to be like chirai workout coaching and not giving them goals run you know don't go in there just to go in there like going out with a plan and have them help you get that plan but this this instantly just like that doesn't grow edible no do they do they try to do that in conjunction with medication does it just as Standalone thing thing wow sound thing you know the only thing I do to help my anxiety bad like I'm talking bad happens like what's what's the process I usually feel it building up over days yeah days like it's almost like a like it'll come and it just builds up and then it's like you have like a little little bit of an anxiety attack or whatever you'll start feeling anxiety or anxious and that becomes your new Baseline and then it keeps building people don't recognize it and for a long time I used to like I used to drink a lot and I didn't I didn't I mean what do you mean like this is how I feel all the time Brian and then you know then what usually happens at night it'll just when I go to sleep at 8 or just Little Rock me Little Rock Me Out start throwing up I'll be sweating and I'll be crying like I'm I'll be in the floor or are you thinking things when this is happening or is it just an overwhelming sense of anxiety just just all-encompassing I don't know where it comes from no I think it just in my subconscious I think you know obviously your brain is always trying to look like when you're asleep trying to file things and process things I think that's what happened is like consciously you know you'll consciously it doesn't bother me to talk about it like I went back and with housing another gunfight 4 days later and I mean that literally I was packing up all my teammates stuff and getting ready to go back to fight again and I got another fight and I think that you know coming home your brain still trying to process all that stuff and I think it happens to anybody you don't have to go to war you could be in a car wreck I mean you look at you look at the October 1st shooting in Vegas you know you could you can go through anything right like it whatever it is I think it's what people are dealing with and it's just I think that's why you see so much anxiety across the world is because of all this desensitization consciously and people are process subconsciously that makes sense that really makes sense that it's they're taking in all this information I think it's not affecting him at all but it really is that's why you see all these people feel like their lives are out of control and it's because consciously like we're not sitting here talking about it like well yeah yeah you know I seen your car wreck today or you know someone told I don't mean and it's like they're not ever processing it consciously but their body will suck your body will always say you can either text the demons are there going to exercise you to grow it put it at what do they recommend when when when you I mean do they check on you to see if you are having anxiety or do you have to come to them and explain it to them cuz anybody get through it without anxiety I would worry about the people that got through it without it without nightmares or anything you don't know but I think I think some people do I think people just deal with it different ways running but me you know like I used to drink a lot and and but I was doing it not because I was an alcoholic I was doing it as up I just tired rather I could regulate my drinking better than I could the effects of what medicine would do to me and I'll do the Marines have a system that they will they check on you and make sure you're Eeyore guide you into a specific type of treatment when they know there's something wrong yeah but you know the problem is Riley's warfighters is like they don't want to go talk about it or tell the Marine Corps because then they're you know your or the military I'll just a military why'd you know they think they look at you as well now this person can operate everybody everybody's too worried to talk about this because they're afraid of not being able to do their job because they're afraid that somebody will look at them and say oh you got PTSD you don't need a gun and it's and it's like you know most people that have PTSD or car wreck victims really that's the biggest source of you do have an issue how how do you go from having an issue to getting treatment what's the process if you if you if you tell your command I mean you know there's there's all types of resources there I mean you know nobody wants to talk out because you know you start talking then you know how quit your job going to be gone you know I got out I was out before I was out so fast after after all this happened I was out you know 7 or 8 months afterwards and I didn't realize it was going until I probably never started dealing with my PTSD until 2016 do I just I thought this was just normal what made you change my daughter's my daughter sailor I can remember the day I was in a I was actually in the floor like just having anxiety attack like crazy and I was like I got to do something I've have got to do something because my daughter's they deserved father possible like they like they had no choice income in this world and you know I might not want to I might not want to deal with it and face it for myself but they deserve for me to wake up every single day and give them the best father that they could possibly have and and that that is my responsibility to them is that when you first got the shot cuz block so I end up getting it and 2017 2017 I think and I didn't know anything about it until you know once I found out about it I did how did you find out about it just another another Warrior that have gotten it and it worked for them and I also use I use I use three methods to maintain all of it I use the spell ganglion block which is his kind of when it gets real bad I'll go get that that's like the whole reboot right for maintenance I usually use is called alpha-stim so it goes on your earlobes quit smoking with that right for pain anxiety depression but I use I use an alpha stim that goes I put on clipping on my ears and it like I usually do it everyday and it just it melts it melted away as well and then the last piece is is in this is not obviously in in our community it's probably not the popular side of it is is is using a poppy yeah all my drinking alcohol legal in it I just made alcohol legal how do you make it legal to Bootleggers about a business oh okay it's Dukes of Hazzard stop that's crazy wow alcohol legal holyshit</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and that podcast that you did with Chaka when I was listening to me and change my whole day changed like how I was going to look at my day I was so you know instead of like looking at my day like it's a normal day I was thinking God damn I'm lucky that I damn I'm lucky and goddamn imagine experiencing what you and how old were you at the time I was 21 21 years old and experiencing what you experienced in that insane firefight being locked down and how many guys did you wind up engaging with I don't know I don't know I don't know I mean everyone that I got an opportunity with right and it just you know it was just so chaotic and I still look that I think about all the time obviously it's something I could have never experienced that mean I trained for war every single day when I was in the Marine Corps Mo's what I suppose what my job was and I still could have never imagined that day the way it was or anything the turnout I could have never pictured it I could have never and I think every day that goes by I think there's a reckoning of it right the way that I seen it that day is not the way I see it today and I think that comes with Juno just to sharpening and just your body you know you change and you you see different things in perspective but yeah I mean you know that day I mean it's still I mean it's still it's just it's just there's so many lessons that come from that day that I look at people complain about stuff here in America and it's like you know I seen in one day the best of humans the worst of humans and everybody nobody thought they were wrong and it's possibly know it's just it's just one of those deals of if you know that that day was just that's an important point we just said nobody thought they were wrong. You who was cocky who would tell you you know I love fighting do you know I mean like I like I just want to go fight like you know whatever every fight I had before that it was like you're always had airplane sitting you out or helicopter sitting sitting around always had you know it was like I'm going to go in there and start the fight and I'm going to call and all this other stuff to to win right and that day it wasn't there and and and literally out I walked out of the room I just think about all the time today I just think about all the time of how many generations just that day were changed how many generations of of people's lives were changed you know all my teammates died so don't ever have kids that Generations stopped their families for every so many lives were changed that day by that that that piece and guess what and everybody in America had no clue what's going on like right now there are you guys troops somebody wondering if they're going to be able to come home and see their family again that's reality whether you want ignored or not like that's reality and that was me September 8th 2009 and it was just a she was a chaotic day it's amazing how you could have thousands of days in your life in one day changes the way you look at everything one day changes the way you look at everything and you don't like the the further I go on that I look at it different you know I always talk about the story you know whenever this guy came up behind me in and I ended up killing him with a rock and I always remember just like I remember it like I see it every night like I remember like I just see his face and I got just cuz there was a point the point that I feel like that anybody that when they whether they're injured or anything like they realize they're defeated like they like it. Like I don't know I just think there's a point when you look at somebody and they know they're going to die and I never forget that and you do now I look at it and I see it and how he spanked it like this guy is a son to somebody his mother and father are going to miss him this guy she believes in his cause as much as I do he doesn't believe he's wrong this guy this guy he he could have had a wife or kids that are never going to see their father again just like you know my dad might have never seen me again if it was switched and really I don't even know that I don't hate him I don't even know this guy we're just here at this place right now because we were born in two different countries will you out of weapons will you out of out of him oh, I know he it came up and he started choking me my shot him once before and he was trying to pick my buddy. I'll leave my one of my close to the Afghans. Ali have been shot he he got killed and killed and I came around the stairs to get him and I was on my knee and this guy came up behind me and so he didn't have a weapon either did he had a weapon and I end up shooting him from the ground and I thought he was dead when he fell on the ground and I kind of moved down and got down with. A lie cuz we all still get shot at from this machine gun up on this hill and I was trying to make myself small as I could and this guy ends up coming up with choking me like I thought he was dead I thought he was dead and he ends up choking me out he starts trying to choke me out and eventually let up a little bit and I end up getting around him and I just got we were fighting and for that I can remember I was thinking about was like don't let his legs get on me like you and these guys are legs are uneven crawling up mountains or whole life and he was up music pretty big dude and I just remember getting on top of him finally got on top of him and I. I was rolling on top of him he didn't have all the gear on I did and I end up member getting on top of him like like I was straddling him and I'm just waking up trying to grab for anything I can I'm holding him and hold him down with my throat my forearm just grab anything I can it finally ended up grabbing a rock and I just started beating this dude's face in and I start beating and beating and beating I remember I remember just like finally like after hitting him you know I don't know three or four times 45 times whatever I remember him like finally just kind of looking at me and like just it's it's like he's like just I'm just looking in the eyes like obviously closer than me to you right now and you just see although you can tell like he knows where this is going and I always think but you know obviously I would kill him a million times over again right he was dating me like I don't feel bad about that part of it but I just think about like in that moment if I can find a way to relate to him in that moment a man I'm taking his life we all in America can find a way to connect with each other if we don't connect with each other because we choose not to I don't care what your differences are like like find a reason why we can get along not why we should not get along and I always think about that moment you know of this guy and you know obviously end up dying and it would it showed me was is that no calls that you have that's built on hate will survive I didn't hate this guy didn't even know him but I was willing to to take his life because of what I loved and that's what that's what we have to build our lives in her foundation on is not not being angry and hating each other but because we love to cause that we believe in so much does that make sense it does the way they look at it in Afghanistan this so it's is it Al-Qaeda or the Taliban so I'll kind is mainly end in Iraq is she gets in a wreck in the Taliban Taliban in Afghanistan Taliban what are they trying to do are they trying to run a religious caliph and they I mean they just want that you know they want to run to do it the way that they want to write like they want to they don't want they don't believe in you know women being educated that mean they don't believe in any like they don't believe in you. They go back to that their beliefs of you know driven by religion of all that control they want to put they want to control and how much support did they from the general population I think the support but because I think that it's not necessarily supported the power that they have right like they come in and they leave with the heavy hand right I mean there's these they don't these disease the locals run the place but the Taliban is kind of like look at it like a game right like or like the time and is kind of like the cartel right and so that's that's where they come from and they try to lead with violence and same thing that you would know you would see with the cartel. Albans, looking over a Big Cartel so the general the population they would like that to not be the case he want us system of democracy similar to what we have and I don't know what they want that but shitholes right they all see you know what I think they they they know what could get you know how it could be better and how life could be better if you know the cool thing about America is that we know what freedom is and I promise you this like you want to have all the differences stop if anybody ever invaded us I mean people don't want to give anything up so they would all start fighting everybody would be on the same page and start fighting if anybody tried to come to America cuz nobody would want to give up their stuff will post 9-11 I will meet you at 9:11. I was in 8th grade and I always say I would never wish for another 9/11 but I would give anything for a 912 I would give anything for a 912 it was crazy people are friendly people were letting people in in traffic people that like American flags were everywhere everywhere everywhere people are proud of America everybody was is hard for people weren't there on those days to understand the mood of the country it was a different world like we people were patriotic everybody was remember what it was like before the day 9/11 so I I don't I don't have much perspective on that but I do remember 912 I remember I mean everybody was proud to be American it was everybody was everybody was proud of our country and Who We Are internship it was an Indian that the way it goes though like when something tragic happens like isn't that the way it goes like like we we we focus on what really matters like these differences go away yeah but we come back to what matters well that's something that a lot of people who experience war of sad that this is where they felt the most connected because their life was literally in danger and because they knew because they had lost loved ones to this thing that lost Brothers to this thing this was real and that to this day that is the most exciting and happiest time of their life cuz they were so connected Sebastian Junger wrote about this in the movie that I'll try but yeah if you read it I haven't read it it's very good and it probably would speak to a lot of the exact same things that you say but you know like I I I find the same thing not the same thing obviously cuz my life's not in danger and I hope that I never have to go a day where my life's in danger again and I find the same preciation back here in a country that that I love I can you know I I I narrowed it down cuz I had to come up with a reason of like why do you know it's hard to sit here and watch The Valleys that you fought for and then the government go and give those beliefs back to the Taliban you know there's one video me and my buddy were laughing about the other day a base that that he had been on and he shows me this video and it's like literally the treadmills that were in the gym there it's a Taliban guy running on a treadmill right like they left it there then we'll just like you know and in and I always think about you cuz if you get down the weeds of you start really getting you'll get upset about you know that Valley did I really did did did my teammates sacrifice really change your life like if they had to sacrifice that day would would your life be changed like cuz that's worth fighting for is America and so I just thought I always looked at it like this and I came to peace with it we're trying to do any where we went when when I served and I wore the nation's cloth I got the I got the best opportunity we will thank me for my service I'm like don't don't think maybe like I appreciate you letting me represent America be the away team for the United States of America like I got to wear the nation's cloth in so many countries but I always I justify it as all we tried to do no matter whether we were passing out soccer balls to kids when we were going in and security for a whale or we're taking out an enemy combatant all we were trying to do was make that part of the world that we were in a better place that's all we're trying to do we're trying to leave it better than we found it that moment and if we take that same concept and we apply it here and we all go over and do it for the person on the left and the right of us and if we use that same concept you can apply it here in America every day every single day you can make this qualitative better there's a lot of people in this country that don't think we should be nation-building in other countries and including people like Tulsi gabbard who served but then you got people like Dan Crenshaw who I've had on the podcast and who his prospective is you have to go over there like that you can't allow these groups to get more powerful and gain more control you just can't you can't you can't if not us then who and anything is America a Beacon of Hope across the world America is a Beacon of Hope and and you can notice when America's strong everybody hates us when America's week the world suffers and I'm not saying we need to go in and and fight everybody's battle obviously right like butt on the backside of it you know we're not necessarily going in and fight for the we do have an obligation to go and help people like you take Syria when they are gassing when they are gassing kids and women if nobody else is going to go send rockets in there if nobody else is going to go hold somebody accountable for it and there's nobody that serving that's wearing the uniform that did not gladly doing that and going to go hold them accountable and it has nothing to do with anything other than good and evil and if we don't go fight the evil then who's going to do it who's going to do it and we don't want the evil to get bigger you don't want able to get bigger you don't want the evil 222 progress and you don't want the Evil 2 to think that they can imagine you see what they're doing right now in and I think the world knows that did America will come and show up and you see how how they're still going imagine if they didn't have to worry about us. imagine what they would look like you no thank you can imagine better than most that's part of the problem is that you know when you're in Calabasas you know going to the mall and I'll get getting yourself a f****** smoothie if it doesn't seem real you know and you can have all these opinions about what we should be doing you know and that we need to stop these warmongers weed stop this and stop that and I've I've had those opinions myself in the past and gone back and forth and the only thing that's changed my mind is I've listened to people that actually know I think it's one of the most important things you could ever do and don't try to form an opinion if you don't really have any facts and real or any real understanding I've done that in the past to have made those mistakes people died and then none of them volunteered together country for their life that day except obviously the First Responders you look since 9/11 besides a couple of tax it's been in America we look since 911 everybody that's given their life overseas has volunteered to do that they volunteered to go fight the evil and for us to go over there and do that and keep it off the country to keep it out of our country to keep it to where you know our kids and our families and our mothers and fathers and don't have to worry about this and obviously obviously could it happen anywhere but but I can't think that us being over there and giving them a place to fight us has not helped this country keep from being attacked multiple times if we had not gone over there that's a hard pill for people to swallow right they they don't want to think that but I think the reason why they would attack us is because we're over there yeah well you know what I mean what what what how why do we get attacked on 9/11 who questioned like these people hate us just because they hate us like they say it's not it's not about you know there was that one worker that that said that while we should go over there and get them more jobs and more opportunities know these people don't care like these people have they wake up every day and and and try to think of a way to kill us like there's no negotiating with these people these people are evil these people do nasty things to human beings that didn't know you couldn't even imagine you couldn't make a video game about I mean you look at you look at some is Isis stuff of what they're doing I mean putting somebody in a cage and burning them you want to be empathetic to that throwing people because because of their sexual preference off the timer hands and legs together and throw him off the top of a building people like that did that we're going after and if we don't do it who's going to do it who's going to do it do you think it's possible that this all could be resolved someday that maybe if it's not our children or children's children do you think it's possible that everybody says that but I mean if you look at any of the book they came before us this is this is what you get this is this is just part of any at any point in time there's there's conflict going on it'll never be resolved it'll never be resolved it will never be resolved so it's main to take a maintenance program while never be resolved just because the military-industrial complex wants to keep us at War and this is just a big money grab and that's all they're trying to do is the reason why they have us over there as if they're sending people over there to die so they can make money this is this is how people love to look at it I mean everybody wants to fight I think it's just because everybody wants to find a reason to know everybody wants to everybody wants a reason that they can Touch Peel and Blaine like they want something to blame and they know there's nothing to blame except the people who are doing this and it exists and it's real and he's a real people and you know what we're just so lucky that we have an all-volunteer military with some of the greatest people that ever walked the face of the planet who are willing to go do this who willing to do it on on mining your behalf I mean how cool is that it's pretty wild when you think about it right is it in complete volunteer army volunteer complete volunteer military these people are willing to raise their right hand to a piece of paper to an idea of democracy go over they put their whole life on hold their wives sacrifice when you take military spouses and they sacrifice if not more than than the people fighting with send in the veterans in the service members and their they're willing to go over and fight for my nanny your freedom they've never met us but they're willing to give their lives for like think about this I like people who are we listening to this like what can you name one thing right now that you're willing to give your life for I think about that would you give your life for right now like like somebody pulled a gun out you know you're going to die would you give your life for Chinese people willing to go do it on the idea of democracy on the idea of me and you on the idea of good it's incredible it isn't you when you signed up how old were you 17 your 17th 18th birthday can my dad sign for me someone can sign for you and did you have any other aspirations or was that something that you knew you were going to do know I like honesty a marine recruiter can't tell me I never make it as a marine and so like questions and just to know being a typical high school student and he's like you're wasting my time you never make it as a marine and you know what I was up to the challenge so I signed up that to him saying that was what really started and it was in really know what the Marine Corps was before that but you think about that like her whole life is built tough decisions you know our decisions our control we are today where were where we deserve to be because we made the decisions up to this point like and that's a hard pill to swallow to yats variable right there's still some things are out of your control there are but but a lot of it but a lot of it you can't control situations and circumstances but you can control how you take it control your sponsor response growing up like that mean you're growing up in combat and you're growing up at 18 years old I mean I was a f****** baby when I was 18 you're growing up in, yeah I guess if you look at it like this and you are here now ten years after what we were talking about and you said it still keeps you up I wake up you know I got a couple a couple nights a month and just you know an anxiety attack throwing up Alexa speak in last week I was on the road at the first time you know I always like I'm always nervous like you in the middle of night my daughter get scared or shoot you know she comes down and gets it in my bed like I'm always really like nervous about that because I don't I would like it like it was so I was so nervous about it because I was just cash I never want them to see me in that in that that state right and the other day on the road I was speaking out in North Carolina and she's obviously we're in a hotel so she was staying with me and I I don't know I didn't feel good at night so what I do is I put a I put a pillow between us and a gosh I had I had one I knocked my tooth off my back. Muffineer off like it was so terrible and she just looked at me she's 3 and she just looked at me and she said it's okay that you're not you're not a bad dad and and I was like you know but yeah I mean you know you still that mean this is that's that's why you look at it I see if people who plays video games and they get nothing from like that there's no emotional attachment to it and it's like this stuff surreal like there's nobody who go out on a limb and say there's nobody who sees this stuff and they don't you don't come back and deal with it go out on a limb and say there's nobody who sees this stuff and they don't you don't come back and deal with it like it's it's a normal process to it to being part of not normal situations</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> weird what you could see all the violence while I watch John Wick 3 last night finally finished it she's three-quarters of the way through I'm like how many f****** people have they killed this is so ridiculous out your system fast it's murder p*** that's what it's like is unheard-of but yet you don't show sex but you could show people brains exploding but they showed a girl's p**** and a penis going inside of a people see your feet up in the air like what are we watching you can see Brad Pitt spoiler alert if you see that once upon a time in Hollywood with the name of it beats woman to death smashing her face against a mantle of a f****** fireplace annulare holyfuck and that's okay that's okay saw her a****** you do like what I see her actual a****** this is crazy get this off you should go to jail it's weird everybody wants to do like we all want sex I really like sex and I like sex but wages it would be a Scarlett Johansson and Brad Pitt had actual sex scene in a movie a movie called brown bunny it was a long time ago there was a movie with Vincent Gallo and there was an actress her name is Chloe I forget how to share names of energy how do you say it 7 G really good actress a really good actor and for whatever reason they decided to do a sex scene where she gives him a real b******* and everybody who saw it in the theater was angry all these critics were angry they like this is f****** outrageous it really killed his career and he killed her career a little bit too I think definitely derailed it but it f****** killed his career but do you want everybody loves Keanu Reeves and he's like he's cutting a legitimate b****** that's outrageous like I should be pulling everybody wants to do it since I'm super weird everybody will be like get the f*** out of here you probably had a film it and not let anybody know what was happening until after it was over the crazy things you talked her into it you imagine she feel like wait what the f*** did you just say where others water buffalo and they kill the water buffalo with a machete they use a real water buffalo and a real machete they really kill the water buffalo but you know there's a scene in Apocalypse Now where others water buffalo and they killed a water buffalo with a machete they use the real water buffalo and a real machete they really killed a water buffalo for that scene and people in North I bet they would go nuts now when people find out about now they freak out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and I tell people all the time like you know just because you know we get so caught up like right now is like an emotional time for for America rides getting ready to I caught the draining time you know from now until you know November until the election time it's going to be draining right everybody's getting so emotional and fired up and him and it's like you know like it's going to be whatever but the cool part is it that this country like from all of us in the military from all our first are police officers you know we're the only country on the face at planet that doesn't swear allegiance to a person we swear allegiance to a document to a piece of paper and that that's what that's what allows us to be us that's what allows us to not have one person come in and be able to change up this idea that we have of democracy of freedom and and that's that's that's something that's just it's it's incredible it's what keeps our country the way it is right like there's not you know the people will always be in charge here any most of America most 99% of America's Incredible is incredible and you know what they're going to they're stopping there helping people and it's just too loud ones that make us look and I'll make it look like it's all chaotic well people love to point out the horrible aspects and they love to ignore the good aspects they'll have to dwell on the bad parts and I think ultimately that's going to prove to be good for everybody because those people that are highlighting all these bad things than everybody else has to think about it and we'll slowly but surely evolve and come to an understanding and M and make the world a better place it's way better place now than it was a hundred years ago or two hundred years ago I think this is a me Steven Pinker talks about this all the time of it in his books but it has criticized for it because a lot of people don't like the idea that things are getting better they want to dwell on the negative aspects and they want to they want to magnify those and make it the most important focal point I think the most important focal point for one have a good world is concentrate on the good aspects and how amazing it really is that we have this incredible ability to express ourselves this incredible ability to prosper to move and I mean people don't get the the same share or the same stake in life a lot of people get a terrible opening hand of cards but you can improve and this is one of the rare places in the world where you can if you're if you're so inclined if you have the discipline if you could figure it out emotionally if you could figure it out in terms of like what you want to do you can you can live a healthy a healthy and successful life in this country it's possible it's 100% a hundred percent like nobody's holding you down right like you have the choice to be able to do that you have the choice set to go out to every opportunities here like there's no other country that has more opportunities in the United States of America especially anybody and I agree with you I think Society has gotten into this to this place of where we're trying doubt victimized each other like can be the bigger victim who's had it harder and and you know it's it's the thing that I also believe is it with technology and all this is the empathy like like suffering has became normal for people right like like it's became entertainment like look at reality TV like people's messed up lives That's Entertainment for people now video games of all time about war right we came back and it was like War has now been romanticized romanticize it is this cool image of like I hear people say I just want to go kick in doors and shoot people in the face and take what you've probably never done it then and it's like we've got her kids playing video games of the stuff that keeps me awake at night and it's like you know at what point do we start humanizing these things will you see one of those crazy video games first-person shooters involving War does that bring back memories I mean does it does it it doesn't irritate you I think it was not put out there is is not here kids at talking about hey you know did you use this or did you use this or did you not you hear people say well did you kill somebody right it's like the kids and I don't think that that's like to me that bothers me because it's not there's nothing cool about taking another human's life and and when you're playing video games since I got you like these kids are just watching the screen over and over in the more you know the more graphic it gets like the less desensitize that we have to another human being suffering the more you know from being empathetic to the hadid's real people these are real people's lives like what if they know we we stop looking at looking at people and saying you know this is Someone's Child this is someone's mother this is someone's son like we we've gotten away from the old art that I was always told to live by treat someone you would want to be treated yourself and if you were in no shoes and every time I pass somebody every time I see somebody stuff I always look at that and be like what would I want somebody to do if they see my daughter suffering or My Son suffering right at me look at all these times I see is people holding their video cameras up in their video and somebody like getting just beat and it's like what how do you do that not help how does that not just suck everything out of you to not want to do something there's a thing called diffusion of responsibility that happens people in crowds unfortunately and is also the same thing that I think filming something that's happening in real life is the same thing you seen in his video games and television shows me we we have never had more violence in film form and video game forum ever ever but yet we've never had less violence violence like how many people who play these games that have seen people get shot over and over and over and over again I've never seen a body never seen anybody gets severely wounded or shot and so to them getting and shooting people is always it's almost like empty like bang bang bang there's a guy comes out of them and then shut it off and turn it on again you do it again you're experiencing this thing that's empty so it's like you're pretending to drink water but there's nothing in the glass you just keep doing it over and over again and then you get some real water and you like oh this is this is different the terrible now she put the analogy of numbing that people are numb to this fake violence and have no experience with the real stuff so they think of the real stuff the same way they think of the fake stuff they do and then sometimes when they see it they still or not they still can't act right like the way I look at it if you know simulators like flight simulator virtual reality training until like I think it is the same way when you're doing this and then you got games that come out like Grand Theft Auto right like where you're just running around and you're shooting hookers running people over how is anything positive come from you got games that come out like Grand Theft Auto right like where you're just running around and you're two and hookers running people over how is anything positive come

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> baseball anybody who really wants to know you in-depth in your element talking with a fellow Warrior I strongly recommend that podcast for people don't what what number is it you know which number play around now number it is just listening to it it's Jocko podcast 115 Into the Fire and Beyond the Call of Duty Jaco is a f****** beast and you together talking the incidents that happened with you overseas it's insane I mean it is is like I had to call Buddy my to stop the podcast and call my friend Brenda just to talk to him I was like this is so intense it's like I was driving up getting nervous right you know driving in my pocket Tesla electric car do you know when you listen to that podcast that that was by far the most like Jocko just pulled it out of me like right like you almost everybody hits like that the high points of it but you owe me and Jocko just made that connection it was the first time we ever met face-to-face yeah we just went I can't pick me pick me up from the airport and we went we went there and we sit down and to do the the podcast and and I don't know I think I think he knew the questions to ask because I think it was good for both of us because you know if you got to the kind of in the middle of it if you start here no silences it was both of us trying to keep from tears falling right like it was like it like that moment you're trying to say just you not really we really connected and it was you know there was a tough podcast well you could tell because for Jocko me. I listen to a lot of Jocko's podcast but that was one where he was really in his element first of all it's very obviously has a deep respect for you and who you are and what you stand for and then to it brought him back to his own experiences and War and so whole thing's just is one of the most intense podcast I've ever listened to if not the most intense it's f****** have him yeah it was it was heavy was a hard like it was a hard one you think we both was getting as much out of his eye was right and I have the utmost respect for the guys just you know he is he's the epitome of of a warrior all around you know like from day it day in and day out and he wakes up every day and lives the things that he says I mean you know he he does what he says and you and he puts people first and he's just he's one of the reason the greatest guys ever met and I agree. Couldn't said about her and Tim Kennedy's while we know we're going friends with Tim and that the same thing that kind of so rare rare human being it is those guys I'm surrounded by people like that I'm so fortunate to have a circle like that you know I think that that that's what makes us who we are you know I mean that the truth the epitome iron sharpens iron and when you're surrounded by guys like Jocko and Tim Kennedy and in I mean what would you have no option but even if you're even if your last in that group like you're still you're still above-average you know well there's a cliche you know that comes up when people talk about military you know that you know people will say anything and sometimes it does it's it's hard to understand whether or not the graph exactly what they're saying but that people make sacrifices so that you can be free and I don't think I don't think people it's hard to truly internalize that without having experienced what you've experienced with Jacquelyn Tim Kennedy to experience what I'm listening to it I know that it's correct I know that it's true I supported 100% but it's almost like a an alien thing to me because I've never experienced it so it when hearing you guys talk about it and climbing inside your head for a bit and let him listen to describe it that that too cliche the land of the free because of the Brave it it it it gets highlight will you understand like this is why America's not like it is in other places because of the strong military and one of things you guys talked about in that podcast was this idea of us invading Afghanistan that you were fighting alongside Afghan actually and most people who talk about Worrell have this peripheral sort of cursory understanding about what they would like the world to be like you know that they would like no war and that other this is terrible we shouldn't be over they don't truly understand what you understand in and and I think you know the perspective that I get to come back and I think all these guys telling their stories you know from Rob O'Neill to Marcus Luttrell like I think every every Warrior out there has to tell their story to make people understand right like it's so important for that because we've got a perspective of the world did a lot of people don't get ya and you know me I stood next to I stood next to people and it did we couldn't like you talk not believing not being raised not come from the same place not having y'all we could have found every reason not to to be on the same ground but we stood next to each other were willing to die for each other we found we chose to find the common denominator and that was because there's only two types of people in this world there's good and evil it really comes down to that like like war is so simple life is so simple when you try to complicate it there's other reasons and it's like this this whole this whole thing we were all fighting for this for the belief to be free this this this belief of democracy this belief of of what we all live for and it's you can't see it but but we live it everyday and we were willing to give our Lives four for four people we didn't even know people we didn't even meet one of things you talked about with Jakob you said you didn't just lose four brothers that day you lost 10 because you lost six Afghani Brothers as well that we let you know. as the Marines were you know my team of Afghan soldiers you know I lived on a basis for us and Eddie Afghans and every day I went out on patrol and I'm patrolling with him and they're no different than than me and you you don't date they just want a place I'll never forget that really hit home to me cuz I hadn't an Afghan we were sitting up on the mountain that actually the cover of my book it was that day we were sitting on that that mountain cuz we chased some Taliban up up that hill and we were sitting up there and it's Afghan looked at me and he just said I hope that someday you can bring your family here on vacation I hope that we can get at that point wow and it really hit home to me it's like you know we're all just alike you know we're all just to like we all just want to live a great life and we all just want to get along I mean if you don't if you don't get along because you choose not to get along for people don't understand the conflict of interest and explain what is happening and why were over there basically Afghanistan it and it was the same thing in Iraq to I mean you know that's where these terrorist organizations were right and you know we're over there fighting alongside Afghanistan world are fighting alongside Iraq we're not fighting Iraq and fighting Afghanistan we are fighting alongside both of those countries and trying to rebuild it up and trying to get rid of these terrorist cells that are inside those countries you know I like you said I mean everybody thinks we're fighting Iraq and Afghanistan it's not the case work alongside I'm helping them rebuild their countries you know when you go to Black Rifle coffee in Salt Lake and those guys are awesome awesome day they brought a bunch of former Afghan troops over they work for him over there like a lot of the guys working in the factory you like oh okay I got these guys are so close these people they brought him back and gave him jobs at America I just think most people don't really have a full picture of what what's at stake and YTD happening they just don't want war war but it's like you know I mean that there's no way you mean you can go in your house and then lock your doors in and sit there and try to pretend that the evil that we fight doesn't exist but it exists it exists it's there it's there and if we don't go fight it over there it's going to come here that's another cliche that like seems alien the people you know it's it's it's a true statement it's always been true throughout human history but when you live in a country like America we're so fortunate it's so awesome here even when it sucks it's awesome in comparison to the rest of the world you know it's a very rare that you have a place where you really can start at the bottom and make your way up to be a successful person I mean literally you can start here and come from nothing and within your generation a place where you really can start at the bottom and make your way up to be a successful person I mean literally you can start here and come from nothing and within your generation be the president of United States you could literally start from that and it's only country on the face of planet</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what do you think about today's hour of boxing speed particular heavyweight Division I mean it's it's real exciting right now I think it's coming back Ruiz don't you look at you may think he can't fight fighters I see they picked the wrong guy and by that my first time ever seeing a guy but underneath all that fat there's an incredible athlete but that's what I'm saying he looks like he's carved out of stone he knocked up and knock them down three times crazy and then you got Deontay Wilder who's one of the craziest heavyweight knockout artist ever I mean that guy has Preposterous power Dion he go in and he fight his fight and and when he can see that show I hit the one hit and hit by somebody he had while at the end least he know the guy I remember the time when he got hurt he got knocked down and all that and one thing did he show up yet confident people don't have comp and they get hurt they start trying to Roar when he got hurt he came forth and that's the reason why he was able to buy that then we're going to have a rematch which shows still confidence ain't nobody even after that fight want to fight Ortiz still in beta upset somebody before we come back and Ortiz is getting old and no one even knows how old he really is cuz he's from Cuba and now this is speculation he's 50 years old people don't even know but he's an amazing man his boxing is just top-notch and he had Deonte and all sorts of trouble but you're right wild to show that he could overcome adversity and then his power that's one of the more impressive things about him his power doesn't go away Pizza power like deep in the 12th round knocked out Tyson Fury or knocked down your license Fury in the 12th round it looks like it was over but that's what I'm saying Tyson Fury 209 the day of the fight crazy cuz he said I can fight I know what I could do Death Note 2 punches referee didn't get up get up by the referee on your jump on you won't let you he would have been the camp and in so now they aren't you excited that he got up and then Tyson Fury want to win the rest around what way did he done but still when you do the thing right at your job going to be saving a fighter right they would have did it you know what bothers me what bothers me is account was more than 10 seconds what that's what I'm saying that's what bothers me about what bothers me is I think it shouldn't be the referee going 1-2 it should be a number like you should be like a timer that I do have this is how you know that they have a guy with a digital clock that shows you 10 actual seconds I think they should have something like that still to the referee some referees like 123 Are the referees like 120 seconds what bothered me was what bothered me I said hi to you and they other in the guy doing him like this they stopping the fight fight a lot of referees with stop that fight something's wrong with that it was because it was such a big fight like everybody wanted to see that fight was such a huge fight while you're not even though I said you go ahead and other country you know is that buy clothes anywhere you're not getting it punching that don't you know that's a fight was that was a fight that beg for a rematch just beg for a rematch and it bothers me it's one thing that bothers me about boxing sometimes is that these fights they don't they don't come to fruition and then if he almost lost in his Tyson that cut in his last fight I mean that was a bad cut you could have stopped that fight or no they stopping it is for anybody who cuz I know how how important it is for anybody who put their life online to be a fighter and want to say I I I it was fair I did it I did my all least I got my opportunity</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> look for him in like 97 back in 97 that was like the first time I ever worked for him but he was dead and that was when Drew Carey had The Drew Carey Show and Drew Carey had got him apart on The Drew Carey Show names like he wasn't being like a real actor and then all the sudden I see him on the f****** Sopranos I was like holy s*** it is substantiated my feelings about acting it's just pretending it's not that hard cuz I mean there's acting like did you see the Joker yet holyshit saw the other night and you were right holyshit Joaquin Phoenix is a f****** Master masterpiece you might not be into it if you're not into the haunted movie I enjoy anything that's done well you know I mean even if it's not my cup of tea but I'll go and I watch it and I'll try and figure out what the message we're trying to get a point and maybe I can connect with your vision I'll give you that I need the dark at home he's just not a funny f****** moment that movie that is not a happy moment in that movie but it's a masterpiece but the point is like that kind of acting like what Joaquin Phoenix does and that movie with Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't his movies like that sad if it's a different going to act on another level but like regular that's on another level but like regular acting like look what Steve did they gave him a fat suit they put a fat suit on him and he who played Bobby on The Sopranos any f****** nailed it knocked out his whole life</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> listening to these dudes quite a bit and then let into the next deployment of their month boom almost died pretty hard teammates save me and we had blood on the ground like I got blood on On Target and then they made a hellacious movement to give me the Medevac long story short I'm eating dinner in the hospital one of the first meals jamming out to these dudes and I was like nah nah try to get ahold of him So, eventually did and he came hung out for like 2 hours I made my friend now General gaudette wait like 15 minutes so we can finish talking about what you're talkin about which when you're when you're in enlisted you don't make generals wait but a lot of ketamine so's this week but then his own accord to donate to the foundation so this little tour going on that coincides with the album release is Special Forces foundation so that helps gold star families which are the families that remained of remained of the friends I got killed on this trip so there were four Green Berets into EOD text and so that money is going to them that's that's what I care about set of challenges but I don't care about getting taken care of other than the normal Army processes but I want them to get taken care of from the foundation so grateful to have you guys as friends now they're awesome amazing musicians but amazing people and then I'm grateful to be here and just to push that out so people are coming to the show is all that money goes to the foundation and then people can go on the foundations website which is Special Forces foundation.org and I appreciate it I did DMT three times in a day wow the third time it was a really strong one and it f****** up for a while I don't remember how long afterwards this is during the Fear Factor days but I remember reality the way I described it the reality was very slippery yeah very slippery like I kept thinking that car's been a flyover the incoming Lane crash into my car and kill me thinking like you'd be really careful but then I realize that what that is is like my ego trying to protect me by making me aware of eminent threats and trying to re-establish its position as in the chain of command because like the one of the things about really extreme psychedelic experiences that they dissolve the ego to the point where you realize like you don't really matter like you're a part of some crazy system the only reason why you think you really matter cuz you biology stay alive because you're season Heron existential threats to your existence that have always existed throughout time and you know ultimately though it doesn't matter cuz you're just going to live and die and probably Live Again by again and this is like a duck come up for a while but I was functional but I was real nervous and weirded out by the whole weeks maybe months or 3 times in a day where you try and do that on purpose or I went in but I didn't go into deep thought I saw the visuals and I lay there and I was like I got to the door and I could see through the windows of the house but I didn't go inside the second time it just like opened up a f****** Vortex and socked me through the center of the universe and then it was really really really intense not I did it again after that because I loved it cuz it was so awesome I wanted to do one more time I got to do it more but start with with re slipping me Molly I start there capsule if I can put it into her shots out of your mind Hocking college roommate it is you like to get the Molly tested like where you buying this model my favorite Molly dealer stop letting know the orange juice kicked it back up from drinking Amalia New Mexico hard party drug we had a great time to Tom would you only he said he do it to you how much have I would you be if you guys might be very mad at your house it was your last the promise of you have something to do that's good thank you here's what I did was and I was you side with the sorry thank you I don't get it I appreciate it thank you I know because I did the reading for this and I mean this is all just a social experiment to see how far they can push us away from any kind of possible power we can have to coalesce and go wait a minute you guys are not going to take any more of our money for your f****** travels hey b**** b**** you can't know you it was not in the public sphere when she said it was in the public sphere I go up there and I am disgusted it's crazy right now and I don't think most people know how bad it is their children who the president is it's all a f****** scam to put public money into private pockets and nothing else you're being robbed and nothing else and they're both doing it both parties both sides both up and down it's about the American people that we have got to go to Washington you know that movie mrs. mr. Smith I think about all need to be mr. Smith and although the Washington was like this is our government that is our tax money and it will be audited As Trump has promised and as long as President Trump continues to make the moves to keep that promise to us I will be supportive of him because that needs to happen the Federal Reserve must be audited and we have to thank President Trump for going in that direction 10 hours a day you went hard in the paint I was supposed to go somewhere so just that those jokes are coming and I was like will you tell her or will someone give her a heads up like and then like we don't want to alert her cuz she might not want to do it now so who decided to not do the jokes jokes around town to get ready for it like I was going like Caitlyn Jenner such a beautiful woman you killed with your car 4 years ago you know stuff like that that you I love that you're a woman that can't menstruate yet you still manage to have blood on your hands like the great jokes and you can't menstruate menstruate menstruate I've never said that to me was because Caitlyn Jenner heard the morning of that a call with her the morning of the roast that she had heard apparently someone's doing jokes about me and my car crash and if they do if I hear the very devastating thing that happened to that family and a woman lost her life and if there's a joke about it I will walk and awesome that's what I told Tommy Central it would been awesome before I heard this I was like it's upset cuz they were like a chicken some said there might be a moment where you know she look at cameras go to the promise I was going first and I was doing all the jokes about the car crash now if I would have upset her first off than the whole shows thrown off and it's weird in the room stop we get to about 12 and I'm just in a nice easy to send a reason is because I'm an ass, can you go more aggressive you can but when you're out of the water the water looks the same at 20000 feet is it does it 2052e don't you know so you can easily put yourself in a non-recoverable position if you're not paying attention and you go into the water coming down rapid legal and turn so now it's kind of pointless Weston out mirrors us so it's above the surface where a pie we're coming down it starts coming up with this is getting interesting sweet kind of drive all the way around a circle I'm just sending it's coming up and I get over to about the 8th position of the line and it's over in about the two position while the quickest way as we know his kids to get someone you know you can keep going around the circle nothing's going to happen across a circle some about I don't know hi to 3000 feet above it and I just kind of dropped my nose aggressively and I cut across a circle and it's coming this way cuz I'm trying to fly to where it's going to be cuz I want to join. And I want to see how close I can get to knows I'm pulling up it's kind of starting across my nose and it starts to accelerate and within about less than a second is I start to pull nose onto an across is right in front of me just go poof minutes gone so I call the other airplane I said hey you guys you guys see that thing in there like Zircon at all so I'm like okay that's kind of weird so we don't see it we're looking at the same time I said hey let's turn around and let's go back to see what was in the water we know there was there something there so we turn around right there where it's going perfectly there's no Whitewater nothing it's just blue like okay so we turn back on our heading back out towards the east and I tell the controller Sol I'm kind of weirded out and I told my my backseat or that we start heading back and the controller on The Prince and it comes up me sister you're not going to believe this but that thing is back at your cat point that was our original point where we're going to hold 40 miles south of the ship so this thing is went from wherever we were at 2 about 60 miles and you know maybe 30-40 seconds it's already over there and it just and he didn't track it it just appeared he just shows back up on the radar is here for like okay this thing is went from where we were at to scan about 60 miles and you know maybe 30-40 seconds it's already over there and it just and he didn't track it it just appeared he just took shows back up on the radar like I was here for like okay</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> way more fascinating with someone like you talks about it versus some f****** random cook yeah that's that's what makes me incredibly interested is the just your credibility in the fact that this is not you know of a history of seeing wacky s*** that other people don't say not just this once and but it's on video and that there's other ones as well this it's really strange I've seen people try to explain it away and what I don't like about when they explained it away or attempt to explain it away is it there really hard they're not going who knows what this f****** thing is they're not looking at it like cleanly they're looking at it like a quote on quote skeptic I don't like the idea of being a skeptic not that I don't think you should be skeptical of certain things that certainly think you should be but there's a lot of people that brand themselves as Skeptics and I think it's a lazy way to look at things I really do because I think you're just looking for the holes in things without looking at it objectively if you wanted to be a scientist if you want to be someone who is a fan of science then you have to look at it as a thing like look at this information and let's study this without any bias any preconceived notions I don't think they're doing that they're looking at in there trying to find a way where they can justify that it's fake and they're they're just doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to try to make it fake that video that you showed that thing slips off to the left and takes off incredible rate to speed Welch Free People the f*** out because people confuse all the time like we took the video that was another crew that took the video week we watched it for 5 minutes with their eyeballs and there was four of us and we all have the same store we all saw the same stuff we all came back and looked at each other and scratch their head and said WTF you know I mean serious what was that you know and then what are you do you remove on we never saw it again radar after that but they're probably seen him on radar all the time they just don't bring it to the attention of the general public is that we don't have any way to go out there and look at it like when you were talking about how they were informing you that they were seeing these things previous to your your mission when you're doing this exercise and they let you know that they're seeing these things did you say hey how frequent is this is this that happens all the time that ours was more of the moment of you know when he's telling us for the last two weeks we've been tracking these things and we don't know what they are but you don't know whether or not it was just those two weeks or maybe it was a year ago there was other similar situations or there's other situations that have happened out there but I would say no for this I don't even know when you got to take it serious we have a tendency if we don't know what it is if we just ignore it it'll go away years Express Prime not too far off the same timeframe running it was like the consolation was doing her work UPS before she got to decommission and an Oscar classes Soviet Oscar class submarine surfaced behind her right and then it's now it's like you know go to Battle Stations world war three foreign submarine get in our area has been monitoring our work up that's a big deal at will can do about it we don't know what they are we have confirmed sighting by two aircrew four of us two planes that said look this is not this is not an airplane this is not a weather balloon this is not a blip it has performance will be on it on airplane that we are flying at the time we're literally brand new super Hornets right out of the Boeing factory that means these these were brand-new first black to series that came out when you go why wasn't something done you know it's like what it is I think it's good now that you know the moves that have happened over the last two years since the original article came out that you know they're there now there's a new reporting for the pilots the Navy's acknowledged Hades sings we don't know what they were you know that they're starting to take it serious because you know I know there are other events that are not out recent events where people have been called in to go have seen this thing so the investigation process is still going on you know we don't we don't stay in the military funny way we don't stop you know we don't stop till we're told to stop so you know what's what's going on you know you can well a tip ended you know they spent four and a half million dollars a year on it and goes for it is 22 million / what are they doing since then well and I'm pretty sure they're still people looking at this and they're still people there are taking this serious I will tell you that I won't get into specifics but there are people inside twice to talk to folks you know behind closed doors to go cuz I want to hear the story and I've got a lot of you got to be joking I mean this this seriously happened and I'm like yeah it did happen and it is real and what are you doing about it so what kind of people you talkin to high-level government officials as well say the most of that is cuz that conversation is between me and them and I don't want people speculating that you can say high-level government officials I have talked to well that was always the the speculation about like what would someone do if they became president well the first thing I would do is I would tell everybody about the UFOs I would ask immediately what's going on and I was taught about I said how many people actually know what's going on and how much of the information I mean it's not like if they're dealing with something like this like you're you're experienced it seems like what you described as what is known so it's this anomalous event with his thing defies our current understanding of technology and then it's gone and so what do you have you don't have anything else other than that like what other information does anybody have but I would say it is cuz I talked to Bob we were together and I'll leave it to everyone it's up to you to believe Bob he's not crazy at all that was the weirdest thing about talking to him but when you when you look at it and go cuz I asked Bob I said what when he describes in the technology he when he talks about his his story I said we'll do you honestly think we could you know reverse-engineer it I said how long do you think it would take us and his response was so far beyond the stuff that he says he worked on he's like do you know a wires and cuz I'd ask him when he said you first described the ship that he got to see he said I used to say you know they built it and then it was like Wax and you heat it up because now I would say it was built with 3D printing because now it's really pretty little things literally from the ground up in a pee it's basically built as one not panels no rivets it's just made don't understand it and how fast would it take us to understand that I mean if it's if it's driven by something that we don't even have on Earth which is when he talks about that element we can't create it you know we can create it for a microsecond and then it needs decays and so we're still a long ways off argue with two people at goheen are we really alone the middle Pacific has no light pollution goggles night vision goggles see what you got at night or so I'm just hanging out not doing anything and I'm like you said Place pretty lonely universe is my astrophysics proof that once I send you believe in extraterrestrial life and she's like of course not if you think we're it I mean the probability they don't like to be foolish and I think when people start talking it's not proven or anything that's connected to a bunch of loony people that are making up stories which UFOs certainly are UFOs are connected to so many people that have made up so many stories was that gentleman's name from you would know that guy is from another country Billy something or another that Billy Meier billionaire and they get UFO dizzy bring those f****** berserk right I know that there are people that have had profound experiences and then they can't ever replicate them so then they just start going crazy and I don't blame him for it but you got some of my commander fravor when he saw that aav and almost Aerospace vehicle his reaction was I want to fly that's a pretty cool reaction I'd like to fly it hey dude. What do you think it is I have no idea to do pretty freaking Preston I'd like to fly it rising to say Well they're not coming here cuz the distance is so that hold the f****** from the very beginning when Bob Lazar came for and talk about field propulsion gravity propulsion distance becomes completely irrelevant so if we believe and The Radars right and Commander fravor saw this thing moving like a ping pong ball with us Waters gravity propelled that's why you can make those Maneuvers that exploding can then distance becomes completely irrelevant for travel you're literally warping space you're falling into place your looks like the idea of showing someone a video on your phone long before video was ever invented people black what are you talkin about like before photography was invented which is shockingly recent right you got to drop pictures of things you saw just like those people that Drew or painted that those images of those men and then whatever those things were with Christ in the background the idea that we could understand what some insanely impressive technology from Apple that is nowhere near us could could manifest the young guy right in 1989 he gets shown something and all the said he's trying to interpret it to 1989 technology so he said it looks like it was injection-molded working towards an atomic printer he's like dude that makes a lot more sense so he has to view it through where he saw it and I can however I will say this it is my knowledge that we understand exactly how these Kraftwerk are one limiting factor is our Material Science we can't replicate not the fuel source itself is another Houston we know exactly how they work yeah but it doesn't break our laws of physics this concept of amplification of gravity this concept of gravity propulsion we understand how things can move from point A to point B almost instantaneously are physics doesn't disallow it but our Material Science and the fuel to create that machine that we we have machines mother places so we haven't well Bob Lazar it whether you believe him or not there was a program I have other witnesses that I will be bringing for about ask for where he work we have credit of other witnesses that work with a long shot that corroborate Bob's account in that they saw him get on and off the red and white the Janet lights that come on went to Papoose Lake and was stopped by by non-military guards at that time people that we're aware of sight for and ET exploitation project is an SR-71 pilot that I've been talking with a couple years these people are coming for now which and it's like I'm sick and tired of doing it these little nitpicky things about Bob okay but there was a program there there was a back engineering program they've admitted there are materials so this is like the measurement about the New York Times all that we have materials associated with UFOs there are interesting what is that what you talkin bout so this was something that was launched in the first New York Times article I believe December 2017 that there is studies being done right now on materials associated with UFOs right so actual metals that have come off of you could say crashes or if it was that that explain that there was something that they were with Eric Weinstein that was explaining that there was someone who reportedly has something along those lines. Dale has 17 samples 17 samples has 1 guided 17cm first ever for the United military created a computer program for the study of UFOs for Project Blue bucks he's an old-school guy they modeled him after in there close encounters movie it's modeled after zoccali the French guy so he's kind of like been involved with this he's had more access to government databases than any of us he went around collected samples known you do crashes or like when things will come on and what's the conclusion there studying right now there was just something on Fox about their studying some of these materials and what they will find because I actually the ones they're talking about I actually took to New Mexico and had five scientists study at about five years ago I got my hands on it got to study it that the famous Parts the talking about now it's layered and the way it's layered is what they're trying to see if it's an armless elementally or the way that they're there are bound together and also the atomic level of of layering is what's interesting will find out if you would explain what you're talkin about what is this thing that you saw okay well there is there a lot of different samples but when you get a sample of something and you can hum to give you samples the ones that that I looked at the range from about this size they range from the size orange orange to the size of a quarter these are materials they materials from a crash so that's allegedly or there's a known crash this is in the public domain rather than in A government controlled so what we were what I was looking at or having a scientist look at is isotopically and elementally what are the elements that are in this are they engineered and what's the conclusion well I I'm not I'm going to leave it to the people that are doing it now who have much better machines and I had any Cliff Notes yeah they from what I understand there is Atomic layering there are there levels of it like we do with graphene we lay down these layers that are basically oriented at a certain degree that's how you get a superconductor or something like that if you take a piece of graphene and you didn't it's highly machined so it's not doesn't deviate from that Atomic layering you can push it right through Isaac hot knife through butter is the weirdest feeling in the world could you just take this piece of what feels like graphene and it went right through butter because it's a superconductor in the heat from your hand melt the ice. That is a metal it doesn't occur naturally humans created it and it has special properties because of the way it's atomically layered so if these materials are from somewhere else then they're we we suspect that they're going to be highly machined that they're going to be created for special you so my whole point is our Material Science has not caught up with the physics that we understand for these filled potion systems I'm just telling you believe me or not but you'll hear more about it that did our Material Science 189 and today is our limiting factor and Hazard Material Science gets better as humans we know how these things work. A fuel source that's a whole nother conversation but as far as creating these machines that's what we're trying to do that's why there is secrecy we're trying to exploit the technology because whoever xploitz it first wins it's a game-changer we don't want Russia to do it we don't want China to do it if we had a non-reaction our propulsion system the world will look different instantane as far as creating these machines that's what we're trying to do that's why there is secrecy we're trying to exploit the technology because whoever explicit 1st wins it's a game-changer we don't want Russia to do it we don't want China to do it if we had a non reactionary proportional system the world will look different instantaneously</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> now when you came back and what do you do with this information to report it do you talk to people about it so the typical process anytime we fly everything gets dbree so because I was a two-seater airplane the junior person in the jet goes down so the boss so I wasn't there so so take it down and its really to exercise the system when were in training so that when we actually get over to in this case we are going over to the Persian Gulf do you know anything that we do comes and gets deeper then and I'll get sent off that's how you get to CNN video and all that so they go down and we change the subject we don't know what it is you know and of course everyone now it's going to make jokes cuz we know we're going to catch it because he works and I told him I said videos of the comics I have them on my phone we do the airplane comes out so we know it's going to come down so he goes any deed they debriefed us both Crews going in and of course I Ever Wanted Intel thinks this is hilarious so the flight that you know Chad comes in with his tapes solar light post it so they copy it they play at there's a big that looks like a rack system they put the 8 million it gets copied to a hard drive and then they say archive it so you go okay so I got this video and then you know the ship you know about 30 minutes I mean it spreads virus Admiral knows about it the capital ship knew about it and then all the movies cuz we have to play movies for us on the ship and they run like a 12-hour Loops of course the movie selection is Men in Black Men in Black II signs Independence Day and we're going to be on the airplane, cuz there's always a comic so you do something stupid like this then ornamental workouts I got a spot on the run so it's like you know there was happy about the first day and a half early died down and then it was. There's always that closet people that you don't think that are really like UFO Buffs then you know like we had one and one and one of the Marines would always come and eat with you on my mind almost 4,000 hours Appliance now did you encounter anyone else that had a similar experience the gimbal video one of my talk to you daily a friend of mine totally different keep in mind for the gimbal videos 2015 the funny part about the gimbal video in the East Coast ipso off the coast of United States are called warning areas and all the hours are if you look on a Aviation map Hardee's big areas that are blocked off by Blue and they say like whiskey 291 or whiskey 243 in is the gimbal Video available in the same way that that videos available yes these things were so prevalent out off of East Coast United States enters a couple of them so there's that you want to talk what they started seeing originally was these things and one of them almost hit by airplane almost hit one of these things but it looks like a cube inside of a clear beach ball so I don't know if it's actually like a surrounding or you don't know if it's a forcefield and you see kind of in the video Scott like in or around it where ours didn't I always laugh ago was a Tic Tac these are not that different stuff out there that we don't know I had two airplanes flying we fly when we go out to the train were usually have a distance you know we'll just a worker you know my mile apart ever fly us there flying out and their airplanes are deployed to combat spread and one of your planes almost hit smoothies goes close down like 50 feet down the side and almost hits one of these floating cubes inside of the beach ball and someone when's if you got 19 out to win and they talked about it these things are just sitting there so 60 or 70 people chant because The Radars the the new radar in the super Hornets is extremely extremely capable okay and it first when they started seeing stuff they were like it's just like maybe it's the radar just give me a false Target really doesn't give a false targets and then someone did exactly what are out there and when you see a heat signature what does that what what is a targeting for advanced sits on the left side of the airplane and its launch it like a flare looking infrared receiver when you see the bombs blowing up on TV and it's that looks like a black and white and that's the targeting pod got a laser in its got and I are marker in it it's it's a very capable system that syncs up to the to the Hornets everything kind of Mary's out so fast now it's the other one it's the one that looks like that what is that what's called the go-fast that looks like a Tic Tac A1 taking out the East Coast but the gravity hook marked out it's going it's screaming across the ocean at a very high rate of speed and there's been some deep bunkers that say wow that's really not going that fast it's just the way the airplane is and how the mechanics of the Potter working when you talk to the crew cuz there's actually I can ask my but I'm pretty sure it's the same backseat or took both of these videos took the go fast video and the gimbal video and my buddy was on a flight with the gimbal video but they be saying so I call my bud cuz I'm like how many people are seeing these things are not going to like 60 or 70 60 60 70 people had seen these things on radar and I said what are you doing I said damn which is a notice to Airmen that just says hey these things are out there so just be careful cuz we don't want you to hit one and I said well cuz it was all white and it didn't have any markings on it and it didn't have any wings and it didn't have any rotors and it was just outperform anything that we have I think if I would have painted china-russia on the side is this the gimbal video yes so it's the same pod look all over look at the essay page so we have a situation awareness page and went whatever the radar is getting Returns on it will show up it's kind of like our God's eye view in the airplane so the Pod can only look at one thing so he doesn't Nate's that is his primary target so that's where the pot is stir the radar still seeing everything else so what they're actually seen this video is what you're when you see that the object that he's tracking when I was talking to one of the other Pilots actually when you see the radar video there's like a almost looks like a form in front of them like five smaller ones that are moving in front of it and then they turn so like a formation A6 turns and starts going the other way and then why they're filming the gimbal video that's kind of The Conjuring her dude holy cow look they're all over this is unreported new information that that he's actually saying right now everybody knows this video this is the one that they say turns like the Lazar craft like belly first however what he telling you right now something that is not public yet he's telling you that there was a V formation of objects that the public has yet to see you're not going to if you're not going to the radar tape there were more objects surrounding this is what he's telling you right now it's just fascinating because the world doesn't know that yet just so you know I mean that's brand-new that's never been reported by New York Times a buddy 47 so they're actually turning into it so it's starting to pull it back towards NOCO the number at the top is decreasing and it's against the way now he's in TV mode and this thing's going to start running, see it's got that or around it he said they were saying that the the ones with the squares inside that look like a beach ball with the same and it's on the airplane call Lazar described describe that that these things would lay flat and then when they would travel they would turn it on their side and that's that's how they maneuvered so this is very similar eerily similar to the propulsion system it was our talked about and that's why this video we're seeing it very differently now especially with what we know about Lazar but the idea is to would fly belly first and high-speed mode so if they have these are gravity propelled this is something this known within the government they are trying to back engineer they're trying to understand it we know there's a program currently that they said is is gone however it is currently active to study this these things will turn belly first the saucer type looking ones and then that's the high-speed mode because they they focus of allegedly you know these grab you a pamphlet fires look this thing turns mechanically there no typical form of propulsion as an expert is telling you this is not a glitch this is seen by multiple Radars multiple people Commander fravor was so close to it this is something that is not aerodynamic and it could move in ways and factors when he's under playing it when we first talked the idea of this thing going it's instantaneous acceleration back and forth of slowing down no turning like a ping-pong ball I said my first talk ping pong ball in a nothing moves like that with traditional reactionary propulsion somebody has technology that we don't have in our inventory at all so this is counterintuitive the way it goes from being aerodynamic to being an aerodynamic when it goes sideways and it flies belly Ford that's correct its your high performance airplane does not have hours worth of gas I mean you don't want to see if we don't have aerial refueling you know when we're actually out doing a mission and fighting and going fast you know you're talkin hour-and-a-half and you're coming back to land some airplanes leave unless you know based on their size and also like an F-16 doesn't have external fuel tanks it doesn't have a lot of gas in the Soviet airplane to the same way to make 29 does not have a lot of gas the su-27 c30s wait because of its performance size of the airplane so you know even even are InterContinental bombers like B2 they still take off in the air or fuel they keep topped off so I can get to rain. 2 weeks 10 things you got something like this that's coming down and I just think of the physics so just so they're coming from above that they're coming straight down they stop at around 20,000 feet they hang out for 3 hours and then I go straight back up so and I know you had a lot on the show so SpaceX is really excited because they can launch a rocket and then they can have the booster come back to earth and actually land on a pad very impressive engineering feat next of this technology that's like a Model T next to a Porsche really that's it you know when you got something that can just at will move around and I'll take it to the next level and I know this is a lot to talk about this so things going to go into speculation mobile you take a shape like that so just take the Tic Tac shape which is shaped like a submarine if you're if you're using a propulsion it's non-reactive where you're just manipulating the medium that you're in are whatever you can go into the water so when you see here the all the reports of hey we've seen these things since in a World War II that would come out of the water and fly if you have a technology like this as long as the object is Seal read I can't get water inside of it there's nothing that says you can't do that because all you're doing is you're not you know where a jet engine sucks in air and blows out the back or a propeller actually pushes the water the 4th now you got something that's actually manipulating the gravity field and it's just moving to avoid then it doesn't then are you can literally in theory fly go into the ocean cruise around pop back up fly around go to space gravity field that's just moving to avoid then it doesn't then are you could literally in theory fly go into the ocean cruise around pop back up fly around go to space nothing that you you remove the barriers of the normal proposing that we have today</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so have you communicated with anybody that has any thoughts on what these things are doing or whether or not there's any consistency to the size of them or whether or not they they think they're coming out of a larger object or anything along these lines know you can ask while cuz I was asking you what do you think they were doing you know what I said watching number two is they were communicating cuz I think you know in my heart I think there was something under the water I don't even know what it was doing there but because of when you saw the X the cross looking at thing explain that again so did the disturbance suddenly be in the shape of a cross to the east underwater by like you know 10-15 feet so is his ways are coming across when a kannada hit that object are going to break on top like you would with us armored like a seamount so and it's their breaking and that's where the chick that cuz that's the only reason we saw the Tic Tac that's what your eyes down there as we see the white water when it's a perfectly clear day with no white caps and you do oh what's that and then you see the Tic Tac and you know what you want to chase in a Tic Tac and we turn we're right there and we turn around and there's no Whitewater It's Just Blew as far as you can see so at that point Hugo okay what was it doing because there's obviously something there that's not there now so that's why I say well it's it was observing us it was could have been communicating with whatever was there and then someone else looked at me and said you know I was talking to Luke about prepping the battlefield I go okay you know so if you go in or these things probably don't know from China Russia someplace else I don't know but it's a capability that we do not possess to my knowledge ask me in 2004 cuz there's a lot of guys go out and get some secret government program I go all right well let's let's let's be honest one if you have a propulsion system that made it gave the capabilities and we be observed visually that that's a huge leap for mankind. So you would say for it was something somebody had this some government had this out a yard whatever if he comes now you go 15 years later you don't think that technology would have emerged because it would literally would change everything we do I mean we're happy about you know hybrid and electric cars and all this other stuff but if you got something that works like that are trying to change your travel forever no visible system of propulsion blooms architect that can move at will through the air at speeds well beyond what we've ever witnessed I mean even when you watch a rocket go off you know want to eat Lawns or one of the NASA whatever you do you sit there and lie girl during the Apollo ages and where you just look at the thing go up up up up up I see him shot out of Vandenberg Rico at my house in central California and you watch you go up and go I can watch that thing for a while this is something that just like poop and matter of seconds is gone now her other pie for other people that have side of these things have they also reported something larger that's in the water near it no no not the ones I talk to you I mean I think you know you can about people talking about stuff but not believe it is what it is there's no reason groups of people that are making stuff up like someone came out on ours was talking about and he's like I I saw the whole the whole video is 10 minutes long and it was doing all this it's b******* what you see is that's literally the entire video it's a minute-and-a-half longer thinks about what people haven't seen that I saw him and I've seen the radar takes cuz I have in my quadrant you know I've heard you know the Men in Black talk to the guys who actually witnessed it chased it and is one of the senior guys about her right it's also possible that that men in black stuff with something that they used to do back in the day and that that programs no longer continued and you know it from Jeremy you would know this the older sightings when they go back into the dating to the historical sightings and I'm not not Columbus but you know he had 50s and 60s did they have similar things that they talked about or something moved in this manner yeah it it's absolutely incredible dumb this down cuz that's how I had to understand it when I was talking with Greta paper years before I kept his secret years before New York Times blew it up I told him is probably going to happen it wasn't by me we're talking about it this system that we have seen for over 70 years just documented by our military this is so important this is a non reactionary field propulsion system everything we know is a reactionary propulsion system pushing me out the back fast forward this is not like a MAG system this is a gravitational field propulsion system and throughout history our military has documented them and there has been ridiculed and I'll tell you exactly why 1952 there was a huge flyover of Washington DC Jets were scrambled all the papers covered it is very famous you know case everybody can look up it's an important case because at that time a policy was started and that policy started because it crashed Communications that teletypes went down the Panic of the UFOs that were being seen by people with fighter pilots trying to capture and try to engage them and a necrosha teletypes so our government was like oh that's not happening again because eating a rush I could use that as a scare tactic so this policy of denial don't look here nothing to see move on UFOs are are fake that's what Project Blue Book was tasked to do specifically the guy that ran it admitted that it was tasked to debunk this and demystify the UFO think that's J Allen hynek correct right I also yeah Jr hydock he was once asked by a friend of mine do you have the Smoking Gun I'll give you the documents pretty amazing it's an Air Force manual where they explain what they know about UFOs at that time in 1967 but here's the point yes this is been going on since the beginning of recorded human history these propulsion systems that are captured on footage you know that is confirmed bye-bye the Paragon like Commander fravor experienced this technology is not ours it's it was here seventy years ago you still got 15 years ago we thought we would see it now these exact things at 20,000 miles an hour going on seventy years ago documented somebody has a non reactionary fuel propulsion system now are they aliens or some sub-sect of humans you know somebody has them and they're fine through our airspace with impunity and pilotseye commander fravor who by the way defended Los Angeles overnight after 9/11 I'm innocent guy we put all of our trusted he was defending Los Angeles right after 9:11 so we got people like him colored 14 I saw this and you get internet Warriors being like it's a bird it's a glitch it's Superman</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> many instances of sidings off the coast of California things that plunge into the water or or escaped from the water and take off into space so yeah they would this field propulsion system as Commander favorite describing as bizarre describe it doesn't matter the medium of space air or water there's no resistance no splash and this goes back to you know Christopher Columbus reported a UFO sighting oh yeah so this is been around this idea that you can go through these different mediums he'll pause for Christopher Columbus of the UFO sighting yeah it's it's a written account so it's like fun that no video but it's not the most documented it's not the most dramatic however it has had the most impact out of any sighting because of his credibility and the mere fact that they're the New York to picked it up with video footage radar evidence and somebody who is as credible as Commander favorite has changed the dynamic of the way people the government response new Navy protocols because of command favor coming for the closed-door Congressional and Senate briefing he's been part of them he's admitted that before there's a new study about UFOs because of this encounter it's so much evidence has so much power to it compared to other ones cool story somebody wrote down who knows who knows if he even wrote it down we have highly documented cases this one has changed our culture and that's what's so cool people are talkin about it differently so here's a good story this is true. Sitting at home and get my wife cell phone cuz it's the first one on the cell phone bill and it's all in my name so I get to see this call from California lady says his grandfather and I go who's calling and she goes I'd like to talk to me in a free Raikou who's calling and she says hi I'm a 79 year old woman and I would just like to tell him I store I go you're talking to him and she goes I've never in my life told anyone this she has my I grew up my dad was in the Navy she was I was stationed in Rhode Island at first when she was a child she said we were walking her mama walking on the beach and they saw these weird lights so that kind of got her into that she fears later they moved to San Francisco so I imagine Treasure Island is at our age it would have been the oppressive 50s her dad is she had her dad is working as a Navy liaison to the agency and he came home one day and he had a telegram his hand and she goes for some reason he let me read it and it was I always remember that she said he looked at me and said we get these all the time and it's always in the same area and I go course I go well you got the telegram she Coast course not had to take it back to work I said you don't have to remember that latitude-longitude she said no she goes but you seem to be so credible and believable she cuz I wanted to tell someone the story that I've never told anyone in my life so that's what you're starting to see is people that you know very they're not they're not crazy they're not making stuff up but they're coming out and going hey I've had these experiences I've got a lot of that from over the last 2 years or people just find my email and send me stuff saying hey this happen to me I saw this and some things are explained in Hornets right so when you put on night vision goggles they amplify light like a lot so you can see a campfire like 50 miles away so he used to do with a good spots for down in like El Centro California there's a range camping in the Superstition Mountains which is Imperial by CCF campfire any UFO time and then you get the airplane going about 600 knots and then you pull the power back title so you can hear it and you get zing and towards the fire will you turn the lights are on now cuz we're in restricted area so we can do that and there's lights on it that you can only see if you're on night vision goggles so the other airplanes alarm light off you count to three upon them off and then you just go away instant UFO Reporting I'm sitting on the desert it's all quiet and all the sudden there's a little lights in the sky and they go in it's gone explainable cuz I guarantee they were phone calls made on some of the stuff that we guarantee you're not the only one who's ever done that.</div>

Naked together on the and I was like oh my God like this is and it was never really sexual before that like there was little flirty things like when it's talking to make a f****** move in like he did but he was on Ambien and black I like this guy is like the guy that I've been talking to them about Iver radio shows every morning I go in and like debrief my producers and last night we like hooked up and it's happening and and then I talked to him later on and he was just like what are you talking about I was like I don't really know we talked last night it just stopped and then it happened to me recently again recently my friend gave it to me because I guess I shouldn't say that but my I took some and Aunt because I was just having a really rough time I did the Roosevelt Baldwin and I was not getting enough sleep which I know you guys were talking about the other night and I had a meltdown and Netflix taping to do the next night my friend was like take the champion you're not going to sleep otherwise and I took it and it and I took Instagram off my phone and took took Twitter on my phone I cleared my room of food cuz you know what's going to happen when I sleep in my life though I don't know if I'm going to get racist when I do an Ambien what if that is what causes him very clever thing that's very smart of you I don't want to get canceled yet someday it will want to get canceled</div>

Just if you're in the public eye people choose cult leaders right they don't choose them for their positive qualities they get sucked into this idea of this person liking them and being on a team with this person and if that person is a strong person it's even more intoxicating Donald Trump's a strong person celebrities are strong people celebrities are famous like I would hate to lie but I support you because you're going to have those what you've done there's people out there that still that show up A R Kelly and they have assigned I'd say we support you those b****** knew what they were in for like really this is something is going on right now to this day it's because people get incredibly drawn to someone who's in a position of Fame and power like like a Donald Trump or or anybody and Louise one of those two so it's not it's not that the people who love him don't always love him and people love Louis before and they forgive him for what he's done articles in just like if he reads them it just like burns on you it hurt you too and he's ever super sensitive God yes but it's still it's not and yet Google alert for your name when when you know 1 out of 10 articles as may be negative about you but he's doing all right I mean like I talk to him after it one night at The Comedy Cellar and he told me some examples of things that have been said to him in public like cuz I just asked him I was like what is it been like for you this is right when he came out of hiding and he told me some stories of things that had happened in public where a woman wants whispered and you know he's at a store or something and then another one we're just a woman blatantly in the street was like f*** you you know and it was like oh my f****** god this is a nightmare for you walking outside your house and I'm like this to this disease has only two times and I don't think you deserve to suffer that much I'm just saying I think as many people hate him as maybe would have anyway because no one can be famous for too long without people hating them about like why the interesting and cuz you pushed out fat kid in front cuz you survived it like you're laughing so it's a f*****-up thing that someone would say at a comedy club when you take that out of context say now then people get angry at it but that is a classic Louis CK line I mean that sounds exactly like Cookie Monster bet you're so right that was the first 10 creation of that but yeah he's working on it while you're with the survivors just because they survive doesn't mean they're interesting that's that this truth and then you got guys like Judd Apatow about it like is if this is like glue final statement on the subject and it's this at especially by other Comics like that I found that the whole thing to be so f***** up like you know what a bit is and you know when someone's triage don't you ever Charles make people feel really sad and angry and they feel hurt by it and they write mean things to me saying that I've hurt their feelings and it feels shity and when people hate you I feel so I do feel for him that way I do and I like what does it look like you're the most beloved and then you were hated mean that's got a f****** suck his kids he couldn't leave done that you would have gone to Africa to disappear wherever you know somewhere to disappear but his kids he couldn't leave until he just had to sit around with it so I mean with that for sure and that would suck</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> wondering why other people success or wondering why other people are successful is their Refuge of losers it's a loser mentality it's a loser occupation it's a it's a it's a loser practice because you're wondering why other people are successful like who gives a f*** you can say you think it sucks but the spend time wondering why someone is successful and hating on somebody is it's a poison that does the opposite of its intended effect the other person at all but it poisons yourself your energy and time are insecure when they showing me that you don't like yourself I try to be more clear and more concise way relay it the way I look at it is that your mind you have a certain amount of bandwidth is why I don't read Instagram comments or Twitter, or YouTube, I do mean time if I read them it's an accident but it just seek him out like you have bandwidth I don't spend time wondering why I hate things are hating things are hating on someone or being jealous you have let's say let's call it units you have a units of bandwidth in your mind so that means there's a hundred unit so you can spend on things you care about or you could let your mind be occupied by some stupid f****** Twitter feud that you're in with some idiot you don't even know and you could spend 30% of your Twitter ban with your mind bandwidth on this and then you only have 70% for the things you love and then maybe you're you're involved in some f****** relationship with someone is an idiot and you're arguing back and forth with them were there is another 30% it's gone you have 40% left your 40% for the things you love instead of 100% but if you only concentrate on the things you care about that mean something to you and learn how to do that like you were talking about meditation yeah it's a form of meditation because you're learning how to avoid the little road bumps in the ditches on the side of the road start doing well and you had less problems math problem that you had it was rotting you away no longer existed snelson to freeze up your time and you realize oh my God there's so many funny things that I can talk about and I have so much energy and I'm so healthy I could just go on stage and have fun and then you're killing it when was the last thing that you go no maybe gave it a little too much bandwidth do you still struggle with those things not really anymore remember the first meeting has been a jealous dude in stand-up like when you first started out you had to pay the guy that was getting head like rate I don't know any male comic you know what how come he got this and he got that and then I remember thinking like this is a gigantic waste of time and I got into comedy because I'm a fan of comedy and my concentrating on people that suck or being jealous about people that are doing well does me is 0 good but instead if someone does well I can be inspired and I can get fired up by early twenties cuz in martial arts like you can't be jealous of someone else's ability you have to realize you might have to fight them someday so by realizing that they're really good you you are forced to be objective about it and you have to go to work like you have to go f*** that guy's better than me I got to get better and you have to go to work no there's no positive benefit in under estimating someone underestimate someone will get you f****** killed like literally fashion Smash in your face like you don't want to ever wonder about that the things that you're jealous of them for aren't really that's good that would get your that will get you killed so now than I've ever been but you know you see other women I mean my jealousies are always with other women it's just the way it is and I have to fight it and I'm really good about it now to be like actually inspired by women who are funny but that's awesome but it and use it to be like okay then I need to be better I need to get up to that level that is I need to go home and write it like fires me up as opposed to like it's like there's no negative aspect holy s*** you just crushed but she's out there killing it he's doing so good it makes me want to work harder and in that sense someone's not doing anything bad victimizing someone what they're doing is they're there their they're showing you that it's possible to do better than you doing that's good she's out there killing it he's doing so good it makes me want to work harder and in that sense it's not doing anything bad victimizing someone what they're doing is they're there their they're showing you that it's possible to do better than you doing that's good</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> sober October so mean or inverted Tom we have this thing he's got a IC Page Avenue started haven't started any book I'm listening to a bunch of books on tape which is most the way I consume books but and it's about how orgasms are ruining us and our relationships and our happiness and it talks about how I'm all for this right now and it's a wild concept and I've only read three three chapters of this book so just I don't have all the information but what I do know is that orgasms are this Rush of like blood whatever your your limbic system is all fired up when you have an orgasm and everything we do in our lives to like have stability and you know kind of lower anxiety and and fight depression is about balancing that and not spiking it ever orgasms are throwing us off constantly and we're not supposed to be having this many of them men men should here's the thing know about men and orgasms is that they they want to run right after they come it's in your DNA to get the f*** out of there because as a caveman it wasn't you can't make it something pregnant twice so once you came onto the next TV to f*** girl's cousin that you just like it wasn't about you weren't going to stay and cuddle but that's why men want to f****** run if you don't actually like the person if you only attracted them and horny if you're only attracted to them and horny be don't like them as a person yeah once you come like oh my God we gotta get out of here but if you like them as a person once you come you like that was great I just want to hang out actually I do trust you but I also think that they're you would want to hang out even more if you didn't come really here's my thing though I've had a lot of instances this book spoke to me because I cannot Trace what happened between a guy liking me and not in slow fading me then to an orgasm without any derogatory intent same as fall you're a lot of work but doesn't mean you're bad just means you're you're a powerful person you got a lot going on my theory on human beings no one is for everybody does not one person out there that's a perfect fit for everybody but if you find someone who has your the Right Slots for your hands like it fits in like this than you could but if it lands like this when they have two things like their big tits and they like to f*** buddy right and then sometimes that horniness not attractiveness you get confused and think you actually like the person and you drain it seem like you're a liar but you're not a liar at the time before you come you're Being Earnest but then wants you spewed you like I got to get the f*** out of here yappy yappy yappy perfect with him the way you talk on and funnies that's the thing like what changed between mean he's hanging out you liked me and then I sucked your dick and now you don't watch my Instagram stories anymore the liquor was he what I thought maybe you're too busy but here if you like that's how you show you like someone now and Instagram time is Super valuable for me I'm not watching anybody's f****** Instagram tags no one I watch them need to let this guy know that I like him so I'll just flip through I'm very quick I won't even watch him but I want my face to pop up so he knows I'm interested it's just a way to be like hey I'm into you and it's just a way to indicate now it happened it's happened to me with a couple guys I really liked that they're into their interested and then after we hook up no more in the end it's not because I wasn't good at what I was doing I really don't think it's that or like why do you have an idea of what it was without asking well I have asked and a lot of times a one-time they've said and then I think it's actually tells me know a couple times actually I get there too vulnerable with me and then I've seen too much in terms of like they've let me in in a way emotionally that they've never let a woman in before and then they're like they're I remind them of the fact that they might have cried with me or something and then they don't want to be around anymore emotionally that they've never let a woman in before and then they're like they're I reminded them of the fact that they might have cried with me or something and then they don't want to be around anymore</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Simone figure I can't but yeah I mean I don't drink and this is absurd to me that I would have a beer 2009 living my best life when was the last time you drank 2011 December 9th Cleveland hilarities I was just doing a blackout from like two drinks because my mind Donnelly is a great joke about it where he says he would black out very quickly after a couple drinks cuz his mind was like we know where this is going shutting down early like if you know it's going to be you're going to blackout your brain just blacks out earlier cuz everytime I drink I would walk out so I just I woke up that morning the next morning and I'd only had a I wasn't a hard night of drinking a couple beers but I was just the sickest I've ever been anything about hangovers that I really had to look at was like the best part about being sick if you're going to find the best part about being sick it's that people feel sorry for you give babies a little bit you gets a nurturing from your friends and family that you don't get when you're healthy but when you're hungover no one gives you that so you're sick and you don't even get the only good thing about being sick which is people feeling sorry for you I don't think you piece of s*** you did it to yourself so I was like in the shower and in the fetal position thinking this is how I should feel if I'm dying like I want to feel this bad unless I am on my way out so I'm not doing this anymore and I read a book and when I was done smoking the easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr so many people have read it it's the one book that when you've tried everything else nothing else works this book my mom quit smoking after 35 plus years so many of my friends I heard about it I think like Ellen Degeneres and Ashton Kutcher I heard a bunch of celebrities kind of talking about it I read the book and you can smoke while you read it and then by the end of the book he just promises you he goes go have a cigarette and there's like no I don't want to but I don't need to his bus it is in this is thing you does with drinking any excuse you have to do that thing he talked you out of it he tells you a reason why your excuses actually bull set and there's no science behind it that and he he disproved any reason that you have to do it and we've been brainwashed by tobacco and alcohol Industries to believe that quitting is really hard and quitting alcohol is hard if you have an infection even the guy from it obviously but with tobacco it's part of their propaganda to tell you that it's hard to quit smoking they're the ones pushing that mess message or message which seems like why would they tell people that are but they're doing that because if it's hard you won't quit so that has been their message to be like it's so hard to quit smoking it's so hard when really it's not know that the withdrawal symptoms of not smoking last up to two weeks I think it's less than I think it's like 7 to 11 days and the discomfort caused by wanting a cigarette is the same discomfort as being a little bit hungry you're a little bit annoying it's like it's not instrumental it's uncomfortable but it's a passes after 7 till 11 days I think it is and then it's even when you're going through it it's not that bad but it's it's the psychological effect of thinking it's hard that makes it then hard so once he proves you not that hard and any excuse you have to smoke which is like it calms me down that raises your blood pressure so that's right it makes me more social actually it isolates you you know it if you really look at it every time you smoke you feel kind of bad people it took every excuse you have and then you did it with drinking too I went through this book I read it you can drink while you read the book you have to want to quit to pick up the book you have to want to be like I want this out of my life I don't know how to get it out of my life and I gave this book to so many of my friends and my friends don't drink anymore and a lot of them you know use program or other things to supplement but all I needed was this book and I was done and I'll tell you I drink every single night of my life and I never thought I could live without it it was just I was like anyone listening that's like no no no you don't understand all my friends drink my life it's my social life it's my work life it was everything to me it's all I look forward to yeah I'll never go like this when my friend and there's a bar again like because I don't drink I am f****** killing it my life changed I can trace my careers before and after like on the. So you know it's not for everyone if you have a problem you should maybe look into it but that book seriously changed my life that sounds amazing and there was no difficulty in quitting you know I was dating a guy though like just wanted to have a glass of wine with him with why can't I just have a glass of wine and I've been tempted and I don't think that I would go off the deep end again but but I don't I just I go back to that book and I'm just like I just any reason I can get myself it's just really it isn't true and I'm better without it I know the lubricant your fun with friends. Laughing and joking around but you don't have that ability to stop there is that too but then that person and you promised yourself you're just going to have to but then you get that voice drunk and that voice is like to have another you can't talk to your so you can't plan for how you're going to feel two drinks in because you get drunk and then you it just keeps going just missed it man even the problem is even thinking you can drive drunk because when you're drunk you don't know what the f*** you can do or can't do cuz I think that's why I got to get in fights with people when they're drunk and they don't even know how to fight your stupid I'm fine I can even know if you find that's the problem the problem is you're drunk and that's a big part of the book is talking to people about this liquid courage that everyone say to me and like I need a drink because I can't go on stage if I don't have a drink I need a drink to talk to the girl and it's not courage what you're doing is you're making yourself more stupid yeah the problem is you drunk and that's a big part of the book is talking to people about this liquid courage that everyone say to me and like I need a drink because I can't go on stage if I don't have a drink I need a drink to talk to the girl and it's not courage what you're doing is you're making yourself more stupid</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> turn up in Akron and like you guys had to feel like you were on the outside of the music business right like the business itself was in Nashville and LA and New York and you know growing up in a in a town do you think there's an advantage what we did but oddly Pat and I had a connection to the other real music business both in our family my cousin was Robert Quine guitar player who played with Lou Reed and Richard Hell &amp; the voidoids one of the first Punk guitar players influential in the Pats uncle's Ralph Carney saxophone player played on all the time waits records B-52 records all kinds of Records it was weird you know by the time we were selling at like a hundred fifty-two hundred rooms we were like we f***** it made it this is it f****** awesome this is what we wanted and then we would be like what if we try to sell out the 400 seat room what if we know it would just kind of slowly went and finally we got to the point where we like or what if we try to play Madison Square Garden that's really work started from playing that his tortoise be like in Brooklyn New York was like hoping for a Ska band on a Monday night in a Brooklyn 450 bucks we drove all the way from Akron 8 hour day 8 hours each way I made $50 got there another down the road that's what makes it interesting like the the managing of the mind you know I mean Dan are both pretty confident but we're also or not like did you know that I think you're only as good as your last show really you know his good as your last record and you know you can't escape by on your s*** all new bands growing up that kind of did right they had a couple good albums and then things kind of went off the rails do to take my favorite bands like going out with Devo cuz they're from Akron and they're like this different kind of crazy band punk band but something special about Ohio we watched you like a medieval times does he get to get to La and whatever happened they are the change that happened and there's something I mean that's in something today and I've been actively trying to avoid is that that kind of thing you know but yeah that's like Dominic is back a real individual get my s*** turn at me by my friends and they're going to make fun of me for whatever rightfully so because it kind of is a vacuum in people who operate in there like 99% of them operate because they have no other choice that and they love doing what they're doing music was so you go to a New York the first time you know the smallest little band has a connection to the biggest producer and you know that's why I like extra seriously so f****** massive City its biggest County in the country in the music industry is here and take the last 20 years of great bands from Los Angeles to have a long list same with New York City you know if you go to the last 40 years those doesn't grow that much do you think it's better best I think if you can really integrate with the music industry peripherally on the outside it's always best house at what do you mean like if you end up signing a major label like what we almost I know we got some offers early on to sign the major labels early on we did not do it mostly because they like the cotton except we kept being strung along like the contract will be there in a week a week or past worship 2 weeks past week all it'll be there next week finally we like f*** this realized at the age of 22 we realize if we signed the ship and they can't get a contract us to even look at in six weeks if we make a record we're going to be so f****** Log Jam. Like we're never going to be able to do this s*** so we we took the gamble we sign with the small Indian just kept f****** going you know and when we finally went to a major it was on a subsidiary of a major with really supportive president and we were kind of an outside still even aware run outside and we were able to do our thing we've never had an ARG I sit around and tell us to speed the song up or or whatever but it bothers if you get in without having some of those boxes ticks and you get into son of Bigfoot big record deal off the bat some f****** dumbass who has a communications degree from like from Pepperdine sitting down too loud bro I was talking about that's that right there and when you get those notes coming from some do this your A&amp;R guy that doesn't really notice to enter major are good A&amp;R guys but most of them are these types of foods and I'll be like yeah man like it's basically what they are doing right then when they get in your head like you got to change that I had on the mix man what they're saying is when this record f****** fails and I can't deliver that any sort of fandom to you that I want to say that you turn the hi-hat down I turned the Hyatt Eden turn down low enough is all compounds everywhere and the only way to get to that is due to we we learn how to make record yourself in a basement we have tape machine $100 tape machine and RadioShack microphones and we've recorded our first record like that we did our second act like that third record like that our fourth record like that and finally we went into the studio dangermouse and we knew how to run I'm mixing desk and I mean we knew what we liked so if someone came in that wasn't dangermouse and was like this or one of the mission answers we worked with if someone came into the kick drum sounds like it would be like f*** off if you can spend the time get the time I get there that's why that's why I get back in the day it's like a record deal band takes years to develop took us took us eight years before we got us on the radio of actively make a record tutoring in a lot of this stuff set up with labels or they want like a hit on the second record you know my I'm married to a woman who sold millions and millions of albums and songs that she wrote you know and when she turned in an Americana record like Warner Brothers gave her sets the run-around the shelves of record the cost 800 because it said there wasn't any hits on it that's that's no way to be an artist you know what I mean that's what we've just always avoided that didn't even bother trying to release it to cut their losses no man and then they charged her for it and then the dropper I mean that's that's that's why so they shall but they never really said yeah they never really isn't it just drop her what might my I learned all that stuff earlier cuz my uncle Ralph who Dimension was signed to Warner Brothers in the late 70s he made a record with his band called tin Huey it sold like five thousand albums you know like failure and then they gave him like 30 grand of buck off and they made a made a record in between it happens all the time, any good do they have shelved what do they do with them ultimately like if people know about there's a lot of good records Cloud shut the outside started off really good and then some Pepperdine dudes remix this you need to remix it you need to do the end of the address to do this do this Regency remember if you're really a producer musician that makes records and you turn it like you turn in a record it's so frustrating when you get someone that doesn't know what you're doing come back like that maybe you should do this actually had to happen to me I hope there's a band called The Sheepdogs is Canadian band that actually this record end up going platinum in Canada in the US and never even got pushed the radio. Not even one song but this guy Chadwick who didn't I work with all the time who is mr. last for records she mixes record this guy's like a genius in audio wizard wizard it was in Wales in a little house on his wife works with horses he's got a little side room to Stein in the room just like half the size of this and he mixes huge records do cheap Studio Custom front of a friend of mine who's going to engineer it them to live and the rest of it went to chat to mix it so I get that I get the mix is back in the day and our guy listening to the mixes and it's like I think I think that high hats too loud on this song I'm not joking I called you know what to do it's been largely that's right but then you also need to remember you you are f***** now they will never service this song because that's the cop out other b******* is not just watch and it is exactly what happened vice president who reports to the president and if you stick your neck out and you say I want to take a million dollars from the f****** machine and I want to I want I bet bet at all in this van quarter million dollars the odds of any ban making it I like probably one in a hundred every time I even breaking even if you only an idiot would ever really get behind a band that is unproven your whole job is to deflect blame you're so like that's why that's what the problem is you know like if I was going to sign a band and someone offered me he said I had $1000000 budget to sign a new band like I also wouldn't give him all the money cuz there's no way I'd make it back and I mean yeah and if you're lucky like with Dad and I walked out and then you look back and feel like I don't even know how I happened with all these other factors that come into it you know and you go try to help a band once something at work for us whenever work for another band so there's no there's no formula to it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> go break off the road for years and we came back 3 years after brakes make a record it was like we'll get you a vehicle and a lot of perspective you know and our conversations when we first started making this record aside from like watching the news and talk about that and black make each other laugh and ship it was like this band is something to hurt really f****** special fact that we're sitting in this you know 18 years after after starting this band and it f****** working out every year we need to make sure that this band is always something that's fun and not a burden and not stressful as a little stressful should be funds rock and roll decision so that way you know so like first of this show we like do you want to do this TV shows TV shows do we have we both watch Joe Rogan listen Joe Rogan I wide happen to watch it what we want to do Joe's podcast that's what we want to do that's important to us we don't want to play with. Not important to us doesn't speak to us these are things we want to do and taking that type of position with the band and also looking at the the business side of it make this is f****** b******* this is ridiculous you know what what what what what I should be giving us his ability to help other bands which is what we do all day long or not to write I mean in The Last 5 Years Dan's produce probably like 15 albums for other artists I've done I have full myself he has a label puts out other people's music there's a lot of f****** work everywhere not too and we're still working other music in the craziest thing is this we still millions of Records we've made between the two of us something like sixty albums when I'm finish the record I'm really proud of and I sent it to Warner Brothers last time I did that they didn't even f****** respond to the email Antoinette when that s*** happens you you know what you want to do tell him the f*** themselves you know what I mean and right now we're in a situation where we're record contracts done you know and I saw what happened to my uncle Ralph do you need a contract go to work with people who understand that the Black Keys is is very important to us but it's also a vehicle that we can leverage to help our other artists when we're producing s*** and it's so f****** infuriating to have been in this business for 20 years and honestly understand the business better than most f****** managers and be treated like dogshit by this person that you made millions of dollars for do you know I mean it doesn't make any sense that you need anything like that to do is have Studio fees or if you have your own studio produced the music and then once people know your s*** is out no but it's different because it's different that we don't need s*** but if you take a new artist from Nashville to say and you make a record for them they need an agent they need they need they need they need to go into her they need to do all the stuff that we did what we were like malnourished freaks are my rent was $145 we started and we practice in my basement and Dan lives in his parents house we didn't have we could we could make like $200 a month and be in the rest are in the black wow well I'm just saying that most bands aren't two pieces most bands aren't like human cockroaches like the podcast where you played new music and then s*** the way you do now it will be gigantic maybe I can just go on the road just to Pat and Dan you can call Pat and Dan on the road and you guys just do it from your tour bus where we just let him wind them up let him talk s*** about things and then play music like music that you really enjoy if someone like Spotify wouldn't jump on something like that they'd be crazy it's a great idea and you could use it as a platform to help artists avoid the system entirely I'm thinking that might work but also if we just tweeted Mark Zuckerberg that we need 245 million dollars he probably do it a good deal if someone wanted to do something like that it's a great idea because you can use it to launch like that like I've done with the comics on this podcast you find people that are funny let everybody know it's not hard get it get a group of people that are really interesting keep the conversations going keep more cool people coming in and then you can use that to help other cool people and let him I know you can do it through your social media you do it through a podcast and of course you guys are still going to do the same stuff you were already doing with producing people and helping them out but you definitely can have your own distribution network but be ethical free or ethical quandary free like a thing about it you just give it to him for free you just do it as a podcast of broadcasting hey check out this f****** band I love this song play it I think I guess what I'm saying is you're going to need an agent to book shop but I do think it is about the music industry what is actually what something that I think that I think we're trying to figure out now is basically how to actually really work again truly independently you don't I mean where it is something that we can figure out a way to actually do the things were passionate about which is a lot of it is make records and end and help him even to make a record and press it is at least $10,000 so I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'd expect that someone will look at your work in the respected enough to come a step in and help out cuz it's not like you're asking for f****** millions of dollars a year to to finance some s*** asking for like a couple hundred grand but that's the problem with the music industry is that is that labels are are willing to give like a SoundCloud rapper like 15 million dollars you know but then they look at a band and they can't quantify their metrics like maybe The Black Keys or or whoever and they they don't give a s*** that will help me out with this guy do they provide that's crazy though how much is that a lot of people buying really isn't it isn't it isn't understand Market in there's some stuff like that but honestly I mean we we get more from like a Live Nation probably what is a record company do then like if you're a young artist that works and then they pray you have hit they pray you have a hit and if you do any want to leave then you're f***** by then if you don't they didn't they don't think so and I think that you want to leave and you got two records off the shelf that record to take avocado it was the most genius f****** credit this out this is how smart these f****** people are is like he said yeah man you know I don't think I really I really take a lot of pride in that band and really help them a lot by just staying out of the way who he didn't even write a check for 2 or support or no promotion he's taking credit cuz he was smart enough not to f*** it up the new Popeyes chicken sandwich I think I put the wrong post up a better attitude than the guy from I have would you prefer that guy who just get the f*** out of the way I would say annoying to you a lot of credit gets taken for a lot of s*** didn't it seems like a f****** frustrating and infuriating business and I glad I'm glad enough to participate in the comics there's no business like we're like in the f****** top 100 1% of this s*** and still f****** annoying every single f****** day it's just like it's the trick to the music industry is to piston it because if you really love music like the way that they the word is still the thing that were most passionate about give me like I love music I only think about music listen to it all day but yet you have to find that fine line for like you don't win like you make a record to rip out of and no one f****** hears it and no one that works with you even response to an email about it you have to find that space where you don't want to kill everybody you know I mean and you still want to go make another record and who need to be connected to someone like this though does this valuable thing in your world what to have this record company and I don't know I don't do it anymore to find any of that since changes is to learn how to Pivot and make it make it how to make sense so the real problem is Youngtown that's just getting started to get signed when they don't really know they're worth yet and they don't know how the problem is is that no one is investing in f****** real bands they're investing in like writer you're vested in the artist that that was a puppet that they can go in like say this person going to listen to this to this s*** they pop machine you think you could do it at the cleaner that you could do it your way look at the other time for something like that if I was to run a record label the main difference would be that I would look at it as let's try to f****** break even this realized some of the most important records here have never sold a million copies like the Ramones go to my copies of any of the records there may be the most influential punk band so what is this redefined what successes success is getting behind art that we really are proud of and not in it not getting trampled and I am getting the support that and eat Buccaneers do you want to subject the Bantu that do you want to be able to elevate that band to the point where they're actually doing that comfortably that's the hard part you mean 10 you though I think would be the same band not always right I think that you could yes it's possible depend upon the individual you know you were living with your parents and this is part of why you guys were so good because you f****** really wanted it you needed it you had to get to a better place we had no other option but I think that's what we see that same quality in other people have already been down that road artist that I'm working with now people like Yola and people like d White this is begging for an organization like your you will your passion for the new important we're already sort of doing it where it where I should have a radio station or a podcast that just talked about this these new albums and what's going on and what you're doing and I'm sure people would f****** love it and just play music play the music that you guys are producing play music that you enjoy that you find out about when it seems like there's a really easy fix for this angst I don't think there is because it's been going on for but for you there's a fixed at least there's a better path for some of the eggs people thinks is important because it is awesome but when I do talk about the business drivers like the thing is it mean when I I found this Photograph. I just hung up on my road case of Dan likely one of her shows and I got this is important I should be I should make sure I have this hung up cuz that this reminds me of all the f****** days we spent like being f****** miserable in a van because we love music so much we go play show for f****** nobody and maybe make enough money to get like a Motel 6 room share a bed get up the next day Waffle House doing it for years and years and years and years but it does take that type of motivation and itself it's frustrating when you do that and then you get to a point where it is the point that we're at and you feel like you've gotten really good at what you do and you help another artist and its you realize that like after all that work is like the myth of Sisyphus it's like oh after all that work at doesn't move the f****** clock at all still the same motherfukers what you do and you help another artist and its you realize that like after all that work it's like the myth of Sisyphus it's like oh after all that work at doesn't move the f****** clock at all still the same motherfukers are f****** f****** helping you know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah it's also what was that it was someone has a continuous message it's always the same and it's always positive it makes me really suspect cuz I'm like London self-help guy on the Metallica documentary who's offering lyrics probably about music I have to come down on some kind of monster and made me actually like the I've been made me as a fan appreciate those guys in a weird way there dysfunction like they became characters will at 1 to watch the movie of the oven like Lars is so annoying then I watch it again like I still think large is annoying but I still think he's right I have a different of you every time I watch it for everyone cuz everyone's trying to figure out what is this file sharing thing you how's it going to fit in in the music business you guys felt it first like you guys were the big hit more than anything cuz it's not the same to watch a movie on your TV even if you can download illegal movie I'm sure it'll have a little bit of a head but people want to go to the f****** movie theater but with your s*** they can once it starts people start sharing things you just you just get a file and everybody kind of just assumed that well I mean this is like this new frontier and it's not really stealing you're just copying it's just you're not giving the money for it but you're not really stealing got this this weird sort of and large was the first guy to say hey f*** you you're stealing I just but it was a weird fight to have because it's in hindsight is always 20/20 we know what the internet has become since then it's incredibly difficult to try to keep a wrap on things and to keep things that look like keep someone from downloading things like they just get there if you have songs they get out there you know where is the Napster thing was the first time this was happening and he was the guy who's is really really wealthy guy was a huge success saying don't do this like the this is stealing well as a david-versus-goliath type of thing I mean clearly people shouldn't steal but isn't Metallica's job to tell people that maybe but maybe maybe they should have gone directly the Napster north of the record label but I thought you know when streaming first started becoming like a real thing we had to talk with a friend of ours who basically encouraged us to look at it and and not do it and I went into with our manager went from talking to someone or bars and said we didn't want to do it and they were at like kind of outraged and like you can't not do it you can't not do it and I don't run but I found out a couple months later that day date I bought a couple months later because I ice I was quoted a rolling stone talkingshit about like Sean Parker and Spotify and it it will happen is I end up getting a phone call or email from from Daniel the owner Spotify and we had lunch together and he's f****** cool guy he's a nice nice guy very intelligent and I and I really saw his side of it for the first time and he basically without explaining it correctly was like you know that he's paying our label to get our music what they do with the money he can't control these are really like that at that moment was Eliezer some stock being floated to these companies which there was billions of dollars of stock was sent in the label has no obligation to give you many of us they gave us they gave us a couple hundred thousand dollars of it out of the billion because they paid it to us and the way the label does for the paid as an artist royalty and it took off. stop it and it was a made-up number it's it's there's a lot of money in the music industry right now that you know the end of problem is is that I take not okay so my favorite band for the most part don't have hit songs don't get played on KROQ they don't have like a Macarena type s*** on the risk of becoming their way in a minute and that's what pays money is like they could they treat almost every stream the same it's like there's a different prison royalty rate for if you pay Spotify royalty rate for if you're listening on the free service but what they need to do in my opinion is it need to say this guy is a Joe listens to music he has good taste in music he he he he follows 500 bands which means that there's no possible way that he's going to be listening to all 500 of those bands and even a six-month period of time but when he does choose to listen to a song it it's worth like acts like 10 axe versus this person who's listen to Old Town Road a thousand times a day because Joe is like actually engaging with our thing and not just dreaming the song for free and like a monkey like you know whatever mouth salivate and everything they hear the little little Old Town Road rubber they gave ownership to like 12 artist and they're like f*** you what the f*** is that just keep the ownership and pay a higher royalty you f****** c********** honestly dollars right and listen to a hundred songs that's it cuz I got so many ways to listen to music that you listen to take at 10 song and you give every that sucks but that's not the way to do it there like we pay point 0 0 0 5 6 7 cents per stream how could you f****** know what you pay for stream if your if your distribution service do you see him saying I'm giving you $10 and you take 30% off the top by Apple music used to do when you buy CD and then you take seven bucks and throw it towards the artist that would make sense to me but they don't they're like they're paying for keeping all this f****** cash order to keep it in a pile and then at the end satiating like you know Rihanna's hundred million dollar check she gets every year I know a lot of artists who just gets checks like $2.50 for a whole year on record that normally would sell like five or six thousand copies but there's no need to thank you have to basically be an idiot to buy a CD nowadays you know because it is a digital file that you ultimately could download from Spotify on your phone and have it with you forever yeah you know unless you don't have the internet and if you're in Alaska or North Dakota maybe you need to have a CD so so few people printing CDs their boils down to how much of it infrastructure do you need as an artist who who did how many people do you need to be representing you what how did your stuff get out there doesn't it doesn't get me especially with you guys doesn't it just get out there because I just found out about you guys can somebody tweeted it guys take the new bands coming outside the new bands trying to break it. That's what I'm worried about you it's like we're fine but it bums me out how much of it infrastructure do you need in this digital time well just need someone to figure out how to get it to Beaver I think it I think it in a way it's like when we first started our first record deal was with a small label not far from where we are here in the deal is this give us 12 Songs pay for the recording yourself will Master it which is the final process of making a record to cost a couple hundred bucks and we'll send you 50 albums and will give you like 12% of the money we make that was it and we can have a $500 marketing budget that was that was that was the deal you remain so we basically I mean we made this record paid for herself and we went on tour with his agent and Ralph Carrera booked us a tour that kind of a mercenary agent who like book believe what they paid him a couple hundred bucks to book us a tour and it all kind of started steamrolling you know I mean but we had no infrastructure with no management we have no agent we had nothing we just kind of got in the van started going and I think in a lot of ways nothing has changed except for that when we got to the second level you know the set like it there was a couple thousand dollars there for us to make a record there was opening slots that be nurturing was a little bit different then why do we always kind of done it in a way that was pretty DIY and the way it's the same way it has to function now the only difference is there's fewer record labels that are going to sit there and give you $15,000 to make a record and maybe give you ten Grand to help you buy a van and that's the hardest step that's that's the threshold for things dancer having a hard time getting through you know what you get through there then it's like then you get to where we were for years which is it you're on a bigger label you're making records and no one's paying attention to you only reason why we ended up getting attention paid to us I think by Warner Brothers was Far Rec R6 record Brothers it was a kind of a heavy time I just turned 30 then just turned 30 and you know when you turn 30 it feels like you've gotten old and like especially in the rock and roll business and we had those good release record I thought was great and I went into talk to we are going with their manager is really ours is one of the guys a heads of Warner Brothers and I and I was like where we're like that where the most sinks band on Warner Brothers which is when you get a song on the TV show or movie or a commercial that has no other band The Last 2 years that had as many things as we've had believe that I don't even know who works the radio Dept at Warner Brothers and we've been on your label for like 4 or 5 years and Leo are basically like that he prioritizes like that week for the first time was like we're going to work on your van and when that happened that's when the Lollapalooza s*** that's in the radio K-Rock everything f****** changed even took a 6 hours and it took us all those sinks all that shall getting called sellouts what time for a while and forgiving are songs going the same dudes that wherever First shows with their arms crossed still do the same music stupid the same music I mean it's it's not for this type of thing that comes from that idea that like maybe like oh that ban like that I liked it better when it was at my secret my friends and I Santa like top 40 radio and there was this thing right if we won record of the year for lonely boy one of ours is going to service that song to Top 40 it would have never probably been a hit but if we would have won Grammy it could have brought the whole band up I've seen it happen with lots of bands like you just it's just like you become like Playskool level we would have changed but the thing is is like you start accessing like you start accessing you start acquiring that's more fickle and maybe more annoying cat food feel like this is probably the same things like someone's going in there to get like so it's going to get shaving cream and this band that used to play it like the f****** Casbah San Diego is playing at the weather checking out like to finally talk this out in that time. It wouldn't matter your music is it is you got you know I mean it's not this even though you got experimental and you've done different styles of songs and some of them feel more bluesy some of them feel more right-sided still Black Keys If you guys just did that it wouldn't matter what you were on there we can stash it</div>

Here to eat in a regular meal and a thing right there the top and I swear that's open it up for me man was no natural light in the back of the van also all the windows had this really dark dark tint black tent oh so we were just in this Panic van I need to get outside yeah I remember when the sliding door won't open it was like when they went into Willy Wonka's place all the light came in and yeah and then it seemed like it was crazy cuz when we got back 3 f****** hours later like our drivers like to do if we got together we've been here for 20 minutes and it's been 3 hours of you guys talking about this dumpster we get back in and Dan listen to some music man it's so he put on NWA and I like we both started laughing as I get it sounded like Fisher-Price music like still plastic and brittle and it was like the most incredible sound record I've ever heard it was f****** insane but it was that experience it first me ever experienced in that like what the f*** is happening like kind of fight or flight but for no reason panic attack thing then I think yeah I deal with it mostly but I just when I'm onstage I still get them occasionally if I come in too fast this is not in my system is not is not for me you seem like you could have been a comic have you ever thought about being a comic I don't think I could I like bullshiting though but I definitely I know how do you say funny funny observations in your face have a Mean Streak I'm dancing dance personal comic that's basically it was the first one and then from then it may be as open up the door and because you had one and makes it easier to have another one is that how it works well I was exhausted that day because we were kids we were kids partying for I was I never been to Europe really we were Amsterdam I smoked weed the night before which I don't do when we were drinking and I barely got any sleep so super shity feeling so every time I'm like basically tired I'm more prone to that s*** and it's a happens like at the airport in Atlanta airport to me morning flights it's always kind of liked that was really hectic and like everything's f****** moving around and tired like f*** this is a f****** miserable and festivals sometimes they're so crowded in like but now I haven't had them have had a problem with him really but at does the hypnotism s*** worked always kind of liked that was really hectic and like everything's f****** moving around and tired like f*** this is a f****** miserable and festivals sometimes they're so crowded in like but now I haven't had them have had a problem with him really but at does the hypnotism s*** worked</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you guys do is awesome I love you music but I I feel your I just want you to do it you know just when there's little contests and this is number one in this one's on this and this is the band of the year the album of the year like sets who and why is it a Content cannot just be this is awesome s*** hear some different awesome. not partake in the current bulshit in the music industry which is so check this out do you mind if I explained it please do we had a conversation with her manager about this record right in a really sweet and it was late but it went from everything like we have family we don't want to be on the road for a hundred days this year we don't Nestle want to do anything we don't we don't want to go anywhere not excited about in this world came down to the promotion and stuffy nose we want to get in front of people and play our songs and have fun you know and the conversation came up with about the actual album like Warner Brothers was interested if we wanted to bundle it which is when you included record like with a ticket right and a lot of people have been doing it with you by t-shirt and to get a record and it's a digital download link does not work and I will you $5 from each ticket back to Warner Brothers and then you would get a record sale and I was like that doesn't make it doesn't make any sense to me into Dan and well it's only way you can get a number one record so if you want number one record you got to do that well it's 121 like we get five bucks back and then we get a royalty and we get our tickets and right now you don't get a royalty and you only get to take you only get album cell count if they click the link and they have like three by 50% click-through so another words we would pay $10 per sale on Nielsen soundscan by giving the money back that we sold on tickets to Warner Brothers tour record they wanted that 1.25 million are record events for this record was less than that so that's so it was like if Dan and I were just on our own record label we could give ourselves $5 per ticket account and we just keep the flu to take it the money from the right-hand and left-hand give you a link if you counted it we get the sail we keep the money that's basically what the f*** was going on you don't mean and it's it's all based on fear like all of this s*** like do you want to be you know that's basically conversation that is basically being had it not that direct but it's like as an artist you better try to get it gets good numbers get that first week I threatened and they're basically like f*** that f*** it doesn't even f****** matter people going to come to the show tonight going to come to the shows we're going to make records people going to buy more than occupy him and I think it is really it's detrimental to the music industry like to to pay too close attention to certain metric sounds like the the whole system it right now with these Majors is like signing s*** that has the most social media interaction the most streaming and I was like you know what when I was 9 years old I bought Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby and I listen to that s*** like I'm not joking like 250 times in a week like it's like a f****** idiot our fans have like you know they've got like a hundred 50 albums that they listen to on a sort of rotation at least and ours maybe one of them a month and I mean some it so that it's a different f****** audience you know I mean Instagram that's exactly right but that's the problem is that there are two different things that play at play here there's the music industry industry itself which is like certain people who work in industry and higher-ups are like we need to sell records we need to we need like this pop producer to work with this writer and this artist and we need streaming numbers and then are certain people you know like the old guard like the Lenny warnicker or Seymour Stein or you know even young guys too but you know they're like actually what we're doing is curating aren't that we really like and it's either going to sell it not going to sell a lot of the records that we grew up listening to most of them were records made by these kind of insanely eccentric weirdo people but really changed our lives in one of them you know like Tom Waits is still like it's so much different type of survival Timothy's artist a why we make music and it has nothing to do with this s*** it's a difference between like the Vogues you know I mean and like the fugs it's like there's a lot of these comparisons that you can make about what we do in our place in music industry is is is to do what we what we do and end for a while we were taking part in like the mainstream aspects of music you know me we were playing at the MTV Movie Awards nominees insane weird experiences because we we hadn't done it before and we felt like we had to do it and I wouldn't I wouldn't want to change anything but at this point like I think she's staying as far away from all that s*** is it is what we want to do right now it is no reason to love each other 2012 we offer to do it we watch and we were kids we were in La already it was like whatever Aerosmith came out and introduced us and now I'm thinking like why would they agree to do to be on the MTV Music Awards are they going to get from that whatever the whole thing was kind of bizarre really bizarre they need to be in the spotlight ER or something that you know and we were there just like I think we kind of realized how goofy was while we were there but we got an insane Xperia hang out with Johnny Depp and Joe Perry and Steven Tyler and this is crazy cuz after the after we do this song whenever we're out stage but about backstage by the trailers and I'd like to see Steven Tyler and Joe Perry and Johnny Depp talking we walk over cuz I just want to see what they're talking about cannabis legal in the craziest and Steven Tyler and Joe Perry talking about transport outer going to get their Arsenal across state lines another one time yeah man we we travel with a goddamn Arsenal AR-15 goddamn Arsenal AR-15 grenades</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I mean I've experience intense stress from doing today I love most playing playing concerts I've experienced it firsthand what it's like and that's way different when does it hit you like when obviously comes out like about to die but you still feel clubs you next week be camping out background like I guess what they would call now hipster s*** or whatever and that was just people who like you know real passion about certain types of music that wasn't Massey appreciate it you know it's just still kind of what we're into but would because that most people that we can we drive shows were like the high-fidelity type record store clerk you know you playing a show and it's just like arms crossed but pretty good The Gatekeepers were like 30 you know thirty-two-year-old now I would look at them as put me to be like being supportive but at the time it was more supportive. The time it felt more like judging until I get in the wrong head stereo headset headspace and I'm on stage with us or something you know me like the worst band of all time is probably the more you know like some terrible like minutos by the more people and I mean like this isn't that many people is like 3,000 people they just be honest like the worst stand-up comedian like I don't know I don't know me I'm like so parking tickets in Los Angeles come on that's how I look at it you know I'm like we deserve to be here more than that for Saturday to put a time in in Dino Dan doesn't we don't need to think about what we're doing so because we're not thinking about what we're doing like the trick is to stay in the moment with music but I can play and not think about it and then I start thinking like what's a person f****** take him out okay Deja Glastonbury there like he knows a 200,000 people are close to that and I just stopped playing like do you have at the moment 5 red bulls or he would be really anxious and drink a lot of Red Bull I don't know and so we got on stage and it was like a sea of people and he was on his fifth Red Bull and his eyes were like saucers and he was staring at me Boise convoys hey man how you doing you know what I mean I was just I was just exhausted really I'm like what do you want to do whatever you want to do is cool with me just let me know he had to call me down how many Red Bulls does it take before it becomes speed I don't I don't drink that much anymore but I think we also have been playing these shows and exhausting is that most of it had to do with our schedule cuz we play this one show in Des Moines right around that time that this is in 2010 right to visit this is when this happened was at Lollapalooza 2010 and this is the festival that we had played like four times before there wasn't like something new and we weren't even have onion this time it was just like we're on stage doing so bad if you looking forward to the show but this is like a pivotal moment for me it was like I I just kind of missed a beat of a song something that no one else even know Southern probably Dan and doesn't call s*** and I got like I spun out and then I just kept spinning out like a panic attack like you know you tend to get a panic attack doing the same thing you did before for a while I was having a pant like a little mini panic attacks every time I was on stage but I've got to the set July crowd starting at maybe five thousand people and now here we are delete most of the festival's watching us play it was like oh s*** like what the f*** is happening finally people a year and is that like I can't f*** it up now and then I mean look man I didn't know what to do it's so good play actors who are going to do like plays for the first time so I went to go see Carrie and his house and we're playing some shows at the Palladium and he he did this thing hypnotize me and the second night like I went that first night we playing it was like better the second night we played it was like pretty much gone and then I woke up in the hallway the Roosevelt Hotel and that stairwell in my underwear at like 7 in the morning in the end I'm in the staircase in my underwear 7 in the morning yes yes guy was on yesterday actually the name is Vinny shoreman he hypnotized a lot of Fighters and he had it before and I wanted to try I was like okay I have these thoughts with probably bulshit or have weak minds but it's a state that they can talk you into is really good like Vinny could talk you into the state and then you're totally conscious but you're definitely you definitely in this weird tunnel where you feel safe like mentally safe at work and you can talk and think about things in a way that's almost free of normal regular anxiety you can address the anxiety can see it but it's for the brief amount of time while you're really in that state you you can get rid of all that s*** this is a weird this guy carry nice remembers a couple things specifically that he said and I went so that he said like you know you know you're afraid of messing up they that's the whole point of like being in a rock band is like it's okay to mess up it's not supposed to be perfect, Perfection isn't something that anybody even wants you don't mean like if you go to like an art gallery you see like a Thomas Kinkade painting no one wants that s*** telling me all that he was he was telling me this s*** like he was like basically like you know what your personality is you know everyone's flawdrip human beings it's okay like yeah whatever like you're not supposed to be perfect you have no desire to be the you know there's no competition you better you know your personality is you know everyone's flawed real human beings it's okay like whatever like you're not supposed to be perfect you have no desire to be the you know there's no cop drumming competition you better do it like I'm supposed to just be here having fun and it worked</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know what this whole thing I realized I go on too much I talk too much like all old women the promise not the talking the problems to people reacting to talking I like to see people get lit been a liar got on you it's off program eat it the problem is not what you're saying it isn't I'm not going to say right now but this was the song that refers to all that I'm just a soul whose intentions are good oh Lord Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood because life has its problems and I know what when you were little girl when you get hit by a car and you were in a mental institution for 9 months afterwards and how it completely affected the way you think and behave and I don't think people knew that and this one it was a really important thing for me to talk about during the last podcast one the reason why I wanted to get you in as quick as we could people need to understand what's happening here what's happening there was a genius comic who's also an Ambien smoking pot drinking and has legitimate brain injury and I have mental health issues I think a lot of that is from genetics but your brain injury the problem is people reacting to the reactants you like your calling for people to be assassinated or murdered or you're you're you're you're yelling racial slurs of the streets you're not doing any of those things you know you're not that person was so overblown and then ABC got so wacky and and canceled you it was so so foolhardy and to try to change who you work the reason why the goddamn show is successful is because of who you were and the fact that other people on the show didn't have your political ideology and you would argue with them a fight with him and it's like real life conflict like people know and their own homes that relatable aspect of your shelf was why was number one so quickly and why the old show was so great that's you and they try to mold you to these woke times and Ashley reacted to the way you were talking as if you were doing something that was like then they change what you were doing and it made it this horrific terrible thing it's just that's all they needed to hear got the network I said that what you mean Trump voters is that who you're afraid he's going to get human and Country View of human it's always offended me it always offended me that they didn't like Their audience and I liked the audience cuz I thought I'm from there and they're familiar to me and how to myself I'm not going to disrespect the audience and I never did and I never did sell out neither I saw everybody you know there will come a day I believe when you know who knows what will happen she says that this might be the beginning of the valuing of an artist rather than the cuz it was the lowest point of ever devaluing in artisan and artist work she says so maybe now it's turned around and the artist will be better respected for what they bring I hope so I was also told that I one more one more me get in trouble one more time I wouldn't have my reruns anymore and I live on that endo know what it mean what does it mean I don't know know what is that this is the problem or something sometime I'm in these people that think people are rude are the rudest f****** assholes on Earth there's a Mustang in the people who think they're so sensitive there thanks thanks to a little bit more I'm not condemning anybody I'm not that kind of person think we need more conversations absolutely on Passover when we were celebrating the Jews even f****** Egypt and I had this horrible cousin I can't even remember his name and it goes any of long hair while maybe we should should be celebrating the death about the Egyptians and I've always be the one going can we just get back to the story fence it to me right now than ever has been before I'm about ready to get out there and tell people what the f*** like that that is hit me many times in my life there's been times I got out of my car to chase after a mother or to the way I seen her treating a kid I do it my boots on the ground I'm not no I'm not I'm not a trifling next door neighbor to the n-word I try playing now it's not Jews use it reuse Evelyn but it's like I've seen what A guy uses it that's a white guys like lol Mid City and it is a good word it should come back but it just white people using it always sounds awkward but why women can pull it off perfect trivia I call that wallowing in filth and arrange anyway we repented for this last year I had to do what to do I'm just trying to be a forgiving person and so I'll be

Smith I think about we are all need to be messersmith and I'll go to Washington is like this is our government that is our tax money and it will be audited As Trump has promised and as long as President Trump continues to make the moves to keep that promise to us I will be supportive of him because that needs to happen the Federal Reserve must be audited and we have to thank president for going in that direction what time do you spend thinking about this stuff 18 hours a day what I've done Henry Tiffany mix fitzhenry Greatest Story never told the story of this country it's phenomenal I'd like to see summary make a movie on it I have talked to him before are people decent for fucksake let's start there do you know where they do you don't move guns and shed all around the world that means like Eisenhower said that's one West High School for the kids come on we're going to be the kind of a country that leads the world we cannot weren't we cannot be imperialist oneworld fascist we can't do it won't work left to do something else so we can be one world fashions yeah alone leave the tribal people in the Middle East to live where they live forever you don't and if you can't then separate them if they can't live together but out of Israel very well integrated you know cuz they're just get the money from bulshit propaganda pedal by the left but the people on the ground or what I'm saying the people on the ground are the ones that matter to me and if you can live together then live together that's great and if you can't then don't nobody can force you to live with people who want you dead what is that that's all schwitz are you shiting me Dad I'm not not sure what you're referring to though the entire worlds or Worlds the entire fuckingworld led by you no bad ideas that haven't work this far it's going to have to be something new that actually works for the people in the world not just the people at the top I had my Solutions or proportion when I was a little girl I made a promise to myself I guess or and the cosmos and God and everything that I was I was not ever going to I was going to keep trying to know no matter what I was going to keep trying to know and know something new know something new and different but what how to create a world where something like Auschwitz doesn't exist and even the thought of it doesn't exist but you really can't cuz I think when you read about Western society and all of that you're like maybe that was you know that's where it leads will seems like throughout history has been evil governments has been certain evil organizations that have done horrific things like way back to is as far as we know from Rome to the Inquisition to the Mongols to the horrific things done by human beings and want to think about knowing about things like outwits is it lets us know that even though things in this country right now are relatively great income listen to the rest of the world relatively great comparison to some parts of the world are war-torn and terrible right now it could go bad it could go back cuz that's what humans are capable of humans are capable when they're led by the wrong ideology when they're cult minded when they're all in there they can do some terrible awful things and we need to know that and it's one of the things about having something like Auschwitz in our history that we we know that that's possible because that's what humans are capable of humans are capable when they're led by the wrong ideology when they're cult minded when they're all in there they can do some terrible awful things and we need to know that and it's one of the things about having something like Auschwitz in our history that we we know that that's possible</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the Tom Cruise movie about Barry seal it's all about that it's all about a few Cowboys Rogue CIA agents the decided that movie for like 5 minutes and his wife's younger brother Lexington Kentucky police officer oh man it went all the way up to look at the governor's office yeah and it was it was deep in Kentucky and he he was he was flying a plane with weed and and like money millions of dollars and cocaine he crashed in Knoxville Tennessee and they found out of everything they did notice the police officer until he died and he was like elopers I found you on the ground with this shoot half-open and just like yeah yeah and a bear also ate all the cocaine and diagram Strawberry Shortcake you should read that book Bluegrass Conspiracy you want us true story but it small state-level corruption at the utmost level in terms of drugs gold chain looks like he's a rapper losing his hat sideways is going to f****** sign resnexus cocaine bear it's all gold Bluegrass found the coke drop they found the Coke and they wanted murder in these two kids when they went to move the Coke and they put their bodies on the railroad tracks and they told the parents of the kids got high and fell asleep on the way to the railroad tracks for the parents did an independent autopsy and they found stab wounds in the kids you know it's for the f*****-up also it will give that away I've seen that when like transients are bums Yamin on die right we like bums will come in on the trains I'm just didn't happen in our yards with the north charges guy he thought they were done with the movement you know you took 5700 foot steel with f****** 45,000 horsepower on the front of it like when it starts moving it's very sudden and hard so you just go to stand up all that thing all of a sudden when it starts rolling and then you you lose your footing and you fall down the tracks from the cars but when you get run over by a train it's not bloody and is The Whispers lyrics been on the mainline it's rolling really hard and hot you put a limb on a track or a body or corpse all that weight and friction and heat when it goes over it just cuts it like butter and Carter eyes is everything like pinches you off like sausage so we find pieces not a mess just pieces unless you hit a f****** cow or something no not at all doesn't settle into have less than a bug on your windshield could you imagine being in the seat the dryer the yard so I would probably like 35 40 miles an hour tops put on the mainline when they're really rolling they're doing like 70 72 miles an hour like I said it's 15000 mile and a half long train with 545 locomotives on the front of it all the 30,000 horsepower each blood menu lawyer has to blow so like essentially like those things that semis used for deer when they the middle of the night but it's actually a big steel shovel with like an axe wedge in it and it just kind of sits just hangs and it's it's about six inches off the rail itself and toe ideas to Splatter everything anything out of the way flange of a a wheel set you know it's there's like a little 3/4 inch lip that kind of hangs over on the inside of the Rails so it's all just gravity and downforce keeping that thing going so you can put like a brick technically you can take anything a piece of f****** metal or a car jack and just lay it on that thing on that train hits it at 70 miles an hour is coming off the rail and everything behind it is still going 70 miles an hour behind it and I mean you got you don't think about every time you pull up to a Crossing in the city and you see the train go by 10 miles an hour and there's like 20 tankers on their full of raw chlorine you could really f*** some s*** up if you knew what you were doing you know the whole city you do real that train we had those we have to think about that and like Homeland Security would come out and get there you make sure that nobody does any Gerard cruise that drive that track daily basis and and repair things and you freaked me out that's why I quit the job if enough of those things happened right in front of me and I was my job to clean them up and get a crane out there at a f****** cock my office I would live at the yard for 3-4 days until we got everything repaired and back together and rolling feel like you know two or three times we'd be sitting out there in the middle of switching leads this happened while being a pickup truck at night during the daytime lake with one of the guys I work with you know maybe it's the guy you're tired you're trying to get done early and you got a bunch of empty cars on the back and the dude push the throttle down before the air goes to the system always rear the train so we going to get this dead weight and things off I got three locomotives I can push it'll be okay until the when they designed the system a hundred plus years ago nothing has changed since then it's a very primitive functional air brake system design you hook all these hoses up from the back ones are through which allows the brakes to release so then the engineer control those brakes with air doesn't go all the way to the back the brakes are still on those car so when all this horsepower pushing rolling metal hits metal that what does not want to roll it just buckles up in a teepee almost instantaneously goes off and you won't even feel it if you're 30 cars up that you're pushing s*** into the dirt and it's all just piling top of its if itself and like I would like two seconds I watch the string over being on the track to literally digging out a 10ft tree off of Earth and just displacing it and I think like everyday me or one of my guys is standing right there I was like I'm going to go write songs somewhere someone is on a f****** train listening to this freaking out.

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when when you're torn with this music now and you're f****** with it and you're switching things up like when will you decide that it's time to write some new chip we just tore and then stop touring and then I'm always writing poetry I used to sit down with a guitar and a part and words and you find me turn phrase I've discovered I'm really just a poet it's easier to write the words out and crafts the meter and phrase to those words musically in the studio I would say both all the other three records I probably wrote half of them while you go into make the record you think you have the songs and you realize that those songs are not supposed to be part of this record I would go home at night and write songs that fit that record on Robert coming with parts like Sailors got to head a lot of parts of music to get piece together in the studio and he's got probably all thought I was f****** insane for is scared to death cuz you know the music happens when you lock yourself in that room with the right people for matter days and you just keep going till it's done and you have ideas in the moment but now I don't even pick a guitar up to right I just write what I want to say what I'm feeling and then these guys you know push and encourage and motivate me to try to do the other thing as well as I'm able has all go through and just scribble out sections or pick this can fit with this this record was very deconstructed I guess we did some Loops would like record riffs and certain key and then record that same roof in the relleke so I could take it and chop it to a loop and make it super precise like a hip hop album and then some stuff was as loud as f*** you know and just having fun with a lot of fun the improvisational part of it sounds terrifying but also a butt off if what you want sometimes you get something if it's a mulatto cooker something the first take It's usually the one you keep that was the Only Rule there was no second-guessing her decision hence the samurai films on the wall cuz like in a swordfight you got one f****** move that was like for these sessions thing is the marriage the right thing it's something so when you're doing on you recording things do you do pause and go listen to it and play it again how do you how do you guys do it Bob I've got a bunch of video somewhere computer like I made him record all of his solos with a joint in his mouth it was pretty fun I mean we're kind of just we were f****** wasted you know just kind of like doing Arsenio and play music only if you have to remember I'm still trying we have to remember that live a relearn it and if you get high live you can't remember what you played High when you record that is an issue so then you go back and listen to recordings and go what we have to learn these songs so you're fire actually like paying attention you did there play these chords I'm sick while f*** did I do that you know just so weird that we did it so relatively quick quicker than the other stuff that we did s*** you know yeah we had to learn it all over again cuz I had we didn't remember doing and it was just so creative and quickly they hadn't heard any of the songs yeah yeah yeah it's like riding a bike there really a year we know each other you know just jump back on I'm still catching things don't play live out here a little bit still so I got a question when you're when you're in the studio with them are you in producer mode cuz you produced other artists or you kind of are they kind of producers with you and you guys are I'm in it together oh man I couldn't I couldn't tell these guys to do what they do I would why would I mean I don't want to work with you I want to work with the guys that just do s*** that amazes me but no I'm not like I have a rough structure in my head of what would it sound like tell him that you know opportunity to not f****** Wu-Tang Vibe by the end of the second day we were doing something I know I hadn't really heard before or maybe I was here in like 15 of my favorite records all the same time like maybe by the end of the second day we were doing something I know I hadn't really heard before or maybe I was here in like 15 of my favorite records all the same time I just say okay this is what this is going to be and it's probably going to destroy my career and that's okay cuz this is f*** I like it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you need country you think about the history and their their contributions to the martial arts in particular just I mean that the warrior ethic of the Samurai like that book Miyamoto Musashi the book of five rings that's a great book for your life just to just to think about excellence in your life from pursuit in your life and health all things balance out all other aspects of your life like his idea of being a great Samurai you had all three great a calligraphy be a great artist poetry being rude to fight correctly sounds f****** guy was like 60 and O in one-on-one sword fights contributions to martial arts like what they've been able to do with design like that's an interesting place even their automobiles you know I mean they make like bulletproof cars that last forever but they're the first people to figure it out just make cars that don't break and go really fast well I had the idea for the record first then we played Fuji Rock in 2017 I have a very good friend a Japanese friend who grew up in Kentucky on Exchange program with with my wife and he later moved back to Tokyo for college came radio DJ shinski ochiai and he did the radio thing for 1 minute for Marvel over there he's just a good dude and weave I went over for a couple weeks before we play Fuji Rock to hang out with him and my buddies get some time on the ground and the record was recorded the month before and I was like man to be really cool to do some animated videos for this album if it's like one or two and we were we were sitting on his place watching a lot of old animation and Anime films and the textures and the color and everything is the stuff you don't see anymore and I was just thinking about like some of my favorite cartoon from that source of the older stuff that seventies and eighties that came from that world so he we decided to start taking meetings with producers just to get an idea like what would this cost how long how long will it take is it even possible would they do it and I was kind of trial-and-error for a while we finally had a meeting with a guy named Hiroki who was very understated in a meeting sold himself short you know just like his mid-50s guy in tracksuit but we come to find out a week later he's the f****** and like all his buddies are the man to and those guys are also used to working under 9 or so restrictions but if they take a project on his from a big Studio the story's already dictated the parameters are dictated like basically they have to stay within someone else's Lane with their vision and so one of the first he asked me this what what kind of Animation I was interested in so I named awesome of the references of the things that I loved and was looking to sort of getting turn aesthetic and text her and he just went straight to the guys that made those things cuz we're drinking buddies with all of them and June pay me Sasaki especially was the one director who I think shun translated all the lyrics for them cuz I wanted them to know one what the record was about and so they can gauge interest and he just sort of said dinner when I was like you're talkin about the same things that I deal with as an artist he's like I feel like this is this could be me talking we deal with the same things and turn dealing with business and commerce vs. art so he just would have reacted passionately to the music and he just said I want to do the whole record he's like those kind of dream project for me and I said okay and then the recycle how are you going to do the whole record in a year because we've already been sitting on this thing for you and a half an hour he they assembled or other directors who are running teams or project teams at the same time simultaneously breaking the thumbs up into chapters so even though there's somewhat of a linen a linear narrative told out of chronological order in the two little side vignettes which is sort of same universe different world just to give up a different perspective on some of those songs because some directors were doing one song other teams had to and he was overseeing the entire thing but had them all working simultaneously on it so we can finish on time so I went over six times in the last year and I realized about the second trip those visits were very beneficial because those guys don't do half ass you know what I mean and they won't they definitely Pride themselves on their work and they all wanted me to be impressed so every time I would come back though they knew I was coming I could tell that was really motivating them to go outside the box and everybody wanted to be the guy that blew my mind the most you know what I mean and they did every f****** time is just like some of that stuff I know how they did it and I don't know how they did it Netflix Netflix right now which is also frustrating cuz we make cohesive concept records that are meant to be consumed as a whole and then I'm not going to fit that model just by making records you know what they put a single out so they put one section of the movie Up on YouTube how which I think will take down now that the old films out but I wouldn't it's beautiful to the the animation if they did for it's really it's incredible was it weird seem like their Vision connected to do to your music no woman I wrote the initial story that the main byline screenplay and then told Jim Paley we were trying to do an Amish of specifically Yojimbo and then a couple other famous Samurai films like the catchy catano's is a Twitchy a lot of Kurosawa things like very reoccurring storyline we were watching Kurosawa films in the studio making the record on silent in the control room just to kind of keep our mood bright like to keep everything kind of dark and ominous and no second-guessing so but yes kind of like a futuristic dystopian Yojimbo which which is also A Fistful of Dollars we got one town of people being oppressed by a couple rival factions were gang leaders and swerve using them for the wrong billing so in the future now we just jump and I talked about it while sex drugs and weapons and War really the main drivers of the economy so let's just say that those are the only economy you know this is the only things that have value anymore at that point and he got weird so I gave him a rough strip and then they just I said what new I want you guys to do what you do so feel free to add or take things and then can you want it anytime so then you get 30 women with her tits out dancing and which which was I told him there was a very old famous Samurai film causes twitching at the end of it once I was blind swordsman conquerors this evil force in the town's people celebrate there's this very famous scene in the end of it with his traditional dance and they're doing this dance and I said sneak this in as a dance sequence / Amish anybody that has to be like a film buff geek like me with females just really was a f****** cool so they decided to take the gimps and the sex trafficked slave so to speak and then just make a big Chorus Line but then they had a woman a traditional Japanese Dancer come in and they put her on motion-capture green screen and she did the actual dance from the film and the animated everyone to that I was like that's pretty sweet I would have thought of that but he did what I wanted he just gave me what he wanted to do with it how long is the whole thing audio is the album It's 42 minutes I just love the idea that you're experimenting with something like that it had to be a long stretch it was hardest part was sitting on it so long and then and then we had to do but I don't ever want to hear that s*** again does that contribute to the way you get creative with the sound when you perform in life you change out absolutely do you think you got to do this in the future again like this kind of Animation today or is this a one-off I wouldn't do the music again I would certainly I might if they want to run with the story I'll be all day what is a prequel or sequel action but I don't I wouldn't want to make this Sonic signature again I would probably use like traditional Japanese musicians and then contemporary production methods and they actually have dialogue and sound effects and make a story I got three kids super trippy light a big white like that Big Mike Tyson blunt when you get home tonight at midnight your kids are sleeping watch that s*** and then you think about where weird motherfuker I am all right or you go back in time to the origins of the the two what's the two robots and there's like an AR monster on lift dealt with before you go back in time to the origins of the the to slick and slim speed with her dad while they show up to the dojo and kill everybody I don't know who's all kinds of them just right and making up s*** pretty straightforward</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I had to make that decision this year I found out I'm not a psychopath is very reassuring with what happened after that I found more impactful and what happened was seeing the aftermath and like the system and how it all pans out but we had a we had to home invasions within 36 hours I guess the first time we got came in the middle of night about 2:33 a.m. and our back door at the sensor on made a very signature noise and if you live in your house you know the noises in your house and spur for whatever reason it just woke me up from a dead sleep and I knew what I heard Amazon thing that would make that noise so I kind of snake my way out the hall and down to the top of the stairs and went to hit the top of the stairs I heard the dog growl and the door closed back so I knew that was somebody leaving me with huge f****** dog basically useless but he did grounded made a very primitive noise I was proud of him and I good morning to tell her and then we called police course one of the neighbors got along to ring Cam and the back alley the guy leaving and going down the street so I had a very clear view of him for whatever reason my wife and kids they had to go on down to where we actually live I was working that weekend Nashville probably mix and record or something so I just stay behind and as a result of me being home alone that day I was cleaning and working on a a firearm ride recently purchased an assembled and so went to bed that night locked everything up and you know because they were home I put the gun on the floor on a padded case next to the bed so I'm letting the next morning like 7:15 a.m. Sunshine neighbors going to work I hear the back door open again and it's like it was Canyon with the f*** that the maid who would be there that early and I guess out of paranoia whatever reason I grab that gun and just went to the top of the stairs to look I still think it's the maiden when I hit the top of stairs and look down staircase same guy same clothes just standing in my living room rolling the cord up on my headphones and I've almost impressed one of the came back was just like I couldn't believe it was happening at this time and I'm very quietly and I got about halfway down by the time of year Vernon saw me and I was looking through his bed as f****** heads were red. Like a video game I'll never forget that image this guy Lake probably thinking he's about to die and the back door was thankfully still open the only thing I said to him was what are we doing here man and I hit him with a strobe which kind of like probably to his brain was he thought was the gun going off because he kind of like seizure back door and jump clean off my f****** porch like never hit a single step and ran out the back gate he had last it and I saw this on the video later when he came in and shut the back gate back so he hit that back gate on a debt rant on a dead run is like blue at the hell latches and wood splinters finally took off down the alley and hoses I'm still looking like a jackass what happened and then so then next thing there's like eight police officers in my living room all they wanted to see was my gun and every single one of them asked me why I didn't shoot the guy and which I found very interesting as a woman and I thought about it finally you wouldn't want to when I'm down going down the stairs you would not believe how much it can go through your head like 4 seconds like I had this whole conversation with myself watching kids aren't here you know this guy doesn't even know I'm here yet I'm holding a f****** assault rifle and he's not a threat to me but if I put one through his dome which I have every legal right to do right now there's going to be news vans on my lawn this is going to be on your f****** Wikipedia package really all of that I'm just like this guy is not a threat and thankfully he chose to go out the door really why didn't you shoot it was and I said that and he's kind of looked at me and I can buy that you know literally by the time we engage Man 2 seconds later he's running out the door is what we're going to shoot him in the back and then you put me in prison and they were like a f*** man twice in a week you've been finally figure something out out you know anything like that when I was I go to the court case and you know it does very interesting telling experience for me because I've never really been to anything like that and he was one of maybe eight or nine other people on the docket that they all sound the same public defender who literally shows up 15 minutes before they start the day to get familiarized himself with every single case and you just saw this Factory like these young underprivileged black males just getting pumped into the system the DEA came over and she was like thanks for being here yatta yatta you know they're unlikely for him he broke into like 13 other houses and they had him on tape a lot of things about 13 or 14 aggravated burglary charges which is pretty f****** heavy you know everyone loves his class B so he was looking at 12:15 I have to keep saying like a bird pleaded down got six and then if he does a successful rehabilitation program in prison he could be out in two and Miss usually yada yada and I just realize like wild just throwing this kid life away cuz he you know Granny came into some people's houses and you probably need almost got f****** killed and they call him the next night like three streets over in the ACT doing the same thing but he had no priors he wasn't on drugs it was just like no Direction probably no. No Heroes and I struggle with what if I gave him a job it depends entirely on who he is right which I never got the chance to sit down and find that bond that I never got to talk to him face-to-face to my turn on some punk f****** kid I be like good luck man you know I like it might turn out all depending upon the person but there's so many people in this country that are set up to fail Sedona find that bond that I never got to talk to him face might turn out on this some punk f****** kid I'll be like good luck man you know it my turn my turn on terrible two depending upon the person but there's so many people in this country that are set up to fail</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> this is a new even between introduce you properly now okay has Justin in March Hospital previous year I'd like that come off of a deployment 11 months before the second one was a bit down in the valley the dumps got divorced had a dude died in the first trips was kind of like Blues real rough to deal with and then it's listening to these dudes quite a bit and then let into the next appointment I was there a month boom almost died pretty hard teammates save me and we had blood on the ground like they got blood on On Target and then they made a hellacious movement to give me the Medevac long story short dinner in the hospital one of the first meals jamming out to these dudes and I was like Mom and then she tried to get ahold of him So, eventually did and he came hung out for like 2 hours I made my friend now General gaudette wait like 15 minutes so that we can finish talking about we're talking about when you're but a lot of ketamine so's this week turtlehead had it on his own accord to donate to the foundation so this little tour going on that coincides with the actual album release is donating to the Special Forces foundation so that helps gold star families which are the families that remained of remained of the friends I got killed on this trip so they were for Green Berets into EOD text and so that money is going to them that's that's what I care about like I'm alive I don't have any legs below my knees for those I can only can't see my legs on the video anyway but I don't have my testicles either so that's a different set of challenges but I don't care about getting taken care of other than the normal Army processes but I want them to get taken care of from the foundation so grateful to have you guys as friends now they're awesome amazing musicians but amazing people and then I'm grateful to be here and just to push that out so are coming to the shows all that money goes to the the foundation and then people can go on the foundations website which is Special Forces foundation.org and I appreciate it and thank you for a great way to help out and and your music you know did you connect it to that I think that's just a f****** incredible thing it's really cool you know when you sent me the text messages telling me you were going to the hospital you know it's very touching it was like yeah it's very not just it's Brave of you to talk about this but it's also its hope so valuable so valuable for everybody that that hasn't served to understand what it really is so thank you for that always say I really like combat cuz I was in a lot of it but I was in a fair amount almost got killed on the first trip so just don't like the war aspect when you see your friends get killed and you're stuck in a hospital bed on top of all this stuff is you know I didn't shift for a week I piss blood for a week I've had tons of nights of excruciating pain at the life of an apt or their guys are worse than me so I'm just grateful for having what I have and yeah that's the beginning of it do that you're just like I was telling like the people that took the trash out in the room I am grateful for you brother brother what is ketamine like after catastrophic injury like that does it relieve the pain does it just put you in another dimension so ketamine is a nmda the way that feels kind of takes your perspective and it's like in always felt like a whirlwind when that if I was getting a push of it but things like you're starting to get your vision mask and your present you're still there but you're dipping into like subconscious cuz you're still conscious cuz unconscious with me in the year like you pass out and you can not have a gag reflex to hang on how unconscious you are so ketamine I would close my eyes and immediately trip the most insane balls that you can imagine an open I'm going to be back in the room I'll be like what the f*** and then a friend of mine when I left my first rotation he was an Air Force CCT that got blown up in the same Village I had a few casualties in he stepped an idea he's an above-the-knee something missing fingers but when he was on ketamine when he was awake and looking around he'd see the walls on fire and then there be like women white pale skin in the corners peeling the skin off their back and he's like a wake like whatever I don't know it must be like someone psychology when they go in like set and setting type thing but I was in it when I got a lot of ketamine my legs are blown off I'm getting worked on I'm telling you how to treat me I cut my own shirt off and then I get to ketamine and I'm like in and out and I see these Visions back and forth and like I was convinced as litter to distinct moments as I can I make it and had that conversation so and what's the real about this right here is that you were talking to him on this show and you guys talk about combat Medics and you were like I did and I just singing key and I was like right on there talking about me and then I got all kinds of jacked up makes you appreciate appreciate and I've gone through huge development last year through depression and then this year after his blasted like being grateful and like in doing introspection and communicating and having empathy for other people being compassionate human which General Mattis has told us a group of us on the way back to my first trip like don't let this experience of War make you more hateful human being because people haven't experienced it let it allow yourself to go to post growth and become a better human being and treat other people like you want to be treated and treat and I would add on to that which came from Tim Ferriss treat yourself the way you treat other people too that's not a side of Madison you ever hear in the Press huh I suppose not. That's a very powerful way to view this inevitable the inevitable consequences of war that that started scraping the off the bottom to focus on that after that trip A lot of people do it recreationally and apparently they they blast off and go in the other dimensions and s*** and they go in a k holes and then I never did say he would do to died from it he was really into it it's doing a lot what happened he probably doing a bunch of other things as well but he was getting treated for ketamine for addiction and then he wound up time you can toast the s*** Academy you can give a kid 300 Megs of it and they will f****** trip balls but they are going to they're not going to die like the opposite of all the other drugs that I think he was doing other s*** to which it's Academy was originally electric isn't a cat tranquilizer or something like that they give it to my wife Best Friends veterinary and she definitely like Jack and animals with ketamine on the road it's it's increasing now in like civilian hospitals drug which it works great beaches communication device work with dolphins and he was also a big asset freak and he would like to take who take acid and try to communicate with Thompson's even allegedly give Dolphins acid he was a part of his long-standing program try to get Dolphins to talk to him but one of things he invented it was or not a movie about this because in the movie The Guy experiments with a bunch of different types of sensory deprivation tanks and everybody knew that this guy he was a legitimate doctor a brilliant guy but he was also a ketamine freak and once he would do is like you take intramuscular ketamine and then get into the sensory deprivation tank yeah girl symptom the issue would be with the pain like when you have something that's controlling some sort of level of pain and then coming off of that you usually wean off of it and then not a physical addiction issue you know I should know the answer that definitively but as as a medic but I haven't heard of anything that works hard to come off of came to the hospital and stuff is like methadone is worse than heroin GNR guys were rocking in one week I dropped down 20 migs instead of the 10 and it was like being a junkie like for 9 hours I just like rubbing my legs like cuz they're just lit up with nerve pain feels like there's daggers in your leg or some sort of electrocution and you look like on a movie with like it someone cracked out or something Cheddar's we used to see these guys would come into the pool hall when I used to play pool in White Plains they would come in there was a methadone clinic down the street and they were all hair heroin people and my friend Johnny B would call the methadone Ian's cuz they would come in they all had like this like sort of like doll Shuffle to them they're all slow down and I can never understand it was like I was like a culturally like agree to make some sort of agreement like this drugs okay it's got you know it's got some some stamp of approval so we're accepting that they have to get methadone everyday but they can't get heroin anymore why don't we just give them a heroin-like is how much different is the methadone is the methadone to get them high with synthesized so it's easier to control but doesn't get them high I didn't have any effect while no it's just fighting off the physiology don't people have with the best effects with like ibogaine and things like that when it comes to getting kicking opiates if you want to go through that I would say you know I would probably be your best but it for a quick solution if that's what you mean like 3 in the morning the pretty shity year damn and how long does it take to get you off of the methadone I mean once you're off of it they are doctors are saying that it stays in your adipose tissue cuz you're fat for like 2 or 3 weeks cuz I have random nights when I was off of it and just get lit up with nerve pain in like getting hit with a hammer in my toes so probably four to six weeks of we and then I went another drug Lyrica meant for you it had to feel me cuz you were there at Walter Reed the whole time you had to feel frustrated but for smiling like the first time I came to see you it was only what about a month after the blast at most he was still in a lot of more pain and I can't even comprehend being in Tenino from nerve pain cost of 30 surgeries total which impressed by even then like how clear-headed inarticulate and I was obviously and awareness of everything going on in the room despite the faint the pain he was trying to pretend like he wasn't in I just and then that place is full of guys like him and everything then when I went back it's like all new faces you know these people but then when I went back a couple days and it was like just in the matter of short time it was Leaps and Bounds and you even the gym on one leg like f****** Bustin Out 20 pull-ups everything you know just kind of like got to be something we can do anything you can do to help in whatever way and in these guys been up since I've known him I've never once ever heard him ask for anyting his only concerns were like for the families of the guys that didn't make it you know so it's just hard really were around album release if I'm going to have a bunch of attention on me I thought it would be a good opportunity to put attention on what other people can do to help these guys are family especially sitting in these rooms and looking at these dudes mean I can't even you can't you know what it what are you what are you call that well I want to help so after the show let's figure out what we can do to jump in I want to I want to help so help with the podcast help with some comedy shows maybe do whatever we could do yeah I'm Blown Away by all this as much as I think all these people are listening and watching this is beautifully doing this man and I think that you know when it's inspiring me to do something I think it's probably inspiring a bunch of other people and that's that's half those things that people talk about with one thing you might experience or here in life that changes your worldview and moves you in a better Direction This is this could be one of those things you know well you're a good man. Well I'm not thinking anything man he's so I'm just a dude with all you guys it's cool I'm very happy that you're bringing awareness to this and I'm really happy that you doing that makes you feel great divorce out of it is though the tragedy I guess so it's not like you no right or left it's just like this is the reality of it making the sacrifices for you and then when they come home what do we do for them you know it's hard thought for people to accept that war is inevitable so hard thought and it doesn't seem like it's inevitable is not inevitable in this room I mean if we were the last people on Earth and there was a bunch of food and places to sleep I think we probably not guilty other probably go to war like what is the number where you go to war is it a milli the two million is it separated by oceans is it just mountains boundaries but the fact that no one thinks that war can be solved like no no one that I know thinks that in our lifetime they'll be no war then there's never been a. Where someone on Earth is human has been going to war with each other it's over horrible truth of being a person and nobody nobody knows it the way you do so for you to come on and tell your story the way you just did I appreciate the f*** out of that man and I would just want people if if if they hear that and it moves them it's more of like a like just be grateful on a regular basis for what for anyting I mean we still have war and then there are people still fighting it but overall the world is continuing to improve in like steadily getting better and fewer people are dying from genocide and War but it still exists so. I want the respect for war if someone is wanting to go to war you know if someone is going to be a commander and chief and that's it that's a heavy thing to like tossed back and forth means that I may never have kids you know like like that use their sacrifice like and I'm the one that lived and I didn't have any kids but like my friends have four girls my other mother friend has three kids sewing when you're if you're going to move the chess piece of War then we need to understand the implications of what that means and try to do everything and political power at the end State strategy to avoid over or cuz it's socially Iced Tea near Pier Russia nuclear war would be the worst in each other to literally nuke every f****** man woman and child off the face of the Earth many times over and that's what keeps us from using them but yet we still have them and we still have appointed each other I mean when you were kids and we are worried about Russia remember that s*** people walking into Target with a suicide vest yeah yeah when's that coming right yeah you could all of it is Europe's been dealing with that s*** for decades and we really haven't tasted that yet on a widespread habitual scale yeah when's that coming right yeah you could all of it is Europe's been dealing with that s*** for decades and we really haven't tasted that yet I gonna on a widespread habitual scale</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is this because you guys don't have I mean how much of influence do record companies have on new bands like when you bands are coming up from the trying to put together the music how much influence do record companies have in the creative process it just depends did they discover them where they already are they really jumping on board with something that's already working I mean it's rare written into my contract that nobody could tell me what to do so it's common that you get f***** with here's what we really want you to want to do business like they knew what the real s*** was and you don't f*** with the real s*** but there's very few of those people actually working in the record business anymore it's all like 25-30 year old bottom line quarterly report motherfukers you know it's all about the money money tried-and-true Mrs Butterworth recipe proven you know give me 17 of those I got it would suck to be in a business with art you know we'll order like you're thinking about it like a business but it's art what's the best way to push it what if we change this and added that was put some gospel singers in the background what if we did this with you know I think that's the thing to say I'm lazy s*** to I got a really want to do something you break those trains apart like Looking Over Manifest and drag cars off of the rails and build them into those trains and then crew them again and get them online so I was working like 90 hour weeks I'm mostly cleaning up train wrecks and derailments really blue switch and put three cars on the ground we we we were the central artery in the in the midwest the really that back corridors kind of the cross-section the entire countries shipping Commerce if we f***** up and tied up the main lines then shut down the railroad you can never tell a kid hey you want it you want to make meaningful music this what you got to do you got to struggle in like difficult jobs to lie about 35 and bit him barely get to where you want to be where you really kind of freaking out about your future and then pour yourself your heart and soul then find success after that that's a good move to one of impactful music if you get into music like early on in your life and make career early on in your life you miss everything that you did by being an older you know it's 35 year old man that makes a jump that's a bold move that makes sense but there's been a lot of incredible artist that made some truly 20 you know for sure but there's a life experience aspect your music God knows what I'd be right by probably p**** that's for sure for sure yeah what are you thinking about you know horoscopes</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> physics is weird enough as it is without adding let that movie was literally created by a Channeler right-aligned David Albers was one of the leading philosophers of physics I should also give credit to philosophers here because they've been taking quantum mechanics of seriously longer than businesses have to be honest so David is one of the very people who got a PhD in physics and then switch to philosophy because he cared about I told story in the book like he wrote a bunch of influential papers as a graduate student and then he went and said I would like to make these papers my PhD thesis and they said no that's not really serious physics and they punished him by making him write this incredibly technical mathematical paper on Quantum field Theory just to prove he could do it and then he's like this I don't take this anymore I'm switching Fields but anyway he was in that film he was in what the bleep and they lied to him they misrepresented themselves Jr documentary about quantum mechanics and they sat him down for 3 hours and ask them all these questions you leading questions like doesn't this mean that we're bringing reality into existence by looking at it and he's like no that's not what it means let me explain to you then the final film there's like 30 second clips of him going yes that is a really important question and did hilarious story there was a event some sort of convention put on in Santa Monica by supporters of the film that they thought it'd be fun to get all of the people who were in the movie it was a bleep do we know and get them at the you know and talk to them and charge people money to listen to them but these people were not affiliated with the filmmakers so they didn't know the David Albert had been completely misrepresented in the films of a invited him and he goes to the Santa Monica and he gave it to yo he decided he wondered like sizes go at all but okay not let's reach a different audience and he he gave it to me said look there's two things you can do when you are faced with fundamental puzzles of reality one is you can face up to what the world is trying to tell you and you can accept it and take it as what it is no matter what you like the other is you can choose to tell a flattering story about yourself and the people who made this movie have decided that the mysteries of quantum mechanics are really stories about how they are powerful and have influence over reality and so forth but it's all nonsense as the punchline is the audience loved it they went nuts because what they wanted was a guru of some sort in like he was just as good a good mind when my first movie came out I think every review basically said something along the lines of worst movie ever made I hate this movie and now people do look at your best movie you know like you can choose to do ever since so it's just weird same as white zombie when our first guests are first Geffen record came out I saw the first review it was as magazine alternative press who two years ago gave me this Lifetime Achievement Award and I had to read the review while accepting what they were this is the worst band ever ever ever ignore this band so there was a something you know there must have been something to your contact person yeah you know yeah that's a lot to contribute and so they just s*** on things and it's just like you as a when you're young and you're new and you're reading you think that the guy is riding it is about music is it's so subjective and you know someone who grew up wearing the right Izod shirts hang with the cool crowd they're not going to your music is not going to resonate with them the same way it's going to be with other people that felt like they were outside I mean I can only do what I do and I don't know what would be popular but I don't understand popular culture in a way cuz when people are gushing over something I move yesterday I said I hated that movie I know it made five hundred million dollars in a thermistor move I go I can barely sit through it a lot of those being made same with music like I do like I love The Velvet Underground episode but what about in the name something like you know I don't admit that makes me want to kill myself anymore more young Fighters would appreciate that early in the crib because I think so many of them are compromised by the time they get to the big leagues you know by the time they get to Bellator MMA and with UFC or you know even kickboxing guys by the time they get to big fights they've already been dinged up too much and I can't take a shot Prime now for next wha5 is not already punches 14 I mean Felicia Allen Supply. But not moving the feet anymore but your phone was really interesting cuz if you looked at the spot where he died for what he's so sweet. incredible to see which style Superior filipendula in Black 6 Ryan's light recognize him with the all-time greats he's the best traveling in a van of the time and they were giant fresh mushrooms a meal Stan and like I just let your sweating it smells like a portobello mushrooms sleeping for my skin and I yelled to the driver I'm like starting to spin out like how it how do how do you get this to stop he turned around he only wore black and shades on and finally we stop I'm a big I get the f*** out of this van this is this is an 2003 is a long time ago in white-knuckling you glowed girlfriend and I walk into the bathroom with Dan and they're like this woman's like speaking French like yeah bro what is a guy no man's that crazy and I'm like freaking out and all I had was like 50 euros and I put it on the tray and Dan grabs it and put it in my pocket and then put second nickel there doesn't cost that much to pee dumpsters here clean is a bright red and I really truly dumpster. Here eating a regular meal when open it was like when they went into Willy Wonka's place all the light came in and then and then it seemed like a crazy cuz when we got back in the van 3 f****** hours later like our drivers like to do if we got to go that we've been here for 20 minutes and it's been 3 hours of you guys lap talking about this dumpster crowd around those days that's like my employee you or were you ever on in or around and he was warming up the crowd so he's doing stand-up to warm up the crowd this is so weird to stand up like it was very tight and you know and they were cute Colin Quinn fan of crowd fan so they were laughing hard but what that show was was the first show where Comics could balbus do you like we do in the back bar at the store like we do you know when we're in the green room we talk s*** about each other with each other repeat that what time we bombed and he took a sip and Patrice cozy at take another step at a time and each other and it was</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and I'm a liberal douche twat loser but I feel like there's some have some common sense here you got to stay out of the out of that weird fog everybody gets in the brainwashing happens and they all star blowing each other and headed to chaos to stay out of the weeds Andrew Yang guard like talking about getting people to stop beating me know probably believes if that's key to making the world a better place I think there's a lot of people that would argue against that I think of you sat down with those people on how to debate I don't think you do well and I think I think of someone who could explain the nutrition required look really explain Basin act like a Chris Kresser guy based on actual science someone like Rhonda Patrick knowing you're not going to stop just stop that a business is in a steak and wouldn't have a problem to wait if you if you don't kill the cow tell me what happened to live forever what happens to become fairies Columbia going to give birth control what you going to do that we can do at this point we just eat them responsibly and ethically probably feed him grass it's real healthy food and if you believe a Life Is Life just one life is worth a life well you're responsible for way more death because you're responsible for birds and bugs and ground-nesting birds and f****** rodents and anything that gets chopped bunnies to get chopped up in those combines Legends of the ground there's a lot of fracking chemicals to get released into the ground even look what you would call like organic agriculture like you're still using machines you're still there's a lot of bad s*** that happens to the world fell so funny how like they'll be people love animals so much and yet if you watch an Animal Planet animals of the most vicious cruel evil survivalist about feeling you get when you look at animals are stuffed into these pens and he's inhumane conditions there right about that they're not right about Farms though they're not right about sustainable Farms like Joel salatin he's got to have this place called polyface Farms where they talked about large-scale natural Agriculture and raising animals in the environment is supposed to be in like two pigs they move around a fence too late they create event to these pigs and then they move the fence to another location after certain push the pigs insist new area and the pigs are always free so they're always free roaming and eating acorns and stuff to pigs naturally eat and then you know that I think they supplementing with other food as well and healthy food but they're there they don't behave like a scared animal that's trapped in a pan just freaking out they they live like an animal lives the argument and it's a real argument like why she should be able to kill why should you be able to eat something that's an animal so it's a good argument it's a real argument you really are an ethical person and you look at that argument that's your point like we shouldn't be able to kill it's it's a I understand you don't want anything to die and don't want anything to stop her what are the way I look at it is the natural world is this f****** Shark Tank that's what I'm saying and all you're doing if you eating meat if you're eating it in an ethical way you're moving most of that in the animal's life and at the end of the animals like you're putting a bullet through his brain you might think that that's a horrible terrible thing to do the deck that cow gets shut off in a second but if that cat was living in the real world it would get ripped apart by Wolves that's what I used to be an animal that had to run for its life in the Wolves would sneak up on them and they tear their legs apart and start eating them a****** first I've seen her ducks that live in a farm environment if they're free rein is there grass-fed cows are just wanting all of them live a far superior life 10 either wild counterparts the live longer they'll be healthier and if it's someone like a Joel salatin or someone who does like ethical farming where they have large scale like big giant patches of land with his animals are allowed to roam free in DeGraff the only real problem they have is when Grizzlies move in that's when they have a problem when Grizzlies and wolves find out about their cattle so when their natural enemies animals encountered them and he's in Cade there is then they have to keep them out there to protect these animals they're going to kill from the animals that want to kill him the whole thing is crazy horrific conditions of some of these animals have to live in and then do you know that they just that means for the pig farms man they they flew a drone over one of them and it had a lake I mean I like a pig s*** and piss and it was the most disgusting looking f****** Lake in these animals were all stuffed into this s*** into this pipe in the pipe would lead into these enormous lakes and pissed and you like these meat factory animal pal Pig supposed to let write a pig supposed to live like the Joel salatin pigs live there wandering around the thing they like the roller is some pig that ain't like to roll around in the roll around s*** but they don't want to just live stuff on top right reading and Taurus metal grate did all these people are always like this was a heroin addict we got to save him like maybe on heroin go

most part always just made him up just improvised like in the mood in the moment and then said you liked it was try to put that it down again as Source or to gravitate towards what we like and then just start building on it and all the stuff that doesn't Works push it away and just keep do you have disagreements on what works it doesn't work when you invented no not usually it's always been like that ever since we were 16 and 17 wow I've never really the older I get the more I realize how special I always took it for granted I mean I remember when we were trying to audition bass players we had this one guy try to come and play with us I just remember it just f***** everything up it's like we couldn't even play it didn't even sound like us why it just didn't work and then was it when this other person left all of a sudden it sounded like a big band again it was weird we learned to play together I never even I mean I never play drums with anybody side from Dan and fit me even playing drums in the band is like because it was a ton of an accident I only had a drum set because I wanted to be a guitar player and I want people to come to my house and play the drums with I had a driver's license I got a job washing dishes and bought the jumps I bought everything you need for bands like my friends would come over and they were all pretty much better at Guitar than me but Dan came over and he was like the best guitar player of all my friends and then they f*** what do I do bass or drums as I call you can't just Jam guitar bass drums that's what we did in high school so we learn to play together man so that because of that there's like it there is like get kind of connection you know I mean we play now on stage with a couple of the guys and it's it's good it's good it's easy as fun but there is something when the two of us start playing where it is we can like work in between beats you know it's pretty liquid Argo has never been like to be this tight kind of rigid like feeling it's hard to describe but it's like yeah we never worried about if we got it perfect we always is always doesn't this is the one that feels bad always a lot of the new record was improvising syllables and words really a lot of times I'll be trying to be singing Melody while I'm doing chord changes but I can see Pat you know that's the thing that we've always done with always be able to see each other when we play and record so you know and go with his movements and follow them that way you guys just know each other so well we hadn't we hadn't been in the studio for five and a half years and we didn't do any pre-production or anything in the very first idea that we had made the record I mean it's just that the crazy then crazy connection yeah man that's so unusual it really is the older I get the more I realize that singer announced like all guys come on really good at Toys R Us some dumb s*** it's someone's wife is David Lee Roth Hitman we've been through it man don't tour with your girlfriend until you like have to make it come out for a couple shows this avoid that s*** and also probably like don't don't really have a girlfriend till you're like in your late 20s probably what's the problem with touring with the girlfriend did it just codependent mother f***** like me the hard part is that I'm up for the work and then ends up for the work and when we're on tour like that was going through I got your periods time I get phone calls you like what the f*** are you doing you know like I miss you I got guilt services like I'm like literally in the back of a Ford Econo van like with like a torn up copy of TV Guide read it for the fifth time because of any money no cell phone or like with a Nokia phone it's like two real to even talk about our first two are numbered and I haven't stopped at the PayPal are you really got to go to it yeah but I mean that's the thing is like it it's what I guess what doesn't kill you makes you stronger I read somewhere that that's not actually true Italy some shake your body up and it just takes years off your life people we were when we were in our twenties during some of the same t-shirts I'm not because I was way too small for me now but yeah you know I think there's a time like maybe 2012 it was really blowing up I mean we could do no wrong and there was an alternate universe add multiple times at The Chateau it's like yeah it is 4 in this version of reality Dan and Patrick don't play the Spike TV Video Game Awards they overdose at the Chateau Marmont it is because if we would have got that wear 23 we would have never been able to sit down and realize what will f*** was going on everything about us bro I didn't I did that says where I think that says we're like the uniqueness and the

Alcorta never gone now and I can see if I can find it but at the time when I saw that for the first time when I was six or seven like you know that was a different time Thomas Howell Soul Man Who pretended to be black to go to a certain School what happened in 2018 years ago Senator is so I could tell you everything I was for Halloween that's I was Orville Redenbacher reset my towel and that's when he's he's the white guy and I forget what exactly it was tanning pills to get in the school is that what it was he took tanning pills oh my goodness to get into a school you took 10 pills scooter had to when he turns into a black fellow and all sudden like it is did you see what he was talking into a news oh Jesus so he's going to kill himself because he took too many tanning pills this was like a harmless movie and not 1990 whatever it was on this movie came out this was an absolutely harmless movie that nobody protested about nobody cared it was really obvious what was going on was not a not a great movie but nobody cared imagine if you put that movie out today oh my God and I was thinking about how f****** insane Doogie Howser I was like if I was f****** sick and a 12-year Washington Post Office like the fact that I'm pretty I'm sure that the whole basis of sex in the cities is based on that is a spin off of South Park Sex in the City takes place in the same universe as Doogie Howser and maybe if you think of what's that guy that she's always trying to date that's a big maybe mr.big Doogie Howser's in adults didn't you say we were subjected to that s*** without kids don't know kids don't even watch that there's three channels and we were kids yeah kids barely watch TV anymore he was a second-year resident surgeon the news so we were subjected to that s*** without kids don't even watch it later three channels and we were kids yeah kids barely watch TV anymore he was a second-year resident surgeon</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> don't really buy into the simulation to me fuk though not at all but I don't like what the same person was saying to me that there are atheist that's fine you're allowed to believe that but you also have to accept it is possibly that's not true it's it's simple I saw a song about to my step daughter who's so smart so sweet and so really changed my life in a lot of ways and we were swimming in the pool talking about life you know it's one of these conversations it's like she's like what do you think that there's a got that she asked me and I said well we don't go to church or anything and I said I said I don't know but I think this is something interesting to think about Isaac I think about that I try to think about the end of the universe at the very end like the edge and I can't picture it I think I can't picture us together can tonight I can't picture like Infinity you know I can't grasp that at all another fact that we can't grasp Infinity will need someone like maybe Elon to believe that work there's a purposely that was left off in some sort of stipulation whatever but maybe that's what I think that that the fact that I can't picture maybe I'm just an idiot but it makes it that I think that there may be something more there's definitely something more to it that possibilities Way open but I do think what do you think I had this conversation with a guy was actually an expert on it because of probability it's more likely or very likely that were in a simulation because the probability of someone eventually creating it and that it's very possible that we're in it right now and more probable than not for them what does that mean I don't know that simulation has to be simulation that why would a simulation of what from what I know for sure what I know for sure that we are the only people on this planet that have ever gotten 2019 this is where we are we know there's a history behind us we know that this is the peak we're at 2,000 walked in at a freaky time a man wear at the tooth where we're at 2019 right now if we are we we know we exist we know we have culture we know we have incredible technology we don't have any idea for the only ones it's likely that there's other life-forms out there it's like weed is other intelligent life out there but there might not be it might be that this is a crazy situation that happens incredibly rarely when you have a planet that's this close to the Sun where these life-forms figure out how to f*** with matter in an incredible way and they start flying and sending things through the air that videos and instantly get your phone this might not ever happen this might only happen here it might happen here and inversions of here which if you believe in Infinity you have to be infinite versions of this does infinite versions of life so it's almost built-in mathematically that there's Infinity is so big there's so many possibilities that everything that you've ever recorded has also been recorded by you in another place with infinite variations of each individual song infinite variations of each album that there's infinite versions and that infinite versions of each version and so there it's insane the whole thing's impossible for a little ant brains the wrap around it that's possible it's not it's completed to a simulation I mean it possible to simulation but it's also possible that this is as far as anything's ever got cuz we're Wheels as far as we've ever got patinar starting Intergalactic Publishing Company I think it's interesting to think about when you don't know the answer to this simulation of the dimensions and stuff I think it's all fascinating until possible man but I do think when it comes down to it like part part of the thing that causes anxiety it is it is it says it's part of it is like accepting that something is real you know happenings even f****** real and I think I think being in the moment as much as possible if it when I'm really truly feel like I'm living in the present I really feel like you can really draw special life is how if I was a billionaire and I married the same check twice I would think I was living in a f****** simulation 2 I think about you on as I get some really f****** smart but he's a billionaire and he married the same check twice if you can marry anybody you wanted to keep it a chance yeah whatever schools raised that dude what is that Astra what is that school he is his own school for her some of his children for some of the employees of his company make batteries make solar panels make electric cars make rockets shoot them the space plan to colonize Mars yeah and then marry the same chick twice every time to find a new check right prove that he's a genius just that it worked out really amazing then like a thousand different dimensions both marriages</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what would be your first actual film films of 2004 mm mm yeah because the way it went down was this is a funny story to I made my first movie house with thousand corpses at Universal Studios and it was 2000 could have been at even the tail end of 1999 I'm not sure the only reason I was 2,000 how to wrap gift somebody gave me and they put a date with Universal Studios I thought went great with the head of universal the time came up to me like we have to talk tomorrow is not a good tone that wasn't what you're so great we want to give you a 5 picture deal tone of voice so the next day they dumped the movie and you know just basically booted us out is the conversation induction but at the time to you figured there was no Hora coming out of University of making like The Flintstones movie and that was not the image they wanted this really vials would have Backwoods hillbilly murderfest where this the bad people win essentially noir films were sort of like not even a commercial thing at that point anyway so then which is funny now if you go to Universal Studios Hollywood Orlando there's a huge a thousand corpses thing event going on in both theme parks I was there for the old grand opening like that's funny I didn't like if I get fired from here and now you know 20 years later it's a theme park attraction the exact place I get fired from which is so weird what was the conversation like before you decided to do that film I mean how did how did they let you do it an amazing experience by think I was too naive to understand what was happening if you like you did one set of comes to look at where to put you into a Georgia car like cool I guess that's the way it happens man I didn't really appreciate just took it for granted but I I had I had met with someone at the theme park about doing haunted maze during their whole Halloween Horror Nights based on my album and then sorted by being in the offices was me meeting people and having just meetings about stuff or I just didn't want to leave once I got in the studio just loved being there even I had no business being there and somehow I remember being in the goddamn thing was Kevin misher his office pitching him a movie I didn't have a pitch for I have title but not nothing else and somehow it progressed from there is like really I told him kind of a cool title with I completely half a side remember I wish it was weird I don't even I can't remember I wish I could remember it well cuz it's after the fact and I had this happen I don't remember this is like your story like the anti ambition store it's like the anti preparation story was successful nonetheless this is why I want a cast and this is exactly what I want to do and if you guys don't want to do it that's cool let's just not work together and they did it wow like that's so great right there like doing the whole thing and big production and it was weird wow when it wrapped like final de final scene and that's a wrap will you like what the fuk just happened well the funny thing is like after we wrap the first time we had a little test green within the studio like friends and I call we could we should probably punch up the ending so they gave me like they gave me more money to reshoot the any that I actually made my newest movie with his money was nothing like throwing money around like is like nothing else in the same building as Giants I don't write I wish I could remember these things better. It's weird that I don't but what attracted you to this Ultra violent psychopath like Outcast murderous style of movie that you do because you have like these almost like mutant Society psycho murder people that don't like Outsider mentality like anything that involves like I think it started as a kid as a kid cuz it's like a lot of people to like this I didn't feel like I fit in like I was like weird I didn't fit it I didn't get like what were the cool shoes to wear on the right freaking Izod sure I didn't understand I wasn't trying to be no one's trying to be weird and I think when I would watch monster movies the monster was always that mentality by King Kong's like a man shooting at me in Frankenstein's like I was just born yesterday why you trying to kill me like and I think it's a weird kid you relate to the monster so as life went on and you know that I would always relate to the outside or then I would always related movies like Taxi Driver Bonnie and Clyde and everything that's normal that was always in the monster movies I'm not always into something that you just tore all the normal people apart and just ripped apart all the day I conceived Notions of what everybody thought was going to happen and then around indoors and a high school when I discovered punk rock you because there's an entire form of music with their just like go fuckyourself that's what we're here she just flipped your whole idea of what life is and then I move to New York if I go out how this entire city of people don't give a fuk up three from Hell people are so f****** pumped yeah it's it's great anime been a long journey because like when my first movie came out I think every review basically said something along the lines of worst movie ever made I hate this movie and now people do look at your best movie you know like you can choose to do ever since so it's just weird saying with white zombie when our first record came out I saw the first review it was as magazine alternative press who two years ago gave me this Lifetime Achievement Award and I had to read the review exactly what they were do you said this is the worst band ever ever ever ignore this band so there was a something you know there must have been something to your contact person I saw who wrote them yeah yeah some things and it's just like you as a when you're young and you're new and you're reading you think that the guys riding it raining all badass you like other dude was look like Lemmy must be this hard-ass guy and I'll help music</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what kind of music did you guys play in the very beginning well when I started I was living in New York City and when my first band White Zombie start I was working at Pee-wee's Playhouse actually as a production assistant perfume Larry Fishburne Cowboy Curtis never had with anybody I was Paul Reubens and I was staying there and he walked by Migos where's the bathroom that's it start a we sort of invented sound based upon completely not knowing what you're doing pop songs even though it doesn't make sense cuz when you try to learn a Ramon song it doesn't make sense even though it seems like all these really simple song cuz I've played them before today catchy but the structure is so odd because you can tell they were just sort of inventing the singer that's how I felt with us cuz I had this weird idea like let's never play conventional drum beats which is like saying what the never make the song fun for anyone to listen to yeah cuz my grades dropped too low because I went from Haverhill to New York so it's like I'm just hanging out danceteria all night I'm not going to school is amazing cuz one night it would be a no Run DMC like before anyone knew who they were and then we'll be like Nick Cave and be this is like I say that every night till 4 a.m. and then we go to school just you know fall asleep or fall asleep on the train ride home in New Jersey then get back so you never went to school like musical instruments or anything I never went I can't learn anything I'm think I'm incapable I just have to do it and figure it out and do it wrong a thousand times I can't I just incapable as a little kid if we got a game I was incapable of reading the directions we were just let's just make up our own rules any kids out there hope right now listening to this. Like that's me I mean if you can make it you can be the Rob Zombie can be an idiot make it but I mean I remember when I got kicked out of school I was sitting in New Jersey I was probably 19 maybe 20 and I was just sitting here thinking I did it my f****** loser choose my wife could work out a crazy things just eventually get better if I don't know how I guess I don't know how because it never they would never seemed like it was going to like white Tommy was a bandit seem like everyone hated and no matter what we had to be literally the last band in New York City to get a record deal maybe that's why we got it like we're literally out of bands we have to sign it but even when that there's always this weird thing and maybe you could really we got it offered a record deal with RCA records we're band that hasn't got anything I turned it down. Mc8 I turned it down and Records know we have nothing this is people holding out for Geffen record cuz they would biggest at the time with no reason to be holding out mixed with stupidity at the same time because I I know I can be My Own Worst Enemy cuz he want to sign the Geffen and I come up with an album title they like really you going to call the Sexorcisto devil music vol 1 is this just to guarantee we don't get any good placement on the album in stores I guess and then like the video but it all work with crazy the past onto legitimate record companies I would need most kids when they're starting out or so you know you like holy s*** this is our chance I didn't think they were good enough. Even though we weren't good enough for anything either I don't know what that thought was well maybe you just not a believer in fate but yeah my whole life is just like I could have gotten hit by that car I just didn't cuz I just stopped one second short from actually stepping in front of a speeding car and made it so you always wanted to make movies though that was always have that was always the thing I wanted to do for sure but that seemed completely undoable because it was just like Hollywood and movies I mean it just it feels so far far removed any living on the Lower East Side playing cbgb's like and being broke that seems doable like you know and not actually inspired me there's I would see so many bands like a whole dates suck I mean we'd at least better than they are you know that was the motivation I had but like movies that's one of the best thing Richard jeni once said that about open mic night that really bad comedians are great because they inspire people to try it yeah friends over there I think it's so similar I can't imagine staying there trying to tell jokes that people are laughing but I also can't imagine staying here playing songs that nobody wants to hear and they're just looking at it like yeah that's why I always figured like I was always visually oriented so I always made sure the band had to look a certain way and act a certain way the way I wanted them to be you know so I thought at least there's that at least you know this is awful but look at these Maniacs where you know everybody's hair is down here and they're going crazy and no one else is going crazy in the club but they are at least it's you know that's been entertaining tray I thought at least there's that at least you know this is awful but look at these Maniacs where it you know everybody's hair is down here and they're going crazy and no one else is going crazy in the club if they are at least it's you know that's been entertaining Trainwreck to watch at least you know</div>

Hammer people and they all my head Burns all over my hands cuz the apple candy Reese ohoto dripping my hand and burn I digress one night there was a big gambling tense which were all rigged of course and someone had some guy getting fleas for all his money and came back and let the tent on fire and then suddenly she had offended everybody that me and my little brother have been around all the time it's like I'll just gonna start coming out when everything's on fire it's complete chaos and I was probably in 5th grade my brother is probably in second grade around in the sky was like that I don't remember his name but he work there somebody hit him in the face with a hammer and broke his whole face open it was just gushing blood and we're like and then eventually my parents got us in the car and we left which was that was my parent my mom's like what done this is not doing this anymore wow what a great way to go out though but the best was going to school on September like what did you do this summer in that was my story wow we didn't go to Cape Camp Winnipesaukee we Carnival Riot what was the gambling tent like what kind of games are they riggan I don't know I mean everything is rigged like anything from and is even a great scene in Kearney where I'm the friend of mine has an alarm when was Meg Foster plays when she's holding all the long strands of rope and Joni foxy change it if I'd like to pull the Rope it's connected to a prize or like the weighted leg milk bottles you're supposed to knock down the softball and everything free in certain ways you know how to cheat him so that when the guy showed me how to do it like it's always just do it like this get some lettuce for Aetna never stops on the number that the guys get all his money on cuz he let him win a bunch of times it's so when the fire broke out and people search who's shooting and who I don't know why was going this little kids like you don't really comprehending Dover going on with 4th or 5th grade just like that guy I hear gunshots everything's on fire the smoke people screaming this guy's brains out of the front of his head so f*** put in this the new movie 3 from hell this was like when I was in high school I was in the backyard rehearsing with my two friends aren't YouTube and Twitter and we heard the screaming it was a bright sunny day that you make a David Lynch movie Suburbia fat naked guy was running down the street covered in blood even stabbed a whole bunch of times when people and their lawns and a bloody naked guy running down the street screaming like we're going to get stabbed and I'm sure I put something like that but it's just yeah I don't know thing that happens when you see too much it's one of the reasons why cops and soldiers have some of the oddest sense of humor I could see that I've just seen too many bodies have to come scrape up all the stuff off the road and the bags brother he would always didn't always but sometimes he was a biker so he come over to the house and get a chopper with iron crosses on any kind of like a limited big mustache</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you were saying that you collect films and you have films did you do go back to like a really old ones like Nosferatu silent movies and now they're easier to get cuz I always love Lon Chaney with somebody that I was showing my kids Lon Chaney two nights ago Rhino Fredrik March depends what does the John Barrymore silent Jacqueline hybrid fredric March one is great it's so perverted isn't really the prostitutes and stuff isn't the one you showed your kids like in the third Spencer Tracy one because it was so strange they there this actually when you know on iTunes you can watch a preview but it's not really a preview Anatole films cuz I didn't have ya reviews back then so it's just now seeing and it's a scene when he's becoming mr. Hyde but he doesn't look any different yeah he's a secret mist do you want because he he like that he promptly painful make up for that I needed invented everything you do the things you do I mean I don't know how much the stores have been exaggerated by publicity apartments with you guys but yeah he's just incredible in movies like The Unknown or the Unholy three ways you can get everything out forever I got to have it then I realize I'm spending too much money on things with those old films you know what I'm trying to show him to my kids I was just trying to we were we are going from the twenties to the 30s there's a movie that the original horror film that I found out was 1920s actually 2 years old and aspirado it was Doctor something. how weird is like the progression of film particula scary films because when my kids were real little my wife was out of town and I said you guys want to watch a scary movie that's not really scary they were nervous how was your day I think they were five and three or maybe 6:00 and 4 somewhere around there throwing down the test do you want to watch it but I knew it was a really scary and I put on original King Kong from what was it like 30 we were laughing I was like let me tell you something we're going to watch this and it's so fake it looks so dumb I go we're going to we're going to laugh until we were cuddled up on the couch and they were nervous and then once they saw the thing like that's it that's a monster I was like let me tell you something kid in 1933 this was scary for people they really thought this guy realistic. This is amazing watch something like save Frankenstein we watching something and we'll be a scene where like Frankenstein's killing Fritz and there's no music and he's just screaming as like this must have f****** been so intense cuz no one had seen anything like that they're watching ya creature who they don't understand the makeup because no one who has done the first appearance of interns I am running for the door pull up a picture of what Boris Karloff looks like in that movie I haven't seen that in forever but I'm so good it was so good and they also it's so difficult for us to understand perspective like to put yourself in their place back then. Look at that writing was incredible for I mean I guess go back to reset a second ago like Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera and is Quasimoto you kind of the bolts and the cables for a battery so crazy the posts on his neck do you remember when they did a remake with DeNiro I do I don't remember it movie very good I don't remember it either but I remember of being terrifying looking like they he was updated yeah he looked cool they got it so right the first time ya in the performance is it like when I watch like I really like Lugosi in Dracula and when you watch it I was feel like he's like Brando of that time cuz everyone else is like talking like like we're still getting vodka you know like the way they're talking yeah and that's why nobody can remember David manners who got paid 10 times with a ghost but but Lugosi like this iconic thing like Marilyn Monroe I'm in the Des was so out of time with so special what they're doing in the scene where the woman have been bit and what's wrong another level and the like everybody like a lot of those actors then seemed very much like they were in the closet and they're trying to like play with a woman and Lugosi has that violate I'm going to f*** everything on this set before I leave this movie you know Dracula's and he's so like switching over the top and Lugosi and Karlov together a so intense it's like this two different movies going on this weird Hollywood and this weird thing these other guys are doing me it's like Brando in Apocalypse Now like you make it a whole different movie is it was on credible what it was no there was no sort of Benchmark for him right I mean and he looked so f****** weird with a long fingers and yeah another crazy actor that yeah reeks of crazy right off the screen yes yes yeah it's just hard to do a good monster movie these days and Rick Baker fan obviously I just love the Prosthetics in like Star Wars and Sheila had which by the way I went to the Star Wars attraction yesterday Disneyland It's the s*** that f****** Star Wars incredible man do they have to coordinate one goes up one goes our left and right so up and down is one kid and left and right yeah they next to each other in the cockpit or they separate like house to each other and apparently there's a bunch of other ones that are there in the process of developing to an hour early but I loved those movies in a big part of it was like like the Cantina scene if you if you went to that now you like oh my God it's obviously a mask oh yeah yeah shellshock like everything I thought about everything just changed yeah it's life will never be the same another movie that's so hard to put in perspective I've watched it with my kids now and it's like you got to bring them back in the 1970s in this movie came out someone gave me a laser laser from a Blu-ray of the original before Lucas get all the extra stuff and ruined it somehow they had cut together something went to all the trouble getting like a Japanese lasers and they cut together a Blu-ray exactly the movie as it wasn't 1977 scene with the digital and just like you'll be like a Tauntaun that's like what does just little robots and b******* everywhere wasn't there another like that and now would seem so badass for affection when it was $2,000 Superbad with a Cheesy of the visual format and so he he shot things in a way where he didn't he wasn't willing to compromise the way something looked to show you something that like like sort of like the King Kong animation like that's as best I could do back then figured workarounds and I just read this new book that came out and maybe six months ago this all about the make him 2001 and it's the book is so detailed I wish I could remember that I love and it's amazing the amount of time they had to make the digital readouts on the computer screens because that's the did not exist at all so the a time that wanted to do simple background things that nobody cares about it is just mind-blowing no weightlessness scenes and how they did all that stuff which still look amazing no it's still incredible movie and it's also a time capsule right but it's also great and a time capsule yeah it's I love it because I love all these movies because they take over the viewer watch it and it's doing what the movie thinks will make you happy with Kubrick's doing stuff like well this is what it be like to be in Space the pace it's going to unfold that like which is painfully slow at times you can't get away with you got it with the Redrum scene with a happy ending in the somebody opening shot would be and then go 300 earlier yeah I think it would do that it's cool to see though like those films they did what they could do with what was available where is now the problem with CGI is they use it and they over you and I think that I don't even CGI can be phenomenal for sure but it's a tool and its turn into a crutch and I see it with actors like you see actors lot of time I feel bad for the actresses used to actors that you do I know these guys are great but they're awful in this movie because I didn't train to stand in a warehouse that's green and pretend look at stuff look at that. On the wall I mean and do you know these guys are pure black cuz I was talking to somebody wants to kill those in my movies and all the Spy Kids movies and he said it was so hard because they be on a green screen look like you're looking at that will not sure what you're looking at but just stare at that. And what is it is it a dragon or is it my mom what am I do when you go back and you look at some of them like you know what movie got it right the disorder didn't get enough respect and its time but in in in time like as time passed it's become more respected as Starship Troopers yeah I know I don't remember that movie that well yeah right a lot of what it's like a GI isn't it yeah with with monster movies though it's Pat McGee he's the guy who did that werewolf the one that's out there you can make them for you like him a call and we had this conversation about it we saying that you can see CGI and even if it's awesome your brain knows it CGI that's funny that I have that same thought that it's something subliminally your brain knows it's all fake IDs like where is like yeah like Godzilla like when you know it's a guy in a rubber suit crushing things like what you watch the original one with like when they cut in Raymond Burr this something so dark and f***** up about that yes cuz everything's real fire this actually three dimensional object blowing up but when it's so big and fake like I always say like what's scarier a giant CG creature that you know you will never see or like a maniac with a pillow case over his head holding an axe coming at you like your brain goes that could happen I get it doesn't like well that's that's like Rodger rabbit that's not it might be cool but it's not few encounters they have with a creature you don't even see the damn thing because it's you couldn't show it that much like the shark in Jaws but when you see it it's like it's actually there that its jaws are right in front of Sigourney Weaver's face it's not like she's looking at nothing and her Islands a little off because it's you know tennis ball on a stick she's looking at this something about it really happening in the space that I think people can feel it and Sigourney Weaver is probably think Sigourney Weaver in Alien is the greatest female action hero star ever because you bought it Hook Line &amp; Sinker she was a scientist she wasn't supposed to be this heroin that's out there just open things up and killing everybody and she wasn't supposed to be super hot and sexy and young but she was hot enough because she became top and it made her butt like an alien came out it was kind of like when the thing came out and all the reviews were bad if you remember every great character actor doing great Rose but it was like now if they read me that if you like everybody but that's the thing you the reviews and never mean anything that just like so crazy. First I was it Harry Dean Stanton that sought the first time who was it that saw the first time will they climb down into the the climb down the stairs and it's right there I don't remember it for like a second but it was a physical thing but the point is it was an actual guy in a suit yeah and you knew by the way moving there was an actual guy right in front of three-dimensional space in real life when you can feel you can and you know I mean just like when the chest first thing you know and then at the end of it you see it and even when they weren't they kill it in the hallway or in the eye that's it for a couple seconds when it when it stares at her and then they gunned it down yeah that was like the Heyday for affect everybody I know who does affect it was like the thing American Werewolf in London or howling stairs and her and then the gun it down yeah that was like the hay day for affects everybody and never does affect it was like the thing American Werewolf in London or howling Woods</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you think that there is there a style of film or a kind of movie that you want to do that you haven't done yet that you're thinking you'd like to get into I mean there's two different projects I tried to develop for a long time and they both failed to get off the ground one was this movie called The Broad Street Bullies and it was about the 1974 Philadelphia Flyers in the movie is the true story is so insane that you can't believe it's real just the way that they did guided their fledgling team nobody cared so they basically built the team of tough guys you know which is kind of slap shots almost like won the Stanley Cup twice based on just being so scared so-and-so terrorizing other teams would be scared to play them know they do you get the Philly flu cause major plays Willy play with fans that come off the ice they break up any when the guys are fighting in the doesn't seem like good natured like going to go it seems like ripping someone's hair and punching him in the face till their teeth are all gone type fighting cops are breaking up the fights on the ice cops with Gates for years and and then they just you know and Bobby Clarke at that time was like a most hated man in hockey out of your hockey funeral but he's just like another one's got he was he had I don't know I could go on forever for a movie but I could go and just never you could just never and I wasn't went to Philadelphia knows it hanging I'm in the team owners want to glorify that time in the visit amazing documentary on at those on HBO maybe like 5 years ago you got to watch it wasn't it might have been called Broad Street Bullies because there was a spectrum was on Broad Street but it's nuts beer that does not like hockey Maniac stitches get hit get Stitch go back on the ice with the stitches there's jerseys covered in blood and they don't even change their Jersey their plan covered in blood I was going to be a hockey player when I was little kid and that was me think and grow long time you my wife get season tickets for the king so we go to every single game here at the year of the year and we do is hang out with the team they come to our house and then party and would always be with him Vegas and they're like football players on skates and they're all for like these that guy so just to have no give but it's the one sport where it's written in that you can fight I mean it's so funny it's so crazy like that would make so many sports so much more interesting but nobody would ever do it yeah it's literally the tough-guy sport it is the tough guys born a thing I was driving crazy like for me crazy with him involves me but they would always advertise the LA Kings is like it's like this family thing like Toronto hockey jersey on the Billboards around town like you should just put up mugshot style portraits of the players like smiling with their teeth missing and just as you think you're f****** tough writings because hartsells MMA which is weird right because that's like the darling of so many you go to the fights and Matt Damon will be there and Leonardo Dicaprio and everybody wants to be seen there and Kanye's in the crowd and it's one of those things where people loves decided like that's okay your mother is open with elbows on the grill mental man seconds earlier because it's become a fight in a basketball game is it giant theater like all my God I shoved another guy it's weird but I mean I can see why they they want I think they probably like Hockey being more family-friendly cuz the Arenas are so nice and bring the girls and they don't want a bunch of Maniacs beat the s*** out of each other they can still fight they can still fight but it is just one time one particular incident the Kings game where the guy was out and it went on forever end of I was so heavy in the arena cuz why is he dead cuz you know when someone hits it's such a weird thing to see people from that era I hear the early days before they became insane oh so it built up cuz what happened was when they were starting as a team they got really manhandled One Time by a certain team and they're like this is never going to happen again and they rebuilt team would basically like bug type guys I'm always amazing anybody could punch while they're on skates and I can't skate maintain your I don't know where you guys are amazing outfits I want time I went I went down and got to skate at practice for the LA Kings with a guys were injured and that ring seems small when those big guys all get on the ice Only stores like each other against the wall with the amount of shock on your body I know it's amazing it I mean they just go and go and go with this conversation because I think that would be able he's pulling his f****** a****** it wasn't what it was that it's amazing so have you tried again recently or I I tried to think that this is like they just don't want to be connected to the story what does this guy Ed Snider who was the guy who started whole team and that's where I met with I thought he was a reason it wasn't going to happen and then he passed away cuz I mean he's pretty old and then we start talking of the newer people and it just Play Addicted by Brian and someone said you got further than anyone else ever did Mike how many times did they try to make this movie I just warned me about that five years ago is there any other kind of movie that you're you're interested in other than something like that well yeah there was this other one that I worked on for a long time and never want either I bought the rights to this book called raised eyebrows which is a light that about the last few years of Groucho Marx's life this guy Steve Stolle wrote it he was a 19 year old college kid who started this petition Drive do you like the Marx Brothers animal crackers have been lost that was the last film and at UCI things at UCLA sorry Stephen I can't remember to get animal crackers released from the bolts and released cuz I hadn't been seen since like the 40's or something doctor's assistant but Groucho's final years a really dark because he kept having strokes and he was Ill any of this woman Aaron Fleming who's supposed to be big kind of late like it was his girlfriend but you said the caretaker and it was turned into Sunset Boulevard inside his house you know in Steve eventually put in charge of Groucho because the it's a home and it says dark it was dark for the enfagrow Joe and but the book is fascinating cuz the guy wrote it Steve who's still alive and we're friends yeah I got a game kids he goes Jesus he goes he goes all I love my wife because I love my cigar too but I take it out of my mouth every now and then yeah that was a hugely controversial he's being taken care of as he's older and you know he's getting f***** over and someone's waiting for him to die so they can get the money and she kept going to make you come back Groucho and we're going to do us tv specials going to be like you and Frank Sinatra and Groucho's like you know a third stroke and I can't really talk or and then how did this lady get into his life she was Secretariat first I can't remember exactly I should I should be a lot the owner boyfriend she's like this in a wheelchair kids are done with them and so someone else is taken care of all that show older kids of all died of old age producers and I was like five years spent with this I'm out of time for every movie I've ever gotten made this probably five others that I tried to get made they couldn't get made some the real time suck ya with this I'm out my God the Drina time yeah that does something like for every movie I've ever gotten made this probably five others that I tried to get made they couldn't get made some

		<div class="paragraph"> the Rick Baker scene when he transforms into the werewolf in the chicks apartment in the nurse's apartment for the first time and it is like man with Benicio del Toro yeah but it just wasn't there the movie wasn't there just wasn't wasn't quite good enough but there's one f****** badass scene where becomes the Wolfman when they're in the insane asylum doing tests on them I don't remember that film that much I remember watching it such a stupid thing for me to say cuz I don't know what the f*** he wants these brilliant actor and I really like what he's ready but it just had that feeling like I don't know what it was and I've talked to people connected with that movie I don't think it was a great experience for people for some reason maybe there's a lot of meddling probably a lot of meddling is that something that's a difficult thing to manage or do you not have to deal with that anymore I had to deal with that a lot when I made the two Halloween movies meddling it was just like kind of psychotic meddling House of weird like like my phone was ringing all the time when I'm onset working and it be like we think it should be this I'm like why do your work yet if I did that then everything we shot doesn't match and it makes no sense it's just like they're doing coke happened in whatever was the number one movie that from that weekend was exactly the notes I would get for what we're working on it didn't and I swear your house around the time of private parts and private parts was number one I go I guarantee when I walk in the office going to say can we get Howard Stern in this movie and they did that is a classic story in Hollywood I mean that's that's really like a villain in a film about a movie about a guy trying to make a movie yeah I mean I always thought I will give credit for things like member working Bob Weinstein in Irish. Like the first thing he would say was spot-on like they they love movies they have a good sense of movies and he would say something but like when he went to the next level of the detail of what's wrong with it it's kind of like something like that jokes not funny here's how it would be funny if you could just sitting there you'll know they're bored during this part is boring or they're not laughing it's supposed to be funny I don't now need are the bordering this part is boring or they're not laughing it's supposed to be funny I don't now need that kid to get up and explain to the studio how to save the picture cuz you watch the movie once so that the process is like half good and half insanity</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> have long-term plans look in terms of like what you want to accomplish as a a guy who makes movies well yes or no I mean I don't have a I'm not trying to gear up to his making bigger films because I know I wouldn't work in that system because it's just not I don't want to make things by committee I would like to see the f****** crazy thing I want to do and I don't want to water cuz I know so many people that will be like like our friend Tom Papa I remember him telling me about his TV show come to Papa is like a certain idea is it by the time the TV people watered it down changed it gets on the nerves like it's so far removed from the original idea that I get it made whatever it takes a worried about are just about making the thing where I can look into it I love it I'm done cuz looking at this stage that's what I want to do that the genre is still so attractive but they're just not a lot of those examples of than like but your films are probably the most prominent currently well I mean if everything's meant I mean horror movies are big business but if they look at it that way then they start making them overly palatable to a wider audience. the horror movies. You know there's layout supernatural horror movies is monster movies but then there's like homicidal maniac movies and if you cannot do not s*** redneck homicidal type stuff that typical kid who worshipped Evel Knievel when I work with wires that considered mental it was just a little kid watching Evel Knievel and listen to Alice Cooper and watching hockey fights and that determines who you become I mean I think it was a rolling stone piece of his body where they showed all of his X-rays and all of the bone breaks and steel rods that were various bones were screwed together like talk man what kind of pains is I don't know I mean did you see that there's a fairly new documentary I think it's called being Knievel I think it's amazing what has any one of those crashes over the double-decker buses and you can see him land in the bike looks like it's made out of rubber and he looks like he's made out of wrapping like it looks like every bone in his body just broke and that's it that was his thing imagine that being your thing you what you're saying is you fly through the air on something that's supposed to stay on the ground a full size Harley that's not made for jumping or doing anything some pretty interesting s*** and risked their lives but he was doing it consistently with an engine that was like anything about him it's like and he was like one of the most famous people in America knowing how out-of-control it was with the people that showed up and was so drunk and the crowds are fighting and crazy just on the is mental yeah three times in the air it's commonplace original King Kong with your kids like all that was a big deal when he jumped seven buses whatever I did it on my bike that would be a great film I don't know what you have to do now catch bullets with your bare hands do you know he's the free solo. We saw a guy yeah I still haven't seen that yet but it was nice and so normal when you talk to him about on the podcast a couple of times and I'm like how are you the guy that's wanting to climb the face in the f****** clips and some of them they're not straight up and down by a finger is there any starting to get injured now too and you know it was for the first time in his life he's had you know for a long time he had no injuries no problems and he's always been doing this a long time now is Bonnie's not holding up the way it used to India retire like when you can even when you know it's all of the people that have done it before him think they think look this is going to end badly yeah you know it's it's crazy to be known as the guy who's doing something that scares the f*** out of everybody you're the guy that everybody's watching to eventually fall into that the angle impossible he's incredibly strong his hands like he's a slender thin guy but he has gorilla hands when you realized you know like f****** 300 feet out that he forgot his powder so he's got no chalk so he's you know things are getting slippery he's climbing any finds these guys that are connected to ropes halfway up and he says hey I don't have any powder can I borrow your chalk so God gives us a bag he makes it all the way to top and leaves the chalk bag at the top of the guy chalk like you know if you ever lifted weights like with that bar gets slippery it sucks if you need chalk to grip things right so you can you can really get ahold of stuff but that's just weights you could put the weight down at the worst fall is going to be three feet to the floor fascinating guy because it doesn't make sense he's not like some Stevo type guy there a maniac and just like always trying to freak people out and do the next thing you know he's reading a rocket I'm a shopping cart into a brick wall calm and peaceful you know he's he said like he's like well you know I'm pretty mellow you know it's like when the whole thing is pretty mellow it's like when things go wrong that's when it's not mellow God</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> was kind of how police had total autonomy they domini they had so much power and authority back then yeah it was crazy I remember another incident this is right before I left at least I think it's our time was fighting finished Square Park in that area is getting gentrified that was the big word and there was like kind of a riot there was all the people protesting the gentrification of the Lower East Side this was probably like I don't know early 90s and the cops showed up on Horseback and I was I was I just walked out to go to the deli I don't even know this was happening I just walked right into the middle of like what's going on here and then the cops just started racing to the crowd start running and I saw a friend of mine so bad he had World Andre he just had so much damage to his head he been like a coma or something and then it was a big Scandal to deprive finances it cuz the cops all put black tape on their badge numbers so that no one could tell who is who while they did all this s*** and we're going to find her a New York post a picture of like a I think I posted badge with the black tape that she was back then you say I was like a turning point in Hunter at Thompson's life cuz he was there and he watched these cops just beat the f*** out of people and he said that he saw far worse beatings by the Chicago Symphony ever saw of the Hell's Angels cuz you know his first book we have the Hell's Angels suck so he was around getting to biker brawls and she said he's like this f****** paled it paled I mean it's yet but it's crazy to but sometimes I be a cop must be a crazy job horrific because I can't imagine I mean I'm doesn't justify and I said we're talking about but I can't imagine how you couldn't go crazy in that job you see everyday and what do you most of them I think of PTSD almost everybody eats a liar find me and you weren't an enemy outfit all these criminals are the enemy is so terrible way to live yeah I need them badly right it's you know I want you around around cop movies people love people love cop movies in the cops are the good guys yeah so strange like their interactions with humans in real life like wife people treated them the way they think about them in the movies would be a wonderful time to be a cop it's weird though cuz I remember that time. New York like so straight like I have a different relationship than when I see cops but there's like a bum kid at 19 like I'm walking down the street and a cop alongside roll down the window and it start taunting me saying s*** like you know Kelly's waiting for you to say something back did more accountable now than ever before I think that's one of the great things about body cameras and cellphones cops hurt you know you just can't rock it that way before but I don't think they get enough counseling and I don't think they get enough money and I don't think there's I don't think it's a stringent enough screening process I think there's a lot of people that are there you know they're powerless twats when they're young and they want everybody for all the wrong reasons and then they're the ones that give the cops a bad name and if you think about the amount of interactions of people have police in this is what y perspectivas so important they are f****** 320 million people in this country and cops have millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of interactions with people all the time but how many of those interactions are positive ID of them are not police brutality the vast majority of we're not shooting someone implanting weapon on number planting drugs on the corner hard job and doing their best but nobody gives a f*** about that you only care when the cops go bad you know you know you know best but nobody gives a f*** about that the only care when the cops go bad you know you know cuz it's perspective which you know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's a crazy leap that you've made I mean people know you as much now for your films as they do for your music yeah pretty much specially I really noticed that when I'd be like in an elevator like the music fans I can pretty much spot them you know but like when some guy comes up in elevator looks like he's a lawyer or something cuz I'm not will I get with normal people I go am so into this or that because you know I feel like heavy metal music very specific but everybody likes movies yeah that's funny yeah right it was rock and roll synonymous yeah it's like not not anymore what made you make that leap into horror films will I always wanted to make movies that was always my main goal in life really before music while it was coming back and I loved everything equally but as a kid it all seemed unattainable so it was Oliver fantasy art yeah I would never fall if I think when I was a kid and play Ice Hockey we would play against in New Hampshire crappy Super 8 movies but none of it seems realistic I thought my life was going to be in a world wars bike messenger in New York City that seem to be what I was destined for but then as the band started taking off and which seemed odd and its own in there was a chance to make music videos like f****** I'm directing these music videos this will be film school for me and that's what it's worth I became did you have this thing that a lot of people have when things are going well for them like you kind of you like this are they going to find out my whole life is like a fool them again I think everybody feels like that I think so too I mean that cuz I was always so I was so shy and I was so sure I wouldn't like want to talk to people on the phone and I was a kid cuz that was too much yeah that one day I realize I just this is how I realized it one day like in high school I didn't so she with anyone like no one remembers me cuz I was just invisible but me and my friends were sort of like punk rock like in a place where like knowing it was that was that was in the day we graduated we were at like hanging out around McDonald's in the main a****** jaw kid came up who will be the worse your worst enemy so you like him and go to college when you guys get like you're cool clothes and stuff oh that's, I'm a different person forgive those people you know the people that f*** with you in highschool it's hard to let that go and realized that all they just were probably tortured at home while you can't let it go because that's your motivation I'm always motivated by probably bite anger and revenge and things of that nature that's why when people on anti-bullying I don't want might be anti success later on our life and because he know yeah Chris Rock has a bit about that I mean for Fighters almost all the best fighters in the UFC have some story where someone was f****** with them in their young when they had to figure out how to fight yep what's the first thing I'll do take karate lessons become entertainers also had some form of social anxiety when they're young yeah I had to do this thing lasts another night before last I was presenting this award to somebody at this event and you know I'm picturing all the stage will be really big and high and I can get up there at Super impersonal doesn't matter when I get there the stages like lower than this desk and it's like all the tables with people eating dinner right that my aunt's nightmare when I had to talk to bank tellers I used to like you know when you're in the line but that doesn't make any sense right but the line of like I have to deposit my check and I'd be in the line and like four more people and I got to talk feeling f****** thousands of people playing guitar in front of thousands of people I wish I could play guitar I but I will sink from the people it doesn't bother me it doesn't matter what the crap it's crazy five people that's brutal this is so weird it's like 500 people no problem yeah five people that's why starting like when you have to go back and play clubs and more intimate setting like no I want the shows to be bigger is impersonal as humanly possible because I hated playing clubs in the people like right in front of you like I hated playing clubs and people like right in front of you like you don't know how that kind of suck but can you just go with it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> remember this a woman who came to the comedy store after the last podcast that we did and she apparently is also working on it and she was trying to explain it to me her version of it you know after hearing your version of is very similar but I believe she was from Romania she was struggling a little bit with English so excited to discuss it it's so fascinating when you see someone who's like for the limited number of how many of you guys there are and gals there are out there I mean whatever the number is when that spark gets ignited and other people start tuning into it she was so excited that this was being discussed on a podcast and she wanted to talk to me about it to say in a please have more people on please talk about this more and we need support we need you know it's it is it's it does baffle me a little bit how difficult it is swimming uphill to get more support for this kind of because it is just an enormous privilege to be able to call your job thinking about the fundamental nature of reality right like you know I gave you my first book tour talk was last Tuesday and I had dinner the night before with several philosophers of physics in the New York area of him from Columbia to NYU whenever and yeah we're all friends and we could talk about you know our cats in our cars but every single word discussed at the table all night long was about the philosophy of History because you guys work in isolation essentially and then when you get together you just you're so pumped up to beat discussing these things so complex that it's so esoteric there's so many people that just they don't deserve the support for it's not there yet but the support for philosophy is more common in mainstream what what areas do you want like a physics department will generally say yeah we should have some people doing particle physics some people doing astrophysics some people doing condensed matter and solid state physics and then and then it becomes hard we need people doing this and by the time they get to the foundations of quantum mechanics there's there's usually very little support philosophers there their job is being patient and clarifying difficult conceptual questions and so they get that quantum mechanics is fertile territory for velocity like it you know one of the big problems in philosophy compared to science is that many of the questions they're asking cannot be tested experimentally what is infinity an experiment there was an important question right and so you need patience but also it's harder to make progress because it's easy to be trapped by your intuition right like when it's just you thinking and trying to think hard and be rational and so forth it's easy to fall into a trap of well this looks reasonable to me and quantum mechanics doesn't look reason with anybody so it's a wonderful corrective It's a Wonderful reality check when you think will reality have to this way and then someone can say well look at quantum mechanics it's different than what you said so philosophically and quantum mechanics they sort of the they share some sort of a border be kind of dry to me because they were all about how scientific theories are constructed and chosen you know the structure of scientific revolutions is the famous book that everyone reads people like Thomas Kuhn and Paul feierabend and so forth that's interesting but it's weird science science is how the world works until you know that I discovered that there are philosophers of physics who are kind of really doing physics you know that they're not asked Health physics works there asking how the world works but they're asking away that is Comfortably located in philosophy departments in right now not too much of physics departments there was a part of the book that the shock me because I had a ridiculous idea once and this idea was not my idea apparently LaPlace had very similar idea as a thought experiment I had an idea once that if one day there was a computer that was so powerful that it could accurately describe every single object on earth that we would be able to figure out the past and La Paz was saying that not only that we would he propose for the entire universe I got every single object electron everything in the atom in the entire universe that you would not only be able to show the past but also predict the future that's right so this is called the positive demon although he never called to that I think I've mentioned him his name and every book that I've ever written for a totally different reason he helped invent probability as we currently understand it for example but yeah so Isaac Newton came up with the rules of classical mechanics in the 1600 but it wasn't until LaPlace around the year 1800 that this implication of classical mechanics was realized it's A Clockwork universe that the way classical mechanics works is if you tell me the state of a system right now with one moment by which In classical mechanics you would be in the position and the velocity of every part and you knew the laws of physics and you had arbitrarily large computational capacity of Applause set of vast intelligence okay then to that vast intelligence the past and future would be as determined and known as the present was because that's the Clockwork universe is deterministic everything is fixed once you know the present moment you're a Mini World person laplace's demon is still possible so if you know the wave function of the universe exactly and you haven't calculation capacity you could predict the past and the future with perfect accuracy but when you're predicting is all the branches of the wave function so any individual person inside the wave function still experiences apparently random events right so you can't predict what will happen to you even if you can predict what will happen to the entire year there's a lot of people pause this podcast right now just shaking their head like a little article that just appeared in quanta magazine which by the way if anyone hears a science fan quanta magazine is the best online magazine for Science these days they have really really good high-level are articles and so I wrote an article called what is probability question physical to put it to use and get on with their lives lost real estate what do you really mean by probability the traditional answer is if you're flipping a coin and you say it's fifty-fifty what you mean by that is that if you flipped it an infinite number of times half the time it would be heads at the time of details that's what you mean it's called a frequent test idea probability but then what do you say like what what is the probability that Donald Trump wins re-election the number of times you not going to do the experiment or even better what was the probability that Lee Harvey Oswald actually was the Lone shooter of JFK that already happened in the past rather than an infinite number of things going on you're assigning a degree of confidence to your lack of perfect knowledge right like I don't know exact there's something going on I don't know what it is so I find a probability independent just like the frequency that you know there's the Creedence as we say that you assigned to these different ideas is a positive number than all the greens is that it for one cuz something happened so in quantum mechanics it is is probability more like frequent is probability or is it more like Bayesian probability answer is it depends on what your favorite version of quantum mechanics is in one of these spontaneous collapsed theories it's very much like a frequency like you know things happen randomly is purely objective in something like many world won't start saying something like hidden variables it's La pasa's demon all over again so the faucet even doesn't work in a spontaneous collapsed Theory because you the laws of physics are not deterministic you don't know when things are going to collapse all by themselves in Hidden variable Theory the hidden variables and the wave function of all deterministically but you don't know what the hidden variables are so you can assign some ability to having them be different things so there's some ignorance involved many worlds is the coolest idea because it's it's kind of in this is what it is it's kind of hard to wrap your mind around on the one hand there is only the way function it describes the universe exactly but imagine that I measure the speed of an electron okay so I actually do know what the way functions going to evolve into its going to evolve into a 50-50 split of spending up and down and then I only ever find myself in one side or the other so there is always a moment in between when the wavefunction splits and when I know about it it splits much faster than I can do about it though the rate the speed of a wave function branching is some incredibly tiny number 10 by 20 seconds or something like that and the time scale of things happening in my brain is like 10 - 3 seconds that best so there will always be a time when there are two copies of me one on the branch for this pain was up one of the branch would have been was down but they're both identical they don't know which branch their own yet so they need to be good Bayesian since I will what probability should I assign that I'm On One branch or the other and it turns out that the probabilities work exactly like the textbook one mechanics tells you the probability should work out the wave function squared is the probability was the physicist who invented it read the book of course but like like you said it to very start the history of quantum mechanics is just so fascinating and hilarious Schrodinger Schrodinger's Cat theme invented the idea of the wave function and wrote down the equation that it obeys okay but what he hoped was that if you had to wave function of electron all by itself if you solved his equation it would sort of show that the wave function become localized peek at one location the electron kind of act like a point particle and that's why we see particles that was his hope what actually happens when you solve the equation this if the electron spreads out all throughout the universe so he was his Hope was dashed and then he's like all right I have this equation what is it like what is the way function do and it was born the whole another guy inside the wave function does is you square it and that's the probability of seeing something somewhere like the wavefunction looks like this at some spread out thing is very biscuit some spread out thing is very small probability over here and large probability over there to the probabilities the wave function squared and Schrodinger said like oh my God that's awful I'm sad I had anything to do with it he regretted being involved with this whole idea of probabilities and collapses and all that stuff</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and there's an enormous number of you making various choices and that these various choices will ultimately affect how long you exist in some branches so there is a weird thing called Quantum immortality which I think is a bad idea and I don't like to talk about it but people hear about it so sometimes needs a friend of mine little bit. You know weird the experiment but imagine you doing you're playing Quantum Russian Roulette so you have your Universe splitter you have your app on your iPhone and you can split the universe and if it goes one way you don't do anything if it goes the other way faster than you can react machine is activated that kills you instantly okcu you don't even know if you don't even perceive it you don't have any pain you couldn't delete that and you do this over and over and over and over and over again so Amo ocean your dad but in those your dad you don't know anything you don't you don't feel like your dad you know there's no regret after the fact the only version of you that survives is the one that was lucky enough to be in the branch where you didn't die every single time so take Mark's argument was that if you do this over and over again and you survived you could take that is good evidence that many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct because another version quite right I don't think it's a good way to go through your life I think that the reason why we don't want to die is not just that we will experience pain but that sort of prospective Lee right now the idea of being dead in the future bother me right like if someone said you know you're going to die in this and that date might be useful information but I'll be sad as soon and I think the same thing was true in the quantum immortality experiment I don't buy the move that says all the branches were your dad doesn't matter cuz your dad you don't feel anything like I think it right now it's okay for me to be bothered by the prospect that in many future worlds I will not be there so I think it is the end of day once again you should act in quantum mechanics just like you acting the regular world are there competing theories to this that this many-worlds theory that you've embraced and then discarded yeah one is more less what Einstein had in mind hidden variable theories so basically you know if you have an electron and you say look when I'm not looking and it's wave like when I look at it it's like particle like maybe it's both maybe there is a Wade and there is a particle so in a hidden variable Theory there's a wave function just like there is in many worlds but there's also another set of variables saying there's really a location of the electron right maybe I don't know where it is but there really is an electron located somewhere and that location the electron is pushed by the way function but it's a whole new part of reality so there's not so that their separate branching of the wave function and all that stuff that none of that is reality where reality is is where the particles are and this is now called bohmian mechanics David Bowman the 1950s developed the most respectable version of this it's sort of therapeutic if you don't like all the other worlds it's basically you know the equations are the same as many worlds except complicates the theory by adding new variables but the good news is it says only one of the branches of the wavefunction is real I don't need to worry about the other ones the problem is it's very hard that might my particular problems it's very hard to reconcile these ideas with modern physics like if you thought the world was made of individual particles do okay but these days we use quantum field Theory and quantum gravity and things like that and those more modern ideas are harder to attach hidden variables to so hidden variables are you known play Dionne but I think if they're hard to make work the other idea which is more dramatic I will bit more fun is every single electron has a wave function and it seems to you that when you observe it collapses but maybe what's really going on at the following but there's a random probability every second that every electron will just spontaneously collapse so it's all spread out but its wavefunction just randomly localizes to some particular region of space very very rarely like if you have electron and you wait for it to happen it will happen like once every hundred million years okay but if I had lots of electrons that can a table is way more than a hundred billion electrons in this table there's there's no billions and billions and billions of electrons so somewhere in the table all the time and electron is localizing at one particular position and because that electron is entangled with all the other electrons the table maintains a location in space and this is called spontaneous collapsed RW Theory after the initials of the people who invented the theory and the great thing about grw theory is that it's experimental distinguishable from many worlds because it says that if I have a collection of atoms even if I'm not absorbing at you for not entangling it one of the wave functions for spontaneously localized occasionally and that will heat it up energy is not conserved in this Theory so people are doing experiments to test this so it's really you know legit experimental science atoms the current ocean by the general public of atoms is that it's mostly empty space idea this is not true or not correct or not it's really not what many world says so this is the other two enormous problems with our current way of presenting quantum mechanics one is the measurement problem which is this question like what do you mean look at it what do you mean observe what actually happens when the other problem is what I unhelpfully call the ontology problem is ontology is the philosophy of being what is real what is actually existing so we just talked about hidden variable theories so in Everett what's real is the wave function the wave function of the universe describes the universe exactly in and completely and many world and hidden variable theories there's a wave function and there's also particles so there's extra oncology extra pieces of reality so the question of is atom mostly empty space depends on what you think is real so the wave function of the electron fill the Adam so if you're a Mini World person like me you think what is real is the wavefunction it fills up the atom when the atom is not mostly empty space the atom is the wave function that has that size right you get the feeling that atoms are mostly empty space because you think that really the electron is a point in the wave function just telling you where you may when you measure a wet well yes so many world says there's no such thing as where it is there's only a probability of seeing it everyone knows that but people kind of diet they talk as if there really is a location of the electron even if they should know better so people who generally people who say that atoms are mostly empty space or just being sloppy they're just really thinking of the electron is a little tiny. Rather than a wave function there is an exception to that because there was a fourth version mechanics that is somewhat popular I said three I said many worlds hidden variables and spontaneous collapsed there's another version that just says look the way function has nothing to do with reality in many worlds it's all of reality in spontaneous collapsed it's all of reality but it obeys different equations and hidden variables the wave functions part of reality but is also particles in the other approach which is called an epistemic approach to Quantum Mechanics the wave function is just talk about your personal knowledge of the world your knowledge or lack of knowledge or ignorance of the world so your wave function just a tool you use to make a prediction for what the experimental outcome is going to be right and that's more or less what we teach our students and this approach says don't bother about reality what we should concern ourselves with is the experiences of agents who make predictions and update their probability expect end of the world and so someone like that if you ask them you know how it is an electron located in an atom or how is it an atom mostly empty space I think if they're honest they would say don't ask those questions those are we don't have to reality questions we just asked what are you going to see kinds of questions but I think of some of the less honest ones will study for an atom is mostly empty space don't know what it is but you the way you're describing a sloppy way what why do you think that is so common well you know it is part of the attitude that physicist physicist have adopted that we use quantum mechanics but we don't try very hard to understand it so you can talk to plenty of physicists on the street and they will tell you to your face that understanding reality is not their job and I think that's terrible but it but they will say it and so when you press them too much on questions like and I was the atom mostly empty space your what happens when you make an observation they just kind of get uncomfortable and say no you're asking the wrong questions let's ask questions about what will we see if the Large Hadron Collider if we smash protons together right questions to what's really going on questions are also interesting so because they don't care about these questions they will read the book it's hard when you write the book it's hardly think about these things as a professional physicist it's it's not natural it's not easy it's not intuitive so even if you're a super duper expert at solving equations and making predictions understanding what's going on is a whole nother activity that a lot of physicists don't try very hard to do all the stuff verified or argued like say it's your sitting down your having a conversation with someone who espouse is a competing Theory how are you guys working this out good I think if everything were going along really really well we would be making experimental predictions and testing them but I think the theorists have sort of dropped the ball here in the sense that the theoretical physicists I should have since the 1930s been developing these Alternatives like many worlds in variables whatever and make using them to make predictions we really haven't they were neglected they were Backwater there were a few people if you pluck e Souls who really put their efforts and understanding these many of them got pushed out in the philosophy departments but that's what we need to do we need to like catch up on the last 70 years of lost time and work out what the implications are these ideas so they didn't the ball I think it's in the theorist doing amazing things with lasers and Adams and and learning about how to manipulate Quantum systems at a delicate level but the theorist and not given them sharp experimental questions that they that would really illuminate the foundations of quantum mechanics so honestly what it is is a bunch of people get around a table and talk to each other but I will see it go left or go right and someone says what do you mean 50-50 chance especially in many worlds where there's a 100% chance they'll be a world where it goes left in a world where it goes right at wouldn't what is the meaning of the phrase there's a 50-50 chance what is the nature of probability in this game where everything is perfectly deterministic right yeah yeah it happens there's conferences it's a small community someone asked me just the other day that you're the book came out something deeply hidden last week and has been on book tour so I was on being interviewed and someone said how many people do you think in the world are would classify themselves as working on the foundations of quantum mechanics maybe a hundred something like that not a very large number like you say how many people to classify themselves as particle physicist someone said how many people do you think in the world are would classify themselves as working on the foundations of quantum mechanics maybe a hundred something like that not a very large number like you say how many people would classify themselves as particle physicist to be tens of thousands</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the reason why I wanted to write this book is very much like you know another thing I do is go around and talk about science and religion and I'm an atheist myself so I say that you know science lead us to not believe in God and I talked about this two very different audiences churches and things like that sometimes well it depends very much on the age of the person in the audience is the thing older people like they made up their minds they're not they're not going to change but young people evening very religious young people are fascinated by what I have to say something they change their mind right away but it might not never heard someone put it that way before right and maybe they do change their mind later maybe not but at least they've heard a perspective that they were not exposed to earlier in the same thing to do with quantum mechanics like there's a buttload of books about quantum mechanics on the marketplace no shortage of books about quantum mechanics but they're mostly with this Spirit of isn't this bazaars as weird will never understand it and I think many many people who have to be physicist this is what they're doing when they are 12 years old the reading these books right and so I wanted to write a book which sad like actually we could maybe understand this if you just tried it's not enough of the mysterious let's let's see no be embarrassed that the field of physics is not put that effort into it and make an effort here and so maybe that will so that's what my new most ambitious hope for book like this is that 20 years from now they'll be a flood of young businesses to think this is really interesting the number would what would you estimate it would be currently how many people do you think of order a hundred that's it I think so yeah like you know what it was when we have conferences is often full people there are 20 people maybe there's more because it always depends on how you draw the boundaries also yes but still that's so stunning when you hear that it's somewhere 100 maybe we have here in California we have sequin the California Quantum interpretation Network which is a group of us the people we know in California who care about these issues and ended me to talk about them and it's like 15 people wow but like I said I do think it's it's it's growing it's expanding and I'm optimistic tend to be optimistic before 2009 that's bad that's bad for physics in a big way because it's great that we had a theory that was the king true with the Higgs boson but in some sense we learned from the Large Hadron Collider the smallest amount it was possible for us to learn there's a Higgs boson and that's it there's a million things we learned about you like for the gravitational waves for measuring the Higgs boson we pinned down numbers we measure the cosmic microwave background of leftover radiation from The Big Bang that you would like something more that you could bring to people saying that this is very valuable intangible stuff that there should be a bunch of other particles that you discover at the Large Hadron Collider and they weren't there meanwhile we have very good reason to think that percent of the matter in the universe is dark matter by 5% of the energy needed and we had very good reason to hope that we could detect it by now in an underground laboratory and we haven't and it's there but it's beyond our reach somehow so it's just so hard to make progress under these circumstances and meanwhile we had big cool ideas like string theory that are hard to connect to the real world so this is the last third of the book to me is you again like I have my favorite ideas but there's a bigger picture about what kinds of ideas we should pursue and how we should persuade them to the last third of the book is maybe we need to understand quantum mechanics to better understand quantum gravity in the theory of everything you know like what should how should be expect to understand quantum gravity if you don't understand quantum mechanics come on about what kinds of ideas we should pursue and how we should persuade them to the last third of the book is maybe we need to understand quantum mechanics to better understand quantum gravity in the theory of everything you know like what should how should be expect to understand quantum gravity if you don't understand quantum mechanics come on</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what was the motivation behind starting a podcast called mindscapes landscape and several episodes about quantum mechanics most recently just last week I did a whole 2 hours solo episode on how space-time can emerge from quantum mechanics Sofia neuroscience and biology and math and computer science is a whole bunch of things in there that I'm not an expert on I'm a big believer that people should talk about things are not an expert on but they should talk about them in some sense of humility that I don't understand everything here so I will talk to some experts right so much fun because I can literally just email and Nobel prize-winning biologist and say can I drop by and talk to you for an hour and then they would say yes I don't have license to call people outside randomly gets like I talk to you for an hour podcast talk to you right so I've gotten you know the trumpet player I talked to Seth MacFarlane the other day battle blast so yeah this is podcasting if he's going to take off you should look into it yeah well for me I mean there's no way I'll be able to get someone like you to sit down explain things without a podcast and it doesn't replace things like books okay but like books are always where you can get into the weeds a little bit like the little bit more specific little bit more careful but there's a long road you know there's a lot of books out there and read all of them that with the other motivation behind the starting my own podcast is that I had a stack of books I wanted to read them to force myself to read them I would invite the author of the podcast enough I should dedicate myself to do a week of my time to reading this book and hearing people talk about it in an informal setting is you both Illuminating but also like oh yeah these ideas in there I really need to get to so I'm a big believer in diverse ecosystems I like Twitter I like little YouTube videos I like podcast I like books I like talks is all sorts of ways give this information the interest in a far broader group of human beings too because conversations like this with you or with you know the hundreds of people that I get to talk to you in a regular basis yeah it's Sparks ideas and people that you know in their seemingly mundane existence maybe just would never get in there and it it did it allows these new areas of inquiry in the new areas for them personally to go look into and I get messages and I meet people all the time it's how many how much it's changed the way they view things because they've now been two interesting information that's sort of spark they're there their view of the world in a different way knighted different parts of their imagination and absolutely any sitting me like literally yesterday one of the areas that I had hoped get onto mindscape podcast the trade deal or what rate the FED should sat in the public economics is it's too relevant to the real world so people want to talk about you no monetary policy things like that but I want to talk about the underlying theoretical ideas right and I realized I just it's hard to get those so I downloaded some economic podcasts and I started listening to them and I have to stop it to think about what just happened because you know they gave me they said something and it gave me an idea and the great thing about being a physicist is there some relationship between what I do for a living and almost everything else right like whether it's economics or biology or philosophy so I can always had like a ID I wonder if I should you write a paper about that so and I wouldn't have done that very easily without the podcast format ya know it's a really interesting time it's really exciting time to spread information it's a really exciting time to find things that you're interested in you know and also you know I always notice it calls you on your crap a little bit right like before the internet you know you could have opinions about things that you can spout off to your friends and you're over the dinner table or whatever over drinks and suddenly when I started having a block and I would spout off and people would say like and you're full of s*** like what he talks irresponsible and wants to get things right putting your ideas out there in public to be critiqued it's a wonderful tool it really does help you figure out like what I do understand and know and what just we're kind of vague ideas that somehow got into my brain For No Good Reason yeah if you're open to the the floodgates that's the problem is there so much feedback and it's really hard to separate the wheat from the chaff it is print strategies like when I talked to Seth MacFarlane he comments like he wants to know curing cancer right it's only cuz it's human curiosity leads us there so if I don't tell other people about it what's the point and we can have a conversation about blocking people on Twitter cuz I was like the only reason why I like Twitter's I block everyone who is a jerk you don't like it they make my Twitter experience Less Pleasant they get blocked right away yeah that's a good move podcast yeah yeah I read a lot of other people's things I don't read any of my stuff like any of the stuff is coming at me it just got too overwhelming after while and it also it interferes with the time that you have to put stuff out because people get wrapped up in responding to their Mansions or reading their mansions and it is an extraordinary amount of time that you can waste doing that that's the secret like people ask like you know how I spend so much time on Twitter and likely talking about 5 minutes a day on Twitter and maybe another 15 minutes reading other people's tweets and 0 time responding to tweet that's the secret like if you can't be precise you can easily misunderstandings and people easily become aggressive jerks right you already know somebody and are just trying to clarify something so I used it from linking two things top of the food chain is one-on-one talking just two people having conversation and especially without any sort of heightened sense of importance or anger or frustration with another person just two people talking that's number one because it was no gravity right number two is probably phone calls like calling someone they don't see them it's not as good you know but like being in front of someone physically 121 is the best way to do which is one of the reasons why I love podcast as well it's cuz you get a chance to put that energy out there the energy of a one-on-one actual conversation with people as opposed to writing an article like it that you know that I'm sure you've had snarky articles written about you it's it's weird so I can say that you know I'm sure you've had snarky articles written about you it's it's weird so I can do that with that's why you saying it that will determine my thoughts and I've almost gotten to the point where I never respond to</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> over the weekend I got in your book yes yes it's great I mean I really appreciate someone like you who's trying to break down quantum mechanics and quantum physics for someone like me it's very hard to follow and there's a lot of backing up and trying it again and backing up and try it again and likes going over paragraphs and try to figure out exactly what it means but it's it's really excellent and really perplex at the same time will thank you and you know if there are different styles when it comes to writing popular books I think there should be different styles and my particular style is look it's not going to be a breezy page-turner but if you read it carefully like is not prerequisites to come into it come into it is someone who's willing to sit and think about every paragraph and then hopefully will be rewarding and you'll truly understand what's going on after doing that well it is rewarding what is fascinating in the history of quantum physics is also pretty fast because I've always wondered like how did anybody even want to come up with this stuff like yes and the fact that it was so long ago was with the beginnings everywhere in the 19 century night will 1900 gold literally that two-year the turn-of-the-century when Lots plug first got the first hint of it and then yeah it took another 27 years to put into final shape now for regular people that do I have a background in physics or that don't this is like the whole idea behind it is so bizarre like why would anybody try to figure out something that one of the things that you said that's really interesting is that you quantum physics is used all the time it's used it with exact calculations but yet we don't really understand it yet main message of the book really because physicist of course do quantum mechanics every day whether it's you know straightforward one mechanics Quantum field Theory Quantum information Quantum Computing clearly were pretty good at it you know like transistors and lasers depend on quantum mechanics the sun shining figure that out depends on quantum mechanics on etcetera so to clean that we don't understand quantum mechanics is a little bit weird but then we have quotes from people that Richard Fineman say nobody understands quantum mechanics party behind it and the reason is what we have is some sort of a black box right eat we say you know what I think what I said in New York Times article I wrote recently is physicist understand quantum mechanics in the same way that someone who owns a smartphone understands the smartphone like they know how to use the apps they can call people they can make phone calls they can take pictures they don't know what's going on inside and that's physicist with quantum mechanics state that use it they can make very very precise protections book them what is really going on like what is actually happening what are all the details of liking you know that's not our job but the stakes predictions the very nature of reality is being examined by people likes if if it is US smartphone it's being examined by people like me who don't really understand the smartphone I have no idea what was going on inside of smartphone I know some words that have you got to describe RAM and processor the electrons moving to their right but yeah and I think it's in some sense that's fine like most of us don't need to know what's going on inside the smartphone to use it but somebody should know and my argument in the book is look the 500 years from now would historians write the history of 21 is creative to invent quantum mechanics and then they were so afraid to really take it seriously and try to understand it like I said like stop asking questions about the meaning of reality and what the world is doing in my mind what physics is all about is understanding reality what the world is doing it's not just about making predictions making predictions is good but we do that mostly because we're curious about what the world is doing well for people outside the world of academe when I read someone like you saying that you were discouraged from pursuing this and you literally told that you should be pursuing you work in cosmology and gravitation is That's Where It's At Sirius work be so crazy so if anybody should be pursuing it should be people like you I want to be fair so of course 20 Century physics there was a part of the attitude was look we have to understand nuclear physics and particle physics and you'll love it was the central physics shifted from Europe to the US and Europe is much more philosophical and and you willing to think about the Deep ideas Americans are pretty pragmatic and want to build things right in particular at the time they wanted to build nuclear weapons and so the idea of just really putting aside deep philosophical issues and putting stuff to work was attractive and it's in the other issue is okay let's say we do demand that we understand quantum mechanics better how do you do it's like what experiment is it there that you can do is as far as we know the cookbook that we have even though we don't understand it works pretty well like what what could you type into your smartphone that would help you understand what's going on inside it's kind of hard to figure out so I think those attitudes were wrong but at least they're not completely crazy it's not afraid of Truth more people are appreciating the understanding quantum mechanics is important what what do you attribute that to a couple of things one is good news and bad news that part of the good news is technology has gotten better so we're trying to build quantum computers for example and guess what do you know some of the ad hoc rules that we had for doing quantum mechanics might not be up to the task we need to understand the details a little bit better the other Saturday thing is that so much of physics is kind of stuck right now right we haven't we literally have not been surprised by a new experimental result in fundamental physics since the 1970s the what is one exception to that which is the universe accelerating in 1998 which was the dark energy we had amazing accomplishments in experimental and observational physics we've found on we found the top Quark we found gravitational waves but they were all predicted decades ago so progress is driven by being surprised and it's been a long time since we've been surprised so some people including myself say well one of the things to do in that situation to take a step back and re-examine the foundation's maybe maybe we can take a broader look and think of you walking down the wrong path now for people that don't have any background in physics there there's a bit of an issue with the public perception and one of the things about our perceptions films like what the bleep sort of throw this sort of cultish monkey wrench into the you know what the quantum physics is weird enough as it is without adding let that movie was literally created by a Channeler right in line David Albers was one of the leading philosophers of physics I should also give credit to philosophers here because people got a PhD in physics and then switch to philosophy because he cared about the foundations of quantum mechanics and no physics department would ever hire him right and through the backdoor yeah I tell the story in the book like he wrote a bunch of influential papers as a graduate student and then he went and said I would like to make these papers my PhD thesis and they said no that's not really serious physics and they punished him by making him write this incredibly technical mathematical paper on Quantum field Theory just to prove he could do it and then he's like I can't take this anymore I'm switching field but anyway he was in that film he was in what the bleep and they lied to him they misrepresented themselves they said we're doing a documentary about quantum mechanics and they sat him down for 3 hours and ask them all these questions you leading questions like doesn't this mean that we're bringing reality into existence by looking at it and he's like no that's not what it means let me explain to you then the final film there's like 30 second clips of him going they completely misrepresenting what he said and so he went public after that and then complained about and about the film and he did in a hilarious story there was a event some sort of convention put on in Santa Monica by supporters of the film that they thought it'd be fun to get all the people who were in the movie it what the bleep do we know and get them at the you know and talk to them and charge people money to listen to them but these people were not affiliate the filmmakers so they didn't know the David Albert had been completely misrepresented in the films they invited him and he goes to this event Santa Monica and he gave it talk you know he decided that he wondered like at all but there's two things you can do when you are faced with fundamental puzzles of reality one is you can face up to what the world is trying to tell you and you can accept it and take it as what it is no matter what you like the other is you can choose to tell a flattering story about yourself and the people who made this movie have decided that the mysteries of quantum mechanics are really stories about how they are powerful and have influence over reality and so forth but it's all nonsense as the punchline is the audience loved it they went nuts because what they wanted was a guru of some sort and leggings just as good a reality-based easily distorted misrepresented in the popular mind</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> done an amazing job in this book of trying to boil it Down For Dummies like me put its hard it is it is a complicated and insanely nuanced subject it's one of those things like this many-worlds theory for one example they just a possibility that there is like explain that explain for four people that don't understand what quantum mechanics even mean give him just like a little bit of that and then explain many worlds Theory good this is what I'm here to do so and electron take an electron quantum mechanics should apply to the entire universe but it becomes unmistakable when you look at little tiny things right so we always were talking about electrons or atoms or so for an electron has a position and wealth sorry maybe not even say that I was wrong it's just so hard to correctly talk about basically quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are the only two big Frameworks that have ever existed in physics you know classical mechanics was so good that everyone thought that was just right in his all that are filling the details until quantum mechanics came along and change things and classical mechanics and electron has a point and has a position a location in space and has a velocity of moving somewhere and from that you can predict what's going to happen OK quantum mechanics says no no no the electron has a wave function so it the wave know sometimes you hear this debate about our bar things like electrons and photons particles or waves the answer is that they are waves and the wave function has this weird property that when you're not looking at it it's a wave it's all spread out or it's localized somewhere but it'll bazan equation the Schrodinger equation so far so good just like regular physics there's nothing the way function database an equation for an equation You can predict was going to happen next but the weird thing about quantum mechanics is that there's a hole set of rules for what happens when you look at the thing when you observe it when you measure it that's where things get squirrely with people describing it right and that's where they want to go woo on it's an opening to be woohoo right when I say like what do you mean observe something like that to be a conscious being to be a video camera in the act of measuring the changes things this is the puzzle okay this is what it's called The Measure problem of quantum mechanics that the rules we teach our students account back or anywhere else we need some quantum mechanics in their sophomore year of college the rules say when a system is observed when it is measured its states wave function changes dramatically suddenly and unpredictably based on if if you're measuring it and it changes how do we know because we didn't measure it more like what What observations are we making that we understand the state of it before it's measure without measuring it good there's a couple of ways so let me make things even simpler forget about where the electron is located and think about the electron is spinning right like on a spinning just like the Earth spins its really exactly like that sick little spinning top except when you measure the spin you can sort of send the electron through magnetic field and we'll get deflect either up or down depending on whether it's bending spin up or spend down only ever get one or two answers it's either going up or going down is nowhere in between this is an empirical measured fact okay so that's a part of quantum mechanics that that's the quantum fact that there's discrete set of possible answers to this question is it spinning clockwise or counterclockwise yes or no it's just those two possibilities nowhere in between so if you're if you have a magnetic field that is oriented vertically send your electron through it it gets deflected up you say oh it's been up so now I measured it's been now I know what it state is if I send it through another magnetic field or oriented vertically it will always be deflected up every single time we know what it is we're going to measure it measuring it in this case doesn't change it gets in exactly that state we know it okay now let's send it through a magnetic field that is oriented horizontally so it's going to be deflected either right or left we know exactly what state it's in it's been this way but when you send it through that magnetic field it's oriented horizontally it gets affected left or right 50/50 unpredictably there's no way we can predict it and then once it is so they now it's been spending up you measured it spins left let's say send it to another magnet that is going vertically and now it's 50/50 again to spend down so somehow even though we knew exactly what state it was in we couldn't predict what would happen next that is part of quantum mechanics so the act of sending it through these things where it makes it Kohler horizontal what is what's happening to it when it's going through these things so in quantum mechanics what we say is that it's not that we don't know whether the electron is bending clockwise or counterclockwise it can be in a superposition above that's just the spin version of the position of the electron can be spread out you know in a way right it's it's truly not just that we are lacking some knowledge that the knowledge really isn't there we teach quantum mechanics and textbooks and then I'm going to correct it cuz many world is much better but this is the standard textbook version there's a wave function the wave function for a spin as it's either up or down or some combination and then there's a rule that says when you measure the spin you only get up or down you don't see the way function just like the cloud that you have for the electron's position when you look at it you see it at a location so another way to get to make the same argument is take a little piece of I haven't satellite image of this when I get talks little piece of uranium so it's the radioactive little chunk of metal and you put it in a bubble chamber so it is emitting radioactive particles and you detect the particles you can see little streak of emotion when the particle leaves the uranium okay well like I said when you're not looking at it this electron is supposed to obey an equation to Schrodinger equation and you can ask what the prediction is when when a radioactive nucleus Hayes and gives off an electron what is its wavefunction going to do what is the wavefunction electronic going to be in the answer is it goes off in a spherical wave if it goes off in all directions at once evenly all directions evenly but you never see that is that Railway that you want to shape of the piece of uranium does it vary know because of the electron from one individual nucleus of an atom right so that matters and the easiest thing for the electron to do is have to go out in this year doesn't have to Inglot in higher energy states but the point is it's not going out in a straight line but when you look at it you see a straight line right that's the fundamental mystery of quantum mechanics that how we describe the thing when we're not looking at it is different than what we see when we look at it so when you're in pursuit of an understanding a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics you when you you're thinking about people from the 19 just sort of basically getting the first steps going to understand the stuff when when you're talkin about this lack of funding and the lack of encouragement for people to pursue quantum mechanics you strongly feel like there are answers to these questions we just need better tools and a better understanding bitter equation more time yet me and Einstein thinks it's one of the secret Heroes of the book because he someone who just couldn't quite accept quantum mechanics the title something deeply hidden is a quote from Einstein when he was talking about when he was a kid and he had a compass right and he was giving his first magnetic compass and he could rotate it this way and that way and always pointed north than you will ever go how that's cool but he was Einstein and he's like this is amazing set of rules Orchard called The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics one set of rules for when you're looking at it one set of rules for when you're not and Einstein was like oh come on clearly this is not the final answer to the nature of reality right he wanted to know God's thoughts he's like I want to know everything we're not done yet there must be more going on and so many worlds is one of the proposed answers to what could be going on it's not the only one there's Alternatives but it's definitely my favorite is the easiest one right down let's put it that way okay so hit us with this many worlds Theory okay so think about this electron you're going to do you say that could be either spin up or spend down it's a combination of both that's its wavefunction you measure it you only ever sees the numbers been down so Copenhagen says that's because the wavefunction suddenly changed snapped into place when you observed it don't ask me what it means to observe something that's not what Copenhagen left you ask many world says what you're missing is to number one you are a Quantum system you are obeying the rules of quantum mechanics you're made of atoms and electrons and so forth you have a wave function to okay so you're secretly treating yourself as a classical thing when you make that measurement but you really should be treating yourself Quantum mechanically right that's one thing and the other thing is something that Einstein invented namely called entanglement when quantum mechanics says there's a wave function for a system it doesn't say there's a sep wave function for every particle right it says that there's only one way function for the whole universe so the way I like to say it is Imagine two particles come in and bounce off of each other either one as a wave function and unpredictable exactly what angle is going to go off at so both of those both of the particles to go off you don't know where they're going but because momentum is conserved if they came in at equal velocities for go out at equal velocities and knob set directions measure one but you know where the other one is going right that's entanglement The observed state of one system to be related to the observe state of another system so those are the two ingredients you are quantum system and Quantum systems can be entangled with each other so whoever it was a graduate student when he invented this idea in the 1950s that look when you measure that electron what happens physically like forget about your person your conscious all that BS like you're a physical system you will be the starting New York 1 mechanical system you obey the laws of physics so you look at the electron your wave function changes it used to be you're just the person doing whatever you do but then after you look at the electron you become entangled with it and it splits so there is one part of the wave function that says the electron was spinning clockwise and you measured it spinning clockwise and there's another part of the wave function that says the electron was spinning counter-clockwise and you saw it spinning counter-clockwise everybody knows that's like that that far it's not controversial at all that's clearly the prediction of the equations of quantum mechanics but everyone else said well that means that I'm some weird combination of I saw it spending one way and I told spending the other way but never felt that way when I look at you electrons I see them one way or the other was that can't be right that can't be the final answer the wave function must somehow collapse and Everett said know what you're missing is there's now two separate worlds both of those part of the wave function real but they're different world they will never interact with each other again what happens in one part of the wave function will not affect what happens in the other part so now there's a version of you that's all the electrons spinning clockwise and there's another version of you that's all it spinning counter-clockwise and that's just taking seriously the prediction of quantum mechanics it's not adding any extra stuff any extra World anything like that Jersey going in a different direction the exact is so hard to understand feet would you apply this in your regular life like do you think like when you go home and you say hi to your wife knew about the fridgerator think of yourself as this Quantum being that's existing in the super-state so that means a couple dances to that what is you know sure if I think about it like I really do believe in you I have a chapter in the book which my editor resisted at first but then how to get away with it which is a dialogue between a young philosopher and her father who is the physicist and the father is skeptical about all this those awful nonsense and he tries to explain how many worlds Works to him and at the end of the last question is far away from your everyday experience right so what is asking you to do is to say I have these equations they are really really good at finding what I do observe in the world and making predictions you know I can build the Large Hadron Collider Etc I will take them seriously even for things that I can't directly observe the best equations I have until a better set of equations location of that is yeah there's a whole bunch of world like a huge number like a real you know Johnny humongously unimaginably big number maybe an infinite number maybe finite we don't know how different copies of you and they're being created all the time the good news is that it doesn't really affect how you go through life it doesn't really imply that you can behave any differently than you would if you just lived in one world but do you think of each choice that you make possibly changing everything about the world that you exist in how are you looking at it if you don't you are a guy who will probably understand it as good as anybody that's alive so was weird as this stuff sounds to to me it sounds like it's almost impossible for me to comprehend so I'm trying to filter it through your understanding of it but I think that he's jacked yeah I'm not exactly sure how to play the best you know it it doesn't it doesn't change who you are it's certainly not true that you making a decision is what branch is the wavefunction the Universe I guess that's the right thing to say because I want to stop all woo yet everyone you know believe me a joke about how certain political choices imply that we're living in the wrong branch of the wave function has been made many many times not that your choices create different universes different universes get created and maybe you're different in them by a little bit in fact I thought you might like to point out there is an app you can download if you have an iPhone called Universe splitter which will Branch the wavefunction the universe for you and then if you agree ahead of time to do one thing and one branch another thing in another Branch then there will be multiple copies of you or living different lives and then you can deal with that in your therapist however you like basically version of measuring the spin of universe Splitters only for iPhones 50 Cent left it gets sent right and if you agree incident that sends back whether you ended up in the branch of the wave function where it went left or where it went there ua199 come on you can if you can correct those you can fill in whatever you want to marry me I will not ask her to marry me but I will accept this job I will go somewhere else equivalent of a Quantum fortune cookie accepted all possible Fortune it's you should act the same as if you just live in one Universe cuz you can never talk to that people in the other ones so but now let's hit hit the brakes on the woo again yeah cuz people would like to believe that there are I mean are there an infinite number of use existing it go with it at the exact same time making the various choices would send you off in a different directions so number one we don't know if it's infinite number or just really big it's really really really big number is it's big enough to be you know big enough for whatever you want but it's not everything it's not the theory does not say everything happens somewhere right the theory says they're threatening or equation is obeyed there's an equation that is obeyed so electrons will never convert into protons because electrons are negatively charged protons are positively charged and nowhere in the Schrodinger equation can you violate conservation of charge right so it's plenty of things that don't happen then there are plenty of things that do happen and some things are more likely than others you experience so yeah it's it's sort of a thing but the straightforward prediction of the equations and it doesn't affect our lives it there's no rule that says you know to be a moral person to be a good utilitarian and make the world happy knowing that the world the way function is branching into multiple copies I should act differently somehow it's it's exactly the same as it would be in the Ordinary World and you are the Ordinary World no matter how copies how many copies of you there are how many versions of you there so with all these copies are being made there's no essence of you that is traveling through one of the copies right like all these people are separate people so if I use the analogy it's like identical twins they were the same zygote or whatever and now they're different people okay so that's the same thing like you are you now and if you hit the button the branch the wavefunction will be two different people both of them used to be you but not the same person anymore cuz different things happen to them now when people about the concept of quantum mechanics and with the way you're talking about describing things in the micro and the macro you think of your existence itself very similar in a very similar manner that the way you think of electrons the way you think of things being Quantum is that you are a combination of all these Quantum things so you don't operate in some sort of static State that's very like Here and Now and in carbon need to put it on a scale and it will never change there's constant versions of you yeah it's kind of like a wishing where you're more and more versions of you were being created all the time and it's interesting thing because even the best-trained physicists sort of think intuitively classically like look here's a table old is one respectable version of quantum mechanics there are other respectable versions more respectable than the textbook presentation but they all all the other ones somehow lean on our classical experience and the textbook version certainly does it says like you're classical person observing a quantum mechanical system and so forth and Everett when he was a graduate student you know he was he had arguments across the ocean with people in Copenhagen you know who tried to push their way forward and he's like I have to be plugged in like why aren't you going to like why is everything so special. You really and he was trying to think of the quantum mechanics of the whole universe right where you is not a separate Observer outside because he's doing the whole universe all at once and so everything had to be Quantum and I think that that's another thing that is pushing us to appreciate the foundations of quantum mechanics little bit more is that we're trying to understand quantum gravity and Quantum cosmology the universe all at once obeying the rules of quantum mechanics and the conventional Copenhagen Theory and I think that that's another thing that is pushing us to appreciate the foundations of quantum mechanics a little bit more as they were trying to understand quantum gravity friend insane Quantum cosmology the universe all at once obeying the rules of quantum mechanics and the conventional Copenhagen theory is if not up to it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> this is as good a spot as any to talk about this week I want to make sure I clarify something because there is some there was an operation this a guy who was the billionaire Diamond guy who won of getting a dick enlargement operation and he died because of the anesthesia and was in another country and we pulled out we were saying somehow or another it got connected to this company that does that mean I'd States it had nothing Phenom Puma like he was getting a similar surgery and that this one the one only the penuma only happens in the US but he was getting something done in Europe so I was like different will they reached out to me to explain first of all the guy died from anesthesia you can get in and you could die from a seizure from any operation at nothing to do with the penis enlargement operation to use the more correct term dick enlargement but he didn't die from that and that's just as safe as getting your nose fish getting your knee meniscus operator on or is it just the any surgery where you have anesthesia carries a certain amount of rest but apparently this dick thing works they actually can grow your dick bigger now that you're risking your life to work go to the dentist right if you if you if you anything you doing with anesthesia there's a very small chance that something could go wrong but had nothing to do with this dick operation wanted to make sure that people know that if you look this up I don't want anything any incorrect assumptions to be out there and I carry no ill-will towards this these people that make this and apparently works I just want everybody to know that this company that makes dick's bigger that are involved in even admitting that you I finished like a little dick is a weird thing right because it's one of the rare things that's unfortunate that you can make fun of but you can't make fun of a little person if you make fun of a person whose ass you know you're not supposed to call the midgets on little people who make fun of a person is a dwarf or a little person you're cruel person are you allowed to make fun of dudes having little Dex we should there should be something in the same vein yes to protect Little Big World world from cruelty because if you have a little p**** that's fantastic but because if you have a little p**** that's fantastic weird situation but a big dick is a sign of virility so we We Salute You penuma we salute you for helping men</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> like the only thing they could top this for those who didn't see it it's such a brilliant idea it was the eggnog drinking contest and you had to do a double shot like it was bourbon but it was eggnog like every 30 seconds will Panda returning Champion was Pat from Moonachie who had diabetes and lost a total it already it was just sitting there and then he continued drink it there has to be like a you know when like a broadcaster can get into the Sports Hall of Fame just because he never played the game but he he like you know because of what he added to it I always thought that Pat Moonachie should have been like they should have been like like like a chick Hearn Johnny most sort of award that he f****** continue with his his health continues to drink I remember when when people posted that V everyone was saying fake this isn't real. Maybe enjoy Trails like no that was real and I was there it was plastic bags all over the ground remember they they they put plastic everywhere all over the ground cuz they knew the people going to throw out they had the garbage can ready and then Pat Duffy leaned his head over the edge of the garbage can and then Pat from Moonachie just here, you see him and then it keep coming it keeps coming is like way crazier and came out make somebody kept shutting it off and every time I start gagging me there was a dude who got knocked out so then what he did was he started he puked into a picture he took into a picture and then he was drinking his own puke trying to make the other people puke so then somebody dared this guy who had to take a swig from it and he had like this hipster Viking level beard and 10 years later he took this Viking level Swig he just gave himself and then he puked into the picture I think and remember it was in his beard disappointing that podcast and in that pocket in that shower I almost puke yeah doesn't crazy thing about seeing everyone people shoot some of the greatest moments are alive in my family we've got some Eskenazi bad Jane's we tend to Die Young and my grandmother died my grandmother's actually only 15 years older than my dad and she died two years ago last 10 years of a life horrible so we know what's going to happen to my family probably to all of us we don't tell your mother your grandmother had your father when she was 15 years old right whoa yeah back in the early days of World War II playing around with her boyfriend she claims to be a virgin but something got somewhere they shouldn't have and she's wearing high school that's probably why I work on Aging doing wrong growing up during the Depression and then World War II and then the Communists came into Hungary and right there a lot of people she had no she had no respect for Humanity so by the time I came along first of all she put all of her energy into to me and I was a spoiled brat as a kid so that that was one helpful to me I think now isn't at all but more importantly she wanted me to do the best I could with my life she said David do what you can to make this world a better place make sure that you leave this place better than you found it and that's what I'm trying to do wow what a profound piece of advice for a grandchild. She was a rebel she told me to get the rules when I kind of like you do if I'm going my own way and we'll see how this goes she from she went on Bondi Beach in Sydney in a bikini which was rebellious and she got taken off the page but by the police with a British thing wow okay like those pin-up girls right when you see them they always had one piece suits on like yeah so making you Guinea in the sixties as a woman on a run Islands she claims to have eaten human flesh and looking on but I think I'll robots that are you know anything that looks autonomous is kind of sinister-looking if we do eventually come to a where those things are going to war for us instead of us like if we get involved in robot wars are robots versus their robots and this becomes the next motivation for increased technological innovation to try to deal with Superior robots by the Soviet Union or by China like these these are more things that could be threats that could push people to some crazy level of technological innovation other drivers for technological innovation as well. That seems plenty strong commercial drivers let us say that we wouldn't have to rely on on World at that front of War kind of stay in about 10 and to try to see if it would be possible to just us being honored and upheld kind of predation on nuclear weapons which has limited I don't know I don't know exact number but it is a lot better than 50 or a hundred country yes and some other weapon says while blinding lasers landmines are supported avocado stay on the sidelines on that particular campaign being a launcher exactly what it is that what I mean certainly I'd be better if we refrain from having some arms race to develop these they're not and I've had for so I think myself quite Vivid the first one was in Martha's Vineyard it was 4 in the morning I got up to take a leak on the balcony there and I looked up in the sky in about a hundred thousand feet up I saw two glowing discs lying and Ashley animation you saw this I saw this how old are you I was and so I look up and I see these things and they're moving man they're going from Horizon to Horizon 20,000 miles an hour and I've been in an F5 I had it in my hands I've been in a B-25 I know helicopters I know Aviation a meteoric bull rides I know what's not a meteor and what is I know what's a helicopter in what is I know what's the moon and Venus to glowing glowing round objects a hundred thousand feet maybe 20,000 miles an hour if you win because they went across the sky like just in a zigzag formation so if I could scream to my wife my friends that got up at three of us saw it and I said you know and they all knew it was something unusual that was my first signing okay now who knows that that wasn't real but I I know what I saw I know what my friend so I know my wife's off those things were moving they were glowing fast they were flying information and they were doing enough speed to get from basically the right side of my why's the left side of my eyes really fast the second one was I was I was in so that's so that's four I can't those two is two and then the second one that I saw saw the one who the third one I saw I was up I was in Montreal Canada and I was on the 23rd floor of the Queen Elizabeth hotel and this would have been doing Patron in Canada the Patron tequila promotion and that was it would have been in the early 2008 I looked up and I'll be on the window there and I saw this on air mattress turned over on its you know what the with it with the bubbles on the bottom it was a hundred 50 ft long 50 ft wide gray it was a gray rainy day in Montreal broad daylight and he story of the hotel are the wires when it's got to be a balloon it's going to be there's no Thanksgiving Day Parade here what what is that and my friends were with me what is that in a come along and just parked outside the window we looked at it big gray thing with these balls underneath and then it slowly turned and we saw the full length of it and then it went around the corner and disappear come along and just parked outside the window we looked at it big gray thing with these balls underneath and then it slowly turned and we saw the full length of it and then it went around the corner we ran out in the hall and we just watched a drift kind of sideways off over the st.

		<div class="paragraph"> no no no love them but absolutely about motorcycles I don't fuk with them I was about to get one I had a bunch of took a bunch of lessons and I was going for my license and then two friends wiped out and get pretty significant accidents in one got it I know got hit by a car by an old man who ran a red light and T-boned the Aaron snapped his femur I can ride anywhere but I prefer to ride in the in the country up north in Canada do you know where I'm living today's half-and-half out there with my dad and Canada lot in the way of the old family farm with the cottage Farmhouse and people that experience isn't it so there's a reason why people don't want to live in a house where people were murdered no one was killed in that Farmhouse but I had many people passed there but even that weird that weird people out but absolutely if you have a house where people were murdered in this is why there's laws you have to divulge it wasn't because when I sold our house in Los Angeles we lived in this state and Woodrow Wilson turn on the celebrity ghost show talking about the spirits that were in that house what happens around the table shapes will be seeing you feel like touching the shoulder that kind of thing least a felt it and I had an experience one night where something got into bed with me and I was alone and went on there but I guess I just figured out locked out of the house right house goes to well or did try to come on to me and I didn't refuse it and went to sleep and I felt something next to me like felt that form next to me and I didn't know I was working on the picture and you're working on a film with almost with something that I've been working down at Universal I do maybe Dragnet or something like that OK Google when in bed and then there's like a weight next I feel awake next to me I turn my light. The person is lying I saw the depression there were two DS and I and I there were two Spirits it might have been there maybe Mama Cass herself while she died in London and there was another guy that apparently a rumor was he died of a drug overdose at a party and they buried him in the Hills oh and my daughter saw him walking with a little red-haired girl down the hall once and and and you know we think that that that he might have been there but anyway when we sold the house to Beverly that was right in that California real estate document that we have to sign by law do you have to divulge any unusual activity in the house so I had to sign up in there that said yes at the beginning of our 10-year in the house we do have experience happy you had to sign papers that said you had unusual activity you sell a house in California you will look in every real estate contract it will be a clause that you must report unusual unusual activity recognized State of California requires that in there real estate documents it's compelling evidence of people are paranoid they want people to see spirits also have that have reality I think you're laying down in bed so you're about to go to sleep and I look and I see this depression and then I go well what am I going to do about this belief up screaming no I rolled over and I just got another up against it and went to sleep and I slept like a baby step that the baby so I'm lying down and it in Old Fort and then this ghost hovers over me and in the director's cut I think the belt comes off in the past come down sex with ghosts didn't get nervous you know I'm a been so tired I may have been so resolved and resigned I thought you know what there's no point in panicking there it is I love you just accept it yes that's right I just accepted at 7 to go man why fight it spiritual it's true it's true so did you smell it no no smell just get sent out the weight felt the weight and saw the depression and then when I feel anything on your body form can you push against I actually kind of wanted to see what it felt like if there was something there and I did feel something there I was just another feminine or masculine I felt masculine party food like a dead biker maybe I don't like was the guy Gaiden the hillside I don't know could be a friendship you know Abraham Lincoln with partners and they were locked partners and they slept in the same bed many times when they were on the road yet knew there was something going on but they knew you liked her that you and the ghost had something happening after I told him yeah so they knew something was going on because they had been laid here the StairMaster going by itself that he my daughter had then you know other little things like jewelry dancing on the table to do something was going on in that house again I'm going on but they knew you were going to ghost had something happening after I told him yeah so they knew something was going on because they had been there to hear the StairMaster going by itself that my daughter had then you know other little things like jewelry dancing the table to do something was going on in that house again</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> ghosts are in the Bigfoot you're in the aliens UFO abductions everything tripping GIF what you what if you have good pot and you're smoking about what you're smoking the turkey that's what makes it that's what gives it its power terpenes give pot at the powerball's part of the elements are all in in all all marijuana you have to go to sleep your dad but yeah everybody has can cannabis cannabinoid receptors in them it is a tremendously healing a thing there's the terpene there's a chart Yahoo chart yeah they're doing benefits Russian trucks while it's legal now in Oregon well the point is that if John had been a pothead he'd be alive today because he died of a cocaine and heroin speedball injection defog when you gave him still under the Year award one day yeah it was one of the High Times awards are presented them what can having a cannabis is tremendously valuable money on the beverage it makes me more more open to the idea of extraterrestrials is some of the experiences that I've had on tryptamines you know particularly dimethyltryptamine but also psilocybin is back for me by gospel help how long back is that control situation transforms your perception of where you stand in the in the world and it's absolute Eagle dissolver you're you are confronted with experiences that defied logic and this is interesting one of things that showed me away from UFOs was DMT because cuz it was so profound it was so crazy that if a UFO landed right in front of my house and be like yeah it's not DMT though cuz DMT was completely different dimension and there were things there the more things that's what you were with a controlled environment as friends thousands of plants it's literally almost every plant nature in fact the one of the universities and Israel believes that it was responsible for the burning bush that Moses Gunn Ten Commandments from the outfit I think that burning bushes actually acacia tree and the acacia tree is Rich and DMT benefit it burst into flame in the NL de Vapor exactly or maybe they figured out a way to extract the dimethyltryptamine from the acacia tree or a bush Acacia bushes well and that they took this small amount of dimethyltryptamine from this fire and inhaled it and had this profound religious experience like I've experienced like many people experience that have taken it and I think that one thing that happens when you do this as you're confronted with entities now I don't know what these things are but they seem be communicating with you and they seem to be talking to you and they seem to know everything about you so the question is like is that really your subconscious is it this is is this you know what you know about yourself strip down to some very bear raw form and then confronted with the psychedelics that perturb your your visual cortex so they provide you with all these intense visualization or is it a chemical portal to another dimension where they effulgent beings like the word describes their complex geometric patterns made out of love and understanding and if they're communicating with you sounds like a nice B Lovecraft was a wonderful writer and and he describes in Ni maschine know that was HG Wells the books about back but no one ever found in the world now I think they found him but he had finished for a while HP Lovecraft maybe look up Graver the device but but you know he he wrote about geometric shapes he wrote about interdimensional geometric shapes and I'm getting up space where you saw the universe in terms of geometry and diamond shaped things in melted we do multi patterns and colors and female artist Alex Grey ass Crazy Beautiful amazing guy and he all of his stuff is tryptamine base artwork pull up some Alex Grey stuff so we can see it it literally when you see it you go on that I recognize that I recognized how long was your Voyage all of them are about 15 minutes to 20 minutes long depending upon this is all Alex Grey similar to what it feels like when you do dimethyltryptamine and Alex's had encountered a little purple Barrel right now just look like that I'd have a nice afternoon are the compounds they mimic normal human neurochemistry occurring compound in the human brain your liver your lungs and there's a lot of evidence at least in mammals it's produced by your pineal gland which is literally your third eye back I think I was in high school or something I never did it but I saw it and I think I was that's what I want to do my time I might mind my friend that they take one of these will have a better time so I didn't see any beings but the race was fun take one out for Ali how did you take it with a cap that doesn't work it was more strength and I never know it's not it will if it was it doesn't work because body produces monoamine oxidase and the only way that DMT Works orally is if you take an MAO inhibitor this is what Ayahuasca is by didn't have that is what the the indigenous people to Amazon a figured out it's how to take DMT with Harmony in the plants right in harming is a naturally occurring MAO inhibitor so that that you can take it orally it's also why the experience is not as intense but it's a long girl and many people find it more spiritual because you can relax Jimmy's coming to the experience but something happens in the body's production of DMT or the bodies breaking down of T&amp;T we're producing something called for 4:00 C&amp;M dimethyltryptamine this is out of psilocybin so maybe he gave you psilocybin pills real, that's real going to take psilocybin idd, I just eat the mushroom so they can get exact numbers Franklin on my cereal once and wise yeah and then going to deliver the mail</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> 2 day do you spend thinking about this well I am an eternal researcher and I'm always looking for stories I love the new fun stuff that's coming out you know my family was into paranormal research that's why I wrote The Ghostbusters my dad was a researcher and like his father because because we have an Old Farm in Canada and my grandfather was a dentist in Kingston Ontario on the in the twenties and a man walked up to him he had been researching psychic research on the Otherworld and mediumship for many years in a guy walked up to him and said mr. eye dr. Akright I believe that I have a gift and its name was Walter Asher's he was a locomotive mechanic at the local engine works and he was our family medium for for at least 10 or 15 years and we would have they would have seances and then 20s and 30s Sunday afternoon the big Dodgers and Cadillacs with pull up in the women the matrons would get out in my great-grandfather would have a 90-minute session with the medium and they would Channel entities from the other side have you heard of the fox sisters in the whole Lilydale thing the whole mediumship of the concept that you know we are life lives beyond what we have here you know who John Edwards the psychic on television yeah bulshit the entire time to just get Slimmer John at work so I watch the show I kind of a kind of believed him but maybe sure if he was the one that got busted in those one of those psychics got busted wrapped Spirit wrap jacket go there and trained to be a medium why you'd want to I don't know I don't know it's a very exhausting imagine shutting down your whole system going with a entrace reaching the other side having that entity come through the other side use your body use your fluids use everything and then abandon you after and then just go if it's exhausting exhausting but my family research mediumship and I wrote Ghostbusters based upon a star family just making 48 they were lying in bed and their new house near Hartsville New York and all of a sudden this kind of wrapping started verifying them they thought it was confined just to that house in Hartsville but they managed to take it around 8 when we went to Rochester and happened in houses when they went to a theater and happened in front of three four hundred people naturally they tore the world with this they called it The Peddler and he was someone who was killed and murdered and buried in the house and the basement Peter Popoff they were all they were all around the world shipping tables and and and text out of my round this something about mean face ladies for my 218 writing a rap space reverberated in concert halls with my knees and my Knuckles crack my Knuckles maybe in my niece made me do it I was talked into it there was so much pressure on me and in the end of her life she then recanted her retention attraction of it but very convincing that was the origin of spirituality people were looking for a new religion in the twenties you had all kinds of protestantism that area of New York was called the burned-over District he's the preacher that all been through their people rebuilding in all kinds of different religion they were looking for something new and spiritual spirituality and spiritualism gave them that brought them I've had people contact me at half past and dreams I've never seen a ghost. Never you no experience. But I I do believe that Consciousness survives after death it's an interesting idea there's no evidence that it doesn't you know I'd I think that reincarnation is also a fascinating concept that's repeated in many different cultures and I wonder why you know there's a great Tyler Childers song called born again and it's it's about things living and dying and being reincarnated in in different times I N I think that's very attractive to people the idea that our physical bodies one but the spiritual body is something entirely different while I think that you know a fiesta Tractive it is a truck of atheist or never going to believe that they're not going to accept that it's hopefully a little help and Aliens they Boos that they were Russian research group photography kirlian she sat there and she was able to blow smoke into a fishbowl and shape the smoke in the Fishbowl so here's some kirlian images they have put a photograph auras and they did photograph they did Dino 21 grams is supposed to be the rate of the weight of the soul and they they photographed the guy dying and they claims were photographed his Aura leaving his body 1 grams and Killian photo of dying man I don't know but they're you saw the auras the photographs their physical embodiment well I don't know I said that it acts as a certain Force there's reacts to scales gravity right I mean</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you're you're a hundred percent in on ghosts I am. Tell me about why you're a hundred percent in on Sasquatch cuz that that one is a that's more puzzling you do it you lose which finger I'm like you thinking while he's got cast he's got hair m e l d r u m I'm not giving them a finger to find out Sasquatches real that's crazy you know yeah he's pretty devoted to us it's been around the world and her husband work on the pipeline and she tells a story one afternoon when she was at her you know her window on the kitchen and she went outside in the garden so she felt saw something went outside and she smelled this really strong strong musky musky odor and she saw this big huge shape at the corner of her garden going to disappear into the woods and bear grizzly Cobra not at all I think it's nonsense I think it's coyotes with mange this is like we'll go back to the goodfoot put the Ariel encounter be the school children at the Ariel School in in Zimbabwe in the in the 90s you were the other storage on and I was working on it two beings landed in two different crafts and they encounter encounter the schoolchildren all in elementary school and now they come back and they're interviewing them now and their adult time it's amazing how their story synchronize why would all of them conspire to make something up fourth really credible kids there that the UFO thing is less Preposterous than anything because we are currently sending spaceships into orbit we are currently sending probes to Mars we we were involved deeply involved in exploration of our solar system at least with these robots and drones and things that we can control that makes 100% Bigfoot is interesting to me because there was a creature called gigantopithecus it was an enormous primate that was a without a doubt lived it's a real thing it was a bipedal hominid they think was between eight and perhaps even 10 ft tall was a huge ape like creature and it went extinct in the reason why they found it is because there was an apothecary shop I believe it was in the 1920s and Anthropologist found a tooth and it's a popped shopping China you talk to the people where'd you find this he recognized as a primate to they brought him to the site where they found it and then they started finding other pieces they found bones that that seem to indicate that this thing was bipedal and this is something that's accepted in the paleontologist paleontological record this is like when an anthropologist look into history of primates when they look at the did they think this is a widely accepted real animal so why why why was real white whistle why did why do you say that it couldn't have survived and Beyond it Extinction in and then existed and some form there's no evidence is compelling just as fake they think they send in a kangaroo suit I just I just think Gabriel story meldrum's research the book that I read if the woman is one of those and I believe she has video footage was a small popular try finding a wolverine or a torosaurus Uber's won the super slots in the unit he decided that he was going to spend his life looking for the Giants long and these indigenous people appointed them in the right direction signs that there's you know there's dung seems to be sloth done they found they trying to point him towards where these things are and of the giant sloth was a real creature but there's no real evidence of the giant sloth is currently alive but the thing is the vast Wilderness of the Amazon rainforest is so impenetrable it'll be like trying to walk across the Earth and make a good audit of all the creatures that are on it you're going to run into them at you Noah many species are dying on this planet right now for dinner because we suspect there are many there to being discovered we never even knew about before and you know the Northwestern for us you're pretty impenetrable to the Yas Washington for us and it came into the United States and that's exactly where it would be it would be in a Pacific Northwest because as you walk down from Alaska vloggers going in there and seeing them or sensing the you know because they're being driven out of their environment so hostile accident logging companies that they think they have been perpetrated by by you know those are the Sasquatch got nobody wants to believe in Bigfoot more than me and I worked up in in the Northwest Territories I was a Flex track system mechanic on Tundra crawlers know the roads are there when I was a kid and I work for Department of Public Works and we were up there and long the hiney River lie have less River we're explorers were going and if they find their heads in the never come back walking up there and was with the survey people they've been coming up there if you know you know years before me and they and they said that does Sasquatch was a common thing that was spoken about among the natives and among the survey Crews up there excellent horror movies. It's really good you would love it love it it's about a bunch of people up there to try to replicate the Patterson Bigfoot Film sort of as a lark up there for fun and they encounter a real sasquatch so Willow Creek it's really good Pennswoods up there and maybe camp for a week and let man do to see something like that a bipedal hominid that is avoided detection hundreds if not thousands of years to be amazing yeah but there's a baseball made of Americans is Native Americans had more than a hundred different names between all the various tribes a hundred different names for Sasquatch Rob Baker no no that's Rick Baker background story. McGee who's the special effects Guy created the one for me but Rick Baker designed it originally but he made a Pat McGee Man the movie called o mop was it call Oma Primal scream see if we can but it's basically are moving about Sasquatch and you know it's it's incredibly compelling to people has been avoiding detection living in the Legends sometimes grandchildren and take them I think that's because it used to be a real thing and that's what I think I think that's because if he if we all agree and scientists agree that this gigantopithecus was a real thing if that is the case then it's entirely possible that one point at one point time human beings were in direct contact with him on the regular basis and no story has been passed down to generation after generation who the real question is are they still here because the people are telling you these stories like when we talked about people in North America it's widely accepted that most Native Americans they share a lot of genetics of people from Siberia to Siberia is was close to the Bering land bridge and come down these people eventually many many many many many thousands of years migrated into America so those are people that would have been in contact a hundred thousand whatever years ago it would they don't know if they know that these tea that they found from gigantopithecus indicate that at least a hundred thousand years ago they were alive does that mean they were alive 50,000 years ago very possibly homofloriensis you know that the Hobbit person that you found this tiny little thing in the right right on the floor as Island that thing didn't even know that was real until the two thousands and that thing existed as recently as I think it was thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago which is incredibly recent this is a completely new discovery that people found that there was a totally different species of human being that was very small over the chimp size brain but it was human that used tools and it lived amongst humans so this thing if they know it lived a hundred thousand years ago could have easily live 50 Mi to live 20 so it live 20,000 years ago we know they were real but there's no like I'm some until I saw a man I feel like we're the other picture don't know but I sensed it I think if you did if you put on Mount mounted a horrible Avatar Style military incursion into some of the Deep Woods of Northwest America you might you might get traces but coming on what a horrible thing that would be today I know but then you're destroying is all mine that's a pat Magee's version of a scrape yeah yeah tile saw like found-footage I got whole thing with you okay here we are in the woods and even if I don't believe in Bigfoot or don't believe it's currently alive cuz I know too many people that are in the woods all the time I know too many people that are Hunters that are in the woods that have a spend weeks and weeks in the woods and none of them since shaft Bears walk on two feet though that's really normal yeah and when you're in thick dense forest bears walking on two feet you see him in the dusk, but I'm convinced and then you really are convinced so then you go back and tell everybody yeah I think you know basically just each individual has to make their own minds up about all of this stuff and if you want to believe it's just like your religion you know I I believe in mediumship I believe in the afterlife five of our consciousness Play My Religion and who's to say why should I be disputed on that you know I'm glad you know how many people live in the Virgin Mary Caplan's and beliefs another was Noah's a new know there was no Virgin Mary know I respect people's belief and they will decide what you believe and that's what helps you you know and I I would never dispute that and likewise I want to be respected for my belief and spiritualism and mediumship and I do the official story of every single thing you know why that's good because that empirical view will be able to sort out the fake stuff to hold stuff from the real stuff if people of real scientific minds and unreal you know and course they're going to it that's what's going to that's what's going to sort out what's real and what isn't story of every single you know why that's good because that empirical view will be able to sort of the fake stuff the whole stuff from a real stuff if people of real scientific minds and unreal you know and course they're going to it that's what's going to that's what's going to sort out at what's real and what isn't</div>

If you have nothing that you ain't build it anyhow motherfuker equip and unfortunately there's so much lack of love in the world for other people you know instead of propagate loved and want to propagate anger and they want to propagate hate and it's so you do and so many people are dissatisfied by their own existence that they want to do that but they don't understand but that by doing that you are perpetuating this whole terrible cycle that you've been caught up in yourself if you go out there hating on everybody and being shity to everybody and throwing all this anger out there in the world that you are literally poisoning yourself there's a there's a wonderful quote about jealousy that I think also applies to hate is that it's one of the the rare things that is ineffective the person who's your target but works on you instead they can get jealous if there's a person out there like oh I I wish I was living her life and you're angry at her like you is that hurting her call with a happier life and that down. That is a big part of it a big part of his embracing love and friendship and camaraderie and be nice to people and I liked it so much easier to be nice and to be mean yeah it's hard for some people because they're not even nicer themselves while self-love is where it all starts you don't like yourself watch yourself you ain't going to do it to anybody else sometimes I wake up in the morning I don't really like myself for what I've done the next day or the day before in the past but you know me and I I got a lot myself enough to get up and get going and yeah just keep going it too much this wild Crystal vodka no no everything in moderation</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> give me a second to make phone calls are going to let you know take out Don Lemon or something cuz he talks s*** about Trump. Maybe she just normal people people deserve it all their experience with a plaque you can go to the place where they were allegedly abducted in the state of New Hampshire has you ain't already happened a state-certified or state recognized paranormal experience and also another states are 61 out right around the time that was a couple months before Kennedy was shot right wasn't shot November 63 for him right now mysterious Marfa lights they have all kind of a picnic area we can watch them at night no one knows what they are the up here every night and they bounced around in Horizon the go up and down and back and forth people sell their headlights from different cars in the highway but the Airforce the state police they're all trying to figure out what they they aren't we just don't know what the Marfa lights are in their right you're nice by the state of Texas as a paranormal event but every night consistently going back and forth and symmetrical patterns what is with the opinions Nation Nonno's mystery lights the state of Texas has a little black the Marfa mystery lights enjoy them because their there they're not be there tonight though 6 p.m. till 2 in the morning I'm not buying that one people that I've talked to would have had sightings and have that experience to seem very genuine I don't know that anyone has been I don't know anyone that's been blown out publicly that I would doubt I mean can you think of one I don't know by what I believed that the Allagash boys Calvin Parker down there in Mississippi to Pascagoula incident I mean again there their lives were severely negatively affected by these experiences check their life they don't they're not a Whitley don't do that future tellers that they don't think there's a guy there he was he says that the Elena. Is back screen porch door he's in town Colorado do you know that gentleman he says balls deep in this man you know all these stories siba fabricating things and I'm also sure there's a lot of people that believe they're telling a true story but in fact or schizophrenic or they have some issues or there's I think there's a lot of that going on Billy Meier was was doubted for me know what you think about the pictures are so vivid in that plating splitting story so vivid I don't mean Billy Meier UFO come Knockin pictures in a white lie by the pine tree they're going they're going all he attached the saucer to the Pine Tree threw it in the air okay well that's one Theory but wasn't it you know didn't they do that just to show the scale of their ship and some of those photos are pretty pretty convincing I don't know and call again you know if there was anyone that I have gout out because Saddam so much doubt has been thrown his way that's pretty pretty I mean how do you well I suppose with Photoshop and Bruce Maccabee I believe like you could say all these positive things about feels he work for the Navy he was at 1 call very very thorough and closing Curry on the on the matter so if you ask me who I doubt maybe I don't know Billy Meier I don't know I don't know why don't you set up a camera crew 24/7 for a couple weeks and let Steven Greer uses lasers said that if you know they've sat on him and watch these things come and go at the North Carolina at their house but people saying that something happened until I get all the photos but his thing is about UFOs he's made documentaries about UFOs how business is he knows a lot about UFOs what you want to Greer I'm not buying what do you want Ashland oil refinery near McGrath Nebraska flash of light when oil refinery in the broad daylight not a good thing could be a fire goes up not into UFOs highway patrolman goes up he was taking it to a ship and deposited as one of the famous one so No Agenda there didn't want to tell the story again got into some cups do people over for nothing some people shoot people for non-existent crimes there's a lot of people that just happen to be police officers that are also full of s*** that's that a lot of people are full of s***. do Highway Patrol mini set of saucer landed Nissan Land and Dan Aykroyd everybody wants to be special and one of the best way to be special is for you to have a special moment with some special creatures from a special play no one else can recognize whether or not you're telling the truth and not telling the truth right talk about this and everybody wants to listen and they listened to you they're totally fixated on everything you like to sell how about how about that is not sorry Air Force pilot and still lives in around he's does many lectures and he did the famous it's the Iranian Tehran UFO sighting he chasing UFO in his jacket in the thing turned off all the electronics in the Jenny said this thing was moving how about General the Brewer will he said David fravor I don't know him he's he's the guy that they were talking about on The Bob Lazar documentary he's he experienced something that flew exactly like the Lazar once I'm going to talk to him and he is incredibly credible and you know the military accolades he's a very well-respected guy and he's never had any other Fantastical sort of stories that he's told I can't wait to talk to him about the Barbies a good guest 2 blindsiding that's another one but I like I like your view you or not going to sit here until it's all true I'm accepting at all it's too easy to get them while I give you two here today from my experience is the ones that I believe and that's Betty and Barney Hill Travis Walton also there wasn't a precedent Betty and Barney Hill in 1961 there wasn't a bunch of people that were talking about these things happening to them and since then they've been very many they were really similar very similar and it makes you wonder what I want to say to people that are skeptical and of course I'm knocking holes in these things but if that if it did happen and you were left alone to try to explain to people something that is incredibly unique very few people ever experienced it it would be so hard to get people to believe you well that's why you have to go to work with rational professional but there's no such thing you know well John special means you make money doing it means you started it you make money doing this not a single f****** human being on this planet as a professional Explorer of other worlds right there's not a single person on this planet that is a professional expert on alien civilization and could tell you everything they need to know I know more about French the French language than anyone that's ever lived knows about alien civilizations and I don't know s*** about French I know it's a real place I know Frances real place in French is a real language and I can say parlez-vous Francais that's more than anybody can be explained about money any civilization on some of the plants to take the credentials of the people who they are UFOs generals pilots and when you have that thing you would do things that make you go see flying saucers Indianapolis news by Bruce I believe Bruce was a real thing I believe Stanton's the real thing I listened J Allen hynek he was so that's a star this is swamp gas that was his directive but then when he left Project Blue Book he said listen these things are real you have 20% of sightings or that's why I was thinking these things and then after it was all over he was compelled to communicate with the American public that there was a real situation going on can Arnold his siding is pretty compelling Nora so I think I don't think they want to form a relationship with us I think you're coming and going like taxis and they have been since the beginning of the existence of Life on this planet of the existence of this planet you think they engineered human beings well that mission to Mars movie is one of NASA employees favorite movies I think maybe they might have tomorrow's movies out in tomorrow is Tim Robbins really good picture listen to this planet you think they engineered human beings well. Mission to Mars movie is one of NASA employees favorite movies I think maybe they might have the Mars movies out in Mission tomorrow is Tim Robbins really good picture</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and I would be nice to find that that's for sure but I believe I believe Bob I do and I believe Donnie and Jenny and I believe driving I want to believe all of them but I believe the I believe the Allagash guys why would why would they do this Summit middle of crazy stories people love telling you their psychic people of believing in astrology people but people believe in Bigfoot I think that there's a lot of people out there that want fantastic things to be real including me it's exciting it's way more exciting than early than not being is entertaining that's why I love the whole problem with severely damaged like Barney Hill was damaged boys were damaged there an interesting couple cuz they were an interracial couple what year was this this happened to 7 so they were dealing with all sorts of pressure this is during the Civil Rights Movement and they were you know you know they were pretty it was it was not the what you would expect for people that were calling out and trying to get attention in the way another way they described as of resonated with people while he was having nightmares and rashes and they had to come to some medical conclusion about it and they just don't let her friend consistently it wasn't a they consulted a friend at the Air Force so you know who they knew and they they kind of enzyme and them not know it's a it's a fascinating story there's just you know it's just it's very very very entertaining and my mother worked for the ministry of Munitions and Supply in World War for the minister and she was suborned to work with the craft production for the hurricane she was in charge of working with getting the hurricane fuselages built in Canada after 4 thank you for the hurricane fighter plane so just you know in the world of Aviation and a 1947 she was walking down Spark Street in Ottowa and she looked up in the sky and she was certain said something told me to look up and she said she saw it look like a Christmas tree ornament just winking above the street about four or five hundred feet blinking on and off red green white red green light that's all I do know and then she looked at in and she's just zipped off in the sky and disappeared around the house after that point we always had articles there's an article is a cover of Life magazine with Marilyn Monroe talk about flying saucers and the cover of look Magazine with Elizabeth Taylor it catalogs the Barney and Betty Hill incident so whenever one of those. She always had that at home from then and I've had four sightings myself quite Vivid the first one was in Martha's Vineyard I was 4 in the morning I got up to take a leak on the balcony there and I looked up in the sky in about a hundred thousand feet up I saw two glowing discs lying and Echelon formation you saw this I saw that they're going from Horizon to Horizon National media like bull rides I know what's not a meteor and what is I know what's the helicopter in what is I know what's the moon and Venus to glowing glowing round objects 100000 ft maybe 20,000 miles an hour to do in because they went across the sky like just in a zigzag formation so if I could scream to my wife my friends that got up at three of us saw it and I said you know and they all knew it was something unusual that was my first real I know what I saw I know what my friend so I know my wife's off those things were moving they were glowing fast they were flying information and they were doing enough speed to get from basically the right side of my eyes to the left side of my eyes really fast the second one was I was I was in so that's so that's four I can't those two and I was four of the Queen Elizabeth hotel and this would have been when we were doing Patron in Canada the Patron tequila a promotion in that was it would have been in the early 2000s and and I looked up and Beyond the window there and I saw this air mattress turned over on its with the bubbles on the bottom gray it was a gray rainy day play Montreal broad daylight and here was this thing at the 23rd story of the hotel and I'm looking at it and it moves slowly down Saint Catherine Street and I'm thinking where are the wires where the wires were around the corner we ran out in the hall we just watched a drift kind of sideways off over the st. Lawrence River and disappear like to see five or six and like that and then and then they the fourth one that I saw I was on my motorcycle leaving town to go Kingston Ontario where I live there and I was driving out of the farm gate and and I saw there's a power line that runs on the opposite Farm there across the road and I saw this winking red-light just moving slowly along the top of the power pylons and I thought call Trenton Times and it goes like this I'm watching at night I stop the bike you know anymore and then it stops and makes a right angle turn it comes right at me and so I turn on I have a police motorcycle so I turn on my wig wags you know like that you have a police motorcycle why do poem over your Sheriff well I would Reserve deputy sheriff reserve and it turns on a light and I'm going I'm looking at the damn thing where's the wash where's the where's the it looks like it looks like it's got to be a helicopter Rings rotors nothing just just a mass of kind of metallic and lights and it just shines a slide light on me and I turn the lights on the bike on and then turn them off and then it went the light off and it just drifted out over the field and just so different if it was in the year 1987 or so and I woke up I woke bolt upright at 3 in the morning I said I got to go outside next day all over the radio of Upstate New York they talked about a big pink spiral in the sky that it appeared to Upstate Northern Northeastern Ontario in Upstate New York and they were saying old was a Chinese rocket what a bot rocket for the Chinese Center rocket this was the exclamation with the media and government was giving at the time so those are my experience and we were doing over there for for Bonnie Hammer over there at at the Syfy Channel and was an interview show where I talked to Doug Meldrum the Sasquatch expert and yeah I believe him I believe him he's passionate about it I don't see why he can't he's also a scientist I talk to all those people but they're the day that I had to say yes I do I believe I believe woman super athlete she was attacked your camper was attacked by when she tells us going again but where was I about the Arabs why we get back to the Syrian UFOs and I had Steven Greer and Stephen Bassett on that same day. Steven Greer on the cattle to okay so I interview Stephen Bassett them about interview Greer and I got a call about like noon afternoon break and they called me say you shows cancelled we won't get out of the studio by the end of the day and we're not going to hear anything that you've done sleeping. Stephen Bassett Steven Greer the UFO now maybe animated decision you know talk shows not really our thing or Aqua it's not really what we want on our Network or I don't know what she called by someone or what like what are these crazy f****** doing was there any of that like if you were a non believer non UFO enthusiasts your interview show me footage I just I just interviewed talk to people is this like it's going to none that don't do talk shows I did a show on Sci-Fi TV show called Joe Rogan questions everything we're along our last very long but part of that was my idea for Bonnie hammer new show on Sci-Fi TV show called Joe Rogan questions everything where a lot of their last not very long but part of that was my idea to work for Bonnie hammer</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> want to talk to you about the the story of the Crystal Skull themselves cuz there is this strange sort of folklore attach them and then there's a lot of people that believe that it's all horseshit in that these were created by modern people in the Marine Underground Yelp in order to my understanding the Aztec have each had one of the most famous one is the mitchell-hedges skull which was found in the Yucatan by Anna mitchell-hedges he reached into a cave she was with her grandfather and was run 1926 and she reached in and there was an oil cloth covered item in there if you pulled it out and opened it up and there was the two-piece detachable jaw mitchell-hedges skull view the Hewlett-Packard engineer they said it could not have been carved by a lapidary by my tools Edgewood been polished over hundreds of years / about / centuries to get to the shape that it was so they said it was a polished item let's see there's a mitchell-hedges call the Phyllis Newman's gold and Max you just that later decided by some people. This is not the case I'm going to I'm going to exactly get to that point because of course it's it's important it doesn't affect my business whether they're fake or not these were beautiful artifacts and we've recreated it beautifully but it's nice to know the true story and I what spot on the theory either way so there's the Phyllis Newman skull I mean Max you have to put it in the closet cuz it talks to her the one that hit the brakes and you're obviously Canadian Canadian guys in the Philip Newman Newman's call she got it and it's name is Max you have to put it in the closet because it talks to her she said so there's mitchell-hedges yes he does Phyllis has that one then there's the lenses the mitchell-hedges skull that's in Indiana the one with the man that took care of Anna at the end of her life eventually had it and got it it's at in Brampton Ontario for many years and I never saw it but people said when they walked into the room and she she kept it in that there was a media feeling of well-being and healing coming over to look at the at the original mitchell-hedges skull there's one in Mexico City is one like one of our money's it's got a cross stuck right in the top of it which is you know that would shatter Crystal if you did that how that cross got there I don't know there are others one at the Smithsonian in Washington to at the Smithsonian Washington DC and one at the Victoria and Albert Museum so that's the supposed to be 8 that we have in $5 missing the woman that Smithsonian has the two there cloudy orange running a cloudy green when I'm going smaller she says they're all fakes that they were carved by a German lapidary in the eighteen hundreds and that he seated them around the world oh wait a minute I think one was found in one was found in Ohio or hearing at the serpent Maryland has she had the tools to do it and she figures artifacts Polished by tribal cast down but they're all fakes but it's just about an Airship to go and deposit these wherever they might be around the world and what it was you can get the pictures of the Stalls up to Smithsonian Crystal heads and smoke Sicilians Crystal had you can get in Victoria Albert Crystal head clear or see there's one at the British Museum and there's some that are clear and a more beautiful there's some that are rougher like that one there and the and the green and the orange one but she says all fake butt modern Western how were they a car that's the thing that came from the Star children if they were brought down and deposited and given to them as crystal ball devices scrying devices to one down there I have to trust the lady at the Smithsonian but then I question they were found at different times in history around the world how do you go and see how you deposit them there what about some sort of a very fast-moving drill with a diamond bit on it that can slowly grind down well that would be then that would be them to be marks that would be visible under under the scanner they put couldn't you polish those marks down I don't I think that the intensity of this of the Hewlett-Packard scrutiny reveal that there were none of those marks and that's why they were able to make their clients but I don't trust me either do I so when I quietly open with all these things I want to believe you I want I want them to be from the sky people I do too but again you know you've got a professional in Washington at our national museum there who says no they're not what is she now is much as we do but I'm downstairs if you are professional intellectual or someone as a curator of you know fine artwork and ancient relics you kind of have to be one of those people that dismisses anyting Preposterous cuz if not there's no way you can sit down and say Neil Barney and Betty Hill were abducted by a flying saucer 1957 he's not going to accept Latinos about physics and Science and propulsion in the universe and how to get from place to place defies the device of Legend Drive I would say defies the theory that there are extraterrestrial Advanced ships out there he can accept it it's just you know you it would be unprofessional for him to say okay there's even a possibility that there were abductions by the Benny and Barney Hill stories very interesting but there's there's no real evidence other than their is that correct well there was a stain on Betty's dress there's her excellent recall she was not he was unconscious paint on her dress is so interesting. It was a fluid that they used in the testing that some kind of a fluid accounting test that they did it once they drew over from her and they do sperm from him now so there's a book out called Contact by Stanton Friedman I don't know I have to ask Kathleen where it is that they did it end up in the junkyard cuz they were marks on the back of the car as well they were trace evidence in the back of the car you know Ted Phillips is he goes around the world collecting Trace all the evidence and radioactive signatures from sightings and and and landings on the back of the car and it was a couple of March but it was Betty's it's their credibility why would they want to bring this into their lives and she was conscious and unconscious or much of it and Barney was not conscious he was unconscious if you hear the tapes of bensimons interviews with them under analysis he was just so frightened when when the little of the being Betty looked at the map and end up being shorter a map if she was on her way out the door and she said may I take this in the being was going to give it to her but then another one zipped up and said no me I can't have this the spaceship said they have an area of the little gray Zeta reticuli Barney and Betty's abduction you had Marjorie fishing out of mature amateur astronomer she took the memory of Betty's Benadryl to star map and she did a three dimensional scale model of that part of the universe and was able to identify Zeta reticuli 1 and 2 and accepted by astronomers self that map that Betty saw board that ship had not been seen on Earth before no none of it at all and end and you know interesting things like when they got back to the the house there there there the house was open then the keys to the house were in on the table with leaves so that they might have dropped them at the site and they being returned them now, but Hopkins yes he said that's where the woman was floated out of her apartment building over the East River in orange or picked her up from the river he was a graphic artist he was a designer a painter and a lovely man and he was one of the first people to start to deal with the trauma of abductees hit big they he got a reputation for being able to interview them hypnotized them interview them and get their stories and empathize and sympathize with him and he said that in some cases that he studied the beings would grab a man from somewhere in America and grab a woman and out of their cars out of their clothes put them up custom drywall red rossburn fluids whatever they're doing and then the woman would wake up in the man shoes or a different car or they wouldn't have two beings were finished with them I don't care where they going to put them put them back in the artist halibut from the store and not eat the fish cuz they want the the salmon to be healthy they want the trout to be healthy him and then they release him but if you're a brown Treadwell brown sugar and base it but if you're a rainbow trout run down this River as they're trying to draw you into a big 9 lb rainbow catch of a lifetime things like how the f*** did I get here what am I doing outside of my driver am I doing in this other dimension of are where I can't breathe that precisely and that's that's what I bet catch-and-release people Travis Walton says you know you got to think of them as just people from over there they're just I want to believe them but this is what I want people to consider because most people that are pragmatic reasonable people that don't want to be ridiculed they look at these stories then go out, and people are full of s*** and I've been there too but I want I want people to imagine that is if aliens did AK occasionally visit Earth what how often do you think this to take place and how it would be very infrequently and if it was if it was half you should be completely unique unusual occurrences out of nowhere where someone would come down it would do something and they would be leaving the person with this thought in this memory in this inability to describe it with normal words if you were taken aboard a spaceship and you were some reptilian beings that were 3 ft tall were running experiments on you and you were paralyzed and they released you back on Earth what words do you have available to you to describe this experience in a way you tell me hey Joe I went white water rafting with my kids it was a great time it was so fun we got to see Eagles and it was it was gorgeous then we had lunch at this beautiful little cafe what a great day I can Envision this experience I can see it but if you tell me hey man we went camping and I woke up and smelling it a finger in my Allagash Bruce Maccabees book of its all the headlines from 1952 432 reports given and I'll address your specific question about people how they relate their experiences and and how genuinely feel in it in a second here 432 reports given the Air Force in 1952 on Ariel siding ships from other planets we got memories members memos from the government hear former Army pilot sees Flying Saucer by daylight whatever was cited here July 30 stories fighter pilots at Newcastle say alert for more sauce two reports yeah that's your clone this people's never lie why don't you know that they never they never make fake stories never talk shimmy already told me and Leslie Keno reporters for the New York Times and they've been studying this phenomenon they report Rivera credibly on it I'll tell you how an abductees experiences related I attended a lecture at the Fifth Avenue Medical Institute in in Manhattan with my wife a few that would be about 15 years ago and John Mack was a lecturer you know he wrote the book abduction was the Harvard psychiatrist who wrote abduction we can get that up to abduction John Mack will you die in a car accident stepped off a curb in in in a in a small town in England and he was struck by a car and three other John Max died the Same Day in England so so if you think people whacking John Max is he not too much I don't know and there were 300 abductees there... Someone who interviewed with some some of your not but we were there for interested to find out about brother experience and one guy got up and said he had one arm and I don't know whether that was related I don't think was related experience but he said I'm a Wall Street broker I'm quite well-off I have a sailboat I was in Long Island Sound a few years ago and a blue light hit me and I had missing time of about five or six hours but in it I have filter filtrated memories of you beings addressing me and telling you that I was powerful and influential men I could help the planet survive and they put me back in my ship when I woke up and and and and he said I'm waiting for them to come back I want them to come back and I asked the room I got up and I said of all of you been taking how many of you would would want to repeat the experience or have it happen again in about half of them said no Beltway they wanted to have it happen again and 1/2 said yeah saucers over the the capital the glowing lights in July 1952 Washington initiated by the detonation of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki where they decided okay these f****** monkeys are doing some stupid s*** we need to go down there and see what's up and see if there's an imminent danger to the cosmos let's find out what kind of capabilities they have cuz if you listen to Lazar or if you believe the work Zachariah sitchin there any of the people that believe that human beings were engineered that there's the reason why this is giant leap between us and the rest of primates in the planet is because something came down and manipulated our genetics while the movie Mission to Mars with Tim Robbins you know basically it says that you know beautiful come on let's go here now for an airplane. Ain't a helicopter now I'm crazy photographing hits from 1952 I mean the special effects back then were incredibly crude. put under pressure to do so in the movie called what is it that there's a documentary on Netflix it's available that he's in that he talks about the pressure that they put on him to make light of that incident and he talks about his own personal experiences was seeing something some sort of triangle shaped craft it was enormous the size of several football fields was flying overhead that was completely silent and how it freaked him out Delta crops are very very interesting but video of the 80s and with the samurai Tanto is investigator there afternoon fun these things would park over the family Barbecue for about half an hour and you know families in suburbs were looking up them the sky being blotted out for these things parking about them so it comes down to I don't think these beings Lord Hill Norton said there were 23 different species visiting a plan in 23 different types of ships I don't think they want a formal relationship with people on Earth they want an informal secret relationship I think they probably have one with elements of the black elements of the Air Force in the government you know David Sarita is I've heard is David's really should have them all and he's very knowledgeable about this he's been precipitated by the Trinity explosion at because it was such an interdimensional disturbance of the atoms being split and that explosion it was it was that that saucer there that went down in 47 may have may have been influenced somehow negatively bye-bye close enough Stanton Friedman doesn't didn't buy that I love Stanton he just passed away there he was the expert on Roswell dinner with him the night before I don't have I don't I used to believe I had the best bulshit meter in the world but as I've gotten older I've got more honest I don't I didn't see anything he's he's incredibly smart guy and he's not a guy was like seeking out attention and he's not profiting from this and then just his demeanor and everything just science in general and we talked about all sorts of different things and he's a scientist is it legit scientist I've talked to a lot of them yeah I know what kind of person is he said when they just hassled him again there they raided his is nuclear isotope he talked openly about it in the 90s that he had managed to weasel some away from the area S4 and they think that he still has it done that George Knapp it actually filmed that it showed some really bizarre distortions using this stuff and then it was able to it it was it was I got to remember exactly what it did that they show but they did some experiences like steam or smoke or something like that would have showed Element 115 admitting George Knapp it actually filmed that it showed some really bizarre distortions using the stuff and then it was able to hit it was it was I got to remember exactly what it did that they show but they did some experiences like steam or smoke or something like that would have showed Element 115 admitting some sort of vapor know it was emitting some sort of a field where you literally couldn't physically touched</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> adoption for the possibility that one day we could conceivably create some sort of an amazing simulation but it hasn't been done yet and this is why it's become the topic of conversation is that there's some need for concern because his extrapolate technology and you think about where it's going down where it's headed there could conceivably be one day with this exist should we consider this and deal with it now outside say that that would be the third take the first two are wrong right then. Many many more simulated once turn on simulated one will be over the course of all of history over the course of our history you know that by the end of time that would have been let outside and the original all have subjectively indistinguishable experiences to count from the inside tell the difference then what given that assumption would it be rational for you to believe should you take your one of the exceptional ones or should you think you're one in amongst that the largest simulated one happened yet yeah but my dick look at the Showcase of just let's just look in the narrow case past the Earth if the historical records accurate if it's not a simulation then it seems very reasonable that we're just dealing with incremental increases and Technology that's pretty stunning and pretty pretty profound currently but that we haven't experienced a simulation yet is not right sure if you were in a simulation yes but it's also how it would look if you're not in a simulation yet that's also a possibility to know right but most people for whom it looks like that it would be the case that they would be stimulated by we be assumed something so unbelievably fantastic when just life itself is preposterous the life itself just being a human being on a planet you know this planet spinning a thousand miles an hour hurtling through Infinity that in itself is fairly Preposterous if it didn't exist but it does exist and we know that we at least we're all agreeing Upon A Certain historical ryderwear green upon Oppenheimer the Manhattan Project World War 1 World War we're agreeing on Korea Vietnam were quick ring on Reagan and Kennedy wear green all these things historically if we are all agreeing that there's a sort of historical process we are all green I remember when the first iPhone was invented I remember when the first computer I remember when this I remember the internet why would we assume that there's a simulation we could assume that there's a possibility of a simulation but why were you soon the simulation hasn't occurred why wouldn't we assume the simulation hasn't occurred yet but it is a possibility that we would be in the first time sickness off all of these things where you have uncertainty about who we are what time it is where you are so if you might have for example all of these people who would existed this annoying having to place bets on whether they're simulated or not and you think about two possible different ways of reasoning about this someone is randomly selected individual from all these individuals and you bet accordingly lexicon Master simulated most lottery tickets are assuming that most of similar this where I'm getting confused by the end of time by the end of this is not going to argue about pragmatic reality of biological person that has a finite life-span you're born you die you're here right now and we are apart of this just the long line of humanity that created all these incredible things it's led up to civilization it's let up this moment right now are you and I are talking to these microphones and luthien broadcast why isn't it likely that a simulation hasn't occurred yet that we are in the process of innovating and one day could potentially experience a simulation but why are you not factoring in the possibility with the probability that that hasn't taken place yet but if you're done that people follow this General principle up assuming that they would be the ones in the original history before the simulations that happened run then almost all of them are bats once the simulation has actually integrate evidence of the simulation is taking place but there is evidence that you're a liar mother you have a problem in that. There's can be true in the simulation as well I mean yes. Right now why would we assume why why would a simulation be the most likely scenario when we've experienced at least we believe we've experienced all this innovation in our lifetime we see it moving towards a certain direction why wouldn't we assumed that that hasn't taken place yet yeah I think to try to argue for the premise that conditional on there being first and initial segment simulated Joe Rogan experiences and then a lot of other segments of simulated ones that condition of the world in fatality Lux you should think you're one of the simulated ones by piece of probability Theory called and tropics betting strategies for this population of Joe Rogan experiences the ones that would lead to the overall maximum amount of winning would be if y'all thought you're probably one of these simulated segments if you had the general reasoning rule that in this kind of situation you should think that you're at the initial segment simulator experience but there's no evidence of a simulation indirect evidence insofar as there is evidence against these two Alternatives that were being that goes extinct before they create and sort of Salvation or that they agreed I do not have created simulation what about if they're going to create a simulation there has to be a time before the same ocean is created why wouldn't you assume that that time is now currently happening when you've got a historical record of all the Innovation that's leading up to today if we understand him it would be there in just a relation but why would it have to be there in a simulation and not be there in reality it doesn't have to be as I would be both right I mean that would be one yoga experience and Ariel original history and then like maybe a million that's a sight in simulated reality Slater but think about your actions that kind of can't distinguish between these different possible locations in space-time where you could be most of the impact of your decisions will come from impacting all of these million Joe Rogan insta yeah but that one relationship simulation has been proven to exist which it hasn't been we we we have at least in terms of what we all agree we're we're proven to have biological lives we breed we sleep we we eat we we travel on planes all these hoes to know and a possible there's no proof or no evidence that makes any sense to me that there is currently any simulation to the possibility that it's more probable that we are in a simulation this is what Escapes Me the most obvious I can find a big window pops up in front of you saying you're in a simulation if you if you got some evidence that suggested it was less likely that is all civilizations hey there, sweet you know we become prudent and will check all the asteroids nothing is on collision course with her status to lower the probability of the first right over on the remaining alternatives didn't running us-27 Isis we think this is what we really want to spend our resources on the soonest we can make it work. That would move probability over from the second alternative like it's less likely that there is a post-human technically you know that house and yes or no have I built our own planetary science computer that can run these simulations and we are just about to switch it on and it will create a simulation of precisely people like ourselves and as we move towards the big boss on suicide of initiate this is basically goes to zero Malaysian as we push this button to create a million simulation one switch Eve. State but we have not achieved that states why would we not assume that we are in the actual state that we currently experience as to which of these different time slices we are which of these different Joe Rogan experiences is is the present one we just can't tell from the inside which yeah I'm sorry and no simulations have happened you could conclude that during the original history but if we can't see that talk outside the window if there is no window in the simulation to look out then it would look the same and then I'd say we have no way of telling which of these different instances we are one of them might be. no simulation and that we're moving towards that simulation that one day by battat caviar one in at all but one in a million a million is that life is what you experienced right now on the other haven't blown themselves up yet let's say that human beings haven't come up with there was no need to make the decision to not activate the simulation cuz it patient hasn't been invented yet isn't that also a possibility is it also a possibility that the actual timeline of technological innovation that we all agree on is real and that we're experiencing this as real live human beings not in a simulation that one day the simulation could potentially take place but has not yet isn't that also a possibility situation for somebody with your experiences to be in experiencing life something that prevents the simulations from bronchitis is where you lose me got to think in terms of the world as a 44 dimensional structure with time in one dimension right out of existence that will have happened by the end of time you look at all the different experiences that match your current experience given these various assumptions the vast majority of us would be stimulated by being that option 1 and 2 are false yeah but they will have been maybe but not yet right but since I thought you said if we look at the universe at the end of time and we'll look back that would be a lot of simulated versions of you and don't want to read in a long you think you might be the original one just be here that there is no simulation and that maybe it will take play something but maybe it will but you have to pick which of those versions Yard Wichita scenarios you're considering and I would say that means one of the first two Alternatives another option is there could be an emulation created later but it has not taken place... I will be a possibility but it has not happened yet exist inside the simulation I still don't understand that why can it not have happened yet well it depends on which of these experiences is your present moments in that scenario that's going to be a million of them plus an initial one you can't tell me there will be a million of them but there's right now no evidence that there's going to be no evidence that there is no evidence that it's ever even going to be possible technologically we think there could be but it hasn't happened yet so why would you assume that we are in a simulation currently when there's no evidence whatsoever that it's even possible to create a simulation maybe fairy some alternative I'm sorry I thought experiment which has nothing to do with simulations of stuff but if a room and then your wait there for one hour and then a coin is tossed and if it lands heads than the experiment on Sunday exit the room and everything is normal again but if it lands tails and then you're working up in the room again you think you're there for the first time because you don't remember being that before and it is repeated sometimes so we have a world where either there is one one our experience of you in the room or else if the world Joe Rogan experiences in the room with an episode of Amnesia in between when you're in the room now you find yourself in this room you're wondering if it's the first time I'm in this room could be but it could also be that later on and I was just given a drug you have to assign probabilities to these different places you can and then maybe after back thar I'll make some decision that depends on where you are so what do you think the probability that the coin that that that you're versus at some later time what is the probability that I'm actually here versus what is the probability that is highly play scenario that I keep getting drugged over and over again every hour that the setup is such that there was this mad scientist who had the means to do this and he was going to flip this coin what is the philosophical thought experiments mypoints ability to get back to his there's no evidence at all that we're in a simulation so why wouldn't we assume that the most likely scenario is taking place which is we are just existing and life is as it seems but strange so if it if you don't want to do write the probability theory part from The Wider simulation but if we were to move closer to this point where we ourselves can create simulations if we survive we become the multiplanetary you would be a planet recycle computers how would your probability in the simulation hypothesis change we will allow someone to create a simulation is indistinguishable from real guy but I would rather assume that reality itself currently is just that because it seems to be is not Occam's razor is not the simplest answer this is reality this is would you are here you're here one day there may be a simulation has not happened yet I think it would require you to postulate that you are just very unusual and special Observer amongst all The Observers that will exist why is everyone is unusual in their own way that's true there's no one person that's a version that's living the same exact life in a million different scenario so I put in this respect if they're all these simulations than most of these people are not special in this way the most of them are simulated what time it is now in external reality and we therefore can't tell from looking at the evidence where we are in girls were either there's just an original history and then it ends so there is a world with an original history than a lot of simulations we need to think about how to assign probabilities given each of these two scenarios in those types of situations how do you allocate probability over the different Martha speaks about how the world is structured and this kind of thing argument is one type of argument that you can try to reduce to kind of get some and another is by looking at them various applications in in in in Cosmopolitan stuff we have Multiverse theories and which Ivy universities Croatia Hot Toddy Drive probabilistic predictions from. Like it seems like whatever You observe would be observed by somebody so how could you test that kind of Siri and this same kind of entropic reasoning that I want to use in the context of the simulation argument also plays a role I think in driving observational predictions from these kinds of cosmological theories what you need to assume something like your most likely a typical Observer from the most Day of Service that will ever have existed or so I would suggest I should admit this filled up on topic reasoning is tricky and not fully settled yet and there are things there that we don't get fully understand but still the particular application about topic reasoning that is relevant for the simulation argument want to be relatively less problematic ones so that conditional under being by the end of time a large number of simulated arrogance and only one I think conditional probability should be one of the simulated ones but I'm not sure I have any other ways of willing to take into account the possibility that hasn't occurred yet yes I'm in the way I say this. I have taken that into account at 8 to see if the same probability that I'm that initial segment as I would give to any of the other Nick Bostrom segments that that all have the same because I would give much more probability to the fact that we are existing right now in the current state as we experience it in real life carbon life no simulation potentially one day there could be a simulation which leads us to look at the possibilities and look at the probability that it's already occurred about this suppose it is the case that was a big bang planets formed gas cloud in an infinite Universe this will happen somewhere right we're just by chance that was a kind of Joe Rogan like brain coming together for a minute and undissolved into gas and probability spectracide song this is told you that well this is the structure of our part space-time like a like a few very very rear springs from gas clouds Orland universe and then do the normal Rogan's is much later and of course many many more normal ones in one out of every you know 10 ^ 50 while the normal ones are ones that have evolved on planets inside the mother and different pieces like the fact that it matches relatives I think he rather went to the point I want to make. If it's turn out to be the way the world Works a few weird was happening from gas clouds and then the vast majority are just normal people living on a planet would you see Melissa that you should think I might just as well be one of these you lost me sorry you know I think that this would be a structurally similar situation where there would be a few exceptional early living versions that would be very small numbers compared to the later ones and if they allow themselves the same kind of reasoning GameStop in this model of the universe you should think you're one of these early gas-car cons and random processes that going to be very few numbers compared to the ones that have not risen on planets so that by taking the path you want to take with relation to the simulation argument I wonder if you would not done be committed to thinking that you would be like in ineffective boltzmann brain in in a gas cloud super early in the universe I still don't understand what you're saying what I'm saying is that we scientists agree if you believe in science and if you believe in the discoveries that so far people evolved currently greet we've agreed that clouds are formed in that planets are created and then all the matter comes from inside of the explosions of a star and then it takes multiple times for this to coalesce before we develop carbon-based life-forms with all that stuff in poop signs currently breeze on right and then we believe in single-celled organisms become multi-celled organisms at random mutation and natural selection we get Evolution and then we agree that we come to a point where technology has hit this gigantic Spike that you described earlier so human beings are created all this new innovation why wouldn't we assume that all this is actually taking place right now with no simulation truth in many versions of it it would actually be the case that in the simulation all of these things have taken place and go back to long time and it might be a reality tracking simulation maybe the same things also happened before outside the simulation I understand what war all these things have actually happened and there is no simulation yet Motel really probable well meant to me it seems probable only if at least one of the other Alternatives true or I admit that there's also this General possibility that I'm confused about some big thing of Science and philosophy but but if we're working within the parameters of what country seems to me to be the case that we would be the first civilization in the universe simulations seems unlikely civilization in the universe where they will later be many many simulations seems unlikely photos of the first it's probably because one of the alternatives to</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but I think if I was in the future some weird dystopian future where artificial intelligence runs everything and and human beings are you know link to some sort of neurological implant that connects us all together and we long for the days of biological Independence and we would like to see what it what was it like when they first started inventing phone what was it like when the internet was first opened up for people what was it like when people saw when when when someone Someone Like You on a podcast and was talking about potential artificial intelligence of where could lead us and we could do a most interesting time. Of great change we were still human but we're worried about privacy we were concerned our phones are listening to us were concerned about surveillance dates and in a poop people put little stickers over their laptop camera see it coming but it hasn't quite hit us yet we're just seeing the problems that are associated with this increased level of technology in our lives which is yeah but yeah it does put some strain on it when you said little too much of a way of thinking about it like what way like what what are the chances that you would happen to be living in the most interesting time in history being like dr.. Could just be I mean if there's a lot are you somebody's got to have the ticket front or or or or or we are wrong about this whole picture and there is some very different structure in place that we could make our experience is more typical how much have you considered the possibility of a simulation I mean night I fell off the simulation argument and saw yeah but personally the way you view the world how much how much how much does it play into your vision of what reality is well it's hard to say I'm in for the majority of my time I'm not actively thinking about that time to start living and my work is actually to think about big picture questions so it kind of comes in through my work as well when you're trying to make sense of our position future prospects Believers which we might have available to affect the world what what what would be a good and bad way of pulling those flavors and then you have to try to put all of these constraints and considerations together and in that context I think it's important I think if you are just going about your daily existence then it might not really be very useful irrelevant to constantly like try to bring in hypothesis about the nature of reality is because for most of the things you're doing on a day-to-day basis like they work the same whether it's inside a simulation or in basement level physical reality like you still need to get your car keys out your estimated right so in some sense it's kind of actress out and it's irrelevant for many practical intents and purposes what do you remember when no I I mean I remember when when the simulation argument occurred to me besides Which is less not just when it's options almost all civilizations at our current stage of technological development go extinct before reaching technical maturity Option 1 or physically possible and Powerful computers on which you could run detailed computer nations of conscious individuals and that they'll lose interest in creating ancestor simulation so these kinds of detailed computer simulations of conscious people like their historical predecessors or variations of these computers that could do it but for whatever reason they all decide not to do it some other than what I wanted yes and I would also having Hines themselves in many different ways and Saw traps enhancing their ability to recognize the consequences if you have the ability to download Consciousness into a computer once it's contained into this computer what it what is what's the stop it from existing there as long as there's power and as long as these chips are firing and electricity is being transferred data is being moved back and forth you would essentially be in some sort of a simulation virtual reality environments Now volume perfect but improving and you could kind of perfect if you can include in the simulation just that you have maybe simulated coffee mugs and Carson citrate you could have simulated brains that if it inside here is one assumption coming in from outside the simulation argument principle have conscious experiences implemented it doesn't have to be carbon atoms as a case where the human brain it could be silicon atoms great conscious experiences of some kind of structural feature of the competition that is being performed rather than the material that is used to underpin it so in that case you can have a simulation with detailed simulations of prince in it we're moving every neuron and synapse assimilated conscious possibility number to restart this posthumous just are not at all interested in doing it and what's number three. We are in a simulation the simulation hypothesis and where you lean while II dinnerly on the question of precise probability I think it would be a probability thing right bottom yeah refrain from giving a very precise number part partly because if I said some particular number it would get cold food greatest maybe sense of false Precision the argument doesn't allow me to drive this the probabilities has to obtain we could just make up any story and we have no evidence for it but it but it it seems that they actually if you start to think everything through quite tight constraints on what probabilistically coherent views you could have any kind of hard even to find one overall hypothesis that fits this and and various other considerations that that we think we know is one day the ability to create a simulation that it would be indiscernible reality itself say if we are not in a simulation yet if this is just biological life we're just extremely fortunate to be in this Goldilocks. But we're working on virtual reality and terms of like Oculus and all these companies are creating these consumer-based virtual reality things are getting better and better and really kind of interesting that you got imagine that 20 years ago there was nothing like that 20 years from now it might be indiscernible you might you might be able create a virtual reality that's impossible to to discern from the reality that we currently experience or experiences and even feedback in terms of like biological feedback touch and feel and smell to figure out a way to do that one they both have an artificial reality that's indiscernible from reality itself and if that is the case how do we know if we're in it right. I thought you could for a given cost I think great many more ancestral simulations with simulated brains in the rather than biological brains with VR gear sell most in Indus Norris where that would be a lot of simulators for lack of a better term mine fox when you really stop and think about reality itself that if we are living in a simulation like what what is it and why and where is it go and how do I respond how do I move forward if I really do believe this is a simulation what what what am I doing here huge questions some strange impossible understand calculations that designed to determine whether or not there's a likelihood of us being involved in a simulation currently the requirements that would be with perfect precision song before have some humor in the brain room light to say I never wanted to simulate ever little Park every at them every subatomic particle the whole Quantum wave function what would be the computational artifact and would it be possible to build a computer powerful enough that you could actually do this now I think the way that this misses the point is that not necessary to simulate all the details of this environment that you want to create an ancestor simulation you would only have to say it in so far as it is perceptible to The Observer inside the simulation so if you're some post human civilization wanted to create a simulation that need to simulate Joe Rogan sprained cuz that's where the experience has happened and then what environment that you are able to perceive surface appearances maybe off the table and walls maybe they would need to see what I see me as well or at least a good did not simulacrum that I could so spit off words that would sound like they came from the real you have no idea of knowing whether. Even our atoms Tara. Now you could take a big electron microscope look at the final structure and undone you could take an atomic Force microscope and you could see individual atoms even though you could perform all kinds of measurements and it might be important that if you did that you wouldn't see anything weird cuz this is to this experiment experiment cheaper than continuously running all of this as this is the way a lot of computer games are designed today that they have a certain rendering distance so I can only like actually simulate the virtual world went with the character goes close enough that you could see it without assigning a probability to either one of those three scenarios what makes you think when you if you do stop and think I think we're in a simulation what what are the things that are convincing to you while it would mean to go through the is it really only 3 so the until the ones are we that human beings go extinct suppose that the first two options are Falls so it's a non-trivial fraction of civilizations that are states to get through Nantes revoked are still interested then I think you can convince English by using just a small portion of the resources that could create very very many simulations and you can by comparing the computational power systems that we know are physically possible to build a building but we could see that you could build in with 9 attacking if you have planetary scientist and resources on the estimates of how much computing power to take to simulate the human brain for 1 minute it's spelled wrong in thousands and thousands and thousands of simulations pain and they might have billions of planets and they might last for billions of here so so the numbers are quite extreme it seems the first two options are false would follow that that would be many many more simulated experiences of our kind and I would be original experiences of our account so ideas that if we continue to innovate if if if human beings or intelligent life in the cosmos continues to innovate that creating a simulation is almost inevitable with the same capability to figure out a way to not die and stay stay Innovative that we don't have any certain natural disasters or man-made created disasters then Step 2 if we don't we don't decide to not pursue this if we continue to pursue all various forms of technological innovation including simulations that it becomes inevitable if we get past those two first options becomes inevitable that we pursue it so if if they have that capacity then they will do it and the motive I would like said desire to you and I would shoot your money off these so not just one simulation right but beyond the simulation the real question if this is a simulation if there's many many simulations running currently what's beyond the simulation would be like what do we all things considered I have the most recent to do in our situation like what would would be wise for us to do is that like some way that we can be or have the Best Buy for whatever ridiculous to even consider maybe it's beyond us what the question of what is outside yes Advanced civilization that that would have developed a lot of Technology overtime including computer technology ability to do virtual reality for a while we'd imagine probably they would have used that technology for a whole host of other purposes as well you wouldn't just get that technology and you know not be able to create a train or something and then for one reason or another they would have decided to some of the resources to two crates simulations and inside one of those simulations perhaps saw any more details but but I still think that's fundamentally our ability to crack this whole thing would be very limited and that might be other considerations. oblivious to put check if you think about the simulation argument is it quite recent right side like 20 years old site if you take that is correct for the sake of argument that everybody was missing something like hugely important appointment all right very smart people hundreds of years presumably that must be some father big giant realization. That is like young. Currently I think having some kind of when does it take in a different option stay right there might be many different simulations start configure different say that I could be ones that run for a very long time or person you could like just about space of possibilities there and which ones are too much about because it would depend on the reasons for seeing or person you could like just about space of possibilities that and which ones of those would be most likely is it for your heart to save much about because it will depend on the reasons for creating these simulations like what would the interest of these hypothetical posthuman speed</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but your simulation hypothesis we if we're in it it's running now is it running and we independently interact with the simulation or is a simulation introducing ideas into our minds that then come to fruition inside the simulation is that how things get done like we are in a simulation it during the simulation someone is created new iPhone why they doing that other other people in the simulation or is this simulation entirely unique to the individual is each individual involved in a different coexisting simulation right sub the one where all people would be simulator that you perceive that you could get the realistic Behavior out of of the brain If you seem like the whole brain that is efficient so everyone you interact with I swear Augusta like acted like humans but that's nothing inside Brian so these would be in philosophers parlance zombies that is like will you like this might not be real like this person might not be real person this might be a simulation right I mean directions are simulated in different frequencies in South different even if you were in that kind of hey today implications for interacting with life as if is a simulation I don't know but I think their first approximation the same things that would be worthwhile and make a lot of sense to do in physical reality would be also our Best Bets in a simulated reality that's really weird like if it's a simulation but you must behave in each and every instance as if it's not if you what you were giving it be like if you had a test you could take like a pregnancy test when you went to the CVS and you know you pee on a strip that tells you guess what Nick this s*** is in real you're in a simulation 100% proven absolutely positive you know from now on from this moment on that everything you interact with is some sort of creation not real but it is real because you having the same exact experience as if it was real karate proceed yeah I think that's what happened what would you do with personally well I I don't know the answer to that possibility like more Chick-fil-A simulation could be like if the computer where this is is other things as well become more maybe similar to various theological possibilities. Afterlife and stuff like that and in fact it kind of maybe it's a very different path leads to some similar I think there is no logical these necessary connection either way but there are so kind of structural parallels analogs between the situation of a simulated creature to their simulator designed and created a day to the Creator. That's interesting kind of different saw so that might be kind of comparison stand that you could make that would give you some voice of preceding it seems like paralysis by now so you just sit there and think about it like at least I would almost wind up not being able to do anything or not being able to act remover thing that seems kind of like to be suboptimal right suboptimal for sure it seems like paralysis by now so you just sit there and think about it at least I would almost wind up not being able to do anything or not being able to act remover thing that seems kind of like it to be suboptimal right suboptimal for sure</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I've often wondered if what we think of it in terms of like artificial life from Another Life another planet is that is like an artificial creation like in our ideas that we understand that the biological limitations of the body when it comes to traveling through space the dealing with radiation def need for food things on those lines that what we would do is create some artificial thing to travel for us like we're already done on Mars. We had a the rooms around Mars The Next Step would be an artificial autonomous intelligent creature that has no biological limitations like we do in terms of like its ability to absorb radiation from space and we create one of those little guys just like that one or Norma said no sex organs does need sex organs you know and we have this thing pilot these ships that can defy our own physical limitations in terms of what would happen to us we had to deal with in a 1 million G Force because it's moving at some Preposterous rate through space like we when we think of these things coming from another planet if we think of Life on another planet if they can innovate in a similar fashion the way we do we would imagine they would create an artificial creature to do all their dirty work like why would they want to like risk their body spaceship, you don't have to have like a little thing that sits and turns the steering wheel right sure is spacefaring in a serious way would have nine or technology is arbitrarily configure if they wanted to they could be invisible toss I'll take like nanoscale things hiding in a rock somewhere information linked up to some planets are a size computer somewhere far away which would be doing that I think that that's the way that space is most likely to get colonized spaceships around and having Star Trek Adventures it's going to be emanating from whatever the home planet was moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light and converting everything in its path into infrastructure of whatever type is maximally valuable for that Civilization maybe computers and launchers to launch morphe space probe so that the whole way from can continue to propagate what we are if human beings are going to continue and we were going to propagate through the universe we're going to try to go to other places we're going we going to try to populate other planets and are we going to do that with just robots or we going to try to do that biological it was probably going to try to do it biologically things were saying earlier is one of the things that artificial intelligence could possibly do is accelerate our ability to travel to other lands or the plants I just think that cannot lift anything important until those efforts becomes obsoleted by some radical new technology wave probably triggered by machine superintelligence that then rapidly leads to something approximating technical maturity would have space colonies and cures for aging and all of these things right but if it's at thinking time happens in that helped and fairly quickly reach a condition where you have clothes to optimal technology and and then you can colonize to space cost-effectively you just need to set up a production facility I'm so done it spreads everywhere and then if you want so you could then like after that initial infrastructure and has happened you could transport Biologicals human beings you know the planet if you wanted to be going to be like but what if we were concerned there's some sort of threat to the Earth like some sort of asteroid impact something weird trivial really like a gift of free energy right here comes another package grapes that's a funny way to look at it do you think we're going to eventually colonize Mars the answer but everything else accessible in the universe when you talk about these things people always want to know when when do you think's going to happen what's the time would be after technological maturity like after superintelligence when Mars is possible that they would be like a little kind of prototype self-sustaining civilization I think that's going to be very difficult to do until we have super intelligence so you think Super intelligence could potentially be what that one of the applications would be to terraform Mars Vortex technical maturity additional Technologies we can't even think of yet but even just what we already know about physics a type of seed possible technology that we don't get that they would be consistent with physics that would be stable structures and so for example I think it would be possible mine seems to two computers for example would be interested in using our technology for that purpose at a time but reasonably a technical maturity to do that now whether it's actually going to happen to pennsaid do we reach technical maturity and be do we are interested in using our technology for that purpose at a time but I'm kind of reasonably possible</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> pay attention to like Boston Dynamics and at least all these different robotic Creations that they've made all that I think I have a penchant for doing it with a sinister-looking all robots that are you know anything that looks they're developing Terminator yeah but what I was thinking is if we do eventually come to a time where those things are going to war for us instead of us like if we get involved in robot wars are robots versus their robots and this becomes the next motivation for increased technological innovations try to deal with Superior robots by the Soviet Union or by China like these more things that could be threats I could push people to some crazy level of technological innovation yeah it it it could not think there are other drivers for technological innovation as well. That seems plenty strong commercial drivers that we wouldn't have to rely on on wall that the threat of War stay in a hotel when it has been this effort to try to see if it would be possible to have some kind of ban on lethal autonomous weapons limited penetration yes or no maybe I don't know. Then I don't know exact number but it is actually a lot better than 50 or a hundred countries and some other weapons that's why I'll blinding lasers landmines killer box it seems the answer to that is not a particular campaign being a launcher exactly what it is that what I mean certainly I'd be better if we refrain from having some more x-rays to develop these. Not but if you start to look in more detail what what precisely is the thing that Pentagon so if the idea is the autonomous bit like the robot should not be able to make its own Farm decision well whenever the screen flashes fire now he has to I'm not pushing the button right but exactly what does that mean you like an Endeavor particular fire decision or is it like some attack this group of surface ships here and not to fire outside this these coordinates like it would be better if I had no worse but if there is going to be a war maybe it is better if it's trouble to be robots or arrive like maybe a want the bombs did it have high Precision run-of-the-mill procession to your civilian casualties in operating under artificial intelligence or or or or it doesn't seem like a good thing to have a society we are like a facial recognition thing and then and you just have what kind of dystopia so given the overall view of the human race that we want peace and everything to be well but realistically if you were someone who is trying to attack someone militarily you'd want the best possible weapon to give you the possible advantage and that's why we had to develop the atomic bomb first it's probably why will develop the or will try to develop the killer autonomous robot first yeah yeah world is is peace fall on it requires everybody to synchronize fractions and then then you can have success it's like we've had with some of these streets with no title big arms race in biological weapons that were Ever every year to maintain these large Arsenal so that we can kill one another a fun day we decide to do it like that that's got to be a better way yeah we would hope that we would get to some point where all this would be irrelevant because there's no more war just Round Up machine guns like they got to make sure this never happens again so they tried to do the league of nation but then didn't feel invested with very much power and on the second War II World War Boss designed us ways to try to prevent it to actually enforce the agreement and there's a beat. Which makes it hard if it's two of the major powers that are at loggerheads so it might be that if I work 3rd big conflagration. Then people would say this time you know we got it really really put something kind of institutional solution replace the power that that we don't try this again robot war memories fade right the Cold War I mean I grew up in Swedish I remember we were kind of in between right and we were taught in school so by fall out something and Maryellen very serious how bad it is to live in that kind of hair trigger nuclear arms race Cold War situation has kinda faded and now it's percent chance are 30% chance that the world would popped during the Cold War and we were lucky but it doesn't mean we want to have another one I when I was in high school was a real threat when I was in high school everyone was terrified that we're going to go to war with Russia it was a big thing in and you talk to people from my generation about that and everybody remembers it remember that feeling that you had in high school that like we there any bad any day something can go wrong and we could be at war with another country that's a nuclear suit but that's all gone now like that that feeling that fear people are so confident that that's not going to happen that that's not even in people's Consciousness and then a number of maneuvers now you're a softer a pinky or alive purple that's being developed either in the Soviet Union or in China or somewhere else in the world where there's a similar type robots I think a lot of the Boston Dynamics actually useful animal-like animal like things up around or something like that this kind of thing alarm</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I was watching you talk that you were giving and you were talking about the the growth of innovation technology and GDP over the last 100 years we were talking about the entire history of life on Earth and what a short. Of time humans have been here and then what a shin during what a short. Of time what a stunning amount of innovation and how much change will even acted on the earth and just a blink of an eye and had the scale of GDP over you know that the the last hundred years it's it's crazy to live because it's so difficult for us with our current perspective just being person living going about the day-to-day life that seem so normal to put it in perspective TimeWise and see what an enormous amount of change has taken place in relatively incredibly short amount of time commuting to sit in front of a computer all day and you try not to eat too much sun if it is this normal percent we were just hunter-gatherers running around and I could culture list for what would the last couple of escaped the malthusian condition where were you basically only have as much income you need to be able to produce two children and we have a population explosion live on the surface of this little special Crump and this is normal and everything else is weird but I think that's a completely inversion and so when you do plot if you depart for example world's GDP which is the total amount of productive capability that we have right now vertical line and you can't really see any other respect it like it's it's so extreme the degree to which a Humanities project now everyone involved in the explosion everyone that's innovating everyone is creating all this new technology they're all a part of this momentum that was created before they were even born so it does feel normal they're just a part of this whole spinning machine and they jump in their born to go to college next thing you know they have a job and a contributing to make a new technology and there's very little perspective in terms of like the historical Mexicans of this incredible explosion technologically when you look at what you're talking about that gigantic Spike no one feels it which is one of the weirdest things about it that that mean you kind of expect every year that would be a better iPhone or whatever I do the material conditions is it relatively new idea I mean people thought of History either as you know some kind of descend from a golden age or some people had a cyclical view but it was all in terms of political organization that would be great all these kind of the pieces moving around right with no new pieces for the entering or if I did it was at such a swell right that you didn't notice but over the eons slowly turns and you know somebody makes it slightly better we owe somebody figures out how to irrigate crops and population Dothan Creedmoor ideas at the Quicken or threat. If you get this Industrial Revolution and that's where we are now Elon Musk had the most terrifying description of humanity said that we are the biological Bootloader for artificial intelligence that what that's what we're here for like objectively if you were outside of the human race and you were looking at all these various life forms competing on this planet for for resources and two for survival you would look at humanity and Hugo will you know clearly that's not it's not finished so it's going to be another version of it like when is this version going to take place is going to take place over millions and millions of years like it has historically when it comes to biological organisms or is it going to invent something that takes over from there and that's the new thing some something that's not based on tissue something is not based on cells it doesn't have the biological limitations we have nor nor does it have all the emotional attachments attachment to things like breeding social dominance hierarchies all those things were no consequence to it doesn't mean anything because it's not biological yeah yeah recite machine intelligence is possible for some reason let's just say I still think that would be very rapid change including biological change and unsought is not going to happen overnight but over a short. Of time cuz I think it would still see quite profound change just from applying and bioscience to to change human capacities one of the Technologies are one of the things that's been discussed her to mitigate the dangers of artificial intelligence is a potential merge some sort of a symbiotic relationship with technology that you see you here discuss like I don't know exactly how elon's neuralink works but it seems like a step in that direction there's some sort of a brain implant that in that interacts with an external device and this all of this increases the bandwidth for available intelligence and knowledge technically hard to improve a normal healthy human beings say cognitive capacity by having the outside of the body so I don't need to have any plans to be able to use Google right because hopefully you could do that even with implants and once you start to look into the details so that's actually look at them papers often you find wild that. The place where it will first become possible to enhance human biological capacities would be through genetic selection which is technologically something very near half dozen or doesn't embryos created during this fertility procedure which is standard reused so rather than just a doctor kind of looking at these embryos and run some genetic test as a predictor and select the one you think is the most desirable attributes and so this could be in terms of how human beings reproduce that we instead of just randomly having sex woman gets pregnant gives birth to a child we don't know what it's going to be what it's going what's going to happen we just hope that it's a good kid instead of that you start looking at the all the various components we can measure to look Beyond clear Stark diseases that is 1 G and is wrong like that increasing rapidly technology I'm very small but that's genomics gets better at deciphering the genetic architecture of complex traits animator technical hurdles really in any way just some small amount of incremental Improvement that's when you talk about doing something with genetics and human beings in selecting selecting for the superior versions and then if everybody starts doing that the ethical concerns when you start discussing that people get very nervous because it started look at their own genetic defects. thinking about all the imperfect people that have actually contributed in some pretty spectacular ways to what our culture is and like but what if everybody has perfect genes would all these things even take place like what are we doing really if we're bypassing nature and we're choosing to select for the traits and the attributes that we find to be the most positive and attractive like what like that had had this ability to kind of lock in there you know more wisdom and then we would get all of these powerful tools but it looks like we're getting the powerful tools before we have really achieved a very high level of the people that are using them or sort of weird we haven't like thing about the the technology that all of us use how many how many pieces of technology to use in a day and how much do you actually understand any of those most people very little understanding of I need two things that use work they put no effort at all into creating those things but yet they've inherited the responsibility of the power that those things possess most of what we need for day-to-day life yet we just use them because they're so many of us and so many people are understanding various parts of all these different things that together collectively we can utilize the intelligence of all these millions of people that have innovated and we with no work whatsoever to go into the Verizon store and pick up the new phone I mean and not just technology but the World Views and political ideas with an empty table chart of thing from the basic principles off what would be the ideal configuration of the state or something like that and get away with it if we have what do I have to work for him then there's no other way in or otherwise it's just no other way and there's no way even like you and I discussing this like discussing the history of this incredible Spike of evolution Innovation rather and Technology it feat it just doesn't feel like anything it feels normal so even though we can intellectualize it even though we can have this conversation talk about what an incredible time work how terrifying it is the things are moving at such an incredibly rapid rate and no one no one's putting the brakes on it no one's thinking about the the potential pros and cons we're just pushing ahead. Nobody my research Yes actually increase I mean when I I got interested in these things in the 90s and it was very much a fringe activity</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> this is one of the things that scares people more than anything is the idea that we're creating something or someone's going to create something that's going to be smarter than us going to replace us is that something we should really be concerned about a person you're afraid to babies how did the big hope well could be solved if we were smarter or if we had somebody on our side who are a lot smarter with better technology and so forth also I think if we wanted Madden with some really Grand future where Humanity or our descendants one day go out and colonize the Universe I think that's likely to happen if it's going to happen at all after we have super intelligence that done develops that technology to make that possible the real question is whether or not we would be able to harness this intelligence or whether it would dominate for bad purposes we have a lot of other Technologies through history so I think there are two challenges we need to meet one wanted to make sure we can align it with human values and then make sure that we together do something better with it than fighting worse or pressing one another I think what what I'm worried about more than anything is that human beings are going to become obsolete that we're going to invent something that's the next stage of evolution I'm really concerned with that I'm really concerned with if we look back on Ancient hominids in Australia I guess just think of some primitive ancestor man we don't want to go back to that like that that's a terrible way to live I'm worried that what we're creating is the next thing I think we don't necessarily want Russian Bots write a lot of room for improvement sure not anything that is different is an improvement so the key would be I think to find some path forward where the best in us can continue to exist and developed it looks nothing like we do not maybe it's not two legged two armed creatures running around with three pounds of thinking about it right and might be something far different what we value is present there and ideally in a much higher degree than in the current well done that could count as a success yeah the idea that were in the state of evolution that we are just like we look at ancient hominids than we are eventually going to become something more advanced or at least more complicated than we are now but what I'm worried is that biological life itself as so many limitations we look at the evolution of Technology if you look at Moore's Law or to display new cell phones if it just released a new iPhone yesterday and I talked about all these incremental increases in the ability to take photographs and wide-angle lenses and night mode and a new chip that works even faster these things does not the word Evolutions incorrect but the innovation of technology so much more rapid than anything we could ever even imagined biologically like if we had a thing they would create if we created instead of artificial intelligence in terms of like some something in a chair for computer if we created a life form a biological life-form but this biological life-form was improving radically every year did even exist I got the iPhone existed in 2007 that's when it was invented if we had something that was 12 years old but all the sudden was infinitely faster and better and smarter and wiser than it was 12 years ago the newest version of it version X1 we would we would suck on Willow before this thing's way smarter than us how many more Generations before this thing thinks that human beings are obsolete faster in like 1890s or bad but still compared to almost all of human history it seems like. Off unprecedented rapid progress right now I am concerned but the more I look at it and go while this is sea it seems inevitable that we're going to run into artificial intelligence but the questions are so open-ended we really don't know when we really don't know what form is going to take and we really don't know what it's going to do to us gate through which we will have to pass at some point all paths that are both possible I need to really great features I think at some point involved the development of greater than human intelligence machine intelligence and salt together as much as we can in whatever. Of time we have before that. Ourselves have some you know intended impact on the world it might also if we are able to get back together a little bit that kind of global political scene a little bit more peace and love in the world would be good or be nice where is the current state of Technology now in regards to artificial intelligence and how far away do you think we are from AGI nearest Aspen lot of excitement way the Deep learning Revolution when it used to be that people thought of a is autistic Savant really good at logic and Counting and memorizing facts but with no no intuition and perception and that have visual insertion saw the whole wide Suite of applications which makes it commercially volleyball at which time drives a lot of investment in it which is now one like how like open the door how you know we think of something that's communicating to us like like a person would and maybe is a little bit colder and doesn't doesn't share our values and has a more pragmatic view of life and death and and things when we think of intelligence though I think intelligence in our mind is almost inexorably connected to all the things that make us human like emotions and and and ambition and these things like the reason why we innovate like we it's not really clear like white we innovate because we enjoy Innovation and because we want to make the world a better place and because you want to fix some problems that we've created and want to solve some limitations of the human body and the environment that we live in but we sort of assumed that intelligence that we create will also have some motivations there is a fairly large class if you want to do anything that has any kind of cognitive or intellectual capacity at all a large passive those would be what we might call agent interact with the world in pursuit of some gold before it starts doing stuff it kind of think what what would I need to do in order to reach this desired State and then recent backwards from that so I think it's a feather natural it's not the only possible cognitive system we could build but it's also not this weird Bazaar special case that you know if you're able to specify the gold something you want to achieve but you don't know how to achieve it a natural way of trying to go by building the system that has this call and he's an agent and then moves around and prices eventually perhaps learn to to solve that tasks do you anticipate different types of artificial intelligence like artificial intelligence that mimics the human emotions like these that do think that people will construct something that's very similar to us in a way that we can interact with the end in common terms or do you think it will be almost like communicating with an alien Southern different scenarios hair I mean I guess my guess is that the first thing that actually achieve superintelligence would not be very human-like possible ways you could try to get to this level of Technology what one would be by trying to reverse-engineer the human brain so that that that seems technically very difficult to do but it wouldn't require in a big theoretical breaks her to do it you could just threw if you had sufficient for good microscopy and large enough computer is sending us elbow grease you couldn't handle it seems to me possible that what will work before we are able to do it that way will be some more soon as I text you that's one of the big questions right whether or not we can locate all the functions of the human brain in the way it functions in in like a mimic it exactly or whether we could have some sort of superior method that achieve the same results that the human brain does in terms of its ability to calculate and reasoning and do multiple tasks at the same time I also think that maybe once you have a sufficient a high level of general or you could use that things that we do different dates cortex is quite limited we rely a lot on earlier neurological structures that we have we have to we have to be guided by motion because we can't just calculate everything out and an instinct than yeah a little bit have you ever had a podcast with him actually had him on his listen to it because he has the worst view of the the the future in terms of artificial intelligence he's terrified of it and when I talked to him terrifies me and Elon Musk is right up there he also has a terrifying view of what artificial intelligence could potentially be what do you say to those guys well I mean I do think that that are these significant risks that will be associated with this transition to the machine intelligence era what actually asked why do different individuals work on AI researcher why do different companies and government funded great scientific Endeavor if you can make the Google search engine 1% better that's going to be worse like a billion dollars send industrialization a few hundred years ago and electricity like it's going to just open up a lot of people make opportunities that you want to be in there where is happy you're a video scared of we were going to do substance agriculture while in the rest of the world is moving on it Groupon our design and create far more sophisticated versions of itself and it'll continue to do that until it's unrecognizable until it reaches literally a god-like potential that septum and I forget what the real numbers were maybe you could tell us but someone is calculated some reputable source of calculated the amount of improvement that sentient artificial intelligence would be able to create inside of a small window of time like if it was allowed to innovate and then make better versions of itself in those better versions of itself or allowed innovate make better versions of itself it's hard when not an exponential increase of intelligence but an explosion where to get father you need like to put in a lot of thinking time to kind of get there what is easier to estimate is it if you just look at the speed cuz that's not a function of the hardwired like you're running it on right so they are we know that there is a lot of room in principle if you look at the physics of computation and you look at what would an optimal arrange physical system I got done it could have arbitrarily large systems like that so from that point of view we we know that that could be things that wouldn't be like a million times faster than the human brain on a lot more memory and stuff like that and then something if it did have a million times more power than the human brain it could create something with a million times more computer computational power than itself it could make wild better versions it could continue to innovate like it when something that we can we say you are it is sentient it is artificial intelligence now please go innovate please go follow the same directive and improve upon your design you think I suck one Milestone when you have maybe an AI That's could do what one human can do but then that's might still be quite a lot of orders of magnitude until it would be equivalent of the whole human species and maybe join got this massive amount of resources Villages using billions of dollars of computers right that's the way we get there then I mean it might take quite a while because you can't easily scale something that you've already spent billions of dollars building some people think the whole thing is blown out of proportion that we're so far away from creating artificial general intelligence it resembles human beings that it's all just vaporware what do you say to those people I mean far away does it have to be in order for us to be rational to ignore it even if it's not going to happen in the next 5 10 20 30 years it might still be wise for in a pool of 7 billion plus people to have some people actually thinking about this out of fun people say I know it's not going to happen for a long time and done by Sue in five years and another person means by a long time 5 years then you know it's more different attitudes rather than different specific beliefs and make sure that there actually is a disagreement what's the evidence that looking at you know who they have some ground for for being very sure about this starting to the history off of Technology prediction is not that great you can find a lot of other examples where even very eminent technology take me to the history off of Technology prediction is not that scraped you can find a lot of other examples where even very eminent technology</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you do while intermittent fasting as much as I can one of the other guys that was on this tour of Israel with me is valter Longo and he's the arguably world's expert on this work great name is that he's an Italian guy I like the coffee he wants to know about what the best periodic fasting protocol is there isn't one we don't know yet we're right on the cusp there hasn't been enough studies but there are few types I go through them in my book so we won't have time to go through all of it but there is the what is it the 18 hours in Africa they feeding you massive meals three times a day but the that's what you want to do be hungry for part of the day or you can go a little more extreme and Skip 2 days but we what's the what's the benefit of being hungry great question and this is what my lab and others figured out in the first few years of the 21st century we figured out that the genes that extend lifespan these are two in genes are activated by being hungry in part by raising NAD levels anime will mimic the effect of so being hungry actually raises your lifespan in some sort of way right so caloric restriction is what we used to talk about a lot if you restrict the calories of a rat was actually discovered back in the early 20th century will make them live up to 30% longer not in an Old State but it prevents them getting old so the right stomach cancer heart disease and all of these are the good things and that was the only thing that we knew up until about 12 10 probably and so we used to think you had had to be hungry all the time and it was a Stihl is a society called the calorie restriction society and they were hungry all the time that very small meals which is pretty tough I tried that and gave up after a week but this new paradigm is that you don't have to always be hungry similar to you don't always have to be on a treadmill you can do it for short time making intense and then you can let your body recover and go back to a normal life and that's great news that means that we can have our cake and eat it too so to speak as long as the cake doesn't have a lot of sugar in it now when you are on this protocol of restricted eating plus metformin when do you take what and when do you exercise and how do you balance it out like what when do you know what to do what I use my body as a guy you know now that I'm 50 I have a pretty good the measuring it a ring that matches my pulse in my sleep is that the aura yeah yeah isn't Kevin Rose a part of that company is that it yeah interesting stores in the internet always finding cool weird videos and just fascinating science stories human nature human interest stories sounds good today tell the time occasionally but yet I want useful with it is pulse and activity and if I haven't moved enough during the day I've got a standing desk and that's been helpful to like move around a little bit more but mainly it's and also do the occasional blood tests to make sure that my body is optimized it's best I can personalized and you did you read the data off your watch like how do you read it what would application are you using nothing don't just do my phone have a look okay so you just have a look like what your resting heart rate is how much activity how far you walking how many calories you're burning deck ideal yeah yeah pretty simple and I'm happy to say my resting heart rates really low which means things are going okay so far for me even though I don't do enough exercise as you rightly point out they might resting heart rate 46 are you walking how many calories you're burning deck ideal yeah yeah pretty simple and I'm happy to say my resting heart rates really low which means you know things are going okay so far for me even though I don't do enough exercise as you rightly point out they might resting heart rate 46</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you have any high hopes for things like crisper things where there's going to be genetic alterations and they are starting to do some experience with a big smile on your face right now so I'll let you talk tell me what's up well and I'm a big believer crispr is an acronym for basically a system that is from bacteria that they used to kill and destroy the DNA of invading organisms like a virus but we can now use that system to cut and change our own genomes it basically a a DNA cutting enzyme that doesn't cut randomly you can give it a barcode in the form of what's going to RNA molecule weather in Cabo cut in the genome what site you Joe Rogan have terrible Gene that's causing heart disease we take this crispr system we say he is what you need to go to cut we can tell the enzyme to go and cut it put into your cells it'll go cut it and destroy that enzyme and delete it and you can also use it to cut the gym and insert New pieces so you can both subtract and add DNA at will now not just randomly but wasn't you can tell it where to go and that's the big breakthrough and they're doing some experiments on human beings I know there was something that they were doing believe the somewhere in Asia for remember correctly I believe is China where they had done some manipulation two people to help prevent AIDS and in the process of doing so they may have boosted intelligence or the potential for intelligence which was so convoluted that my puny little brain can't understand the study I was supposed to go over the same paragraph like four or five times just try to figure out what the f*** they were saying am I making any sense yeah you are you are and that was a study that has been published but it's being reported that he is his last name is he he took them to delete ccr5 Gene which is required for HIV to infect cells that was most of us scientists think that was Reckless for the fact that HIV is a huge risk in China One in a thousand chance of getting HIV there plenty all the thing other things they that you could do that could be more helpful website why don't you take copious canine to prevent heart disease which would probably have to 50% to kill the boys but boy it wasn't the most risk-benefit ratio modification that's one thing the other is we don't know what happens when you cut jeans and embryos does it have changes to the DNA did it accelerate the Raging it mess without the jeans get caught in other places and screw out those jeans we don't know that yet and so that's why the scientific Community had a negative reaction to it but what's interesting is that the scientific community and the Press has pretty much gone quiet on this imagine if this happened during the bush era week we have protested the love the place to be outlawed and that hasn't happened I think it's because we live in a world with a 24-hour news cycle what is that also because it's being if it wasn't during the bush world I mean the protesters really take place if it was done here the thing about things are done in China or overseas like huh like it's so far away like wild keep an eye on them and I guess that's true that some country can an engineer Army of Two are there genes that predispose you to to long life we could make Offspring a family that would potentially live a lot longer but is this something that can only be manipulated in embryos or in fetuses now we can do it in adults actually rugs that are in development to actually correction attic diseases such as vision loss real print on a laptop I need glasses to read my laptop so we just put up a study online on a psycho by walk I've anyone can go there and see it just Google my name and bio b i o r v e reason that interesting is that what we're showing is in mice at least we can reverse the age of the retina and restore the vision of old mice what do I have to do well come on man I lose your job are you going to let me Crack those kind of jokes sorry I was joking I know it's not his fault available to the general public any time in our lifetime and what would you do adding factors also known as yamanaka factors that are named after this Japanese fellow who won the Nobel Prize in 2012 these factors I used all over the world even probably in in high schools to reprogram skin cells other cells to be in stem cells cells can be used to make you all guns are you blood cells but what people hadn't tried until recently was can you do this in a living animal or we just going to mess it up is that if you do it the wrong way you mess up the animal and it'll die but weave sew-in for the first time in this paper is you can do it in a Safeway and normally that reverse the clock make the cells young and restore how they work and get back vision and what's the methodology right quick question so that the current method is using a virus that's on the market these are called you put them in the eye there already patients getting this real yes spark Therapeutics is an example of a company that is curing genetic diseases in the eye with viruses were in the new world most people don't know about it now so what is the company again Tammy look up the spark genetic engineering so these folks are already doing this to people so is this for people that are sort of desperate and they'll try something experimental right well there insensitive no other throwing up no other cure diseases someone was just treated and cured of sickle cell anemia that's phenomenal and you know I learned that that comes from malaria right that was the idea that people were the resistance to malaria was that trait from people that evolved in the area where they would get malaria was also what led to people getting sickle-cell correct correct sold it I learned from Tiffany haddish by the way Tiffany Tiffany. Luxturna stuff is this something that someone like me to take right now no not easily you talk to would need to prescribe it and so if you did was grab it I could literally get Vision back while this is not the same technology that I'm talking about it for my lasses inherited retinal diseases are commitment to our die RDS this is Gene replacement not reprogramming a body to be young but it's the same virus that would to correct so they're using this for certain retinal diseases or the correcting it know what how is this bacteria fixing your vision with a virus is a jazz bar age to get the jeans into the cells that's all and that these are but then on viruses they don't hurt you but they are carrier and it maybe eventually we'll have all the way to do this the right now the virus is the best way and in the mice to restore the vision we have this 3 Gene combination of these young baccarat programming jeans we put them into the eye and then we turn them on with a drug in fact the same drug that I took when I was in Africa called doxycycline is the same drug we can feed to them I turned on the reprogramming jeans for a few weeks restore their Vision back to a young Mouse and then we just take away the doxycycline an antibiotic and mice have the vision back and how long does it take for it starts deteriorating but don't know yet. back those young guys again so you might have a hole full cycle from like 20 or 10 to 40 years old again that's the future that you'll get a delivery of this virus you'll take the antibiotic for a few weeks be fully rejuvenated and the doctor says come back in a couple of decades will fix you again I will give you some antibiotic in a couple of tickets but then it gets really weird if you have a few engineer your children to have your system if that ever happens with matching a coup we could do this right now with technology and you have people engineered to be able to be reversed in their age or let's say they have an accident and your optic nerve gets damaged or did they lose their hearing from a bomb or something that spinal injury give him a dose of IV of antibiotics and they become just like an embryo they can rejuvenate they can regrow their optic nerve regrowth eisbein fixed back back like new division you going to see that's going to be available to the general public also suck I'm an entrepreneur as we discussed before and also one of the companies that I've started is exactly that raise money to be able to make as far as we're making it now takes a few million box and we'll hopefully with the fda's approval injected into people's eyes no first one just beat guys like you first of all we have to go into an area where it's FDA approval which is a disease like glaucoma is pressure in the eye for macular degeneration that's our first gold benefits safe why not do old eyes yeah well yeah you could theoretically put it into the spinal cord or give a given IV the people died injuries oh for sure it's one of the things we also did in this paper that we put on line is we pinch the optic nerve and what normally happens is it just degrades I mean Norristown car back right unless your baby play the human but we made those so so young that the optic nerve crew back to the brain first time that's being able I know a guy from fighting he's got a detached retina detached how bad this is Vision in his right eyes extremely poor shout out to Michael Bisping do you think that that's something that inside of his lifetime they could see something the use of this technology that can regenerate his I well-nigh get get a lot of emails really trying promise anything I what I what I think is possible is that initially will be used for disease a chronic disease then it'll be used for injuries like like that but fresh injuries I think it's probably work better if it's fresh I don't know what is Technologies going I can imagine a lot we can all imagine that you could get Vision back and people walking again but that's what is Technologies going to Discovery in the book as a what what happened while I was riding brighten a remarkable and so I wrote them down in the book as we went along so people can see how it feels to be a scientist to make these discoveries I'll bet it's only been a year or less that we've known about this so imagine 50 years from now what we can do even 10:30 a remarkable future it's very exciting know what kind of a timeline are you anticipating for bringing this to you know people with injuries will injuries already we have a study plan for spinal injury in mi and that will probably know the results in less than a year and then we could go as fast as the FDA allows us going to a clinical trial now is the same scenario applicable for people Spiner and spinal injuries as Vision like people that have but more recent spinal injury will be more likely candidates than people that have had older spinal injuries I think so that would just be my guess that it's easier to fix a recent recently damaged system anything in the body that's fresh but rule out anything when we when we first discovered this the experiment was to have a fresh injury the pinching of the optic nerve but then I said to my student what you just try almost anything come on old man as you kidding me how's that going to work just try it just try it so we did it and in collaboration with another Lab at Harvard the experts and so bruised Cassandra's is named the Bruce call me Professor 10:30 at night just got off the plane he said David you won't believe it I didn't believe it I just looked at the date it freaking worked old my singing again cuz I don't want to go down to the FDA and tell him about it cuz right now I diseases typically all you can do is slow them down and he is actually reversal of loss function does this apply to injuries as well do believe old injuries or just old macular degeneration we haven't tried all the injuries and now we've done glaucoma which is an old injury theoretically what we could do is at least with the existing knows if they still attached we should be what we could do is at least with the existing knows if they still attached we should be able to rejuvenate those make them work better cuz he has some vision is so yeah so that's possible that that makes more sense but very little very limited in one eye yeah well we'll have to see</div>

So Christopher darden's out there helping people whenever gross just a mean I don't think you should you know we should somehow or another find out whether there's a way to test if this raw milk is fresh enough for people to eat but if it is people live on farms have been drinking raw milk since the beginning of time it's normal and healthy taste better it's it's way easier for you to digest like I get a little weird when I drink like straight like that milk and cookies which I love it here and I'm thinking about it the cookies might be with messing with my I don't think so though cuz you get this feeling from the middle of the fight both you know what that is and then I was fat right there bread is better they have bread that is not from their Vera did they don't have modern wheat so the week that they have is not engineered to have more complex glutens and higher yield like we do</div>

And we praise this down to a single genetic pathway that we work on these or two and I talked about these NAD response immune to eating shittyfood like the negative aspects of using shittyfood yeah that was safe and could mimic the effects of fasting prescription without actually having to be hungry wow and what time do SRI given these mice with equivalent of about 250 mg a day and a human Okay so is 1/4 of what you recommend people take right I don't recommend people take anything but okay what you take required to have an even better effect on longevity but the results are bright clear when we opened up these mice maybe I should have said that when We examined carefully put them to sleep for scientific purposes it was clear that they they were healthier fat that was interesting but their arteries were cleaned that lives were like a healthy lean young Mouse and when we looked at their results of bright clear when we open up these mice maybe I should have said that when We examined carefully put them put them to sleep for scientific purposes it was clear that they they were healthier now that was still fat that was interesting but their arteries were cleaned that lives were like a healthy lean young Mouse and when we looked at their metabolism it was like a younger Mouse</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I have a question for you right off the bat regarding metformin it was actually an article I'm sure you saw it recently like within the last couple of days that was going around through all the mainstream papers it was talking about how the use of Metformin DHEA and what was there something else as well that was taking two years human growth hormone taking 2 years to biological years off of people's lives it turns of their their age with your natural I'm 52 would make me 50 right eating 49.5 athletes or did you get like schmohz that don't exercise super bodies you know about that study is. I was with the first paper Israel part of my journey up the Great Rift of Africa is aging truly reversible is that it's not just about slowing down aging but one day we could be 80 but biologically 3 now when we're talking about the biological age how is that measured this is measured by the length of the telomeres is measured by physical performance is it measured by a combination of these factors it's none of that something brand new and you don't just look at the letters actg if you look at what's on the letter c sizings called their chemical modifications and those chemicals change as we get older in very linear and predictable ways and you use a computer AI you can say if I took your blood right now I could read your DNA look at those chemical groups on the Seas and I could say you are okay 52 you might be 46 according to that clock predict when you going to die like a fortune-teller yeah but the good news is we know we know what's not just measuring I can wait we think that clock is part of the aging process with learning how to reverse it too is this just one modality this this combination of growth hormone this one way of going about it are there other ways of going about it growth hormone DHEA metformin is there anything well that's the first that event rental close three things being used widely but I think as we use this clock we're going to figure out that whole bunch of stuff that we do and things that we can do and combine will not to slow eating but reverse it and not just buy two and a half years eventually and some of the technology that I talked about in my book waiting could turn the clock back by a decade or more hello know what things are you talkin about that could possibly turn it back a decade or more wealth and who do I have to blow sorry yeah you can blame me but you may have to do it a few times but the amazing thing about where we are now today with agent and we're right on The Cutting Edge so it's great to be able to share this with you this clock what I'm saying my Theory of Aging is that it's not the DNA that we lose that's the old Theory you know the old idea that antioxidants hurt the DS just throw that out for a while maybe forever what I think is going on is it the DNA is getting modified and the cell, read the DNA the way it used to that's really important and so the clock is not just a clock on the wall it's also if you move the hands on the clock time changes that's what I think is going on we pause right here for a moment and explain what you were saying about antioxidants well antitoxin Sabine biggest disappointment in the Aging field doesn't stop 40 million people everyday buying drinks with antioxidants in them but antioxidants have with very few exceptions failed to extend the life span of any organism but you are a proponent of Resveratrol at least you used to be are you still I still take it and we still study at but what's you brought this up it's really important was originally thought to be an antioxidant and it is a mild antioxidant but the way it really works we know this is a fact from my lab is that it's stimulating the body's defenses against aging and disease because it's binding to these enzymes that we were conco sirtuins and these are the Defenders of the body and you were saying that if I remember correctly you take Resveratrol you take a powdered form actually bought exact Wichita and you mix it with yogurt in the mornings that is how you do it what's it what's the dose that you take while probably comes out to about a gram in a gram okay so someone's taking capsules what pens are probably capsules 250mg is it important to take it with fats is that why you take it with yogurt yeah yeah either high protein which is Greek yogurt devices or fact but water is like brake dust it won't dissolve in a glass of whole milk maybe it barely got in and I meant so but nmn is also effective well let's building a little bit please if you read the paper and I have turned out one of the effects of his treatment was the reduction in the levels of a protein called cd38 cd38 resides on immune cells and it goes up as we get older and what they found one of the biggest effects of the treatment was the levels of this city 38 protein went down so what is the CD 48 this is the main enzyme in our bodies that degrades NAD NAD is required for the sirtuin Defenders to work so one possibility is that and I'm sure it's complicated but one way this could be working is by allowing your body to make an AT&amp;T store it rather than degrading as we get older interesting so would supplementing with any men which is a form of NAD correct precursor would that enhance the effects do you believe like if they try to do a new study it could could it could cost $10,000 for the entirety of the treatment and the treatment lasts how long I don't remember how long they traded the patience for but I do know that it wasn't cheap that's why they only did nine Horvath nine patients you kidding me why didn't you do 50 and I went well we didn't have the money that's the point really is that we need to test a lot of different combinations include anime and include this one for my sandwich is a little bit more risky and toxic but there are better molecules in development the question is what is the best combination and do you use it with exercise and fasting or is it bad to combine them all together we don't know yet that's a good question to that I wanted to ask you because one of things it came out of the podcast was input from some other people that I know that our nutrition experts and performance experts that were skeptical about metformin and they were saying that metformin although it may have an anti aging affect and actually decreases physical performance in athletes will that there was a study that shows that was very cool to actually real that can prevent the great gains from hot excite so he's the solution that I think is worth trying a solution and that is a theme that I have in my book in my on my research and that is we don't want to be doing everything everyday necessarily we want a pulse that we want to shock the body and let it recover we know that you got to text size I mean some people have been on the show run a hundred miles of free every weekend but generally you want to hit hard and let it recover and that way I think my body can have the best of both worlds so when you are not exercising and you take it you feel like it doesn't have a hit when you are exercising and not taking it so it somehow or another whatever performance headed has its temporary yeah right so this is all just theoretical right on The Cutting Edge of human knowledge but my guess is that we want to allow the body to recover so I don't take my phone on those days rather than taking metformin everyday like a diabetic would know what what is the what's that hit like what is happening with the mechanism behind the performance hit from taking metformin all we don't know but I can tell you the best explanation that I can give you some at Forman is a derivative a plant molecule the French lilac so it's not crazy molecules Pretty Natural but what it does is many things in the body scientist will quite annoyingly argue about it for first they have to lock past 40 years so there's no correct answer but what I think is going on is that my foreman is interfering with the mitochondria mitochondria in the cell mitochondria become a battery packs they basically making chemical energy without that chemical energy would be dead in about 20 seconds we need that for life-form it interrupts that energy production in the mitochondria but you need the mitochondria to amplify after you've exercised so it they're antagonizing each other so why does metformin work by inhibiting the mitochondria the body gets a signal that doesn't have enough chemical energy not making enough so it expands the number of mitochondria these are ancient remnants of bacteria that enter themselves and we have less if we sit around and like we are now we have more fixed size and Metformin by telling the body s*** we're running out of energy the body respond to make more mitochondria metformin and exercising that inhibition is preventing the benefit somehow of what you get with exercise your house so I like what what did the study or what studies have been done and what did they reveal I don't know the precise details to study it was it was giving metformin everyday to people who were in a controlled exercise I think we treadmill a few times a week and what they measured was the mitochondrial benefit now that so confusing if there's a mitochondrial benefit butter performance hit well know that actually metformin prevented the mitochondria from amplifying up it must be interfering with the signal that you get from exercise what if that is we don't know exactly what that is so you really have to be some sort of a guinea pig with this stuff to go back and forth from taking it and exercising not taking it well know that actually metformin prevented the mitochondria from amplifying up it must be interfering with the signal that you get from exercise what if that is we don't know exactly what that is so you really have to be some sort of a guinea pig try to f*** with this stuff to go back and forth from taking it and exercising not taking it one of those guinea pigs</div>

look real like like like that thing exist on this planet and was just like witches walking around free that you could just bump into that I understand you know like when people first came out here and they eradicated that's along the lines I mean look at that how many pull-ups do you need to do to f*** it look like that oh my God look at the f****** muscles the guy like he had nerve damage in his f****** arm didn't work oh yeah for sure yeah I mean there's a great video recent video like 2 weeks ago of these guys on a motorcycle in India and the right of the most of them are almost got them it's full clip Jason and I actually looked how fast they can run and I'm surprised because I was only a scooter or something and then going 40 miles an hour we're tigers hunt people has a history of them hunting people they Hunter they come upon you know they hunt them under bands in the sunderbans Tigers over the last 200 years of killed more than 300,000 people there they actively get elbow quick death, yeah I already know what I would ever do if I ever came in contact with the tiger just exactly what it makes some defensive moves like our offensive moves just to get a title right towards it choked out then knocked out it's the same thing you just go to sleep yeah you just sleep I mean it probably hurts for a second and then it's over I think the last thing it's as bad as the smell of the tiger all the Press we were I think Jamie rotten meat breath or just affected they found their clothes where was this which rainforest I don't know so I can write in your right up your f****** Ali's to I was surprised it wasn't on your Instagram like that's such that's like I have had some Rogan s*** right there that's a bummer man when people get confused and they don't understand

Eagles and South America and it is zipline tour in the in Costa Rica just kind of looked around a little bit and Minnie f****** heart attack we did a zip line that was one mile you get on it you use

		<div class="paragraph"> favorite quote from Tarantino you don't I mean there's no sense just going in and showing your ass and being you know it's a private gig and they go okay perform between these two lines you not Lenny Bruce if you go in there and you go outside of your f****** a****** right cuz you agreed to do that right you do a corporate gig or Christian church right but if you're at a comedy club it's like you're a guest you came into a nightclub people to get upset while you're the problem the other people are there to see this kind of s*** isn't so rarely selfish maybe like I went to a restaurant and I didn't like the meal and then the chef owed me an apology and had to change his menu and you didn't want anybody else to eat stop I hate this food and if you go in there and eat off of that menu then you're part of the f****** problem and I'm going to try to take you down to cuz you didn't have a problem with this f****** chicken and dumplings which of the strange strange best name special I feel well I didn't know what else to call it just that's all I could think of yeah I like it because it's not it's not you not punching him in the nuts you just said strange so weird time how long do you think you're going to wait until you do another one you have a set schedule because I take the enjoyment out of it it's like more like I had a bit that I was doing the first time I told the story and my new our two women like yelled out simultaneously and they yelled the same thing which means they whisper to each other let's yell this in 321 and I got out go fuckyourself I got into that with them and then they went upstairs and I'm like the comedy club I know they're still there because, Club security is the worst it's the worst they just they just they they don't know how to kick people out so I went upstairs I had to put the hoodie up and all of that s*** they said they were at the bar I walked by and then I go outside the club took the hoodie up and then they were there and then we got into it again and I was just like you don't even know me go fuc yourself so it had to do while with a lesbian so that in and it was still wrong show to do it on cuz I think it was kind of a gay show I mean I went up there they had paper cutouts of dicks all over the place so I'm like I what's the comedy club so I'm telling I'm telling the story I want to tell so I told a story you know so it took me a little while you know the kind of so I've just been you know working they been out working a bit out and then like you know I did the joke the other night at the Laugh Factory in the exact person from that group came up to me told me she loved the joke and she's just like I feel like he would describe in my life and I'm like that's why that's the fun of this s*** and you know it's people say I can't do it at home I have to go out there and just start throwing it against the wall and see how Easter stuff together so to go back to like when are you going to do a special again like I enjoy this part too much to be thinking about like you know then you're like okay I'm doing a special I'm taping it here and then I'm in the bubble and then every night I go on stage and it's just like okay and then I got to do this and made me what if I open with this opposite reason the entire reason why I got into this business was nothing real job I want to have fun so this which is goes back to what I was talking about you and I was watching you on the other side he shot his special and now he's going down and it's much as it can be frustrating putting it together he's having fun every night seeing all right choices idea going to go just going to leave it like when I put a new our like I have some of that shitt ever and I take all the house rules and throw them out the window I don't give a f*** if you see me doing these jokes and most of them don't live but some of them grow into something better yeah and then it's not hockey and now it's this this thing that then shoots off into this and then you just start spinning off over here when people go down there and it's literally like it's not even done you just starting to draw and they're reacting to it's saying it sucks and it's like it's not done I'm just agree with you it sucks yeah yeah I'm with you but some people know that some people understand that some people think they're come and see if most people most people now today in 2019 and it's because there's so much s*** to look at controversy gets people to stop at your website and then you get credit from the advertisers in the side and then they big gas up s*** and they say they need internet hates me but I walk down the street and everybody loves me so it's just like so what is what's really going on that's what's going on is is the small that percentage that don't like you is being shown to be the majority you know it's a very vocal minority to get upset about things and they're very they're adamant about it and they're very active that's what it is the people that are upset about certain things people that are the really responding to operate a culture if they turn around and then do trying to find their Justice and they just I don't know the irony seems to be lost on these people but like I don't talk about I try not to talk that s*** a lot because I don't want to give it any more added weight than it deserves and it's just like people bring it up I just say we do not have a reason to like me yeah I don't know what to tell you I don't need everybody like I just need enough people to fill up enough of wherever I'm playing so I can continue doing this it deserves and it's just like people bring it up I just say we do not have a reason to like me I don't know what to tell you I don't need everybody like I just need enough people to fill up enough of wherever I'm playing so I can continue doing this</div>

No f****** discussion whatsoever we see you and I don't have to do that but we wouldn't anyway we just come in here and shoot the s*** that's all they ever did come on in shoot the s*** what the f*** is going on you know Anthony never gone on a book did Jerry undo that guy know I can't do it you know the giant is when they get that voice you know in the morning do you have any Anthony did live from the compound he did he build a studio in his that's when I was like going this is not going to last this guy's Woodley building it's just like business selling ice cream and I'm building my own ice cream parlor at home like bus go round and round cuz it was just like anything but you were on the bus but you were outside if you want to hang it was you almost like I always felt like when I went in there that Raiders of the Lost Ark you know when Harrison Ford's on the hood and you're grabbing under the photo damage threw up in the UK was your idea and then that dude's and Nathaniel came he was the one that pointed the baby by got credit for some reason I think bands voice sounded like me he came he came out I was your idea you were like the only thing they could top this for those who didn't see it it's such a brilliant idea it was the eggnog drinking contest and you had to do a dub shot like was bourbon but it was eggnog like every 30 seconds will Panda returning Champion was Pat from Moonachie who had diabetes and lots of total it already it was just sitting there and then he continued drinking that you came up with I need to get into the Sports Hall of Fame just because the game 8 heat like you know because of what he added to it I always thought that Pat Moonachie should have been like they should have been like like like a chick Hearn Johnny most sort of award that he f****** continue with his his health continued to drink I remember when when people posted that video everyone was saying fake this isn't real everywhere all over the ground cuz they knew the people going to throw out they had the garbage can ready and then Pat Duffy leaned his head over the edge of the garbage can and then Pat from Moonachie just here, you see him and then it keep coming it keeps coming is like way crazier I start gagging I'll see Fear Factor killed all that in me I never tell the one that makes me gag I start to gag is when there was the dude he puked into a picture and then he was drinking his own puke trying to make the other people puke so then somebody dared this guy who had to take a swig from it and he had like this hipster Viking level beard and and if it was in his beard disappointing that podcast and in that pocket in that shower I almost puke yeah that's a crazy thing about seeing everyone people shoot you were in the moment and I had you know I just sitting in my room smoking a cigar with the Bobby Kelly Rick Talia you know from fossil hunting right and we were sitting and I was looking down at the strip before they came over and I was thinking about the first time I came out there was right before they imploded the Sands of the dunes or something new starting implode those old ones and just walking up and down the strip in the Rio is the new hot one casino and just all great f****** times that I am crazy f****** stories and all that and then just walking around Vegas being old now and seeing all these young people like and you want to stop and just be like dude if you could this anyway to take this in do it because you know it my age if I was to continue doing that you just a creep respect younger people wear their time let them have it that's their Club don't be standing in there with you listen trying to listen to that DJ music to get the f*** out of that let them enjoy their Generations drugs and let them have their f****** stories and just yeah there's no way you could impart that on anyone though tell them to soak it up and enjoy it I had moments remember thinking when I was young like a wild moment Caroline's you are Caroline and I went down there and manufacturer I was just like I told the whole f****** story I came home it just started living with me and her friend was there and I was telling the story of what I saw that day and I was laying on the ground crying laughing telling him and then this guy did this remember the guy who was f****** he would do is shot and when anybody would puke he would Yuki would stand over in the corner and not FaceTime use face in the corner so we started calling him Blair Witch even funnier than me and then I just remember a friend at one point just was like she was like</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> well that's the thing you know what I was in New York all summer and I was all those the up-and-coming rappers are like trying to hand you see this is what am I going to do with that they still have CDs then they do something then they just click on this to scan this and it goes to like Vimeo page and then Mike is this guy in my phone now like what just happened is he all my contacts yet so I just kind of steer clear to them I get weirded out by those little cute and things do they call them is a cute cute QR code QR code I get weirded out by those things because you camera goes on it and then boom it opens up a website and like what is happening here I'll tell it's a weird one is they have home security systems now where I was reading an ad for this on my podcast and that I was thinking like afterwards like like a lot of times home I guess alarm goes off window blows open and everybody f****** shows up and it's like a video camera so they can confirm that somebody is in your house but then I'm thinking like what what's to stop them from just turn that on and start watching your life like a show nothing but fighting again will for sure if it's possible for someone to do that for sure if there's a strange contracted says we would never do that okay yeah yeah yeah I met as long as it just using it to catch the bad guys which is going to be what they're saying but there's this going to be somebody somebody has their dick in their hand right now obsessed like M&amp;M you jerking off just to the woman walking up to the door to go into her house and it's not enough hey would you be interested in furthering your security enough interesting you say that we just had a case the other day one fortunately she thought it was enough and it wasn't really and then sells and that now he's watching her eating cornflakes it's a slow creep into your life how much time before it's everywhere before everyone can see everyone everywhere I don't know different idea of privacy it is kind of been out there I would not want to be young right now they have a real tough time where do when I was younger when I got my ass kicked it was over it wasn't video documentation for the rest of my life this is the kid from Rocky Point he's all grown up now you trying to get laid in a bar like 20 years later you yes that happened I was sorry send the kid just climbed off him and walk towards his friends and everybody's like probably experiencing severe brain damage and I'm thinking what if that was my son has your son some guys slamming his head and then he's unconscious punch them five six seven times in the face I thought you want to be that guy I was like baby fat tough until like f****** 6th grade and then I sort of leaned out and 11 to get funny and then that's when people started to learn how to fight and there was blood and s*** and I remember there was this dude I think I got up the kid got off the bus he was f****** Jack the other kid was kind of Baby Huey big guy but the other kid got off the bus first he just jumped him and then just sat on his chest it and it was it was like didn't come to school for a week then came back this why Tommy came back to school most of the swelling come down but he almost look like a he was a cousin it wasn't him yeah and I was just like I don't want that to happen to me so that's why the darkest things I've ever heard anybody say about a fight khabib nurmagomedov said about Conor McGregor I want to change his face out there like that that are like that you don't want to be underneath the all of that they just kept getting worse the older I got that sound of somebody's head hitting the floor the worst is WorldstarHipHop videos where will the worst one I ever saw was this guy was drunk and he was talking s*** and one guy knocked him out and then when he's out called lying down everybody took shots at them I mean everybody in the street people were kicking him in the head with running up to him and kicking him like a soccer ball punch them in the face I mean like s*** and one guy knocked him out and then when he's out cold lying down everybody took shots at them I mean everybody in the street people were kicking him in the head with running up to him and kicking him like a soccer ball punch them in the face I mean like 10-15 people doing it just running up to a boom kicking a running up punching them</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I want to do it anymore and even saying that sounded crazy to me she was like she was just real quiet I'm thinking about you not saying nothing I like I don't think I'm going to do this anymore and she said something she'd never said previously to wish you liked by it look not Time come on you got to get up I know you feel this way I know your Bible come on I feel like you still got time enough for first time she ever agree with me she was like I think the decision is already made ray connect you throughout this whole day and some of the stuff you've been saying and I've never really seen you like this she said I think it's already made I took that out bro by the making phone calls call call my lawyer who's my good friend Josh Dubin April I think that maybe if he had been wanting me to be you know. He's like if you feel that way but I'mma support you call my manager the next morning and it took us so I went I went I went that weekend call the fight we held off on the announcement and my little just told us you look he's going through some things we're good give us a couple of days so I got you that weekend and he said you still feel like that come Monday morning but but I think I'm done long story short we ended up announcing it September 21st is like a two-week. We're trying to keep it under wraps and doing all the stuff I was letting the necessary people know Roc Nation HBO everybody know and the night before I announced him and me and my good friend who's the director he's also directed mydoc Deonte Thompson he video is like a legacy video where I had my young son my middle son of my oldest son and those are like those are like you know that was me at that point time in my career and we did this whole video that I was going to announce my retirement with and and actually have the doc that I'm working on right now is about this like why did the best Fighters tour of the world at that time walk away from this point on Top Shot the video I'm in the damn my retirement bro and the response was just overwhelming you know it was over when I got just couldn't believe amount of people that were reaching out and it was it was like good and bad like it was good cuz I was getting support but it felt like somebody died like I felt like I died and it was overwhelming and in the two years that followed like I said it at the beginning of this podcast harder than I thought it was going to be one of the hardest if not the hardest thing I've ever tried it had to do and still like I still have to do like it's a daily decision if you're not doing it no more the one of the most rewarding man and it was a necessary evil and I hope that one day man the young guys can look up one dancing and imma do the laundry Wars and turn that you know that that's all you worried about something and all of a sudden that gets resolved I just makes room for the next thing to kind of fill that void because our brain is developed a brain that it has a certain kind of set point for everything it's doing and that just makes room for you to feel that if you're an anxious person probably will always be somewhat anxious no magic bullet that's going to take that out what you have to do is attack the process from knowledge of how it all works and that requires that we have a more sophisticated understanding that one then it's possible from Simply observing Behavior because Behavior does not tell you necessarily what's on the Mind Behavior tells you how the the the brain has responded but you know just to go back to the Fear 3 example when I say I bring you into the laboratory show you a picture of something like a a blue square on my colleague list fell to used to be that damn lie use now at Harvard did experiments like this every time the blue square would come on the person to get a mild shock to their finger and so then she would present the blue square subliminally that means you really quickly with the in the fall of the kind of mastiff and that prevents the information from getting into the conscious mind and tell the person so that I didn't see anything but if you put the person in an Imaging machine fmri and image what's happening that stimulus that threat the blue square gets to the amygdala turned it on the heart begins to race Palms are sweating but the person has no fear the person doesn't know it's there and doesn't experience fear the amygdala is not about fear it's about detecting and responding to danger in order to be afraid that has to reach your conscious mind so that you can experience it as a state of this automatic Consciousness that we're talking about a selfie of Consciousness that's hard for people to separate and that that's why you can't understand that's why the medications are not working they're targeted to work on these underlying systems in rats and mice but that's not where we are experiencing are anxiety and then he just starts playing at his face and then all his friends are atoms are pointing at him and the whole place was just staring and waiting and watching and wondering what the hell's going to happen so I can take them we filmed it before is it free Instagram put up on YouTube it's like I do is ever show this is incredible and then six months later people started coming out with cake me signs 6 years later so 6 years later like I think I've kicked over 15000 people now you know wipe it up a little bit more time this is like Ultra specific cakes that aren't you know at our she'll give us this is a special Aoki cake what is the strange thing is there's there's like not as much cake as you would think this is like frosting it just sort of explodes everywhere so it's less bread yes just so like less carbs more sugar forget all the front row please crazy thing for people to enjoy to get caked in the face the Signature Bar the show is fun it's exciting they close it off to the public knew it got 0% on Rotten Tomatoes they've been open to the public and it got 99% of course if Dad doesn't show a crazy disparity between first of all the idea that you're going to suppress it like you're going to say 0% of no one's going to watch it and we're going to shut Dave Chappelle. He's canceled knock him but people love him you can't cancel someone who doesn't care what you can't Dave Chappelle you can but on top of that like how would they not understand that someone is going to know that you're not opening it up to the public and that once it does get open to public you're going to get a massive Whiplash I'm backlash for people going to come and even if they didn't want to vote on it now they do another going to give it 100% or 99% I knew I had to watch it when I saw how all the media channel many of the media channels that I really dislike and do not respect we're coming so hard at it and saying all now you don't need to watch it and all this other that means I absolutely have to watch it the guardian gate in the UK give it one star and then I saw her by saying like don't watch it Rock saying don't want Elsa okay this is this means that I have to watch this is going to be good small group of relatively small group of human beings that are in charge of these media conglomerates is sounding that they it's not just opinion right it's like they're they're trying to get people to behave and think the way they do it's not just yes it is activism and it's it's also it's undisguised activism it's very transparent activism it supposed to journalism I really wish there was a place where we could go we we can get 100% unbiased info the news and we can get an honest perspective of both sides this I believe this and this is why they believe that but this I believe that this is why they believe that it's very hard to do and if you have a podcast one thinks it's really interesting is if you even talk to someone who has an opposing point of view of yours or who is right wing or who it maybe have some questionable ideas you are somehow platforming them and supporting their idea and supporting some alt right ideology in because this is not an representation of reality and anything that deviates from reality is reality that his filter through your senses and I think art at its highest is exactly that if this was an exact depiction of reality it would be a photograph and I don't need the artist that take you to a slightly other kind of Dimension as you gaze upon them it's more than what is actually going on at the time and that's that's are taken to the craft of Photography very first painting where its title is the background think about that this could have been called the full painting it could have been called Rolling Hills but no it's called starry night and everything and run of it everything in front of it is just in the way and how often do you paint something where the title is the background that that's my point and in this particular case the background is the universe and soap so for me this was a pivot point in art and it's a 1889 which is recent given the history of paintings and on way back so yeah they have to say yes it's not what are you doing for this painting on them in different ways how weird so the town is realistically depicted the trees or recognizable trees if you ever saw a sky that looks like that the end would be here exactly it's how we felt that's all I can tell you by the way that's he's a real evening so that's sorry it's not even his early-morning the crescent moon when it's that orientation means this is Before Sunrise and that white object lower on the horizon that sort of glowy that's very likely Venus and that enables us to trace what's over what's Ed weeks this painting was actually painted it's early morning the crescent moon when it's that orientation means this is Before Sunrise and that white object lower on the horizon that sort of glowing that's very likely Venus and that enables us to trace what's over what's said weeks this painting was actually painting</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> champ belt belt I feel like they're Nate needs too much money it's just too much how management pieces it's worth money will Dino Dana said something you know I said that I think that that Nate Diaz is one of the biggest superstars in the game right up there with everybody see call that luck we got other plans this other s*** with the amount I just between the powerfuljre page Boswell need you just I'll just fight that fight to the baddest motherfukers ever but they're funny as f*** you know that's not one of the best things to say about Mazda doll and thing is people that don't necessarily associate him with knockout power for some reason but yet the guy knocked out Eve Edwards with a head kick you knocked out Darren till cowboy Cerrone another dimension with a flying me world record fastest knockout I mean it's weird that people don't associate Mazda doll with a knockout artist because he doesn't have doesn't Sara Lee have the most power but he's so good so calculated you set up that mean is this card Kelvin Versa dentales interesting Johnnie Walker's a good fight butts to Johnnie Walker shoulder still f***** up I'd sent you that video of him working out he's a mobility's not great with only one arm is not in the videos of him working out and then there's other videos of him going through strength and conditioning and you see what he's doing with his left arm and I'm like Jesus Christ as like he's not lifting any weight with his left-arm hope he's all right. How about freaking Kelvin vs till it was like nah man let me just go after these f****** monsters Tylenol up in Liverpool and wherever Bali or there Hebrew in the hotel so he's going through something and then they just give them freaking well I think he asked for Kelvin but the coming after the two losses that he suffered and then you know I've seen you can get some issues is wildin out Lube in Liverpool and wherever Bali were there Hebrew in the hotel so he's going through something and then they just give them freaking well I think he asked for Kelvin</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what is a really strange thing though that if you can contain it somehow it incredibly strong pipe but it won't freeze yes it was race what is the temperature 30° okay how would you measure that pull out an ice cube and just because they'll be at near-zero Fahrenheit if you if you have a good freezer and leave it on the counter would put it on a wooden cutting board okay and just let it sit there for like 10 minutes and it's temperature will come up you'll be a point where it hasn't melted yet but you can take it and squeeze the Ice Cube you can force it to melt by squeezing it cuz you're forcing it into a small volume that it currently contains and the only way you can accomplish that is if the ice turns to water then it will occupy smaller volume so that you could squeezing ice can actually melt it so if you had some sort of a pipe that could physically constrict like something that had threads and if they could wind down to a smaller size you can stick a cylinder of ice in it and you can slowly Crank It Down the more you a hard it would be for you to squeeze attempt to accomplish that a a mesh screen mesh wider openings than a screen door would so what would this be like a fence like a chain-link fence and pulled horizontally and get a big block of ice and just place it on top a block of ice is heavy what'll happen is the ice that weight of the ice will melt the ice in the contact points of the chain itself because it's feeling that pressure to squeeze into a smaller volume but by the time it melt the ice has now passed through the great and it will refreeze on the other side so you can actually pass a block of ice through a chain-link fence vertically just by pushing it yeah it's pretty pretty cool but it's real I mean depends on the 10 to the I should have it and how and how much it weighs to the pressure is what this is why this why you can I skate why can you skate on ice because the edge of the blade is very high pressure on the ice is melting a bead of water you actually gliding on water when you're skating you're not skating on slippery ice really I thought you were just cutting the ice with the blade well so the blade have you ever seen a sharpened blade it's much as flat there's actually a concave cross-section to its each edge of the left and the right Edge is is basically a knife-edge okay not quite as sharp as a knife but if you can feel how it's it sharp so that when you lean on that edge either your inner Edge router Edge your entire body weight is being held up on this on a very narrow surface area of the blade so the pressure is Extreme it's like 7 pounds per square inch you don't weigh a thousand pounds are you not skating on a square inch right so you you you do the math on that and what you can have is you will skate and you're actually makes it so slippery on ice skates is because you're moving on a bead of water that freezes right behind you as you go past it dude to be so cold you can't really skate on it because even that pressure is not enough to melt it work the freezers right behind you as you go past it dude you can't really skate on it because even that pressure is not enough to melt it how cold it have to be last I did a calculation was really cold but tens of degrees below zero</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what are your thoughts on digital privacy do you mean phones like phones like it never talk to someone about something and then you see it on your Google feed you see ads we don't research this but my wife tells we watch Gifted one of these you know what do you call those things that you talk to Google at home. Lexus IS Amazon price so I don't have one but it's not cuz I know that it's listening or not arguments like it's real that seems like it should be a problem in question is one of the things that you're getting out of their ability to scan things is there tailoring things to your liking like you know what your phone tells you it's 22 minutes until you get home I get it how do you know where I live and I'm just Ulta about this okay I'm get off my lawn about this I'm the old man in the rocking chair on the porch saying be sunny get off my lawn but I don't want to admit multiple hats I'm also dad also husband I'm I got all these hats for all those things in this particular case I'm old man and my old man sensibility is if you track what I shop at a store where would I buy in a store and then send me coupons based on what you think I'm going to buy next based on what I bought before which is kind of the same thing you're describing you have denied me the chance of stumbling upon something that I never thought of buying and that takes away my freedoms and I don't want that they denied you the chance of stumbling upon something different I walk into a wine shop they can I help you and I say if you help me find what I'm looking for it's a guarantee that I will never find what I'm not looking for and I'll end up spending less money in your wine shop when we read that you learn other words on route to the word you're targeting I understand that is how I feel and that's how I think but my interaction with his world I'd like the randomness the randomness of it in which is my life and if you're going to advertise to me because you think you know who I am maybe you do but I'll ultimately end up spending less money because it's the diversity of how I think and what I bought what I think of buying and how I buy it and how much money I spend that is the richness of the life I lead you're trying to channel me into some product so it's something that fulfills a what it called when they have the the study whether you going to buy something or not do you like this product or not if I am you don't know me and I want to experience this world by stepping where I've never stepped before and buying something I never thought of buying and if you know my previous habits you're assuming I'm going to stay that way for the rest of my life and maybe most people do and maybe I might do that but my do is cuz I chose to not because you have decided that that's how I should be sorry do you think they're just doing that because they think it would be effective to advertise in that way so if you go Googling new Nikes and then as you're looking at something in the Google ad pops up and it's for new Nikes they said hey nail I know you were looking at these you heard about the case where they were that I read this I haven't re-verified it but it's completely plausible it was a teenage girl who was Googling pregnancy tests cuz maybe if your not pregnant okay and the fact that she had searched pregnancy test she got coupons in the mail for baby products and appearances what is why what is this she got out that's a little weird but it's the kind of thing that can happen. Seems that seems intrusive certainly there's something that appears on your Google feed you can quickly glanced over what's the difference between send you mail to your mailbox and feeling your advertising space in front of your face with products for one other people can see it I walked by your computer I can see it don't look I guess I'm arguing principal rather than in detail on the positive side what they're doing in terms of a particular Google in terms of your driving right in terms of using of Google Maps and documenting the history of all these people driving specially with things like ways which they acquired his they've developed a much more efficient products than Apple Witchwood Apple does the Apple Maps they shred everything you do if they do pay did they bomb where you been and where you're going Apple Maps sucks so you have to because they don't have enough data they don't have nearly the amount of data the telling you your 20 minutes from home you can talk to drive home doing that well yes and also it's okay I can ask it how long it'll take me to go somewhere rather than it knowing what my what my daytime schedule looks like and it coming in like you said how do you know b**** you know I had that same reaction as you did and I said I wonder why what's causing this it's a little creepy and again I'm the old man syndrome 10 year old kid that only ever known this and becomes 15 and 20 that is life to them right why would they even but maybe they're not going to complain about it but I'm the old man on the porch but do you get off my lawn intrusiveness or at the very least that you have these devices and that they have to your patterns and your information is seems inevitable because we don't have to walk in there with open arms but I agree it's inevitable but you don't think I get off my lawn intrusiveness or at the very least this connection that you have these devices and that they have to your patterns and your information it seems inevitable that this we don't have to walk me with open arms but I agree it's inevitable</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> does dry ice work always just Frozen carbon dioxide that's all Frozen H2O and a block of Frozen CO2 so they are it turns out the air pressure on Earth is high enough it's at sea level is high enough to allow the ice to melt and sustain a liquid state okay go to under air pressure normal air pressure it wants to melt but it can't sustain a liquid and it goes straight to gas if we had much higher air pressure you could you could have CO2 melting have liquid CO2 physical chemistry what happens if I reduce the air pressure okay well the transition from Ice to water is still the same it's not affected but the boiling point is affected as you know cooking times have to be adjusted on mountaintops because when you boil water is not 212° depending on the height of the mountain just let are pressing down that's preventing it from boiling okay good morning. Not some absolute fact about the water that has to do with what the air pressure is sitting above it really high air pressure water have to go too much higher temperature before it boils so our soap the boiling point of water that's reported in Altec what is at sea level at 1 atmosphere pressure that's how you get 212° do you start producing 10° for this reason that I want I'm not done with you let's keep reducing the air pressure okay theoretical possible on North or whatever but I'm saying you can do this experiment in a laboratory you keep reducing the air pressure keeps dropping his hardened 7250 100 degrees Fahrenheit 80° Fahrenheit 50° Fahrenheit 40 degrees Fahrenheit 32° the ice melts and becomes water the water evaporates and become Steam and all that's happening at 32° there is an atmospheric pressure for Water Ice team coexist and Nicole the triple point of water and all ingredients have a triple point is very close to the triple point of water so you can have you can have a simultaneous bat in certain regions of Mars the simultaneous bath because the air pressure so low like 1/100 air pressure very very well so you have a place where what pot of water ice cubes and steam are coming out all at once that the triple point so the lesson here is we live life in our world at one atmosphere pressure at one atmosphere pressure and we Define what is normal based on that life experience based on our sensors Interac need to find what is normal based on that life experience basement how are census interact with their environment but the actual universe is far freakier than what we'd the what our senses are exposed our five senses are supposed to on Earth</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I was just an extraordinary facts about water and why were alive today okay to watch that has to take a lake that has fish in it okay temperature drops outside and like slowly begins to get cooler cuz there's a tank time lag between the air temperature and the waters that's why the first freeze the the lake is still there is going to be cold longer that's what happened OK and it begins to what is called in a surface and it begins to shrink so that word. It's right that makes it denser it falls to the bottom find it does that down to about 4 degrees Celsius and begins to expand and become less dense than the water so now as the water wants to actually freeze it stays on top when it does can you freeze the top surface of the lake. The water below it it's insulated from the dropping air temperature in the fish don't die imagine if ice were denser than water what would happen to the freezer top layer it would sink the bottom is frozen fries and fish would be systematically forced to swim in shallower and shallower Waters until they were all freeze-dried on the top surface of the lake and all is would be dead every winter every like what is a double plural different kinds of plural fish yeah double blow my mind got pushed out in a wall of ice South Dakota oh so there's too little oxygen I don't know why can't you look at the if you look at the Greene in the water most likely it's algae so that happens with certain Lakes to get polluted with certain types of algae kill the lake but by doing that that's incredible man is that a video Jamie it's not frozen so I had to do more homework on that one to see what would cause that over the winter yeah I mean if you put a barrier between you and the changing elements outside that basically an insulating layer right cook so that works because frozen water is less dense than non frozen water and it's one of the rare ingredients for which that so and it's likely they would be no life on land or anywhere on Earth if that were the case of the opposite of that were the case so what is a very special ingredient to life on Earth</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> gravity is one thing I want to grab it because as you should be since we've talked last I've been reading a lot about I'm one of the things that confuses me the most is that we don't really understand what gravity is we know what the facts we can measure them we know how to measure him we know what the mass is involved but we don't really know what gravity is a similar question in the book but they got more philosophical than you just did but they both lean philosophical it's science can describe how gravity works but can they describe why it works so this is the how why do ality here and allow me to just answer from a Hawaii point of view then we could apply to gravity okay after I say that in science if we can describe how something works and predicted future Behavior we claim to and we move on you can ask deeper questions about it why is there gravity what is the meaning what is the purpose and go ahead but I'm good with what I've done and I can land a spacecraft on Mars inside of a crater in a hole-in-one using my understanding of gravity so I'm pretty good with it okay so I'm not distracted by the more philosophical side of that why does it work okay Junction Newton was deeply puzzled by how you can have something called and when she coined the phrase action-at-a-distance okay he wrote down the equation that worked you want me quite the moon goes around the moons of Jupiter to go around Jupiter he accurately describe that with his equation to gravity okay he said one day I think we're going to find some way to do connecting to each other don't know what that is right now but I know my equations work you call a spooky spooky to him at his word spooky action-at-a-distance all right fast forward 300 years no Albert Einstein gravity is the curvature of space and time and you're moving on the curvature of that fabric that's gravity oh my gosh is it even a force fan is it even so there's no need to think of it as an action at a distance and in a phrase first uttered by he was John Archibald wheeler student of Einstein learned relativity from John Archibald wheeler and relativity class in graduate school space Mater tell space how to curve space tells matter how to move it moves on the curvature of space you don't need an action-at-a-distance there's no action in it can't do anything else but do that it's like you have a funnel and you take a ball on your roll it on the frontal the ball can only do what that funnel tells it to do and it'll search if you give it a sideways motion start spinning around there's no magic hand coming in there it is following the curvature of its space-time Continuum this construct that you provided for it so now I can describe what gravity is doing I even have a mechanism for it are you guys still ask me why is there gravity is that answer not fulfilling enough to you even in the wire department is it why would a particle curved space you can just keep doing that that's fine but is there a point will eat where you'll be satisfied with the answer do that answers my why I can say why did this half liter of water drop off the edger was no longer the forces are in balance and if it no but why did it disappoint where it's not especially productive to continue to think about the world that way because what I'm claiming is answers to the how when you understand the how enough are tantamount to having answered the why question that's what that's what I'm telling you about in terms of the ability to measure it and actually use it correct so you can say okay why did you go bald well okay then hair follicles at when you start in your late twenties and where'd you go bald when do you start losing your late 20s early 30s if you have your hair when you're 30 you'll probably have it for the rest of your life that's the how that goes you start losing it up right going up to you 30 so finishing well because the DNA has it be coded about the haircutters and why is the DNA have damn school because so we know far more about how and why people go bald then we do about what gravity really is correct I'm telling you gravity really is the curvature of space and time that gets us the big bang and everything we've ever known in love also based on mass right it's based on the amount of concentration of matter and energy and or energy will curve the fabric of space and time and the movement of matter on that fabric of space and time we call gravity and I'm good with that but you seem a little defensive you need to know why why does why does matter and energy the fabric of space and time you can ask that okay why and I don't have an answer so I can say that's all I'm asking what we had to walk to that point where your wife got unanswered I understand that but so what I'm telling you is that I can answer your why question most of the time but then you'll come back to a point where there's a point where there's the why doesn't have the answer so you say why did it fall I say there's a force of gravity operating on it why did fall that way because of the curvature of space and time I'm answering your wise then why does matter and energy in time Frontier we're still working on that you are a man of science so you're you're a person that should probably Embrace wise accept many people ask why questions they're really want to no purpose many other people who ask why questions what's going on and if you are inquiring about purpose then you gets theological okay because when you see a logical then religions give purpose to life but I just think it's amazing that something that's such a massive part of life on this planet that we stayed glued to the ground because of gravity pull up my Instagram account I only post actually I'm sorry this is a real account and it's not can I have it back posture and don't know it illegal so so there's there's one that says fan of Neil Tyson okay so here's my cat go to my caption go full-screen on that mimic okay for most of our life on Earth we are the resist or succumb to the force of gravity at Muscle Beach gravity loses every time is a war gravity loses a battle just listening to this so I was at I was in Venice California and the sun was setting behind some guy who was doing who was doing suspended up on the chin up bar right and it was so it was cool it was silhouetted there's a palm tree is a beach he's there you haven't conquered gravity lately I work out all the time I'm not buying it cuz I see your middle-aged Man Billy you can't say that but that's a weird one for people that this one thing that is so powerful but what is a gravity that's a weird question responses to how are also responses to a y that's the point of making it I don't like splitting definitions I think we do that's why we can win things on Mars cellphone gets time from GPS satellites that is pre corrected for Einstein's general theory of relativity because they're in a different gravitational field in an orbit that you are under the surface we got this skip time from GPS satellites that is pre corrected for Einstein's general theory of relativity cuz they're in a different gravitational field in in

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think about what's going on in Hawaii now with the protesting of the building of this largest and latest telescope the AT&amp;T Thirty meter telescope which would be the largest-ever by far of any kind of tells what the history of astronomy is one where bigger telescopes become beer buckets to collect light that's the only telescope today are the same as telescope when they were invented which is bigger write the principle behind them is because what they're doing is simple all you're trying to get as much light as possible in the more like you get the dimmer is the object you can detect and the farther away is the object you can see and sew for every generation of new large telescopes that have been built it is it has increased and deepen our understanding of our place in the universe so that's just the that's the background the proposal is for a 30m what is ever on the big island of Hawaii Mauna Kea with other telescopes their most sightlines to it but that's not so much what's important here it's that the native Hawaiians from what I've read view the mountain is a sacred place and so to put a towel yet another telescope there becomes would have invasion of sacred land and so so yeah it's it's it's a standoff last I looked having people protesting the streets and there's some native Hawaiian to embrace this cuz it means jobs high-quality jobs engineering jobs you got to build it got to maintain it there's an entire support of infrastructure for that that means jobs and it's done in collaboration with mercy of Hawaii and the only other telescopes are partnered with the University of Hawaii where people are educated there and so so at the end of the day you have to ask well how we going to make decisions going forward or going to come democratically then you take a boat or you do you want the natives to to be the deciders of their own fate and is that Democratic location the natives vote okay or is it too few people protesting did they win the day I mean it's gets complicated and it's very it's very there a lot of nuance issues going on there there's that there's a branch of thinking that the the United States government and and normal Municipal leaders have no authority over it there's some who claim that this is native Hawaiian property that does not belong to any Municipal entity of the US government so therefore even state representatives have no say there's a lot going on there okay but if I were to weigh in this is how I would do so okay I'll take first I think what should happen is I don't know if they even have the infrastructure system is set up but if they could set it up this way if the mountain is viewed as Sacred by the natives the native should have entire say what happens to the milk okay that's how I think that should be so now what you want to make sure is that whatever decision gets made and voted upon by the natives that it's fully informed you you don't want to vote being misinformed or under-informed in any election let alone with your voting for telescope on your sacred Mountain okay otherwise you're voting out of nowhere right unit information you were future based on partial information and decisions based on formation of bad decisions no matter what okay so I would say hold the road with the natives and make sure everybody's fully informed and here's a bit of information I just want to add to the information okay you know what we do is astrophysicists we study the universe rather passively at that we sit there at the end of a telephone and wait for light to reach us it's not petri dish where we stir it or heated or freezing her crack it or we just kind of there communing with the cosmos my PhD thesis was significantly fed by data that I obtained from mountaintops at telescopes I've got my data from mountains in Chile Trump said all have specific access points to the universe they're not all asking the same questions and so it's the collection of all the data that gives us the complete understanding what we think is a complete understanding of the universe so what we do is try to understand our place in the universe and all I'm going to say is that if you have power over what happens on that mountain and its sacred to you because whatever that is it is something important to you and your sense of your understanding of your place in this world that would be spiritual significance I can tell you that what we learn as astrophysicists from those mountaintops gives us a deeper understanding of who and what we are in this universe so I would say that whatever is your concept of God be at the the creator of the universe the spirit energy that provides all of space and time whatever is your concept the discoveries of astrophysicists bring you closer to it I get your perspective let me be the opposing view they feel I'm not tryna information information and I walk out of the room and then your boat right I'm not you know we believe in democracy here and majority rules that's it that's kind of a good thing it's kind of worked right but if it's not majority rules I don't know how they going to make a decision but let's say invented future where that the natives vote if they bought I want to make sure they heard what I just said and now take control of your own fake iced don't think they care I think they've decided that's a Sacred Space and they don't want anybody doing anything to it then I don't judge people understand that fact I can take it one step further and say mountaintops because of the access they give astrophysicist and and by proxy us all to the universe are sacred places to scientists okay notes not sacred in a religious sense but it's sacred in a in terms of a pathway to knowing and understanding who and what we are in this universe we place great value on that so but it's not our land hits with you know fine Legions of scientist are conducting experiments okay if I'm native peoples governing themselves so so so that's that the consequence if it gets voted down and that's permanent and there's no way around that that telescope is still going to be built it just won't be bill why will where will it be built very have to be built on mountaintops to be above the clouds and Hayes and then what a dry environment so there's less rain clouds we visited more than 10 years ago the first time and it was I got very fortunate it was a night where the moon was not out yes Moon if not the astronomers we would think yeah you want the darkest guy you can we were worried as we're driving up there that was really cloudy but we drove through the clouds y'all got to the top and we got to the observatory and it was the most amazing without telescopes just weave they were telescopes there but without telescope it was the most amazing view of the sky at ever seen in my life and it changed my perspective of our place in the universe which looked like we were on a spaceship like we were flying through the universe because of the diffused light and on the big island cuz it's all set up so that it doesn't ruin what they're trying to accomplish at the CAC when it was in the wrong place and you end up through the clouds the Moonlight illuminates the clouds and you are an island in the middle of white cotton and you're not even connected to the Earth it's what you imagine Mount Olympus would have been with the Gods that's their place is there so so so yes and so any my my brethren my fellow astrophysicist to have also observed from Mountain Top by the way it's becoming a lost art because when I'm lost but we don't do anymore some legal service observing will you put in your observing program the antenna to a technician at the telescope who point the telescope gets the data and send it back to you so the Next Generation doesn't have the experience that my generation did because it was a pilgrimage to the top of the mountain and you converted your life's path you become part of your life scheduled to become nocturnal and Endo doing you you know this is the journey was long enough cuz you're in the middle of nowhere now you got to go nocturnal and by the time you're ready for this you are communing with the cosmos it is you the detector the telescope and the universe there's an eerie silence up there too cuz you don't hear any of the hum of maybe the the the the motor of the telescope but that's it and so all I'm saying is if they choose to not have it until she will go somewhere else one of them is the Canary Islands these are also volcanic hilltops not as high as as at 14000 feet by the way I should have checked at what temperature water boils at the top of it we could have rounded that story at but I think it's around a hundred eighty degrees actually I think I did actually calculate it went so so you find a Mountaintop and we'll put it somewhere else and the data won't be as good but that'll be a consequence of it and none of that will go to Hawaii it is out there protesting yeah and so we get celebrity types to put the weight of their name behind it it it it magnifies the cause of others even if they're in the majority and so if you're voting on whether it's so sacred you don't want to put a telescope there he want people who have a an indigenous indigenous concern for what goes on there and Indigenous in reference to relative to the word indigenous relative timeframe to declare what is native and what's not and the native in its in its simplest form is are you born there so I'm a native New Yorker around born there but I wasn't the original settler there I would my species did not form on Manhattan Island so everybody travel to where they are and so that has become the definition of indigenous art Were You There When the Europeans landed that you're an indigenous but to other life on that on that walk on that Hawaii Zara volcanic it's a volcanic archipelago you don't have multiple volcanoes in a string is just sitting there okay and doesn't move around the way it does on Earth Earth's crust shifts okay so that hotspot girls up makes a volcano then the hotspot goes dormant but the Shelf still drips you still have continental drift so drips then hotspots have time for me to go again the girls up and I get another volcano and then it goes dormant volcano goes dormant it shifts you get another one anytime you see in a chain of islands guarantee they're made by volcanoes over enough time little gift to a shifted the plates over the hotspot of Earth's mantle with their concern with the eventual spoiling of this beautiful natural resource that slowly but surely people are putting up houses there and developments and all these different things in the scientists are saying we need this sacred land because we're going to put a volcano when they like luck what is already I mean Eating Disorders are trying to Halt the progress of civilization or maybe progress is a bad word the expansion of civilization yeah I mean let's go back what did Teddy Roosevelt to he said we got to preserve these lands because they're beautiful and he said that after he shot all those elephants and lions and tigers and bears what happened was he realizes how important this land is and how beautiful it is and he is the he's the patron saint of the national park system so so that's the secular version of sacred right we don't say it's sacred but we've all decided as a community that we care about these lands and you don't want to drill on it you don't want to put housing was it Lyndon Johnson's wife Lady Bird Johnson who said our freeways that were so carefully building after the second world war the Eisenhower Play Project okay you know the interstate system is this is our country we want to keep it beautiful so certain stretches over there no Billboards Billboards would you know would change your relationship to Nature so certain stretches of Interstate or secularly sacred if I can say that so I remember visiting and there is the famous rock in the out in the outback please help me get the correct pronunciation of this one coherent geologic rock it's not just an assembly of rocks and I don't know nothing about the geology of it but I do know that the Australian Aborigines Guru iconic Red Rock okay so that is one to the geologic thing and and climbers one climate excuse miles in circumference okay so we visited it I rented a bicycle with my wife and kids and we rode around it okay so now that is sacred to the local indigenous peoples they don't want you to climb on it to rock climb right you know what do you care I'm not going to ruin it I'm not going to want you to climb on it and I try to think to myself is their counterpart to this that would suit a wake up a Westerner to say I get it right. Suppose some people from some natives from Alaska or from the some tribes from Africa or some Aborigines came up these remote places in the world walk up to the Vatican and said you want to climb the walls of this Vatican just for sport what would we say we want to climb the walls St Paul's Cathedral in downtown London what would you say no these are important structures to us know we built those the natives didn't build the Rock by exactly okay it depends on how important that detail is to you all I'm saying is on the level of weak say this is sacred you say that is sacred and now you can have different rules for who's climbing what I think it'll work before she to take pause so here's an argument a blank supporting what you're saying look at what's going on with the Himalayas I mean it's the human s*** that they had they leave behind their scoring so disturbing yeah yeah tons of human waste if it's still not a problem that people are climbing is that they're leaving waste you don't stop the climbers you tax them at some level so now you clean up Crews to come up after you make it worth it but don't understand why they can't even bring body Cars and Cars were killing people in the street across the street across the street stop the car they say it's actually pretty useful thing do we ban cars we make stop lights o people across at what we make crosswalks splitting Lanes the cars don't hit each other and let's make airbag so that you don't fly through the windshield all right soap there ways around problems if you value the thing that it is that you want to do so people leaving crap up there you make them bring it back or you develop a system that enables the stuff to come back no matter what if you can't do that you don't want it messed up then cancel the whole Opera we can cancel cars we got really Innovative about how to kill a big difference between cars in human s*** just left in the side of the mountain. I think the real problem to is I think it if you value mountain climbing and you want to keep doing it then you solve the problem is what Engineers do that's all they do what the problem to bring those bodies back because the physical limitations of the human body it's barely barely have enough juice. used to climb it's so thin they are so thin that's so dangerous the energy drawn you is so hot by is there a human ship that you're talkin about or is it all there's no humans were there that we got a clean about our presence that's what you're talkin about role would just being human we have to go you got to go you got to go when we got to go up there and just open up the hatch and let her rip down the side of a mountain</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what did you think about Elon musk's idea about nuking the poles of Mars that are to make it warmer yes so some of these are kind of pie in the sky ideas let's get to what he's trying to get at what you want to do is you want to introduce warms you want to block the ozone do you want to block the ultraviolet it's so that you can protect organic life right so we have an ozone layer three oxygen atoms 03 and oxy ozone likes ultraviolet light comes from Sun and gets eaten by ozone gets eaten and when you do that they don't write like doesn't make it to Earth's surface so even though they sell wear wear sunscreen and sunblock 45 yes that's for the 1% of the ultraviolet to get through the atmosphere if you're above the atmosphere you are fried so because Charlotte is highly hostile to organic molecules and what we're made of his life so you want to protect you want to give like a chance so you want to not only heat Mars want to find a way to block the ultraviolet light coming from the Sun so you need some mechanism if not ozone where it just live on the ground for example okay and so so I don't think we should think of the idea as a literal thing but just it's a general principle what you want to accomplish on Mars in doing so you want to warm it you want to protect what could be the future of biochemistry and then you see it and you and then you wait you want to wait too long you wanted so to speed it up if you could and then you terraform Mars SpaceX has I visited him a couple of times he's got a mug you can buy there then it has Mars on it okay and then you put put hot liquid in it and Mars turns to Arabic blue green marble very good and it doesn't tell you that you know and you show it off and oh my God but it doesn't look like her a lot of people that go it's just sitting Below in a permafrost so you wouldn't have to bring water to Mars by the way and I'm really just a future you going to be there at 2, and get all the water you need but how far distance is that become it's everywhere Shooting Gallery in time but there's no real incentive so there's no engineering funded engineering plan to do what we got to do in a paper we know how to do it any conceivable way it happens with or without us because we are in the shooting path of countless thousands of asteroids and comets so what you would do is you find one is headed close to us anyway in the seventh orbit down the line with a hundred orbit down the line and then you lightly deflected in such a way that it would then collide with Mars or even Earth if you wanted needed some more freshwater really big that would fill Lakes were there if that collided with Earth that would just be bad for life on Earth because it isn't it's a spontaneous deposit of energy that can change the climate and do she want to do that on a planet that you're trying to terraform isn't that the speculation of how water got here in the first place so if the jury still out on that there is there tags in the oceans in the water molecule that tell you that the word muscle come from more than one source so that's what's confusing things we want to be a sin okay my comments were all came from inside the earth volcanoes volcanoes emit Lakes are historically lakes and oceans worth of water just out of their out of their calderas so so the problem is what as we same-side overdetermined is plenty, still delivered all the water is plenty of water that could have come out of out of volcanoes to give us all so but in the ocean is clearly a mixture the lakes are historically lakes in Ocean's worth of water just out of there out of their calderas so so the problem is with as we same signs overdetermined is plenty, still delivered all the water is plenty of water that could have come out of out of volcanoes to give us all so but in the ocean is clearly a mixture and so the final word is still out on that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> my brother my brother so I've had this water baptism my whole life being exposed to him I'm the you know the The Sibling scientist but the they have an artist in the family I haven't worked makes me want to throw in a heart as part of that movement science technology engineering art and math is a better word in that they both good words for what they need but I just sounds like a bunch of awesome stuff like anything then the memorization has to kick in but steam you don't have to memorize that it's already there for you this is cleverly conceived I think the abbreviation was it is tacit recognition that these are elements in society that advanced civilization and and grow the economy actually so in fact there's hardly any growth economy in the world that isn't growing because it has meant not having been touched by science words everything just think about it so if you're around running at you don't have them on your show but if you want around saying I don't like science science is bad science is evil okay well then you will die in poverty if you elect officials who believe that as well and 19 how did they express this Express at 3 okay it's not it's not out yet but I've got it but I don't even have my coffee yet in there there's a whole chapter on just angry people who don't like anything including science and one of you took it to it's a refuge us and I didn't bring some of the worst thing that ever happened to humanity and pollution and and so I reply is Letters from and I replied as as calmly in his rationally is is possible when you get attacked that way but what I'm saying is not everyone and braces everything that science does and some will cherry pick it you have the science deniers for global warming science deniers with vaccine if seitan Aires with GMOs all manner of science denying going on in modern society and you know we in a free Society the people can think what they want but if it's thinking what they want influences policy with that affects everybody then your science denial has consequences to the economic health of the nation and its your health is your physical health as well as our security right you're driving a car that's relying on GPS using a phone to complain about the global warming hoax you know you're correct want one of my more more a sort of popular tweets was remember when they have the photo of the black hole from a distant galaxies and it was a banner headline maybe he's a year ago less than a year ago Banner headlines and a first photo ever of a black hole and it was an astounding engineering achievement to accomplish multiple telescopes all around the world pulling the data to get it right and was one of the greatest collaborative effort we've ever undertaken in my field of astrophysics okay and everybody would love in the results so the scientist report first photo of a black hole public warming the Earth every image of a supermassive black hole 55 million light-years away the response scientist who concluded that humans are catastrophically warming the Earth response that conflicts with what I want to be true so it must be false that is a demographic that has cherry-picked science to deny human-caused global warming their other demographic demographic of cherry-picked other signs to deny other things and it it's not all located in one political Spectrum in one political Branch so you tend to find liberal folk complaining that the conservatives who have embraced know the global warming platform or denying science and then eat sign Richard and many of those same people or rubbing crystals together to be healed by the crystal energy or they're denying vaccines thinking that there's somehow bad for you and so so all of this requires some or total rejection of mainstream science and we're living in that world now and I don't know why don't think it'll stop the progress of civilization but slow it down and occasion well that is certainly a problem but about how big of a problem is it like how many people are really in denial of Science in 2019 and it's got to be for me and that you elect officials who are not official people who are scientifically literate and then listen to people who right so what they're doing though is there they're doing what their constituents would like them to do that's why I don't be politicians over the head ever I don't do that where it where a republic or democracy whatever they believe if they think Earth is 6000 years old and they got elected it's because the people elected them believe there's a 6,000 years old do you have a portfolio of thoughts and beliefs because he's such a profound Christian I mean he's so profoundly Christian that he's we just want any of literally definition you are connected to science that don't include the pope by the way more Christian than the pope from a couple of years ago it's a scientifically literate. Document so Jesus still rose from the dead and there was still Miracles and all the rest of that in the New Testament so he's not in denial of that but given that he is saying oh my gosh hear something we the religious community and scientist can partner behind that if you want to save life on Earth and so we have to be better Shepherds of what is going on on this Earth and one of them is we want to flood lowline country in the South Pacific where the average sea level is 10 feet above sea level or whatever it is you going to Ludlow line countries in the South Pacific where the average sea level is 10 feet above sea level or whatever it is you going to lose these countries if you keep melting our our our so right cuz any ice that's in the water floating that can melt and it's not going to change the water level so</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know that little bit of Starry Night there I felt because this is not an representation of reality reality is reality that has filtered through your and I think art at its highest is exactly that if this was an exact depiction of reality it would be a photograph and I don't need the artist so even photographs that take you to a slightly other kind of Dimension as you gaze upon them it's more than what was actually going on at the time and that's that's are taken to the craft of photography where its title is the background think about that this could have been called the full painting obviously this isn't down there there's a cypress tree there's a church steeple it could have been called Rolling Hills but no and how often do you pay something where the title is the background that that's my point and in this particular case the background is the universe and soap so for me this was a pivot point in art and it's a 1889 which is recent given the history of paintings and you know that go all the way back so yeah four or five ties that have this painting on them in different ways yeah so I'm all in the town is what have you seen Starry Night in bacon so he did look it up on the screen it's somebody did it in bacon the town is realistically depicted the trees or recognizable as trees if you ever saw a sky that looks like that the end would be here exactly at Clouds because you wouldn't see the stars means this is Before Sunrise and that white object lower on the horizon that sort of glowing that's very likely Venus and that enables us to trace what's over what's said weeks this painting was actually painting so it's kind of like forensic astronomy that's how I should be I think yeah we need artist for make cool s*** the cool stuff is something that they felt then it came out of them. The natural world in ways different from the rest of us and that's why they're artists why do you why do we all know who Paul Revere is right we all week is a household name yet is there any other War ever fought in the history of the world where a household name is the name of the person who told other people the enemy was coming we we can mention his name but we can't list the generals that all fought in that war why it's because a poem was written about him and he mundane job let me tell people to Adam he's coming and so the artist in this case the poet elevated the mundane to something that forces you to to record it with your understanding of this world what Joyce Joyce Kilmer's most famous poem about a tree dog piss on trees you drive by trees you don't even know they're there yet poem about a tree I'll never see something as as a tree oh my gosh this is the art forces you to pause it just reflect on things that you took for granted things that became ordinary in your life and elevated 222d get beatified by the talents of artists someone in the Catholic Church beautiful could have to be the first steps on route to sainthood and authorize the title blessed and limited public dishonor she was beatified 6 years after her. So I think you can't become a saint unless you previously been beatified I think that's the roof but I'm looking at the number one definition here to make supremely happy so that's that's interesting to be out of the bird was up there are you head on the screen Roman Catholic Church he beatified one Diego and Indian bleach have a vision of a Virgin Mary synonyms canonize sanctify Halle consecrate so I think if you take something ordinary and you subjected to the interpretation of an artist it can be beatified and elevated Ana level where it becomes a household recognition of its importance in this world</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> not even just that it's expanded even further in the best evidence is Dave Chappelle Dave Chappelle's recent Sticks and Stones Netflix documentary for whatever reason Rotten Tomatoes thought it would be a good idea to only have it reviewed by five Super Progressive critics only critics they closed it off to the public view it got 0% on Rotten Tomatoes they've been open to the public and it got 99% of course if that isn't do a crazy disparity between first of all the ideal you going to suppress it like you're going to say 0% of no one's going to watch it and we're going to shut Dave Chappelle. He's canceled knock him but people love him you can't cancel someone who doesn't care what you can't cancel know that you're not opening it up to the public and that once it does get open to the public you're going to get them massive Whiplash backlash or people going to come and even if they didn't want to vote on it now they do and now they're going to give you 100% or 99% I knew I had to watch it when I saw how all the media channel many of the media channels that I really dislike him do not respect we're coming so hard at it and saying all now you don't need to watch it and all this other that means I absolutely have to watch it the guardian gave me you can't get it one star and then I saw Vise saying like don't watch it box thing don't Tulsa okay this is this means that I have to watch this is going to be good small group of relatively small group of human beings that are in charge of these media conglomerates is its really astounding and that they it's not just opinion right it's like they're they're trying to get people to behave and think the way they do it's not just yes it is active it's undisguised activism it's very transparent activism it supposed to journalism I really wish there was a place where we could go we we can get 100% unbiased information and news and we can get an honest perspective of both sides this I believe this and this is why they believe that but this I believe that this is why they believe that it's very hard to do and if you have a podcast one of things really interesting if you even talk to someone who has an opposing point of view of yours or who is right wing or who it maybe have some questionable ideas you are somehow platforming them and supporting their idea and supporting some white all right ideology and there's no room anymore for people to have conversations with people with differing opinions and just find out why there is there is right here you've literally created a man seriously you you you and a handful of other people have created this an in-depth comprehensive analysis about the way the world works that's not going to happen I'm not your guy yeah but what I am is someone is interested in talking to people what they should have is someone who has my I don't say my sensibilities but my my willingness to communicate with almost anybody again and then also someone who does a real exhaustive research does real exhaustive research on the actual fact behind all these critical issues taking affect everybody I don't see that anymore you're not going to fight you're certainly not going to find it on television just cuz the format just doesn't allow for that you said you've got the time pressure the advertising all that just simply doesn't allow for it and then in you know the way newspapers in journalism is going I mean the stuff that's being paying is the clickbaity sort of stuff you know the stuff that gets people outraged stuff to get people fired up highly partisan stuff it's you know being sent but is not the in the old media that's not what seems to be profitable I know but is that everything is profitability anything we where is real journalism because I feel for real journalist because I do think that they are fighting for their lives in terms of this world like nobody I subscribed to a few different things I subscribe to The Washington Post and the New York Times and a few other periodicals online that pay money to read their stuff online because that's they are valuable contributions I just I don't think many people are doing that but this so much free s*** boxes free all these other places are free and so if you're only going with free s*** you're only going to get buy a stuff and you're also only going to get stories that are commercially viable to to the people that are making it and what why would they be commercially viable economy click-baiting that's that's the only way you get people to pay attention should be I think that's that's already to stop working if baby stuffy I don't know if you I mean if you were mad think back a couple years ago where I don't know you'd go on Facebook and you get all these kind of like BuzzFeed things and you had all these new media companies that sprung up and sort of took advantage of the clickbait era but people are pretty people become quite wise to that now I think and people are starting to realize I mean I think if you went back even a decade I don't think most people thought the media in general was particularly biased maybe they would have thought okay maybe that one and that one but not just generally now I think if you were to survey people like a lot of people understand that even the ones that are supposed to be impartial things like CNN things like the New York Times especially when it comes to the opinion pieces you know people know that those things are not just giving it to you straight they know you're you're getting some spin some cases you're getting it from a totally partisan angle and I think if people are up front peluquera conservative news outlet look where a liberal left-wing use outlet and that's the filter everything is coming through if their front upfront about that then you know that's fine but if people claim to be unbiased to claim to be totally impartial and just bring you the fax without putting too much opinion or spin on it and then you can kind of see through that and see that's what they're doing and they may not even know that they're doing it right cuz so many people get stuck in these Echo Chambers so I don't think all of it is necessarily on purpose but how it is and I think the vibe I'm certainly getting I know with myself and with other people and listen to what people are saying is people are starting to notice it a lot more I know you've talked a lot about the online tech censorship and buy it and stuff like that which is another thing that again I think he went back 10 years ago I'd only people thought that Facebook or Twitter or YouTube or any of these things were by us whereas now in 2019 it's like okay you got enough examples to COK their deplatforming a lot of people of certain political I'm certain political Persuasions and then you got other people who are outright calling for violence or just saying like crazy stuff for threatening people and their find a turning a blind eye to it and it's it's just in your face and it's kind of like will this isn't me being a conspiracy theorist it's just that they taken on that person that person that person that person but all these people are still there so these rules are not being applied fairly</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> promotion looking in people's individuals cuz I think that is really that that's that's one of the keys to getting out of this mess it is to stop tribal ideological recognition and and definitions of humans just to look at people's this is Tom this is Sally this is this guy this is that girl this is this non-binary person whatever the f*** they are a lot to learn from children in that regard Saudi Arabia I mean off the bat I was just surrounded by people of all different skin colors different nationalities different religions and it was just always cool some of these ideas like I've never heard people talking about race anytime more in my life than now which is really weird to me rightly knows and in the 90s in the thousands I did wasn't hearing people talking about white privilege it is what it feels like your white man that weapon and suddenly it's like you know me tell you about my blackness or we know your interns like Blackness and whiteness and it's like what you even talking about like this is this is nonsense people of color it is. I can't stand that turn by the way just all this terminology and people just talkin and he's really bizarre ways and just kind of grouping people into these weird groups and I'm just like what's the point of all this what's 8 now they get something by appealing to fellow Europeans or by appealing to you know like the straight Pride Parade now they got a bunch of people to f****** parade they got together like I'm so proud of being straight like a great you're proud of being 90% of the f****** population a bunch of guys I know at least three they're in the closet that want to come out but can't they're scared because of their career cuz there life in other game once their friends they let their friend but they don't want to tell anybody so for them like a lot of conservative sites that you can hide right like if you are black it's obvious if you're white it's obvious if you're gay no one knows no one else so you can hear people say gay jokes and say mean things and and you can just swallow it and let you know when you can feel terrible you can hear pastors talk about are you going to hell if your gay f*** and there are gay and they can't come out so for them the idea of Gay Pride make sense it's a celebration it's an affirmation it's okay to be who you are that's that make sense straight pride is f****** preposterous most people are straight b**** what are you doing you do taking time out of your busy day you going to March you got a flat what is the gay pride thing as a rainbow what do straight people get stop and think about that what is a black and white black and white for real straight pride flag holyshit holyshit is a straight Pride flag this life everything knowing god damn it that's hilarious though meanwhile the gay one they have a way better flag make America straight again oh my God oh my God yam and lesbian people can do what they want then I was joking thinking is a straight pride flag and the fact that you nailed it perfectly that's probably black and white pink and blue another one among the straight Pride folks they can't decide what's what it's great to be straight what do you get people that no one wants to f*** Black Bandana bet you ain't Hulk Hogan you take that goddamn thing off right now but a bandana around his head stop to answer your question discussion is what is needed to keep the keep the lid on the lid on the pot I think I think that's why it's you know when we were talking about like deplatforming and all that kind of stuff all that stuff plays into the polarization as far as I'm concerned you know it drives people underground it pushes people to radical fringes and what not what you want it's just keep the communication channels open I mean you've only got three ways of dealing with any conflict you can talk you can segregate or you can fight doesn't matter if you're talking individually or countries that those are the only three options so as soon as discussion breaks down or people don't want to talk or people think I do I can't talk to that person cuz they they go to Trump or they voted leave or they voted are they voted Democrat as soon as that breaks down and I mean it's crazy you seen all these stories about couples breaking up or families where the parents won't talk to the kids anymore or vice versa or people are kind of you know exiling and denouncing their own friends and family over politics and when I see stuff like that in my eyes sad and very very sad I mean if you have a disagreement you can say OK I believe in this I think this I'm going to go that way you go that way cool baby be friends you can still be brothers you can still be cool like that stuff I mean if stuff is functioning correctly politics shouldn't play such a huge role in your life should be a very bunch of background thing you know what I mean it's just there isn't one of the main characteristics and Cults is to separate you from anybody who disagrees it is it really didn't that's one of the things that they do in calls they separate you from your family it's one of the first things they do it is and that's how people end up an echo chamber glycol how did we not see Trump coming I thought you didn't see Trump coming cuz you don't talk to half the population right and if you live in these high population areas where everyone has the same sort of ideology or shares that ideology it becomes a real problem do you work in LA in particular yeah it's weird I mean it happened to the two things I guess it happens with most are politics and religion right so if you live in a place where everybody is religious and everybody is on the same Faith then it's easy to sort of s u behave in a way that everybody else in the world or outside things and believe the exact same things everybody you know does the same thing can happen politically if someone lives in you know super liberal area or super conservative area you can just think okay well everyone everyone I know thinks this is what everybody thinks and a lot of people I mean I'm a musician you're a comedian we we both go around respective countries to two different places and you talk to different people llaves podcast you had all kinds of people have different Persuasions on here religious non-religious Eno political all across the Spectrum in whatever so I'd imagine that you can understand and empathize with all of the position you've got your own views but it can be okay I get what I get where that person is coming from or I get how that person believes that all right I'll get that and just that level of empathy is really what is needed I think it's really just about empathy it's about being able to understand that most people look people want to go to be a better place throwing that many people who wake up everyday thinking or I want to make the world worse I want to make my life worse I want to make my family but most people want to make stuff deader people have different ideas on what will make things better but I think as long as people so to extend that charity to other people and don't try to consider things in the worst possible way if somebody says something wetter online or offline don't try to interpret it in the worst possible way that you could or read some kind of malice into it that's whether online or offline don't try to interpret it in the worst possible way that you could or read some kind of malice into it that's not there just understand that coming from a good place you may disagree and then you can have that discussion and even if people don't change their minds you at least understand other people better</div>

What is a hear the most scroll up a little bit in the most famous doctor patients were president and mrs. Kennedy dr. Jacobson frequently visited the White House and often travel with the Kennedys in 1961 for example he went with the president to Vienna for a summit meeting with Khrushchev and dr. Jacobson said an interview gave the president injections there in addition to the Kennedys other persons who are patients of the doctor included Truman Capote Cecil B Demille Eddie Fisher Alan Jay Lerner I don't know that is representative Claude pepper of Florida blah blah blah bunch of other politicians foreign Tennessee Williams wow including included among the number of a number of other prominent patients dr. Jacobson have been a bunch of other famous people blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and it also turned up the names of well over 100 others in ranking positions in government journalism Finance industry society and several entertainment field are said to be patients of dr. Jacobson but who could not be confirmed as such what does it say about okayed it cannot be said with certainty that the Kennedys or with a few exceptions any other specific patient received amphetamine it is known that whatever that dr. Jacobson uses unusually large amounts of amphetamine in his practice the doctor's office reported the doctor Jacobson by damphetamine at the rate of 80 grand a month that is enough to make one 100 fairly strong doses of 25 mg every day so he's got a hundred people taking hardcore doses of amphetamines everyday 25mg apparently they're saying it's a big dose I don't know what that means Source f*** stomach acids get in the blood baby I mean it's about energy right look at poor f****** Joe Biden that poor bastard you can pay attention to him a little bit yeah he's bleeding from the eyes I saw that on TV give that guy I mean you could be 70 a Jack LaLanne when he was 78 look f****** fantastic when he was 90 with pulling boats do you ever see that I don't the vice president is probably the easiest job in the history of the world the bright vice-president like slightly easier than hosting Fear Factor</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what a broad range of culture that you've been exposed to that's that's pretty f****** cool yeah Nigeria is a strange spot because I've never I've never been but when you look at the numbers of successful immigrants like businessmen and people have come over from Nigeria and how industrious they are and then you look at how many successful Nigerian scammers there are it's a wise very clever play you got the email from the prince 2 did Mara was thinking about was Jamie was telling me a story yesterday about a guy who would he sell sold a non-existent Bangkok Airport airport to a non-existent airport to about this been several stories over the last couple of weeks about Nigerian scammers making big score yeah there's one that I think closed down in Brazilian bank why are they so good at that a lot a lot of smart and enterprising people and I think if that's channeled in the right way then that's a very good thing I think some people scam people but as a person who hasn't been a victim of this it's quite amusing turn 30 equivalent to American Dollar Tree in 30 million what happened in the 90s no I guess the store is just now going around without a reason but it happened in the 90s which is what this says con man once told an airport that didn't exist for 330 million now. cancel last name in wude maybe movie something like that what are you starting with a M how do you say with an N but how are you doing it's it's an end but it's the pronunciations of a little bit different say it again is two letters off my actual first name really yeah my NZ Ube so that's actually two letters different so you just said it would be a little bit more synonymous with you original early 2000 email account Moody. Do it successfully convinced an unassuming bank manager by the name of Nelson sakaguchi that he was selling a yet-to-be-built airport for a price of 330 million dollars is the former director of the Union Bank of Nigeria himself today was privy to confidential information that was crucial to him pulling off his long con I'll tell you you knew s*** about banking using the information he then person dated the governor of Central Bank of Nigeria at the time Paul okay here's another one Paul Bogle uma uma uma uma uma Gucci we need Steve Aoki come back Hymn of a mouth-watering deal Nigeria's plan to build a brand new airport in another one Abuja to Juice It Up a bit for porous takiguchi promised the head of the Brazilian of the Brazilian bank a commission fee to the tune of 10 million US dollars of the deal was approved to get it over the line sakaguchi paid 191 million in cash as you do and the remainder in the form of outstanding interest waited patiently for the construction of said airport wow wow that's kind of thing you can only pull up once and it was a documentary about it was it was a television show brother was really sad because he was a dude who's older gentleman looks like he was in his sixties and he was convinced that there was his woman who is his love and she lived in Europe and he traveled there new sending her money in the whole deal and he travel there twice and meet her and both times she couldn't see him both times but he still believed in his daughter was like I don't know what the f*** to do this guy really believes and you can see how this lost look in his eye when she really believed that there was a woman over there that was corresponding with him back and forth and he was sending her money center a lot of money more than $100,000 that she was going to be there for him you went over there something came up and I can meet him and yeah it's weird way with stuff like this I always feel like in some way you kind of feel sad for the person that but in another kind of like what what were you thinking bounce back from that bounce back from thinking that there's a girl in Europe that's going to be your love and sending her $100,000 and traveling over there twice getting duped both times and then how do you bounce back from that the first thing you should do is not tell anybody like daughter take the L without just quietly just take it take it quietly and privately in Dona don't tell people his daughter knew about it and then the camera crew I mean that's why the fuk brought a camera down I don't know why I think the show vaguely remember this about 10 years ago I think the show was all people that were getting scammed okay about why people get scammed and what you know what is it that makes people believe ridiculous things and money those are two or people get greedy and I need somebody in the US with a US bank account to help me out with this and I'll give you a 10% cut and you know yeah but when it comes to romance and money those are the two or people get greedy I was going to say it's greed it's Greek to do only greedy people can fall for some of those things I mean you see some of those scams and it'll come through saying okay I'm just inherited 30 million dollars and I need somebody in the US with a u.s. bank account to help me out with this and I'll give you a 10% cut and you know that should raise a lot of red flags for anybody who's kind of thinking with that with a head on straight</div>

bytes technology person that had Social Challenges that probably over and over decades I just come to be more at peace with the fact that I probably do think a bit differently than most people I don't expect them to you know to think necessarily like I do and it anyway that keeps me from being upset at a lot of people and disabled people are different they're not going to process these things the same way that I do but yeah I can see it as show me a problem but I do think also there's this ability for people to people always want to say if they put down your phone why aren't you living in the real world and there's another aspect of that wear for many people the world that you get in the virtual world whether it's on your phone or all the way to VR the whole reason you do that should be because it's better than the world that you're choosing to step away from and again it's harder for many people that are innately thought leader position if your life awesome in every way that yeah you don't need that much from the virtual world whether it's on a cellphone or virtual reality and if you've been no Courtside backstage pitlane whatever if you've done all these things in real life the VR version of it is not going to be that compelling and if you saw people you'll fixated on all of that you probably think those people are not living in reality they should just be living in reality but for so many people I know what they get the people on the other side of the phone that they're interacting with that's where that's where they'd rather be the people can find their tribe out of the billions of people in the world even if they live in some Podunk town in the midwest I think that's a really wonderful thing and so while yes there is a negative tail on one side from it I am I think that this connecting everyone is largely a good thing on net there are downsides maybe there should be things we should be doing to mitigate the downsides but I think this connection of humanity is on that a positive thing I tend to agree with you the positive thing I think philosophically I think the way we understand each other the way we communicate it's very radically different than our grandparents and all of it seems to be moving in a place where we understand each other better and you going to have your side effects like Twitter rage and and social media bias and you know these confirmation bias groups where people just sit in these Echo Chambers and reiterate the same ideas over and over again and each other and you're also go get people better understand cultures understanding each other Understanding Psychology understanding the way the Mind work and getting access to information at a rate that's unprecedented in terms of the knowledge that you can get a just just being able to Google things and give them credit for Mark Zuckerberg Facebook leadership they talk about the mission is to connect the world and no course it's like oh okay of course the Facebook CEOs to be mouthing these things like I really legitimately do think that the Facebook leadership is doing this because they think that's a positive thing and I agree with them now I'm not a very social person I'm an introvert I'm a hermit mode sort of person so much of the time but I think that this is again a good thing that connecting more people giving them the opportunity to find people that they wouldn't otherwise be interacting with people they wouldn't even have known existed in many cases I think we'll come out of this and looking back decades in the future there will have been all the trash connecting more people getting them the opportunity to find people that they wouldn't otherwise be interacting with people they wouldn't even have known existed in many cases I think we'll come out of this in a looking back decades in the future there will have been all the tragic things that happened with social media but on that it's going to be good</div>

It's a great way to think comfortingly like obvious like work hard you can get better things be nice to people they're nice to you be like a bee be a good friend you get good friends eat healthy food you're healthier to the lack of variables that are very difficult for but there's also there's a surprising amount of life that's pretty straight so that is a simulation it's not the most difficult one to follow crazy and chaotic but there's there's a lot of comfort in it like as much as we try to do well on the horrors of humanity men's shirt and a lot of them has a lot of Beauty in people walk-in and there's no no audience just a bunch of people that get paid to make people laugh like Jon Stewart was back there Michelle wolf and really funny, so I'll just laugh and having a great time talking and it was so nice and so fun rewarding like this cool things in this life fascinating thought-provoking conversations does a lot of really positive things but it's pretty bad I mean it's not it might not be the dream like the Elon Musk scenario right away but it takes time to get there go ahead I mean his dream of like I mean like you said he's just like almost a superhero is Bruce Wayne you know he's doing whatever you know he's is Iron Man you know well you know some some cars have small engines right there's a Honda Civics out there and then there's f****** rocket cars he's got some sort of crazy Quantum rocket car engine for a brain If you talk to him he's actually on the on the list of people I would love to be in the studio with the music within you know just into his mind a bit I've been putting that out there to the universe in the background while talking to you how much is bouncing around in his head and any realize that other people weren't like that and it's like oh no no but I'm alone he's probably intellectual who's responsible for so many groundbreaking Technologies in other the number one electric car in the world SpaceX tunneling under La the boring company makes he's like that so cool to have like a true outlier all the crabs in a bucket don't like it you meet that guy like this game he's like my the top of my list is so you know being his presents but I think of you very exciting to try to do a song with Elon Musk</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you think about the original Luca and then human beings to ever try to extrapolate you have ever try to like keep the other process rolling in your mind and see where it we're just going to go at the end of the book I am not so Rosy picture of Robert of significant experiences in our lives that occupy the human mind one is the kind that we can call an awareness of facts you know this thing is here and the other is what we might call a self-awareness it's me that is aware that that is a bottle so that's a that's a Higher Love and that is what appears to be unique to the human mind ability to represent yourself as a subject noun words to have these subjective experiences that have a personal past it's not just the past but your past you lived it and a personal present and a potential future that you can imagine different scenarios of you existing in in the future so that requires that's called noetic Consciousness the ability to to self know about where you are in time and it depends that this is an idea that was proposed by a guy named endel tulving a very distinguished psychologist who's that retired now but his idea was that the unique aspect of the human mind is mental time travel the ability to protect ourselves in the past present and future and without that kind of Consciousness would limited too kind of factual information something is there you know that my I might be able to say oh food is there or drink is there or sexual partner is there but not necessarily that I want that food I want you know you might have a kind of biological urge towards it from the outside it looks like everything we do is intentional and willful so I think I'm controlling my behavior you think you're controlling yours I see you do something that I might have done in a similar situation I think you intentionally control that we see a dog doing something that would be similar to what we do we think we know why the dog is doing that because it had some intention but the fact is if we start taking these things apart in the brain we say that the systems that control very simple behaviors are not the ones that are doing all this high-level conscious thought take the example of the Ariat work on world is yours which is threat detection now the part of the brain called the amygdala is Cades of the detection and response to threat in a kind of basic sense you know threat comes up you freeze it there's a snake for example now it's because of that it's been assumed that the reason you freeze is because you're afraid and therefore that the amygdala is also making the fear because the amygdala experiences and that's why you produce the response but for the longest time and throughout most of my career I've said the amygdala does not consciously experienced fear and yet my work is been used to kind of cell and defend this idea of the amygdala is the brain's fear Center I think that's completely wrong my fault because I was not as Vigilant as I should have been when I have is described me to see what I did was I I would talk about the amygdala as an unconscious state of fear non-conscious implicit for you and I would say that while the neocortex it is where we consciously experienced fear in those are separate but that was too complicated the journal is kind of ignored it and it was just it was the brains fear Center even thus I just ignored it because you know we were studying and in I I kind of gave up after 1:30 okay we talk about internship here because you know that give us a lot of money to be directed towards research if you're studying fear and how you could treat that but I think it's you know it's been kind of a wrong path because it's led to the development of medications that don't really work so all the big things are getting out of love the anti-anxiety business anti for your business because people still feel fearful or anxious when they take them and you like Xanax in some cases you know not rather than buy some hypotheses so they only thing that's been discovered since then is more versions of the same thing with Kina slightly fewer side-effects there's been no new discovery of a new kind of drug that's going to help people and why is that well the way the drugs are discovered is that take a rat or Mouse put it in a challenging situation give it some different medications in the ones that make the animal lieutenant in those situations is assumed to make the animal less fearful that's why it was Timothy so when you give it to a person they should be left there. What you find say a person with social anxiety might find it easier to go to the party and they're less timid but still anxious while they're there and the reason is that we now know is that damage to the amygdala in a person doesn't necessarily also eliminate the feeling of fear gets rid of the the body responses but not the feeling so it was a misunderstanding of what the hell you can tell us we treat behavior is if it's an ambassador of the mine but behavior is really a tool of survival it goes back to those first cells that ever lived who had to defend against danger bacterial cells moved in there in the water and then they come across like you know what a gradient of some chemical that's a toxin soon as they detect that they bounced away and go in a different direction if they are going if they find a gradient of something that is a nutrient that keep going so they have the ability to detect what's useful and harmful in their lives these are not these are not there for psychology there simply there to keep the organism alive and many of the behaviors that persist throughout the whole history of life or like that they're there because each of the cells and cells in the body has to you know do all these things to stay alive until the organism as a whole has to do it as well defend against Danger nutrients balanced fluids thermoregulate reproduce so these are survival tools not mine tools that we can use our mind in conjunction with these thing and because we can we can flight every time we're freezing in the front of the snake to the fact that the fears what's causing it but the fear is a separate process it's the awareness that that stuff is happening to you that stuff is happening to you in the front of the snake to the fact that the fear is what's causing it but the fear is a separate process it's the awareness that that stuff is happening to you the weariness of that stuff is happening to you so that it said no self no fear</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> drugs you don't drink right you don't f*** around with anything that's like one of the things we talked like you know when we talked about how I'm sustainable is it that you have to not do the certain things that that make it unsustainable so I never really got into drugs I do talk about my book my first acid trip when I was 13 but that's good living s*** out of me to stay away from anything close to genic and like literally a 13 so I just stay away from drugs very very funny story but it got to the point where I just became this straight edge hardcore kid I became extremely religious because I was in this like I was 13 I was looking up going to be f***** with my wife like when you're on acid you're like f****** out that you're just so f***** up and and when you start thinking like this is how I'm going to be forever you're Clinging On to anything that can get you out right and for me when I grow up as a kid I'm almost putting into like Catholics and one of the best thing the Catholic schools do is indoctrinate kids on fear and so will you know like yeah I remember going out to the drawing board like it was like a a drawing of what hell is like guess who's going there forever people I don't believe you know and you know when you're young you start seeing that and and then we get into a place of vulnerability where you're like where I was I was like scared shittless I was like I'm going to go to an insane award when I'm 13 I can't get out of this acid he'll trip how long does it last I guess like what's 7/8 hours but every second is like a minute you know cuz you cannot sleep you cannot stop thinking about what your in I mean there is like it's like this exaggerated emotions like the first part of my acid trip was like I was so funny I was laughing and everything is like the best thing I ever did just laughing everything just everything's joyous and then like I went into the upside down world like stranger things when I got dropped off at my friend's house and everyone went dark and my friends were my friends 14 he doesn't do drugs so he was in The Mamas come down like a little kid like what the hell am I doing acid for you know I do talk about like where that came out but yeah so like when I was when I got flipped in that world then everything was like I saw Street Fighter out like Fireballs from why you coming at me like my clothes when I close my eyes it was very very vibrant and Vivid and I mean it was it's a trip for sure so once you regain sanity you were like enough of any of this nonsense this is for real like I I have f*** drugs and then I was like I'm straight and then I was like I'm all about God and Jesus is going to save me you know like you save me so like as a kid I was very religious going to start exploring more about the world and and then went more from this space or faith-based living through life to you know things that needed me work need any didn't make sense for me very much more scientific on like the understanding of how I wanted to see things where where did the change take place when does it take place college and post so you just became educated start learning more about things and then I don't know if there's like one spark that happened it was just kind of like I just had questions about why things happen like what what is religion like what you know you know how things work in the world House of size are built a little a little but I don't know if be like a philosophy class that I was taking was not really the the Crux of it sociology was my major I was women studies in sociology when I was at College women's studies those glasses so I just was like all right I'll try this one and then I was like wow this is actually pretty interesting I'll try another one and and then I'll just I'll finish off the major and you know I'd like to say like the stuff I learned in school it's in large part of how I kind of look through kind of like navigate to my life like sociology I am a sociologist I want to study people like why they do certain things you know like how do I navigate different directions in you've become a purveyor of great fun like that's essentially what you do professionally give people great time wild extremely energetic experience for people and they leave there's a certain level transformance right arm of watch them your s*** online and you do these enormous crowds and it's so epic and you see all those people going f****** crazy and dance along your s*** mean it's got to be a wild wild feeling knowing that you're giving us really positive experiences Fred roaring along to your music I guess you could say I'm addicted to that and because I care so much about that I have to be sustainable you know it goes back to what we're talking about like what do I need to do man you're going to look like an 80 year old man I'm 40 adults because you've literally burn the candle with a blowtorch if use that Elon Musk not a flamethrower candle you know I mean it's what you do and I always say if whenever I have the opportunity is that for the people in my crowds and I had to say country-by-country they're very different as far as like what I think if they're doing drugs are not where they do the most drugs oh I don't think so I don't but you know his heart beat like it's like I'm just judging right I don't know what what people are doing up there I can judge by how interactive VR that's what the best way I can tell that's the worst that's the worst like subject to play to it's like really plugging a cocktail party when their backs are turned are you the same kind of thing for me so if they're already high and they just like lost in their world like it's no fun for me but I spend so much time making my set so interactive so engaging and entertaining like it's bit disrespectful honestly it's different though it's more like chill like but if you're so like highs one stop your head where you can't you don't even know where you are or what's going on then like you just lose the whole experience I mean lots of times people wake up with what happened what's going on know where you are or what's going on then like you just lose the whole experience I mean lots of times people wake up with what happened what's the point of the experience if you're so blitzed out of your head you don't even know what's going on</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how do things like Xanax work what what's the mechanical process okay so the that's part of the class of drugs called benzodiazepine and they will a bind to receptors in the brain brain has receptors for all kinds of chemicals and many of these things are things that exist in nature and what the dump that they bind the receptor called the Gaba receptor which is the major inhibitory transmitter in the brain so when you have a benzodiazepine binding to a Gaba receptor what it's going to do is increase inhibition so the you know the kind of simple reason why those things can help is they kind of inhibit so they tone down the brain a bit and so things that would normally trigger a response no longer trigger so it's like increasing the three for something to bother you no sense in a lot of people would enjoy that with alcohol and not supposed to while it's alcohol also attacked those receptor so it's like a double effect on a plane to find Africa and she said I'm going to Africa hope I don't get AIDS just kidding I'm white LOL being funny and you left and she landed in Africa like that a bunch of funny trying to be fun right but she was on Xanax and drinking there and woke up completely oblivious and her life had been destroy them she was fired you know she was a social Pariah and I'm pretty sure that was Xanax and alcohol that she was blaming it on yeah well at least powerful drugs I dropped like that all of the drugs that we take go to the entire body and if they don't they're not able to just enough find their way that one spot in the brain to do their trip there this is your talk about Magic Bullet might be able to be targeted for specific circuits and but that's a fantasy at this point so if you reduce immigration in the entire brain yes you might we do you know anxiety but you're also going to change a lot of other things so you going to make for example for thought in the ability to rain in things like the stuff the woman to say more difficult because they're attacking the prefrontal cortex we have some inhibitory control over Behavior they're going to alter your ability to retrieve and store memories and to be able to attend to things and yeah to the extent that these drugs have a positive effect on some people it's been said that part of the reason is that it's kind of a general blending of emotion it's not an anti-anxiety drug is just kind of adulting of everything and you get bangs ID anti-anxiety as a part of that but if we want understand how to do better we have to figure out what does the brain circuit that's really making us anxious is and not just what's making us you know but not turning down everything it's kind of like they do you go to the restroom the music's too loud to myself please turn it down a little bit the music stays the same to same song but it's not as annoying as you turn the volume down and I think that's what a lot of what these medications can do is turn the volume down but after you take these things in your anxieties ramped up afterwards but I can be a rebound effect that can also be kind of a lot of people next day feel depressed no because it just does the stuff is out of your system and if he takes his kind of like taking sleeping pills ambien or of the same general anxiety Then the anxiety wants to come back even stronger that proposed and body set point that you're worried about something and all of a sudden that gets resolved I just makes room for the next except one for everything it's doing and that's just makes room for him to feel that feel that up if you're an anxious person you probably will always be somewhat anxious so there's no magic bullet that's going to take that out what you have to do is attack the process from knowledge of how it all works and that requires that we have a more sophisticated understanding that one then it's possible from Simply observing Behavior because Behavior does not tell you necessarily what's on the Mind Behavior tells you how the the the brain has responded but you know just to go back to the fear threat example when that say I bring you into the laboratory show you a picture of something like a a blue square polyglyceryl-2 used to be in my use now at Harvard did experiments like this and every time the Blue Square person to get a mild shock to their finger and so then she would present the blue square subliminally that means you're really quickly with the something that follows it the kind of massive and that prevents the information from getting into the conscious mind and so the person so that I didn't see anything but if you put the person in an Imaging machine fmri and image what's happening that stimulus that threat Square gets to the amygdala turned it on the heart begins to respond to sweating but the person has no fear the person doesn't know it's there and doesn't experience fear the amygdala is not about fear it's about detecting and responding to danger in order to be afraid that has to reach your conscious mind so that you can experience it as a state of this Audino at a Consciousness that were talking about self-consciousness that's hard for people to separate that's why that's why the medications are not working they're targeted to work on these underlying systems in rats or mice but that's not where we are experiencing are anxiety you don't like it they're probably all going off patent and because the company can't find anything new they're not going to keep pursuing it because it's not going to be a prophet anymore but still want them I mean it's you know I do think that for sample the drugs that are available to help people because it's important to reduce the behavioural timidity and the physiological arousal that goes with that cuz if you don't treat that then the conscious mind will be reactivated by those responses if you only treat the conscious mind then nautical stuff will bring the conscious stuff back and everything will

advocating from your perspective from an understanding of the human mind and all the systems that are at work it seems like that's really not the way to do it I mean it's you know I'm sure that that's the day and he's come to believe that he needs that much like an alcoholic it's like that's really not the way to do it I mean it's you know I'm sure that that's in a sense maybe that's his crutches

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it'll certainly we don't I think the have no idea what your position on climate changes but personally I think that things are happening and something needs to be done that's clearly things are happening and that a couple of editorials probably in the New York Times or something couple months ago one was about how yes the things are changing and we have a right to but you know we shouldn't worry about the Earth as famous quote this guy is a tough b**** so the Earth Will Survive but the configuration of life on it is unlikely to continue to be the same under those conditions the more that everything changes the conditions of life change in the first things to go this is what happened to the dinosaurs a large energy demanding organisms because as the canoe change the climate that we've lived in we've succeeded because we were able to benefit from that kind of client but as the client begins to change our kind is not going to be able to succeed as well because those conditions are not the Waters of rising the desert expanding all these things are happening and it's just not going to be you mean years and they come so I'll try maybe it'll help us get through this but that's only going to work if we can do that collectively that's the scary part we have to work together collectively as a world because these are not local issues these are Global issues Sunday this probably a profit motive underline that at some point sure people are conscious green dollars when you think about it and you think about the the conscious mind and the ability to create the creative process do you envision the possibility of some sort of a technological solution to a lot of the problems that we're facing I think it has to be a social solution social we have to we have to figure out how to balance this worldwide you can't we can do whatever we want in this country if we could do what we want to know if if if even if we were the best country in the world for the environment that wouldn't solve the problem you know it's it's a worldwide problem Amazon for us that's affecting a lot of people it's just not a it's not a simple thing that one country can solve right but if one country takes steps and imposes some sort of a technological solution that pulls carbon from the atmosphere that does enhance some sort of a cooling process to bring homeostasis to bring some sort of a like generally agreed-upon state of the environment that's technologically possible mean that's going to come out creative mind right now I don't want to go too far off of the my not area of expertise like climate and soil Labs I just think there's I think I would put in the kind of the social perspective and what I bring to contribute but I don't want to I don't think I can really tell us the details mitigated I think your creators coming along and trying to find Technical Solutions that's great when you analyze the human mind and knowing what you know about the thought processes in the way people think and work when you see people in denial of climate change and when you see people that are so enamored with the concept of capitalism and big businesses they don't really think that it's a big deal they want to deny that it's a big deal so they can continue short-term profits but what is that like those mechanisms like wanted watching that take place in Monkey mind what are you what are you thinking when you see that happen with humans I don't think it's simple it's not simply denial of climate change for climate reasons I think there's a lot of social within certain groups there's social stigma for being pro-environment yes and so it's it's it's kind of form of self-protection that by identifying a set of issues that we all can agree upon because they're kind of dictated top-down innocence or our thing and is somebody else's thing yeah that's a weird aspect of Being Human Being right these tribal identity things where if you are in this group you must be pro-choice in if you're in this group you must be pro-life you must be anti-war you must be pro-second Amendment know very little deviation and and that that's left right that's every now and then leave systems rigid belief systems you know part of this part of being when you look at politics and you know that these belief systems are the find it odd that we have those that like sort of Polar Opposites or at least left right choices red blue choices that we've limited ourselves to these very distinct tribes but that's yeah I think that's unfortunate but that's where we are is there a way out of that politics and you know that these belief systems are the find it odd that we have those that like sort of Polar Opposites or at least left right choices red blue choices that we've limited ourselves to these very distinct tribes but that's yeah I think that's unfortunate but that's where we are is there a way out of that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> therapy yourself I have you did you do that to examine this an Amy went into it with for the meditation important to try and calm some of my restlessness has writing in all this study that you had to do to write these books has that enhanced you gave me that you have much more of an understanding about what's at play than the average person does it all again to see it's kind of like the patient who's reading the emotional brain with their therapist I think by riding those books I learned a lot and it helps me see things and that doesn't necessarily help me lead my life any better but it's I think I understand it better but no self no fear means that you have to be have to have this on an already Consciousness ability in order to great and that is a special human quality the ability to put yourself in the moment in your past and then your future if it's not you that's going to be harmed by that snake then you don't have to worry about what it's going to do to you so if you are part of it then you worry and it becomes you know it's an emotion when when you're involved so I think emotions this is a crazy idea that's in the book The Emotions didn't arise do natural stool wow. That's the idea that they were byproducts of other capacities that came along first you had some kind of crude language that enabled is hierarchical and relational reason to jump across language gave you categories to like conceptualize things our reasoning allows you to jump across those categories and those kinds of things allow you to actualize yourself as an entity with an experience so you have to have a self that could do that kind of reasoning and across those conceptual categories and that is what enabled On Emotion the ability to put yourself into a significant situation so now that it's here now that we have once emotions are there then they become selected but they weren't selected by sample the amygdala having evolved to be the fear Center in inherited that from animals your animals probably have some kinds of experiences but it scientifically is very hard to know what they have like dogs but I don't let's talk about the brain for a second so the parts of the brain circuits in the brain that are involved in this kind of Audino Eddie commotion that I'm talking about the self-involved and motion that so human such a human quality the part of the brain that I think it's important and this is still hard Papa is something called The frontal poles very very front part of prefrontal Cortex that region is unique to the human brain no other not even another 8 past that now other parts of the prefrontal cortex are present in other primates all of the primates but not in any other mammal so if we can figure out in human brain what the frontal pole does and what that other part that all primary tab then that gives us an anchor for speculating about what other primates what kind of experience other primates have given what those parts of the brain enabling us and that would allow us to then extract what other mammals don't have that we have because they don't have those parts of the brain so it's it's a kind of no use of the brain to to tell us some things about what might exist what is no way to ask a dog what's on your mind Ryan Coogan measure the brain with an fmri or something along those lines we get a reading of scarlet if you ask me is there a pain here on the time I say yes I can respond verbally or I can point to it when I'm responding verbally I can only do that for something I'm conscious of I can't respond to something on unconscious of by naming it follows other animals can only respond non-verbally so they don't have that other kind of response that is only reflecting a conscious thing so I'm not saying they don't have anything but scientific was very hard to what the hell happened and the fact that we can study it we known for examples of fear that the fear itself probably doesn't depend on the amygdala but the ball the behavior that we see does makes us have to be cautious about observing behaviors that look like they're based on fear love and all these other emotions when we can't really know because we can't measure that it's a tough problem are based on fear love and all these other emotions when we can't really know because we can't measure that it's a tough problem again I'm not saying it's not there it's just like right I get it I'm physically</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> did you have a long-term Vision in terms of what you're trying to do with virtual reality and Oculus so I do and it's not something that people some people read this the wrong way and react incorrectly to it where I said that my pitch for VR is that that the the promise of er visits to make the world as you wanted where people do not have the it's just it is not possible on Earth to be able to get everybody all that they would want not have Richard Branson's Private Island there's just not enough driving them out of islands in the world to give them to people but even on a a much more mundane level not everyone can have a mansion of a house not everyone can even necessarily have a home theater room and these are things that we can stimulate to some degree in virtual reality now the simulations not as good as the real thing again if you are rich and you have your own home theater and mansion and private island good for you by we may still be able to offer you the convenience of being able to geniously get to different places but you're still probably not the people that are going to benefit most from it but most of the people in the world aren't in that position most of the people in the world live in relatively clamp quarters that are not what they would choose to be if they had unlimited resources and the technology curve for these things are this is $400 now we have an earlier one that's $200 that's less capable but these follow the cell phones price Curves in many ways we have 25 our cell phones in India now that are smartphones that do a lot of these things the technology crew Wars long baby crapping out in terms of absolute performance but we still got a lot of price performance that we can drive out of these things and we can have virtual reality devices that can get cheap enough that lots and lots of people will be able to have these and we can make better and better software and it can be a better world in many ways now people everybody points towards like there's this art piece of art that goes the internet of the sort of dystopian kid in the corner drewno drooling with glass goggles on with rainbow pictures on them and it's a terrible-looking place and people say it's like this is the world you're trying to deal with people plugged into virtual reality that ignore the world around them and of course the first rejoinder to that as well as his life really better if he takes them off and he's in this horrible place there but more concretely like I just came from in Dallas if a hundred degrees this week there we changed the world around all that we do we live in air conditioning and people nowadays don't generally go oh you're not experiencing the world around you because of your air conditioning you should be out there really experiencing the world now that is what human beings do is we know we been the world to our will and I think that a virtual reality that lets people do things that would not be possible in the world or it comes down to it not economical and a lot of people react negatively to any talk about economics but it is resource allocation I am here you have to make decisions about where things go and I think that economically we could deliver more value to a lot of people in this virtual fence we're at the very earliest age of it right now with the experiences that we have in the things you can do and how long you want to keep it on but there is a path to this comfortable thing that you can wear for hours at a time maybe you spend your entire work day working in it maybe your time after coming home is putting it on in and right now you can you can watch TV with someone else virtual reality mundane thing but you could have your sister or somebody that's across the country and you can have meat in a virtual space look over and see each other and you'll watch something on TV I all activities that do not require an actual taktl physical thing can eventually be subsumed in this where there are a lot of things that do require the Tactical stuff you're not going to be replacing food with virtual reality anytime soon but a surprising amount of things that people value are these largely audio-visual things if the decoration the museum that you walk through you're not fondling the individual things there you're experiencing things in a way that could with a good enough virtual reality experience be replicated there without the travel without the lines without the crowds you could have it private to yourself and there's so many things like this it's not everything it's two of your senses simulated fairly well but we can do an enormous amount with this and I always like in I'm almost a broken record in the company most people are tired of hearing me harp about this but it's all about user value know what I care about building things as an engineer the whole point is to bring value to the world and I think that virtual reality can bring a lot of value we're not there yet but very early days of their certain niches of people today that can get a great value out of this I don't pretend that this is something that you know everyone in the world can benefit from today but we're inching our way up towards that and that's how Great Value out of this I don't pretend that this is something that you know everyone in the world can benefit from today but we're inching our way up towards that and that's how that's how the world gets better is by building Technologies and distributing them people so that they have something better than they would have had if that didn't exist</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> where do you think selfishness came from automatic Consciousness so that's this ability to put yourself into an experience which as I said earlier is responsible for our greatest achievements as a species but also is what will potentially do is send it allows us to not only Envision a world in which you know we can be self left self not selfish but help others but also exclude others and I think it's a natural basic animal instinct to stay alive all this meeting with Richard Dawkins had the theory of The Selfish Gene animals are incredibly selfish and in a struggle for existence so that kind of automatic selfishness is there but what the automatic mind allows us to do is to be intentionally willfully selfish to allow us to choose to do these things for our own personal good for example I think that the the human mind is the only entity in the history of life that's been ever to put organism that were talking about the conscious mind being a small part of the what's going on in the car text to put all of the rest of the brain and all of the body at risk for the simple sake of mountain climbing swimming in shark-infested waters are taking drugs at dangerous levels no other organism can commit suicide in the sense of intentionally planning to put an end to an interview that it knows has a possible end so our conscious minds are special in good ways and bad ways I just minded seeks Thrills what do you think is the root of that I've always wondered like why certain people are drawn to doing like flips on motorcycles or certain people are drawn to climbing mountains with no ropes what do you think that is and I'm just guessing I really do but I think that we each have these kind of physiological states that that we try to maintain your some kind of our homeostatic levels are are different and some people need a little more adrenaline or little more to use adrenaline in the kind of cheap way of saying looking for those kinds of things to get the rush and it's it's sort of on the spectrum of a diction in a sense where you need that that physiological change that the drug induces but you know we also have addictions in our lives that are habits and things that that we develop and pursue that aren't necessarily good for us but that we kind of feel compelled to do what times and every time I talk to my hand start getting sweaty and he climbs these seemingly impossible mountains with no ropes and there's video of him doing it with his Drone footage of him climbing these Peaks and my hands just stopped pouring scrap watch it but when I talked to him what's really interesting is he's a rational intelligent man who's very thoughtful and he's he's a very kind of guy he's D doesn't seem like some you know I think of when I think of someone who likes to do flips off with a motorcycle or do freaked out he's not that guy and when he describes it was really interesting as he goes it's very mellow he's like if there's any of this really a thrill I've done something horribly wrong like the other real thrilled or so scary because it means you're about to die so he's instead of getting the thrill he's getting that piece for your risk-taking which is an odd thing about humans and they've they've shown through natural natural selection aspect of it with females and mates that females are attracted to men that do those crazy things and take crazy risks for some strange reason whether it's some sort of a remnant of our ancient past like that thrill-seeking man is got not going to be he's not going to shy away from combat he will protect our children or some evolutionary psychology you know that lot of that is speculative but it's the thrill seeker is that's what it's one of the weirder things when everything's great and you have plenty of food and you live in activities in like okay like I'm not getting enough juice here I'm going to have to learn how to hand gliders everything's great and you have plenty of food and you live in cities and like okay look I'm not getting enough juice here I'm going to have to learn how to hand glider so you know some people may do it for attention or yes</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> no measuring it in humans is I mean there's this concept of people I'm an emotional person you know I'm emotional I get emotional like people love to say those those kind of thing is it possible to measure varying degrees of emotional response in terms of like how it's affecting a person physiologically whether or not these emotional responses are physiological or whether you've gone down well Groove psychological path that you've been sort of participating in your whole life so that you have the sore triggers this happens and then up I'm going to start crying this happens up I'm going to get angry and people sort of fall into those path without self-reflection without this ability to be objective and introspective and go why am I reacting this way like maybe you should stop being so emotional Joe Wright never said that to you I guess my wife is sexy but what is that mean like what degrees of emotional response and whether or not those are beneficial or than that they detract from your experience or inhibit your your ability to be productive so you know you're really nailed a lot of interesting stuff in there and very kind of deep analysis of what's going on the problem is that our language is so bad that all these terms that we have we borrow from what's called folk wisdom or folk psychology and they come through the ages and this is true in every aspect of science that you have both terms of physics becomes real physics and then the stuff goes away. but in Psychology the folks stuff never goes away because we always experience the folk aspect of it when we have a conscious experience that's what our conscious mind is our folk psychology of ourselves and others and other animals but the underneath that is the part that we can get rid of the folk psychology up because we can understand behaviorist control how these physiological response to control and 8 because you know we've had fears causing it but when you're afraid you're almost always running from the bear and feeling fear but an Dental you assume that when you're running from the bear. What causes you to run but fear is not the answer fear is your awareness that all that s*** is happening to you but also the the ability to contemplate the consequences right but that's no possible either right wow it don't mean you need to self to be afraid yeah so afraid yeah that's gay you find yourself freezing are you walking in New York City and you jump back in the bus goes flying by so you've reacted to danger but only afterwards you feel fear when you cognitively become aware that that's happened well in that sort of a situation but in a situation like we were walking down a dark alley what's going to happen to not starting with your starting with anxiety worry about what's going to happen nothing there's nothing there that's made you but the wannabe ramps it up Hey Joe yeah I like to borrow some money from you is going to go into your brain and Trigger your muscle tension your heart to race and so forth and the dark alley is going to go to your cortex and you're going to be interpreting the fact that you're in a dark alley in your heart is racing in terms of being anxious and fearful and all of that but they're happening separately it's not one bundle it's like separate things in the brain and once we understand that it becomes I think I'm much easier problem how to approach problems if you're an anxiety you've got to currently treat the behavior in the physiology from the conscious thoughts and in between those two you also got to change the cognitions that underlie the conscious experience but also the cognitions can trigger Behavior so you know one of the things we we proposed I propose this in my last book and anxious was kind of test program for exploring this would be kind of a three-part 3-step program first you would have to do it with something simple like a spotter for a big spider phobia corn snake phobia called if so you would do exposure therapy subliminally that means you're the picture of a snake or the spider so fast the conscious mind doesn't know it's there what does the picture could be a film them and have to go very fast in the film so there was some of the picture you just presented really quickly and normal if you show a spider phobic try to do exposure therapy and now they can look at the picture without the body reacting they're not jumping they're not the other Hardison tracing because the amygdala has been turned off so I was body response if I have calmed down so now the person can kind of go some undergo some cognitive change about looking at spiders and so forth and then finally once you've done those two steps the brains ready for talk therapy and meditation and other kinds of approaches because all of the the impediment stall that have been put aside by the saddest first two steps so is anybody ever like officially cured someone of arachnophobia or video phobia fear of snakes or spiders like those are almost like deep-seated genetic fears we venomous snakes but there's something about some people have almost a logical reaction to it that it's often been speculated that this is some sort of a genetic memory have someone perhaps in their ancestry line surviving the snake attack or losing someone to a snake it's more that you're turned out that the it's more about the ability to rapidly learn about those kinds of dangers done to innately respond so there seems to be it's called prepared learning so you have an evolutionarily base thing that's with you that everyone has some version of the unit varies from Individual individual and in some people are prone to rapidly learn that either because of other experiences or because of their particular genetic makeup and so they tend to go down the road of of acquiring these kinds of phobias so it's the problem with treating that by just extinguishing it through exposure is that the extension is always in permanent enough you once you've been reduced nothing is wrong with this is true in a ride or person that said the rat has been given a toned it's been paired to the shop and then it hears two-tone 20 or 30 times stopped responding but then it goes back in the room of the chamber the shock of the curb the town will again bring it returns to the place where he or she was bitten by a spider or place responders of supposed to be present it can come back so these are imperfect temporary solutions they're not enough and that's why they're called These are called in a reinstatement medications can help temp that down a bit so medications are useful and in that sense of being able to control the behavior from the physiology but less so in terms of changing the mental state because how could you possibly design a medication that would know how to change the content of a a mental state that seems like an impossible and that's what you want to do it I want to change all mental States One content you know I'm afraid of yeah it's it's so fascinating though how people vary so widely in their their reaction to certain fears or just certain things that could induce fear whether it's dogs or whatever it rational thing that did will have the source of that is really often speculated that there's like some sort of a genetic component to it Dubai so let's say let's say in any kind of situation like that there are multiple systems in the brain during be involved with isolate the amygdala as in a hypothetical part of that system that is detecting and responding to the stimulus so we're going to go into the amygdala and focus on one little part of it called the lateral nucleus doesn't matter but it's the part that gets the input from the outside world so that is the Gateway into the amygdala so now let's talk about that say it's got 200,000 cells and neurons and each of those neurons it's going to have a bell curve that's based on the genes that made that sell and whatever kind of electrical signals it's had throughout the life of the organism so you can have mm bell curves you know various degrees that when the stimulus comes in those cells that that are activated that little bell curves are going to determine how much they respond to that and that's going to propagate to other cells that have the wrong Bell occurs in areas and so on down the line that what happens at the level of behavior is a very complicated kind of summation of all those curves of all those cells that happened be activated so it's not like you know one thing is programmed sound like a brain areas program it's all about what's happened at those specific cells both through genetics and experience so we often kind of oversimplify things by thinking well is it a gene or an area that has inherited that thing one thing is progress I like a brain areas program it's all about what's happened at those specific cells both through genetics and experience so we often kind of oversimplify things by thinking well is it a gene or an area that has inherited that thing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the brain reaction to Danger do you did you did you do any interviews with people who are soldiers or in a interview Fighters or people that are involved in the extreme activities that I haven't done a lot of interviews so I'm going to have to talk to people like that in individual cases are interesting because they give you stuff but it's not data so that you have to go out and collect what do you got there for notes going to pile notes or just thought I think we covered most of what I want to say maybe not primarily a tool of the mind it's a tool of survival we think we know why we do the things we do and others do them but we don't really because we are conscious mind is not privy to all of the things that the body and brain are doing exam in danger and you want to examine the mind and how it reacts to danger in fear and threats what we trying to get out of this when I started out thinking this was a way to study emotion and at the time I've been studying these these human patients with split brain surgery and alleviation of epilepsy it's a way to control epilepsy they can't be controlled in any other way medications not working so you have like young kids teenagers that have lived most of their life Paralyzed by epilepsy and not being able to lead a life that was one patient to basically his parents would constantly having to hold him down on a mattress he was seizing so often so extreme set of conditions and it's not done that much anymore but when it's done it's the connections between the two sides of the brain room are separated so information one side doesn't cross over to the other and so u-pull-a-part here and you can see where those axons are when you opened up in the top the Imagine like a hot dog bun and so you opened it up at the top and you can look down in the sooner and imagine that there was like a bunch of wires Crossing between the two sides of the bun so those wires within be surgically sectioned and so now you end up with two sides of the separate and independent so typically languages on the left side so you can talk to that side the right side doesn't have language so you have to ask what what can it do so if you preserve a stimulus that only the right hemisphere sees and you do that by flashing a picture of an apple on the left side of space cuz everything to the left of center goes to the right Hemisphere and everything to the right-of-center goes to the left hemisphere send a stimulus to the right Hemisphere and you say what did you see in the left hemisphere answers cuz that's where the languages he said I didn't say anything so you said reach into this bag and see what's in there the right hand goes in that's connected to the left hemisphere can't find it the left hand goes in connected to the right hemisphere which saw the Apple without the Apple so the information hemisphere can't talk about what is life like for people once they've done that operation was slowly if the left hemisphere kind of comes to dominate again and the you know that they come to live with it and how does it prevent seizures the folklore of it I don't know if this is actually true but what is often said is that it prevents the seizures from jumping back and forth having it because the the electrical activity jumping back and forth to get into the kind of in the solute that can't stop but cutting that isolates the seizures in the two hemispheres and makes each one more controllable by taking the medication Jesus sub you're interested in in in these patients said we were studying my this was my mentor Michael gazzaniga and I were we're studying these at Dartmouth medical school we were at Stony Brook out of Long Island Weaver drive up to Dartmouth to see these patients how does the left hemisphere coat with the fact that the right hemispheres performed behavior that they get the left hemisphere that you talked to didn't come and so we would information in the right hemisphere other guy would stand up why'd you do that I needed to stretch or in the left hemisphere would generate a narrative the made Its Behavior makes sense so that's why because at the time that we were doing this the idea of cognitive dissonance was very popular and what that means is that been cognitively when you do something behave early that is incongruent with what you cognitively know it's disturbing your causes dissonance until you have to engage in some kind of dissonance reduction so our hypothesis was the narratives that the left hemisphere is generating about right hemisphere with a wave of the left hemispheres conscious mind kind of keeping it all together the Consciousness thinks that it's in charge that you know the brain and body or it's you know it's it's the the control center and everything else is there to satisfy its whims and so would generate these narratives to keep that sense of unity going even though it's no longer unified that is so fascinating speak some sort of an explanation for the actions that you provoked but externally and that's why I got into emotions as well maybe a motion systems produce these yes I'm doing what I'm looking us up alien hand syndrome came up do you know anything about this I don't I'm sorry there's a long article explaining this thing called alien hand syndrome and also known as dr. Strangelove syndrome yeah do they generate an explanation when they do that said it just explains difference to us nereis people add like a leg walk in the wrong direction or reaches out to grab the nurse on the ass can I say that solution to epilepsy I know there's other solution set for that. That is the last ditch effort yeah and suffer severe severe cases I don't know really ultimately what became of all these people because I moved onto other fields and but I think in general they live a somewhat better life but I doubt they ever live a completely full normal life from it how could you after all that but I'm really interested in the brain creating is narrative to explain right they'll try to explain their life away and give themselves excuses and give themselves reasons for behavior and one of things you see with the more rational people if it's never their fault I always someone else's fault but that's the four billion years story that I had we got to these narratives that's what it's all about give themselves excuses and give themselves reasons for behavior and one of them to see what the more rational people if it's never their fault it was someone else's fault but that's the four billion years story that I had dinner at we got to these narratives that's what it's all about</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> put these the systems that are in place and the all of the various things that have gotten us to 2019 is it any one species when you study anxiety and he study fear and all these different things is are we experiencing high levels of it because there's not as much real physical danger as our ancestors experienced and it's almost like we're looking for it but it's not necessarily they are like we're we're to be able to deal with it. That's a good point I hadn't thought of that way but I think that's a good way to think about it means you know the philosopher Kierkegaard said that anxiety is the price we pay for the human ability to choose and this is where our automatic Consciousness comes in our ability to think of ourselves as having a past and future to be able to plan and choose in the future yeah he said it started with Adam making the first the human in the Garden of Eden in Dallas Where it All Began so and I'll bility you know you can rephrase that statement by saying our ability to choose is what allows us to be anxious because that is what anxiety is a worry about what we're going to make the right decision and how can we deal with this thing that's coming up it's a worry about the future ability you think about the possibilities might like what could go wrong when I go right am I doing the right thing and then to contemplate all those various choices anxiety feel like you're walking through the woods as a snake you might freeze but almost instantly that fear that is generated by you freezing and seeing the snake morphs into anxiety you know will the Snake Bite Me bait to bite me when I get to the doctor will they have the Attic if I died would love of my family need to do that's worried that things on you so these are the kind of separate spheres about danger that's present anxieties about one that hasn't happened yet almost always as soon as you're afraid of makes you anxious about what's going to happen and then there's General existential angst the life itself what is due to our ability to conceptualize to imagine things that have never been imagined before to create art to build to create architecture build buildings imagine going to the Moon designing an instrument to do that and actually pulling it off and make sure to get back all of that is something that our special kind of enables but it has a dark side which is it also allows us to be incredibly selfish and self-centered and narcissistic and to support tribes and groups and you know unless we I mean I think the world survives best when it's either completely isolated all the cultures isolated or if we could also somehow be together and more unified way cuz of the direction we're going now where each country is isolating itself but it's still so entangled with all the others is a recipe for disaster is this because we evolved essentially without long-term travel and we would kind of evolved to stay in whatever area the resources were in when we were hunters and gatherers and then somewhere along the line somebody how to get on a horse and the next thing you know you're visiting people I think it's more about you know we have a special kind of inquisitiveness that we can because we can mentally model the next step and plan what are the options to try to anticipate the the problems that are going to come up and take those steps and end that's a pretty special thing but it also allows to plan in the kind of devious way where you know me or my group is going to benefit and if mine benefits I don't want the other one to benefit cuz we got to keep everything separate so it's you know Consciousness are kind of Consciousness is our greatest achievement but also probably our worst aspect it is imagining humans with no consciousness to this thing as the human race is it managing our Consciousness or perhaps maybe work like yours giving us the tools to understand what are the mechanisms involved that maybe that can help us sort of navigate our biological traps and maybe</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> also Bernard develop this insane discipline while in prison that the hardships of prison were so awful the feeling of being locked up and contain that he f***** up his life he was so bound and determined to become something special that means so disappointed even beyond that like he opened up his eyes and you looked at the landscape and you realize that most Fighters are not discipline most Fighters they like the idea of being a champion they like the idea of winning you know championships and what that brings not the championship of what the championship in the money brings you the lady is that you know the party and all the stuff and he said imma do it a different way like these guys are out gaining weight 20 pounds in between fight I'm going to live like a Spartan he under he got the Revelation and he just stuck to it. Clean leather cleaner and he thought so disappointed he fought so smart he was one of the best defensive fighters ever just and people didn't like that style start doing the things that maybe they shouldn't have done and then he would capitalize knows things I meant when he fought Trinidad man let me know if that was his wife and I love to you I do too I mean he was a killer I got a chance to see 200 fight live in Vegas once was amazing but when Bernard started putting it on him all the while this is first volume this is like a legitimate middleweight finding guys really a welterweight and this is also a really special fighter but just figures people out Tito in New York City in Madison Square Garden glitches glitches little Puerto Rico like you know I think it was the week of the Puerto Rican Day Parade lights and previously to that fight in Puerto Rico Bernard Hopkins took the Puerto Rican flag through it down call Dan maillet had to run out of there get snatched out of the Arena where they were having a press conference get thrown on the plane like that the beef was real and to be able to like like perform under that kind of pressure unreal one of my favorites he was running away from the crowd in Puerto Rico and you realize I got my God he's on his own here like literally people trying to kill him but whip what's even crazier is he knew that was going to have you back to the back of the bus if he wins the fight what you did he moves on to become great yeah he moves on to Greatness you know what's interesting when you watch his style as well. Very technical very disciplined Style vs Roy style which was so athletic and explosive and very unusual with that lead left hook that he would fire off more than a jab Monroy a crazy style and then we watch Royale Point Bernard early but then Bernard comes back later his career and really kind of like shot Roy down and shows like it when the athleticism starts to play a little bit Roy is normal human where is Bernard was still this incredibly disciplined very well-drilled boxer was a real good lesson for fighting to see the D-League this is why you use the fundamentals this is why you fight correctly you can get away with being Roy Jones jr. or Roy Jones jr. with his physical gifts I feel like he got away with fighting discipline to you could have got away with fighting technically but you know he just chose to fight his way for a long time work until it didn't work better than anybody made it was amazing to watch in the day when he was on top you know when he was knocking out Virgil Hill with body shots and put his hands behind his back and now I can do without me know the guy fell in love with you know he could have gone and have full career and rode off in the sunset and then in Pensacola Fishing hunting doing whatever he does and still not really been super fundamentally sound but I mean after you beat John Ruiz do a championship of the world and I've been going to multiple Roy fights leading up to the heavyweight fight Antonio Tarver will have a lot of respect for you know they were rivals in Florida when they were young Antonio was following her around trying to get him to notice I'm trying to get him to take a fight and I remember clear as day in the post-fight press conference after Roy became the heavyweight champion of the world after being in middleweight champion starting at 160 West Conference East Edward Jones you been ducking me you've been running he's going on and on and on Roy looks at Target in and gives him the attention that he's been after and he said he said I'ma whoop you whoop you make that happen and at that moment I'm thinking like know enough lb of muscle that he had built up Mackie shilstone to get ready for the heavyweight fight went down there for the clothes fight but he didn't look like himself took the rematch that I'll even after the first fight with Harper may you run for the hills you know what I'll be them I went myself and going back up took the rematch and then got knocked out earlier my brain scrambled here cuz I thought that was immediately after they're knocked out heavyweight went down for October the first time they fought the remastered and got knocked out so I can talk two times in a row they fought two times in a row and then they ended up fighting a third time like waiting on the road to get really I didn't even know that the loss of the wait was a terrible idea let's be realistic about how we put that weight on is most likely there's some Mexican supplements involved and it made him to put that in bulk on you know I mean I don't know and I've heard people say stuff like that but like I'm that's my guy I like I'm a kid so I'm like no I get it I'm believing that it was just ruined Mackie shilstone and Hardware, leave it at that I really only game maybe 10 15 lb still if he was lean as f*** he was pretty lame phenomenal you a picture of Jamie yeah that's my guy know I'll listen I'm a gigantic Roy Jones jr. fan but I mean I feel like that's there's one example right there but you see it almost more why was fighting me really had like a body built to hook you know what if Jones remained heavyweight it was a Tyson fight on the table and I believe I'm actually when I say this it was somewhere around forty million guaranteed there's an upside to you stay at heavyweight keep the weight on at Tyson wasn't quite Tyson at that time dangerous but wasn't quite Tyson I think they were working toward it from what I've heard they wanted more money James Prince was like bro take this 40 million there's going to be an upside as you and Mike Tyson Roy Jones or Mike Tyson Roy some house had no I'll be there later on down the road put his attention toward Antonio Tarver the rest is history why I'm kind of glad in fight Aizen I want to see him fight Tyson and ride off in the sunset Uno my head 2003 Fight Card 2000 Antonio Tarver the rest is history why I'm kind of glad in fight Aizen I want to see him fight Tyson and ride off in the sunset Uno my one more Jones had 2003 Fight Card 2000</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> did you get involved in grappling how do you have time to turbocharge Ferraris where do you come up with the extra time to do all those other things always get enough sleep like I I do not work well like I said I can't work more than 13 hours if I if I don't get 8 hours of sleep I also start falling down but there's a lot of hours left in the week after your 8 hours of sleep there I like on the martial arts side it's it is kind of interesting where I am get rid of Midwest YMCA Judo back then I wasn't any kind of a Phenom I was in a sort of second-place finisher for most of it but it was still weird enough that the content of the school geek was pretty good at that type of stuff I am I messed up my knees a little bit doing that and in retrospect I wish I had pushed on a little bit more with that we're in recent years I sort of tried to challenge the wrestler ethos the embrace the grind two people where it's like discipline is something I was always obsessed but I could have done with a little more when I am when I was younger and I probably would have been better off if I had I kind of stuck through some of that the wrestling side of things I am but I got back into it in my thirties where it was kind of something I'm just again one of the between projects well what interesting thing do I want to take a look at and I looked up some of the local Judo places and it was interesting where the place is called Becerra Judo and I'd come again from Midwest YMCA Judo which is just you learn your moves and it's why it's not that serious but this was a he was a Cuban Olympian and it's still judah's mostly kids you get mostly I kind of teenage kids coming in but I go in there and he's just yelling at the kids and berating them it's like get up grab the key and all this stuff much more serious training environment but I got in there that I am I go down I base out and then the guy would roll me over an armbar me like three times in a row cuz you know early teens I YMCA they didn't teach you the arm bars or anything but that was enough it's like I was having a good time with that and so I did what I was doing something I studied you know I went and said well okay and got pretty good at that and then my wife Christmas one year got me a year of private lessons with Carlos Machado and that was where I certainly took me up several Levels by I was in a situation where I had underwear space my rocketry company at the time we had enough space so I had a whole bunch of mats that out there and I would work with Carlos and one of the other guys there on Saturdays and he really turned me up where I had a really good straight armbar that was my go-to for everything in against most of the Judo people that it was just most of them wouldn't know what hit them on that I would just be able to get that over and over again and there's a. There where I had to go pick it up at the club on one day and then I had to do with one of my coaches and other day and then Carlos on Saturday. There were I was pretty dangerous although I was I was always one of it I never did work out proper flow kind of fun just the way you just got to roll effortlessly always a very tense aggressive gato Grappler and an interesting thing about that where do you know from Fort Wayne with any of that the really good guys I like rolling with Carlos it's always happy funny smiling and you always thinks you should be able to do something but just actually can't but in contrast with that one time when I went to Japan I stopped in at the kodokan you're the home of Judo and of the ancestral land of Judo and you know it's funny we're talking with a friend about that also did some Judo where you think that that should be like going to the Jedi Temple it should be this Majestic thing but it looks like an old middle school when he go there until you actually get out onto the mats there but I remember I I did some rolling with L Judo gyno gray-haired guy practice English with me and it was shocking how different it was versus rolling with Carlos we're still he was way way better than me but it was a sense where when I was rolling with him I just felt I had no options like for whatever reason I was just always bound out that I couldn't do any until eventually get my arm and I tap as opposed to the fluidness with Carlos where I'm like running around taking off I just do this maybe I'll be able to get you know get around it in wrestling in one in Judo when I was a teenager and so that's why I still got these little stick legs cuz I can never lift what you do heavyweights because my knees gave me problems so I wound up with strong upper body and really nothing on the on the legs did you get your knees mride I never did this was back in life no so by the time I was in my thirties they generally felt okay so that was when I decided I'm going to go back into Judo and I and it's been all right for quite a while and it's you know it's interesting there were a lot of people are surprised that I care about this like I tweeted about going to the UFC in Dallas and there are number of people that are like yeah this is shocking and disappointing that yukino that you like seeing people harm each other and there is one interesting thing at the club where there was a new kid that came in and hell he was probably here because his dad thought he should toughen up a little bit you know very not forceful person I am and when he found out who I was he said what is someone like you doing here and it just didn't compute for him that I somebody that was a technical kind of Brainy sort of person would appreciate like a rolling it a judo club and and and I probably agree with his you sense where they felt the physicality of it they've had to push as hard as they can and maybe not get through and learn that find the extensive what you can and can't do on what the limits of your body are and I think that's good for almost everybody to get that at some level I mean even if you don't care about the competition in the winning but kind of knowing what's possible and the different limits there I think is valuable agree wholeheartedly and I love the fact that you got into it because I would like to encourage so many more people to variance that there are there's many things going on simultaneously there's a tactical aspects of the various moves that they understand the point of Leverage and how to get to a superior position that is also the physical exertion aspect where you are you're managing your body's resources and you have a finite amount of energy and you can't burn it all out quickly so there's this sort of management game that you're playing and then on top of it it's like you you have to be able to be it's you have to be able to put yourself in a good state of mind while you're uncomfortable and so many of those Lessons Learned From that are applicable to everyday life and they they give you a higher threshold for discomfort a higher threshold for pushing through obstacles and understanding boundaries and how to overcome them and how to increase your physical engine how to strengthen your your meat vehicle the hammer and sometimes you're the nail and a lot of people do go through much of their life I am going without ever really internalizing that when it's always no participation trophy or whatever but it's like sometimes you get your ass kicked add that can bring it you can come back stronger after yes it's good for you it's actually good for you and it's an amazing camaraderie is particularly grappling as I found that grappling the camaraderie is much nicer than striking I came from the Striking background because the thing about striking there's a camaraderie a deep camaraderie with people that you would go and compete with your hurting each other where is in grappling you're not really hurting each other the same way and you can kind of Do It full blast and you appreciate each other because iron truly does sharpen iron in them in there so many times I remember just driving back from the eye from Judo where I just have a big smile on my face was thinking that was really great sharpen iron and there's so many times I remember just driving back from the eye from Judo where I just have a big smile on my face was thinking that was really great now it's like the Judo Club was in a little bit of a sketchy area of town to my wife was always like you can never drive your Ferraris to Judo practice</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you talking about the end of Moore's Law what what is the limitation that we're facing technologically with why is it going to wire why is there going to be a point where they can't get any more powerful so the way I had the chips work is you have these I am they wind up sketching out basically wires onto that the Silicon chips and they have gotten so small that the wire that the current flowing through is a handful of atoms wide which is just astounding if you think about it fundamental elements of matter and the wire is the small integer number of atoms wide now in theory you can keep going down and say well maybe we can make a one atom wide electrical path but you wind up running into eventually all these Quantum effects where if you make a very narrow wire you pack them very close together you have two wires there an electron won't necessarily stay on that one wire a conductor that you wanted to be on because of the way I Quantum Mechanics Work it is going to wind up jumping the quantum tunneling there is a percentage chance and Quantum is all about Randomness like that but an electron flow in here there's going to be this chance but it just teleport essentially to Anil by wire it takes this discrete Quantum jump to another wire and this is reality it's shocking it's not intuitive people have a hard time kind of grasping a lot of this by Quantum tunneling is a real thing and we are bumping into Quantum limit they can still shrink more we are right now we're at we're down at 7 nanometers in the latest. Although there's all sorts of issues with marketing speak about exactly how they measure if they're still getting smaller and there's still room to get smaller still but the end is in sight it can't go too much and one of the things that becomes an issue is just the economics of it each generation has gotten more and more expensive if you went back 30 years there were a whole bunch of semiconductor places they could Fab different ships you could go ahead design and you could shop it out to a whole bunch of different places find the one that work best for you but it's come down to the point now where it cost billions of dollars to make a new Fab and at the high-end processes you're left with just dsmc Samsung and Intel I'm very few companies no AMD held on for a while until they spun there is out and it's so expensive that will see a couple more so it'll still make chips cheaper somewhat faster more cores on them but it is going to get it into the line but I hold out hope for potential other things know there are directions that you maybe you have your carbon nanotube wires or you're starting able to be able to do some things with photonic processing and different ways there are possible outs for it but I don't know that any of them are sure enough thing to really be counting on at this point it's so hard for a dummy wrap my head around that but when you're talkin about these wire Sophie's wires its size dependent when they get too small then this Quantum tunneling becomes completely unpredictable is that what is said if you drive like a probability density function of I like you got a particle and you like to think about particles as being like this hard little billiard ball that sitting here in this specific place that's sort of the you know the vision that you used to see in grade school textbooks about he was an atom moving around but in actuality they're really these these distribution functions they it sounds so weird but they have a chance at being in all of these different places and this is not a curve that goes to zero there is a nonzero chance that a given atom you could wind up being a macroscopic distance away but there is a real chance that it could wind up being a few atoms away so the you know the electron moving around at the edge of this wire if it just says well I got some being over here and if you've got billions of these are quadrillions probably electrons moving around in this even if it's a small chance rental he's going to jump over there in enough of them jump over and all the sudden you got 2 wrong didn't you got a mistake so we start fighting all of that by doing error-correcting codes and doing ways that there's this whole set of Technology about how you work with unreliable systems which starts getting hurt it should start making you feel a little bit uneasy that okay we're going to have this error rate but we're going to buy carefully crafted codes allow ourselves to constantly be failing constantly having errors and still getting the right answer in a statistical enough case there's a lot of things like the way your cell phone works with the way to radio signal is I interpreted as a lot of things that do work in this sort of probabilistic way but when people are used to computers as being this accurate thing where you always get the right answer that sense of moving to something that has a larger chance or is a more probabilistic computation still feels a little bit sketchy and see there's a lot of things that do work in the sort of probabilistic way but when people are used to computers as being this accurate thing where you always get the right answer that sense of moving to something that has a larger chance or is it will probably stick computation still feels a little bit sketchy in some ways</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when we talk about technology and you talk about the exponential increase in the powers of technology is it possible that we could come to a point in time somewhere in the future where there is no way to encrypt anything where it's not possible to hide things where we won't be able to do Banking online we won't be able to have digital currency because virtually everyone will have access to all the information freshly digital currency or anything it's encrypted it's just information rights just ones and zeros is it possible that technology will reach a point time where borders and boundaries are impossible so one thing a lot of people don't appreciate about cryptography is there's a really straightforward way to make completely unbreakable cryptography and that's what's called a one-time pad wear if you essentially have along you are very long set of data and it made it as long as nobody else has it you can encrypt anything with it and if it was generated randomly properly you always have to worry about flaws in your random number generation or your random number Source but a properly generated one-time pad is unbreakable not a problem is it's finite so you have a fixed amount of it and all of the really Serious Pie craft would you do something like that where you got the one-time pad you can send a message through it in the old days when you were manually doing it you might only have a book with a certain number of pages and once it's over it's gone and you can't get me about returning to base but this is always a possibility and as we've seen storage densities increase so much the fact that you can get a little micro SIM card that's holding a hundreds of gigabytes now which is pretty remarkable you could imagine a world like it we did have this Quantum apocalypse we're all of these shortened 512 1024-bit Keys whatever all those just gets smashed irrevocably you can imagine a world where the heck maybe people start implanting the one-time pad inside people so you know whatever you need to encrypt it's coming from you has this you know this clear unbreakable key that you're working with do you think they were going to have things implanted in our body soon with it. Allow you to interface with computers or technology wireless internet I think it's possible that it will. We have people that want to do that right now talking with the north link people the idea that of course right now you store off you say you take somebody profoundly disabled and you put them in a laboratory and you try to train them how to use this but we were all saying that what you really need is a programmer to get this interface you need to be able to let a programmer actually program themselves on their interface and you will make a hundred times more progress than this previously disabled person coming into the lab for a couple hours a day and it was funny the conversation there where I wear their guys would like the basic rules so they don't stroke themselves out in like okay yeah that's kind of important talk about health and safety rules there but if you start getting a programmer in there that starts running this so like all right instead of just going through these basic exercises they run everybody through you really understand exactly what you're doing and you change it you write the code as you're experiencing it and there are probably people volunteering for dinner ready to go do that have something like that I read an article sometime after that about one of the early neurosurgeon that didn't plant himself with some Electro he had to go to one of these Fringe countries that didn't have any ethical guidelines around the medical practices are when everybody paid a neurosurgeon one of those countries to implant an electrode into his head and even had some complications afterwards there's like no there's a dedicated researcher having the conviction to do the experiments on themselves and you've got to respect that we're it's one thing to make a grant proposal to set up a study to do all of this and it's another one to say dammit I'm so confident in this I'm going to have someone cut a hole in my skull and implant this in be so we can learn the lessons what was his complications from affecting changes as a result of wired article I think from number of years back but this was like a single electroknit was just doing very one bit for one analog value computation and he had a little transponder kind of put in under the skin of his skull head big lump on his head with that while interesting again did the neuralink stuff all modern high-tech where you kind of power with RF through the skull and it's got a little plug-in I won the first when you on first kind of approached me about I've been talking with him about that the idea insightful was this idea that the aisle levels that they were doing on the neural anchor they were planning on doing with that was fairly close to what we do on virtual reality we're okay we've got theoretically maybe up to a million inputs here and a billion outputs and I can run those numbers and say well that's kind of like the cameras that were taking an into display that we're all we're putting out and I made the point that well you probably could run that off of like a Qualcomm chip that we've got in here you'd set it all up as I turned them into you set it all up as I turned them into work on Mickey lanes for the input and output make the inputs look like a camera and make the outputs look like a display screen and you could then run software on something like what we use here to drive your brain like the programmer could then going to start running some of those experiments with it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so how did you get involved with turbocharging Ferraris like what because that's a No-No in the Ferrari always encouraged modifications of the cars even from the early days people of hot rodded Porsches but when you f*** around with a Ferrari people get really upset at you computers I I knew what I wanted I would much rather have you know a new Apple then I look at a Porsche or something like that and my first car was this very boring to Volkswagen Jetta as like Head Drive me around I was just fine somebody wrecked out you don't ran into it and looking around for the next car my I worked on cars and he had an old British MGB in his garage 1st and Noe many ways they're just terrible terrible cars but I fell in love with it was just beautiful and I and I started I had to learn all about cars at that point because in the clutch master cylinder broke the very first day that I had it and just everything is breaking all the time and it's a pathetic weak little engine that you can make it a little bit faster by doing some of these different things and I went through the like many other things I've had in my life learning stage where I start reading the hot rod magazines and track or something it again this is Midwest Missouri where I grew up where all the basic ins-and-outs of the cars there I am going to go on and started software and start getting successful and I do the natural upgrade from an MGB after it after it gearbox eats itself I buy Miata which is sort of the modern slick version of a British sports car and I was going along okay for me I enjoyed it but almost on a whim one time I went in the Ferrari dealership in Dallas and here I am at I like Wolfenstein days so I guess I was 20 years 20 years old or something and I'm into that t-shirt ripped jeans and a walking to the car dealership and say I am garage they had it for a 328 which is kind of the fancier version of the Magnum PI car from the earlier days and I thought it was just the most beautiful car I am I really wanted to get it and what I wound up buying it it was interesting because the salesman gave me a little bit of a talk where he said you know if someone in the Corvette pulls up next to you and just going to hang your hand out the window like you got a thousand horsepower under the hood and that didn't sit well with me that was like this idea he kind of knew that those cars weren't actually as fast as they looked or you're their reputation would have and that there's this play that you would do to just kind of not get into a situation where it doesn't hold up to its looks and I was like no I don't like that and so I wound up calling around to all the different shops in Dallas where like okay I've got a Ferrari 328 I want to make it a little faster and I've done all this stuff on my MGB back in the day end up doing with the intake and exhaust and cam timings and the options there but they were all basically horrified like you just don't do this to a Ferrari in like the only suggestion that came out with how we can put in Italian to the exhaust on it and I'll let you know I'll make it sound better and maybe it's good for a couple horsepower or something at those are things that people largely due for the Aesthetics is oral or visual with it and that's not a big move and right about that time John Romero at the office had I picked up there's a copy of Turbo magazine I'm back in the day and there was an article about an old replica I'm I'm kind of race car done by a local company in Dallas called on Norwood Auto Sport or Nord AutoCraft and the beginning of I am kind of all the science project experiments what is the 328 have standard horsepower the best probably the European trim it was probably around 350 engine in it when it was at like five hundred or so and I went through a long history of melting many pistons in the diff bison different cars but that wound up being this decade-long set of interesting experiments there that was my gateway drug into working on this and like okay we made all this power in this system we know it's kind of at the limits of a lot of things in the chassis after we melted the engine there we tuned it back down a little bit that's the way so many engineering things wind up going to do it until it breaks can you dial it back a little bit and you stay there curb weight really thought you could really feel it rear back when you went into it and I'm at by speed is a little bit dirty if you start getting up in 1:54 tomorrow so we thought well what's the next level where do we go from here so I'm here done a job on a Testarossa before which is bad and it was a bigger 5 liter Flat 12 so there's a lot more possibility for doing things there so I got I got a Testarossa and we said all right we're going to do the twin turbo job with intercoolers with the new engine management systems and we went through this long string of upgrades through this which generally was like okay we melted the Pistons we broke the input shaft all these times but at is top-form in Peak I still have the dyno sheet for 1009 horsepower at the rear wheels none of this crank horsepower talk this was over a thousand horsepower at the rear wheels and it was amazing that sounds ridiculous what is standard horsepower if you were on the highway and you could just downshift 2/4 you could go from 50 to 150 faster than anybody's business it was with that much horsepower you know I would run down Superbikes it would it would just be faster than anybody it was shockingly fast and really pretty well so we we had a super track car are anything but I could win him if I could move him around the tracks reasonably well but the main thing about this was this just ungodly amount of power it was this see Jesus effect when somebody died takes a ride in it and like okay we're going you ready for this and you have enough space and for all of those years and ID software or building was positioned I off of this we had this long Highway access road that led down to it and I mostly more often than not I was working kind of night owl hours and always so loud I'm kind of obnoxious in retrospect but I am I had this puschel dragstrip basically every day when I would go there and everybody in the building until Taco John's coming which is sort of the signal better get to work and look busy by the time he gets up here and it was especially in the early days before we got some traction control dial then it would get really squirrely just because when the Boost would come up fast enough on there it would tend to throw the car a little bit sideways and I'm happy that I can I can say I do know I never spawn a car on the one of the big cars on the streets I did spend my little MGB when I was learning how to drive as a teenager but I never did that with the big Ferraris on public roads although there was one time at the Motorsports ranch when I pitch my F50 like through the infield just spinning it around over and over in the world most expensive lawn mower that brush one that was that was there some pictures of that going around recently where was a little bit weird sketchy because it was a turbocharged there's it really wasn't technically legal in Dallas most of the time we would make it legal sometimes but much of the time it probably wouldn't have passed an emissions test and it really wouldn't have passed the California emissions test so have a conversation piece and I think eventually wound up selling and I think I got a message from someone last year that still had it so it's still functional at this point which is saying something because it had an early almost one-off halltech engine control system that probably no one can do anything to right now you probably have to completely replace it if something went wrong with it but Testarossa eventually detuned it a little bit down to six or 700 horsepower or something and somebody bought it from and I felt he might have been buying more car than he should have at that point we'll basically it's going to break again it's going to have problem that he wanted and I think that he got some great satisfaction out of it but I know it broke again on him later and and I think he had to get rid of it I know after that then I had I had a Ferrari F40 beautiful beautiful car and that was the only color that I didn't really modify only did was turn the wastegate that also is making all Paisley race trim at 40 there and their forties an interesting car in that it has any of those early days the turbos weren't nearly what they are right now it was a small engine 2.8 liter because it was suspect for racing really was forever race car and if you didn't wring its neck it was a pretty slow car if you just like I told it off it felt like a Honda Civic it was terrible at the low in you had to really rub it up and flip the clutch out get it up on Boost but it was it was car because it was like this amazing race car that you're driving around on the road and I was still wear didn't have internal door handle to have a little pull cord inside their which led to the point where there was one time I was getting at valet part and you could tell the valet that had to go get the car for me is like this is okay highlight of the week gets to go drive a Ferrari F40 and he pulls it up and you can't figure out how to open the door so all this brand-new everyone else working with him looking at him and I had to come over and tell him how to get it out do you like the worst is time there do you still do that do you still have cars like that no right now I am all about the Tesla where I have I have a p100d and I think it's the best car I've ever owned by far so I've gone through all of these hyper Exotics and I love my Tesla I have the same as fast as anything is the fastest car ever driven to my life compared to time that you're driving is you know my point about then I thought about how anti-social the old cars were where I did you could not just go use that she would have to plan ahead we're okay you make sure that you got enough room with the other traction issue going here you're going to cover a huge amount of distance it was so loud you really wouldn't want to do it in most places but the Tesla is so magical where I had one of the first roadsters and one of the other people taking out for drives they said you're driving a whale gun which is actually you are magnetic pull on the car and you just put push the throttle down and it just goes and it's this amazing feeling and it's not antisocial every stop sign you stop at you got traction control it's not burning rubber and it's acceleration is so confusing to people like my wife hates it and I've had people in my car and I know you ready for this Siri is there cuz it doesn't seem real doesn't seem like a car that looks like you know a nice 4 door sedan should be able to do that so that the launch is definitely really something but I am compared to like if you're if you're already moving the the old Testarossa with a thousand horsepower was a very different Beast where that Jesus sends that you get at the very beginning it's that magnified extended for quite a while as you're running up through 150 miles an hour or so yeah cuz it doesn't seem real it doesn't seem like a car that looks like you know a nice 4-door sedan should be able to do that so that the launch is definitely really something but I am compared to like if you're if you're already moving the the old test Rosso with a thousand horsepower was a very different Beast where that Jesus sends that you get at the very beginning it's that magnified extended for quite a while as you're running up through 150 miles an hour or so</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I'm just saying I was thinking of in terms of martial arts is that I know you have a background martial arts a grappling martial arts yeah that wouldn't be so good for that unless you had some sort of a working dummy that was programmed that I think could be possible that what I would like to see from a martial-arts standpoint there is immersive instructionals VR it does give you this extra sense of depth for a lot of things like you're looking at instructional sometimes it's a little hard to see exactly where the hands are in the different areas and I think there's some value for a lot of training aspects for virtual reality in the back that's like Walmart's you doing a ton of work with that and there are a lot of companies that I am one of the side effects of that of putting a VR headset on his you are forced to pay attention where if your company like Walmart training people you expect most people wind up having their phone out there not paying attention but put them inside the headset they have it's almost A Clockwork Orange stretching to the eyes I have no choice but to pay attention but if it's important and you're training them for something that matters this is a you know what you want but when I was thinking about things like I am I am I remember watching some Judo instructionals for things and like male Olympian level stuff just goes by so fast you just blink and it's gone but a lot of things that I did in VR for some of the video stuff was giving you this almost superpowers the time where you freeze frame and then being able to like slowly frame forward for him back jog forward and when you got an immersive sense here that really feels like an interesting. Like power like you're sitting here just like stop time step-step-step rollback look closely at it no run forward and almost anything physical that you want to train people to do is going to have some benefits for things like that and that's something that we were still just really at the early days of exploring that for making a difference with people's training sparring you could have something that would throw strikes at you and you could move away from those strikes and hit it leg kick it do things long has on the problem would be that you're not hitting anything is the only problem I have a friend that has a stick fighting background when I showed him beat saber he was like oh immediately you have to do some stick training thing for this and yeah clearly we're even if you're not hitting things there but that sense of getting the motion figurine move around the situational awareness and there's probably some things to do there it is a stretch to imagine some kind of a head-mounted display involved in actual grappling and anyway but I does the Boost because also you would have the thing the only thing I was thinking you could have like a dummy like a robot mechanized dummy that has crude movement like but but does understand it can throw punches and kicks and it's programmed and you can kind of spar with this thing in a virtual world and that thing also connects to the system so it understands where you are and understands what you're doing but that's robots training something like martial arts when it's looking through and it's not making you a voice nothing but even if you're working through a drill with someone if it's basically drawing the outline of your arm goes here your leg goes over here I am again training is one of the value areas that is working out visualization is very important in martial arts mean Shadow Boxing is already a huge part of a Strikers learning like learning how to visualize and that's what they're doing this way they're supposed to do and when you see a good fighter shadowboxing they're sort of recreating these movement have you had a virtual real dad said you had an actual opponent front of you I think it would be way more lifelike and actually way more beneficial and back there are a bunch of football teams that are using VR for some of their training which largely is going to visualize in the way plays are going to go it's not like they have virtual versions of everything by that sense of being able to get in to see what it would look like when it's going right to the kind of lock it into your mind has some value it seems to me that something like the board which is really fun to do you could see in the future as technology improves having Quake like competitions in some sort of enormous Warehouse environment with other players that's been one of the real Visions from the from early days and in fact last year we we cobbled together a demo at Oculus connect our big kind of convention which is next to the new ones next month here but we had a large area set up and you had this game called dead and buried which kind of a cowboy zombie shooting thing but we had bunch of people I could play in one common enormous shared area and it was amazingly cool and everybody's like well when we get to play with this this was all held together with duct tape sort of experience that's a lot of hard work to turn it real but this Warehouse scale stuff there are a number of companies that are trying to do this with various bits of Technology and on real things there they can move around draw beat on people and then you got another person there with a tablet which is a window into the virtual world so they can look at that and see the whole the way it's all drawn in style the way the people are rendered inside it so there is yeah this is again the amazing stuff you can do outside of your home where you get the VR stuff that you wind up doing inside your home and then you figure out what things can you do if you're willing to set up a dedicated play space and yeah this is people not moving around too much play kind of a cover base thing but there are companies that have people kind of charging around in pads you do with a virtual world that they can skin in all sorts of different ways and it's all exciting and an image of what it looks so and as things get more and more accurate in terms of what you're seeing and more realistic you could conceivably be jumping up and down on boxes and running up ladders and things along those lines and actually doing virtual world as well as in the real world you can tell there's like a little gap between reality and you knew you would want to do like a diving grab at a ladder run but it's you can see that there are things we need to fix to get there but that's all possible there's no can't be done sort of thing there and eventually you won't even need to be holding a controller it'll be able to track your whole body just been cameras and work all day had a computer vision magic out from that and you will then be able to set up these wonderful skin virtual environments yeah that's why I was thinking like Esports in terms of like an actual sport sport like Esports in terms of like doing something on a soccer field with a bunch of people with virtual reality and they're playing some sort of a horrific nightmare dystopian environment zombie game like whatever you know fill in the blank with your imagination company plans where we don't have people pester us about the technical hooks for things like this and people that are doing it themselves like the void they put their own tracking technology on top of it because ours isn't set up publicly in a way that they can do that so it's a lot of work for people to do it we will eventually commercialize it so that you can set things up more easily out of the box I am but a lot of these and become entrepreneurial business plans is like okay who's going to go raise the tens of millions of dollars to set up things up more easily out of the box I am but a lot of these and become entrepreneurial business plans and like okay who's going to go raise the tens of millions of dollars to set up and do it right but it's on the cusp of being it's not a technical problem now I've not a technical impossibility no new research really needs to be done but there still lots of challenges to work out so it's more about figuring out if you can get the business plan to close you can make the technology work</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> far away do you think we are from artificial general intelligence I tend to underestimate how long things take but on the other hand as a programmer I've usually been able to say well maybe I missed my estimate by 50% while everybody else blew it by 100% or something I think that we will have we will potentially have unclear signs of a GI maybe as soon as a decade from now now lots of people this majority of scientists I working on it think it's like oh it's going to be at least a few decades and you still have a few holdouts that say oh it can't happen at all but I'm a strict materialist I think that in our minds are just our body in action and there's no reason why we can't wind up simulating that in some way I am so I don't think the question of how far out there's a lot of numbers that you can play like that the brain has something like 85 billion neurons in it in the route they have something like 10,000 connections between it play those out and compare them to what we have in computer memory and processing time and you can say that yeah within 10 years those cursive cross but I would even go so far as to say most of those are probably not I completely necessary we know lots of biological systems like we understand the process thing that goes on a lot individual side and we don't need nearly as many computer transistors as neurons that are used for processing some of those early layers so I suspect that even today some of the government supercomputers that the biggest the top500 list that they have those are remarkably probably useful for doing until it artificial intelligence work wear for a long time for decades I thought that was sort of just National chest-thumping the top 500 computers because so many of them they relied on replacing what used to be the old Big Iron cray vector supercomputers and they really weren't very easy to program mostprograms people want to use you can't run it on a supercomputer just be a lot faster one of the shocking things most people don't really appreciate is the fastest way to do most single-threaded applications is an overclocked gaming computer today you can't go spend a million dollars and buy a computer that will do many tasks faster than what you can just run on a gaming computer and this is not at all the way things were for decades wear for a long time you would go spend your millions of dollars on a cray supercomputer and all of your code would run faster than anything you can get but it turned out that the the processor wind-up using in high-end gaming systems are in many cases the fastest or an all cases at least close to us fast for certain serial application so there's nothing else you can do is pi a lot more of them together and he's been computers are football field-sized systems there is racks and racks of gpus and CPUs and nowadays for a long time I D like well what would you I would think how can I make a faster Quake map Builder something on one of those because we would sometimes have hours and hours that process I am at one point we had a computer that was almost in the top 500 I am in software just for making our Maps but I looked at a lot of these supercomputers in like all these are terrible not very useful for what we want but now as I look at a I work and I think that well if you're just doing a whole bunch of these and a general Matrix multiplies that computer right there is probably pretty good so I would suspect that you could do something if we had the right algorithms the right training schedule open the right time to run through it that it's probably possible on some systems today and it'll just still take many years for the right algorithms to wind up being developed the right training regimens to be run and faster cheaper Hardware than white and make it more economical to run all the experiments he's in so many cases the trick is not that the minimum requirements exist but that 1000 people have thrown themselves at the wall of a problem most of the bounced off and failed but eventually somebody gets through Quantum Computing is that something that could potentially break the bottleneck that we have with Moore's Law so I don't I'm not an expert on Quantum Computing and I think that many times I beat myself up about it where there's some simulators online where you can go and work on it and I should work through the exercises of doing the basic factoring all the rhythms on Quantum Computing but you might read on it right now is that it's probably not directly useful for most of the artificial intelligence tasks the big things that people worry about that things like breaking cryptography I breaking the different hashes and encryption methods that it's possible that in many ways that's almost a terrible technology because it's a technology that doesn't solve so many of the problems that you'd like it to solve and it does solve one of the problems you kind of wish nobody was able to solve I am so I buy Breaking All the encryption you like if somebody whines up with a quantum computer that they achieve Quantum Supremacy and it runs past all of our traditional computers and Southern they can break all of the all of the secure socket layer stuff break everybody signatures impersonate any public key sign stuff there's no upside to this that's all downside and all bad things are going to come from that while it's not going to make your video encoding go any faster and it's probably not going to help artificial intelligence in many ways so I haven't found a whole lot to get me really excited about Quantum Computing it may just be that end with all these cases why I beat myself up about not learn about it because in most cases when presented with some capability there some way to figure out how to apply it usefully to the things that you really want and I consider it almost the essence of engineering engineering is figuring out how to do what you want with what you've actually got and if somebody gives anytime somebody gives me new hardware usually I can figure out some useful way to do things that I want with it even if it's not immediately obvious and maybe Quantum Computing plays out that way but it is still definitely the domain of big Labs with cryogenic Cooling usefully to the things that you really want and I consider it almost the essence of engineering engineering is figuring out how to do what you want with what you've actually got and if somebody gives anytime somebody gives me new hardware usually I can figure out some useful way to do things that I want with it even if it's not immediately obvious and maybe Quantum Computing plays out that way but it is still definitely the domain of big Labs with cryogenic Cooling

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> really cool to see and it's these games particularly Quake they are unbelievably difficult to master it's one of the more fascinating aspects of like video gameplay and addiction is the complexity like when you would watch like really remember remember thrash I was named Dennis Dennis Farm there is and I remember I would watch demos one of the cool things about Quake was that you could is that his Ferrari one of her only that real killer in Dennis Fong their first real killer in the the Quake playing games and you be able to watch him play on demos you play through his eyes so you would be able to see like how he does things and move around really cool interesting things about Quake where it wasn't really so clear when we were designing it but it is a brutal game especially in one-on-one where a lot of modern games are much more approachable where if you followed a lot of the quake and a lot of them were just blowouts where you would get somebody that would take control the level and they would be running their pattern denying anyone in foot in the door you'd wind up with these 22 one blow out games where there are things that you can do in game design to make it more approachable we're like if you don't have health packs where you can keep is in a game like Quake you go in as long as you come out on top in the fight you got this little window to run around and bring yourself bring your health back up so even if you're only 5% better you might win every engagement because you have enough time to go back get yourself back up before you wind up re-engaging we're in another game if you didn't have health that that we continuously you have the ability to bring it back up then even if somebody didn't win if they knock you down a whole lot then they might get you the next time around and scores can be much more even wait gameplay wines up brutal tending towards blowouts and very frustrating for did not have the approachability for new players wear a lot of more modern games things like OverWatch can be jumped into another aspect of that wear if you got a team you could be on the winning team even if because you might have really great players that are kind of covering for you there you can jump in it and have the chance to say yay I won I am even if you didn't contribute at all and you might wind up I am doing something you start off being completely useless and then you slowly work your way up to being able to contribute effectively for your team so I can recognize some of these things now about ways to make games more approachable but the the kind of brutality of Quake like there was a it was a taste than a lot of people real I'd like it didn't wasn't so much explicitly designed for that but it worked out that way that's one of the interesting things as we look at game design today versus the old days a lot of people fall into a sort of nostalgia trap about saying well the games I grew up with where the greatest games ever and you see it with music and movies and everything and I tend to be much more optimistic about the state of things today where the amount of effort that goes into the modern games is extraordinary just the detail and all the quality of all the different levels he's a little sense of games are so expensive to make now and sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars that they do have to be conservative so they have to be careful to make sure that they've got something that has a broad Mass Appeal and I think that is the the upside of some of the older games where they might have a little bit more of a distinct flavor they weren't sort of focus group to death in the way that some of the more modern games can be. although that is a thing it's so fun when you're the person blowing the other person out that it's worth learning the maps and that that's it was for people to understand what we're talking about Quake would have it has maps and on those Maps like this is where the rocket launcher is is where the rail-gun is this where the health is this where the mega armor is and you had to know where these things were and they would regenerate every X-Men II and so you're managing not just your fighting but you're off managing the resources so you're running around and trying to control the map and trying to control the mega health and trying to control where the armor isn't don't let the guy get the rail-gun don't let the guy get the rocket launcher and in doing that it's just incredible game of strategy as well as like fast-twitch aiming and there's so many factors going in the Masters would have it time sex that they're running the way it's going to spawn and a half second before they get there if it responds they run over it it's theirs and it's gone and the difference in the top-level players is something you see in competitive games a lot even today is you get the sense of the big fish in the small pond you know it's like I am but I totally beat all my friends asses and we're the best on the best player anybody's ever seen in my tiny little area and then you put them in the big pond with some of the professional players and they just they get nothing you know they wind up not being able to land a shot there is that much difference of course you see that and everything martial arts where you get the the dojo hero in one place and goes in actually rolls with professional and just find out that they weren't all they thought they were and there's even more layers of that in games because you're not so can find some of the physical limits of the human body and the amount of time you can do it is not confined to the physical limits of human bodies of those people out there playing 10-12 hours a day with their thinking and sleeping and dreaming in you know catching people with real shots in the middle of the air my career when I'm learning new things when I'm just immersed in whether it's a new programming Paradigm a new piece of technology and I'm working 13 something hours in a day and I go to sleep and I have dreams about what I'm working on that's when I know I'm really deep in the groove of soaking in this new information and the dreaming is my mind helping synthesize this into a useful for me so I can apply this in the future and those are some things that I look back on very very fondly when I've been that obsessive about something that it's soaked into my dreams yeah I used to get that with martial arts when I was competing I would I would throw kicks in the middle of the night I would have liked dreams like moving and I'd wake up like you know and is like thinking that I was in the middle of a fight and I had a real problem when we you know we have this land room setup here with Quake on it and when we got into it where my diction got re-sparked again we are playing two three four hours a day I was starting up quick dreams it was really weird like I have dreams that I was going down corners Kim. Riis Park again we are playing two three four hours a day I was starting up quick dreams it was really weird like I've dreamed that I was going down corners and dodging rockets and desist that game is so immersive and it's so you get done with it and your heart is pounding like me and Jamie and and Jeff would play and then when when it was over we would all be out of breath with all our heart will be race we have to get up and walk around</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how did you feel about when people with play the game competitively new turn all the textures off so I yeah that's especially as a sore point with the artists that have labored for years to build these glorious textures and then you get the people that just turned them down and there's two reasons to turn them down you turn them down to help performance in some cases in the early days and specially the early graphics cards you would get higher frame rate if you turned him down so you would have left late and seeing your response times but there so do you even more the Furious thing about turning them all down to improve the contrast on your enemy acquisition so people want this almost flat shaded world so that any moving set of pixels there just turn and fire at that and that's why I never came to really great terms with that where I always thought on any early days at Esports and gaming we did always insist that people have to play with at least plausible resolutions there do you want a game to look good people that are looking at it for the time seems professionals play it I am ill we don't want them to look at that table this game looks like garbage it's all flat Shader door blurry and luckily computer's not fast enough that people could start playing at the frame rate that they wanted even with the full textures running in it I am Nicole pace of doing that I am kind of Esports and the Competitive Gaming was very interesting we saw the dawn of that with doom but it's been pretty surprised it's amazing the state that it's gotten to today I remember when we did the Quake read Annihilation tournament I gave away my first Ferrari is grand prize and I was thinking this is just the most over-the-top thing this is going to be unmatched for years and was only a year later that there was some other tournament with $100,000 prize coming out so that went on went much quicker than I expected and then today you have just the the amazing celebrity of the top Pro players it's great to see it really is stars and they make a ton of money whereas if you were a kid 10 15 years ago your parents would tell you're wasting your time this is nonsense why you playing these games but now you have a legitimate opportunity to be a professional game player top Quake players won 3 million 121 872 what's a quake what game is at Toyota what is that what's DotA where are they like if you look at the numbers for things people think o the Super Bowl like the height of all competitive Sports whatever and the a lot of easy sports games especially in South Korea are the dwarf those numbers really millions of people tuning in and enormous Arenas to write they playing these gigantic oh my God that looks like 30,000 people that looks like a UFC event</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what about the possibility of a haptic feedback Wester suit something you can put on your body all the way back into the doom and Quake days I remember one of the really early kind of entrepreneur guys that came by he had made this leather jacket with all these impact bucks on it and it had like eight or nine different things that would be solenoids that could deliver pretty sharp side and he wanted to interview no get support added to the games for that the idea you played what you get when you getting shot and actually feels like you're getting hit in the back and I didn't think that was a very likely I am mass-market consumer thing I mean not too many people want that level of fidelity where it actually starts making you sore but that's one of the wonderful things about being able to open source the various codes after the games are a little bit older where anybody that wants to can nowadays going take Doom or Quake or those earlier titles and programming for whatever crazy thing I don't have to convince they don't have to go convince skeptical John Carmack this device is going to be a worthwhile thing to add support to the mainline code they can just go do it which is a wonderful thing that is very cool that you guys do that I think that's really cool and early on in the company where the people that weren't coming from the sort of hacker ethic background on the programming side you get the business people and the artist and the designers then like we want to just give away our source code won't that be a Lego the competitor is why do you want to do this and it was one of my made me really happy when many years later Kevin Cloud one of my early Partners I told me that yeah in retrospect that was really the right thing to do and it's great with doom and Quake now especially Doom wear anything that has a processor runs Doom if it's got a 32-bit processor and it can conceivably display an image people imported Doom to it and that code will live forever a hundred years from now people will be able to dig up and run the Doom source code and some Enya nose very cool now what was the conversation like like when you guys when you were saying hey this is good for the community this is good for games overall it's going to get people excited about it just going to generate more business like what did you how did you sell it up there where are early it's games I can remember that some of the very first things that happened with Wolfenstein 3D before Doom where that was not set up to be easy to be modified we were still back in those days at fitting on floppy disk so I had all the day Preston this non-standard thing that I just made up at the time but people dug through all of that disassemble the code figured out how it worked and started making some level editors and doing the things like you were placing Hitler with Barney and all these early mods and we're all like Melissa fantastic no this is people taking the game they played through the game they loved it and they loved it so much they want to keep doing things on it and they wind up breaking into the game at that time essentially to figure out how to make new things so by the time working on Doom it was an explicit Top Line technical goal for me that okay I had these Graphics things I wanted to do a 1 to do networking but I also wanted to really make game modding a first top-level feature so we had it all this ability to do the the wads and P wads and we documented all of it and we released a lot of the tools the early source code so here's how you go ahead and is much harder at that point with the more sophisticated stuff going on but here's how you build a level in Doom and we've been released the code for our level editor community that much because we're using these crazy expensive next workstations and other people had to take the steps to go ahead make a run on PCS but the Step Beyond that when we were looking at Quake I am so I knew that I wanted to enable actual changes to the gameplay because it doing you could swap out all the different models you can swap out by the way things look the way things sounded and some people would go in and actually patch the executable to do a few minor changes in gameplay but the next definitely was allowing people to really make whole new gameplay modes so that was how Quake got this Quake C extension language and we wrote a lot of the game in that in that led to all the things like capture the flag and Team Fortress all those which with all these really really great things but there were still things that you couldn't do or couldn't do effectively there and that's where there was still this desire to be able to say what what if we just gave them everything what if we gave them the full source code and let them for the fact their heart can't Port other platforms and again it wasn't a super popular decision but the way I was pitching it was well it still helps our titles it still gives them life it gives them life after they would have been off the shelf falling off of people's radar just pulling into some game of nostalgia but being able to let people make real new versions of it would be that we would keep them currently we keep irrelevant and so the pitch that I ran for years there was after our new game came out with brandy technology then we should be able to open source release the previous generation so first when doing without re-released Wolfenstein when Quake was out re-released Doom Mandalay turquoise route we released the Quake 1 code and that worked out really remarkably well I know at the time there were some people in the company they're just like this is just John's thing and they were not really happy about it but I was in position where I could kind of throw my weight around a little bit that and I was happy that I did it in in the end but he agrees it was a good when I'm a little sad bit more companies weren't able to take that final step modern was embraced Broadway by a lot of game companies but only a handful of companies were able to really go the entire way and release full source code years since that's too bad because that is one of the core aspects of the quick Community is that you know you guys did release that stuff and there were all those cool extras and then things you could downloaded maps so many different maps of people Morse code or sense that's too bad because that is one of the core aspects of the Quake Community is that you know you guys did release that stopped and there were all those cool extras in the end things you could download in maps so many different maps of people had created a really interesting like I'm ever won was a guy's apartment like you could you could play quake in an apartment like you could shoot you could get to the top of the toilet and shoot at things off the toilet was really amazing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Mount Rushmore of video games you're George Washington you're up there so this is great people have been kind of nudging us from here to get this done so it's great that were finally able to make it happen yeah I've been from day one a gigantic Quake junkie and a doom junkie so for me to have you in here is a giant tree never let you know I talked about your video games and your Creations so many times on this podcast so it's pretty cool to have you here and thank you very much for showing me before the park Stardust tell everybody you showed me the latest and greatest version of oculus rift which is amazing it's so small for people watching the YouTube this is the entire unit this this thing that sits on your head it's very light and it's not attached to a computer that you don't have to carry thing around and there's no extra everything is in here yeah so this is the Oculus Quest the Standalone device and it's been kind of the culmination of a bunch of different products that we've been working on and it's the vision that we had even six years ago just the ID not connected to anything you put this magic hat on and you're transported of these different worlds Adam is available right now anyone can buy this website it might only last 2 hours or so Netflix on this thing so our previous one right before this the Oculus go was a little bit more media focused and that's one of our more popular iPhone applications I mean it's surprisingly things everybody thought to be always going to be all about these just amazing gaming experiences but some of the most popular experiences are doing reasonably conventional things watching Netflix watching YouTube Amazon Prime stuff like that where if you like if you're you and you've got a great home theater and everything there's not this much benefit to having a funeral satin VR but if you're in a situation like you're in a tiny room in Tokyo or something the idea of being able to put on VR headset and have this like lovely Ski Lodge atmosphere with a giant screen TV it has some real benefits so in the end VR should be a replacement for anything you do on screens today whether it's your phone your tablet your TV your laptop your PC all of these should eventually be superseded by just having more flexible screens in VR I want to channel just now with resolution and comfort for long-term use but this is the direction that everything's going not only do have things and be all that you couldn't do anywhere else just experiences that you can't have with that level of immersion but it should pull on every other thing that people do with screens devices today I didn't consider the television shows but of course people would be watching Netflix on this if it's possible have you done the Disney World ride the Avatar ride flights of Passage I haven't done that yet it's amazing you sit on this it's like a motorcycle looking thing it's traps you in place and it's supposed to represent one of those flying dragon things in Avatar and then you have the headset you put that on and the virtual reality experience is second-to-none minutes incredible super high-resolution and the motorcycles moving around you get wind and smells and all these sensory path of it for the really interesting things like I think about that whenever I am at amusement parks for things like the Harry Potter rides in like that were there doing locks with screens and motion platform is where I think about it from the VR perspective anything we're doing visually and audibly we could go ahead and do a great job in the headset so it's cutting it down to these few physical things that you can't do so you got things with motion platforms that actually jostle you around that you can't do in VR you've got things like smell and like the boy that is where they have the Star Wars experience there we have a fantastic Star Wars experience on quest which in many ways a lot of that magic but in the void where they set it up and they blow hot air over what's the virtual lava towards you that's something that you still don't get but it's kind of like the age-old Battle of what can you do differently in an arcade that you can't do as good in your your home system and VR now takes let you do all of these amazing things there but if you're willing to spend millions of dollars and build a theme park attraction essentially you can still throw some of these extra things in people joke about when is smell-o-vision coming to the actually been real companies that have spun up to say it's like we wanted to send augment mentation when it's not a great thing and those are still the last vestiges of things where you have to go someplace but the promise of VR is do you know the world as you want it not having to go to someplace to do something magical and if you can get to 90 something percent of that experience staying in your own room then that's great what would they be able to do with smell-o-vision would you have like a standalone unit that like has yes to the program so like if you were flying over orange Fields it would spray Citrus in the air like soaring over the world have you ever done that Disneyland ride a box that put glue to attach to the underside of the head-mounted display and what are the interesting things about sent as opposed to I like audio or video with video everybody knows that you just make red green and blue colors you can mix them in anyway make all the colors that we can see smell isn't like are nose is actually a receptor for a whole lot of discreet different molecules there's no way to mix up smell like the way we do with light to make red green and blue primaries with that so they really had to pick okay here's the dozen-or-so smells that we're going to have with this and it would just sort of split sit out on a little blast of are very close to your nose so it doesn't need much of it to get in so if you really wanted to do some sort of a jungle experience with you and thousands of different smells of plant send dirt knowledge you have to have like some enormous unit that's spraying these various things modern people in modern society do not really have that Discerning of a level of sound like if you took some Peruvian indigenous or something that they probably would complain for other Fidelity on this is garbage I should have 500 different smells here and I only detect 5 of jungle is probably going to be more than enough to sell experiencia the guy in the jungle building this is sterile urine you're not real so what is this Jamie virtual reality world of course it's coming but why am I shocked look at this guy's got like a little cartridge has popping in there that'll refilling your toner cartridge on your generator how hilarious but you are where you got that low-resolution sort of thanks my friend Duncan he's a he's a huge technology had a really early version of the consumer virtual reality headsets the early early Oculus and I remember putting it on going oh my God even though it's really pixelated like this is a game-changer like that sense that you've seen the future yeah you put it on it's not here yet but that's the ability to just project a little bit past the flaws and you can imagine what it's going to be yeah it's pretty stunning what you just showed me today the the Star Wars one is actually higher resolution than the void which is the one that you pay to go see over there do you go to the warehouse and everything I've done that several times the void with Star Wars and in the void with Wreck-it Ralph was pretty cool to Tuacahn something versus like you're mine some play some French mine kind of pretending to do things and that doesn't sell the experience and that's why I view my favorites are the things like beat saber where in the game you are swinging this lightsaber sort of things through things so your actions in reality are exactly what your actions in the virtual world are swing through at there's a little bit of a buzz as you cross through it and it just feels like you are you're projecting yourself there</div>

They don't have faith in you I just can't think of what to take would be the problem is if I explained it with the take is it would f****** the bit for people that haven't seen the bit are there are you feeling good about the you know what that guy is no he was the the Pervert the traveled around from Island to Island measuring guys and taking weird photos with Roman soldiers and he posted a whole series of this case before because of this pervert guy and so when this man is missionary showed up on an island and started like he knew all about the history of this island so he made like a chain of post on Twitter which were really interesting informative and then I started going deep into a rather guys journals the journals were hilarious my little kid got killed know the guy the Pervert the English probably wrecked like that whole area for those people because they had this idea of what why Arnold's people don't ever written language and they they just have stories they probably still have stories of these white men income carrying diseases and want to touch your dick and measure them he was in the right he was in The Lakes School morphology but was sexual organs what he was it's hard to tell what he was into but it was it's so obviously perverted like it's it seems like he was doing sexual stuff with these p trundle Vegeta Miser by measuring them and doing detailed descriptions of their sex organs and he's really into that that seem very important to him and he said he survived the island coffee cuz that's a great spice for food but it's a it's a potent anti-inflammatory very very good for you and it's good so I have to wait and see what your take on it are you drawn to that are you drawn to that idea I certainly am that which I did and hang out and spend time with you uncontacted people you've done it in you're not on contact on contact but some tribes that like the chimani and the micucci and Whopper Sean or I'll try to North and South America Pooh a long long history of of contact and engagement with the outside world but individuals who can still very much like hang out with individual aren't that old who in your youth were very much like living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle with it with a mix of native materials and also some Western Materials Guyana Guyana and Bolivia people that you know people that would still make their bows from native materials people that grew up using canoes that were made like hand-in-hand dog dogouts using plant toxins to kill fish but also like you know also other very modern stuff like one of these guys that I really appreciate hang out with him he's got an email address but he got an email address but he also told us about we interview them on our show on a podcast and he's telling me about how their peccaries their white-lipped peccaries aren't around right now there Packer he's there white-lipped peccaries are around right now because there's a shaman in another Village who's jealous of their Village for being so prosperous and has lock their peccaries up inside of a mountain and that they're training their own Shaman to free the Packer he's from the mountain and you can shoot the student email</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> now that you're big on the stool you're you're big on tribe like you have like those guys that you travel with we do shows with this like a tribe of you like a community and it's very important I respect that I think that's very that's huge so I guess but it's something I've learned from my interactions with you and your thing I've seen is you don't you don't pray it around you don't talk about too much but you do talk about that there are some things we just you put up firewalls in your life and the people that you're around and I have heard you refer to at times that something got to someone was maybe like to damaging in referring to people that the it will seem like you were condemning them or thought they were bad but you just referred like times you've had to like disorder protect what you had and what what you care about and just make some things not part of your life anymore you have to realize that there's some people that are not looking out for themselves some people don't make that jump well and they keep that around they keep that that influence around because it because of maybe like misplaced loyalties a handful of times we are like something just got to be where you had like build you just had to be like you I love you respect you and everybody just I got to protect these other things do some people gets completely self-absorbed and they burn everything around them cuz they're only thinking about themselves and even if you dermacare them or appreciate what they're doing like some people are amazing at certain thing like you know we were talking about Hendrix I mean if Hendrick did beat his wife and if that's true or beat his girlfriend's know but it's like some people are so good at what they do that like that's all they're thinking about they didn't develop is interpersonal skills or relationship skills or you know whatever just so you know they didn't develop a sense of nuance in terms of their perspective of the world sense of introspective thinking when they're the looking at themselves and being objective about how the interface with the people around them and and life those people that are just like holy focused on the South if that specially pure narcissist which you run into a lot of them and show business and some of them it's not their fault you talk to me if you believe in determinism you know he believed that their product of all the things that have happened to them and then you run down the list of all the things that have happened them it's f****** bone-chilling show me people that I know particular ancho business are there because of just a giant hole that they developed in their self-esteem and they're who they are as a child they didn't get enough love they got too much abuse and hate and bullying and Halle Berry and factors that made them push so hard to achieve success to let everybody know hey I am special hey I am something you were all wrong and then they but along the way they did burn everything around them and I don't I don't I don't want to it's it's possible to get there without that that's what I want to say it's like it's possible to get there without being a piece of s*** and some people think you have to be a piece of s*** to be successful you don't don't have to or they can some people get to wear remember earlier I mentioned like the collateral damage people think you could develop such an inflated sense of what you're bringing to the world that you excuse you personally come to accept the idea that there is a price to pay yeah that pricing other people yeah that's a problem but then again if you don't have certain standards than other people chew up all your time and their problems become your problems and they don't even think about their problems they thinking about you saying about their problems mean there's many people that pawn off their problems and other folks and they think that if you're a good friend you're helping me like you're not a good friend you're not taking care of me you're not helping me crap that a lot of people get stuck into its codependency and happens in a lot of relationships is a lot of people to get involved in relationships boy and girl that they find that the person who is there their soulmate is also the source of all their f****** problems and their the curator of this person's life there their they're supposed to be like helping is personal because this person is like deem them the person is most important to them and it's like you got to you got to find you got to find out what you know what is the what's the boundary where you won't cross where you realize if someone is becoming an impediment to your own happiness and success it's amazing the degree to which people deep down do care about what someone is quote like you know where I find it because I've been on your shoulder number times people are curious about you and people often ask me you know what's Rogan really like but they know they know that they know what answer they want to hear bad people would love a story okay easy cuz I'm like Oprah Winfrey I found the people love a story about how bad like people are going to eat up a story that she's awful what you've done is it people are like they're like he's a good guy right but they want to know that they feel like you are and they want to have a confirmed not that they're like yeah tell me the story about him being bad like they were with a lot of people really bad story about them all yours can't dance not good shape was she doing just talking she got a billion dollars f*** her I hope she's I hope she's a meanie hope she's doing terrible thing about that it's like you want to find a f****** people over Oprah's house in Montecito I pass by the house

Preposterous success breeds animosity and that lady's got a lot of preposterous success and there's certain people you meet them you wanted to sell like dr.

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> shoot a duck with the band on it everybody knows as cool as s*** like I know that everybody wants to shoot a banded don't know that it's cool as s*** if you get a banded duck flies that it's a little bit social science because long ago like we used to not understand this caliber tricky explain we used to not understand how migrations worked because everyone you only knew they saw okay and there wasn't someone who was sort of like coalescing all of this information people would know very well but you know wherever you go you live along the Mississippi River okay and you might know very well that like in November shitload the docks that you haven't seen they have been here all year are coming from the north and going to the South and you knew that very well you know the docks moved you knew that they move through here but you didn't put all of the no way to put all the pieces together over time what if we wanted to understand like animal migrations better one of the early this is way pretty collars like GPS collars and then pit tags and s*** we started this banding system where you can go and catch a dock and it's in his nesting area is really easy to catch the bolt soapy water put a band on a dock and you go you can go up in the in the Arctic or the Upper Midwest anywhere and throw a band on a baby duck and that band have a phone number on it and you were encouraged to when you got a banded duck it was like they made it be that it was a good thing and you were encouraged to call that 1-800 number whatever the hell they were before 1-800 numbers and give them the the band the band number and then we started to really would like great detail flyways how ducks migrated like the dark sin on the Arctic Slope in Alaska 10 to follow along this path and attend to end up here at this date and they're down in the you-know-what ever down in Texas all of a sudden weather down in Southern California and their there they're hanging out and rice fields around Sacramento whatever the hell did we start to put together this whole detailed picture and it was one of the great achievements and wildlife biology was what we learn from the duck banding system I think that over time it be can like I said it was so like social engineering were people were taught to think it was cool and you would wear a band you would if you had a lanyard you keep your duck calls on the still goes on if you got a lanyard. Calls on any banded bird you get you put that band on your lanyard I even met these Knuckleheads some North Dakota who have a lot of bands on their lanyards from band Birds I've shot and you got to us a lot of bands Eagles yeah not one of them reported they think that it bit it remains more Pier to do I don't know that's a dumb I wish you guys did like calling anybody want to contribute to component to your show and we would call one of these dudes are all unreported anyways I know if it's okay anti-science play will you love to argue did you talk to that guy about this no it was long ago I can take where I was standin doesn't my brother's Kitchen in Miles City Montana beneath this crazy chandelier he bought online and I remember everything about it but I don't remember when I if I challenged them on the sense of of being proud of having not contributed to our scientific understanding of waterfowl migration xand y anti-government sentiment yeah it's cool to have bands and I have like in my sort of I'd like a box work with report and stuff to me but imagine if you had a box of deer collars there's no way I wouldn't put it to your cock those are cool but there's a friend of mine who's a she's a carnivore research and all their research project but she says you know I'm with someone that collars animals and I even think that she's like when you get one with a collar on it she said it was cool every time she's like someone has already got the best of them did they become tainted when they've been held by someone else and that a little bit how I view it were like a wild animal you want to imagine it being like the wildest wild animal he wants to have the collars like someone it's it's all sloppy seconds maj stop them they become tainted when they've been held by someone else and that a little bit how I view it wear it like a wild animal you want to imagine it being like the wildest wild animal he wants to have the collars like someone it's it's all sloppy seconds man</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> supposed to be amazing fishing the Catalina apparently is like the greatest mako shark fishing in the world which is it hear it hear the weird one shark fishing all the sudden you're an a****** that used to be with jaws like you caught a shark a good get that f****** thing out of here they're going to kill peep do now it's like you monster shark fin soup don't care about the global warming like that everything is conflated it's always piled on together with you what are you doing are there isn't there is I thought thresher shark your day on the menu I just started the magazine story about this long long ago it was when I got out of school night is like first assignment I had to go right article I was reading for outside magazine and 19 years ago man Mako Madness and knows a thing in Montauk this isn't mm and I got sent out there and it never ever New York I didn't go into the city I just flew into wherever the hell I flew into and got a car and stupidly took a cab to understand that I was very young I don't understand like I took a cab from the airport out to Montauk it doesn't my first-ever view and I never saw that place again I never saw it again till after but is this thing called Mako Madison's like a shark tournament and traditionally been like a contest to get the biggest shark and he would bet money on it and there was like the general registration fee so all these captains who had charter boats would join Mako Madness notebook clients on their boats for Maaco Madness and when you had to pay some amount of money to play some of my money to register your boat to be in the contest but the real money was in all these side bets called calcutta's and so you could do is enough side bedding going on all the various captains that the biggest mako could win a hundred thousand hundred thousand dollars but the sort of the Fatal flaw in this tournament from a poet perception Sand Point would be that there's a category 4 just bigger shark under the category for like biggest mako so people going out like at a time this is when at this is when shark populations are still globally they're still on a decline but there was still a lot of shark bycatch from swordfish long lining and other things and there was people getting very worried about shark stocks and shark numbers Mako man has had no makos you were bringing in a Mako so everyone go out and just take make damn sure that like I don't want to come back empty so they would catch a blue shark cuz if no one caught a Mako you still might get biggest shark from catching a blue shark and at the end of this thing man dead dumpsters they're not dumb they would fill a dumpster with blue sharks and no one would know go into a dumpster you can eat blue shark yeah well you can they're high in urea and Justina Mako Thrasher can you eat a great white great white says there's a guy is a writer I love and he does all these Fisheries guidebooks named Vic done around like he's dead or alive by got all of his books you got like Gulf Coast Pacific Ocean Atlantic Coast looks like it's like all the fish that you're likely to catch kind of like how to catch him what I like about he's got like a SWAT food quality section and its food quality sections are really funny and like the highest praise you can give something like excellent or one of the best rice if you look up Snooki like one of the best his his headline for great great white sharks don't even ask but they be good because Sam and shark good these come porbeagles like salmon shark of very good reputation and Mancos have a good reputation and Threshers have Market power who's all there sharks in all the areas they have market value but those ones are like our ones that are popular table fare the assumptions the white that great white sharks would probably be good shark hunting and killing is right sort of the shark fisherman character in Jaws is based on this like very real dude Frank Mundus and Frank Mundus used to fish out of Montauk and at a time on talk was his Premier destination people catching swordfish and big bluefin tuna and as those big pelagic Fisheries had collapsed overfishing in the 70s Frank Mundus he'd go out and he just go out and find a go out famous that you'd go out and find a beach whale or not a beach whale with a floating dead whale anchor up on that well and catch big ass great whites and then come in and hang the bloody carcass up on the docks and you made necklaces with two sharks and s*** and he became like the monster man or something of the Monster Hunter and started looking all these crazy trips were true succumbs at holy s*** I want to go kill a big monster and he's credited with having created this like culture of like going out and getting a Hazmat him that that's right so he kind of like build this idea of like shark hunting in Brooklyn like shark biting his forearm go back to that likes pain to this sort of thing where you want to go out and catch a big shark and hang it up and throw it in the dumpster and people look at like when people look at that history they look at it being is like it's like in some ways Mundus and shark hunting was symptomatic of declining Fisheries they're so similar real of Jaws rating of the greatest movie The Narrative of shark fin soup and sharks being you know something that we need to protect that sort of thing did the idea of shark fin soup and its Allure was driven holding one time we're in Berkeley and we are at a boat launch become off fishing and we've been out fishing for leopard sharks member of The Life Aquatic that's a good movie I know they got to know that the famous shark near the Jaguar shark which is a good idea for shark only exists but there are leopard sharks me fishing for leopard sharks we came back to the boat launch there's a dumpster there and everything is our fishing poles of fish guts in the dumpster and remember there's a gentleman digging through the dumpster getting out leopard shark fins and then had stuff on them I thought that you was acting out of some sort of desperation and I hey man do you want like a nice fillet I'll be happy to give you a filet he's like no it's a little disgusting it ain't like I'm always reluctant to a little bit reluctant to sort of oversimplify things around around Harvest and in animals and stuff because I think people can take it too far but if you seen footage of people cutting fins and dumping the sharks in the water and kicking the Sharks off the deck into the but it speaks of something I think that seeing like wife in the Sharks going into the water speaks of something about just your level of care Jimmy like whether you view something as as sacred or not it's hard to see that the individual engaging in that is viewing it is as sacred and there's like a lot of stories about even like swordfish Captain's no burning blue sharks and stuff in aphogee cuz I lose so much there swordfish catch blue but to see people kicking them off it speaks to something about animal suffering is speak something about like what is that person's view of the resource like what do toddler respect but it also says peace like a general thing where you don't see things wasted Waters one of us load was just used to be able to go out and you can feel your hold full of just sharp parts fishing Captain you just be honest and keep the fence and eventually made it I'm sure someone correct me if I'm wrong here I don't think I am they met you made it that whatever you have for shark materials in your boat on a commercial operation only a certain percentage can be comprised of fins and since when you're on a commercial vessel your hold like you you're very keep ice fish is finite limited it want to be not worth it because unless they only like 30 it want to be not worth it because unless they only like 30% of your Shark part could be shark fins and you had to keep the rest it wasn't worth it to feel your hold full of like shark meat and so it's sort of D incentivize people to go out and thin and US Waters that make sense long time ago I had it back in probably the 90s at a Chinese restaurant in the US or overseas us</div>

like my initial Instinct doesn't to be sad I sort of I have this view that yeah I have this view of that that that serve like settlement and development V Wildlife it is the global problem right and one always wins like the destruction of wildlife habitat always wins and then you see it when you see it play out like that in some ways you kind of like hope like Ryan Kelly and who you know recently the kid got a young kid is like 9 or 10 year old girl got thrown up in the air by bison in Yellowstone by no means of cow hope to see someone get hurt but he's like Barca habituating Wildlife since 1877 they do it is weird I've only been once while I went once when I was a kid but I went once recently with my family and it was very weird that you take selfies with elk to help with these big herds of elk are so confident that people won't shoot them on there in like the public tourism area that they just go and hang out near the vending machine getting a Diet Coke and there's an elk like 30 yards away from me so strange that's that's little bit in line with what that's what I'm talking about when I talk about like that when I hear someone's dog got killed by a coyote you know it again man I know it like logs and they're Inseparable is that dog got carried off by great horned owl in a penalty great horned owl cook carrots dog off like a little shittin dog I would feel real bad for him with that say I do have the same you kind of rude and I do feel sad when I see like in a place like Yellowstone this gorgeous little bit weird when I see and wild animals especially animals that people hunt for when I see that they've lost their fear of humans some people would look and be like oh this is like what naturally they should be like okay so this is animals where they have had to give up their human that where they've lost their human fear because we've give him this my old place I see old timey old-time real son Ella Yellowstone Park atmosphere you see where Wildlife becomes obituary to be humans and they feel like you're seeing something more natural right because outside of human hunting they also don't have that feeling anymore I look at that it's like I'm to me it feels like something's been subverted and something's wrong with that situation because you know people been hunting in that area at least 10,000 years so then we take your break and the Animals become very accustomed to people it's it's shocking how quickly they can get it back in and often times it'll say melk that live like the same it will spend their summer in that Park will migrate out of there and going to Old National Forest on ranchland and then they'll be worried they can be hunted they know they cross that lights up the same some dude could basically walk up and touch their we'll just something in his head switches in the Enders and they enter into a new mines face when they leave and they're still exposed human predation and if they win it's shocking how it's shocking degree to which state ReadWorks they can keep this together in their heads and it's also pretty surprising how how quickly adapt but I would imagine if you were to open up this be pretty controversial idea about throw it out there I think that it would probably be less than a year I think like a season or fall hunting season would have them right back into the same mindset that all the other animals lyric interpretation they're sort of attitude toward people very quickly get it back to make sense and padding stuff again like referring to cow his ideas that like people have gotten where they confuse national parks of the musement parks and they feel that the animals are like on Rails their entree they're programmed to do a certain thing it's one thing that I've discovered over the last seven years thanks to you and thanks to you getting me hunting is it most people have no idea what it's like to be around actual Wildlife to sneak up to them in the most you have no idea about their sense of smell like this and then just f****** bounce that to see that and to know that like you're dealing with some superhuman ability some like impossible to imagine with confines of your own biology what these animals can do and when you're when you're out of months and no cell phone service and there's it's just Footprints and tracking your way through mountains it's amazing it's it's not Yellowstone what Yellowstone is and what anything like that in zoos is the worst example right but when we think of animals like people always tell me like like you know I have a famous dog run with him everybody loves them to the sweetest dog in the world Nails day like to know that dog if you love dogs how could you how could you hunt animals and I'm like both know that's not he's not an animal he's a dog he's a pet is a science project an animal's wolf and animals a deer that's an animal what a dog is they don't survive outside of us if you don't take care of them they won't know what to do. did the dog catcher comes and gets him and somebody rescue something they're not wild animals it's not and has it almost has less to do with how they're raised and more to do with their ancestors like they're their biology has changed they literally been bred to something different they're f****** science project stop in the wild cuz if he sees another dog is a boyfriend he's not like checking to see the things in steals food or Rob him of his mates or your kills babies Hazel it's the result of a 20,000 or whatever your experimentation with the domestication of an animal that they dog park they think they know what an animal as they don't even have any experience with it we've been so domesticated and so isolated and cities most people especially most people that have opinions on this s*** and I'll people that live in rural areas and you know that you live in Bozeman Inn Bozeman is surrounded by these areas that are just f****** completely wild I mean if you're in Bozeman you drive an hour from your house and then you're around bears and Dean completely wild place with people that are in those areas people around Boise Idaho for example they have a totally different idea people in Wyoming have a totally different idea of what Wildlife is versus somebody lives in Santa Monica but there's a video that just somebody sent me today a guy in Thousand Oaks is on his street and he's filming a f****** enormous mountain lion maybe it's huge it's a big boys like a hundred fifty pound and they're in the car and then looking at it through the window and him and his son it seems like her a feminist think on holy s*** look at this thing and you saying that like somebody was filmed somebody was speeding and apparently and they're they're trying to figure out what you want me to send it to you I'll send it to you but you know that's that's super rare wild animal it's super super rare that anybody would have any kind of experience with one of these nights the most people that are talking animals images really don't know what that even means they just saying it has developed like a pretty big cultural division between people who are pretty big cultural division between people who kind of like live around work around and deal with animals and people who view them are think of them is very other a friend of mine who's a biologist Thousand Oaks I just sent you a friend of mine with the forest service guy named Carl Malcolm he might hurt on our our show he just sent me a paper there was about kids attitudes to Wildlife and it was comparing rural people's attitude and knowledge of wildlife the kids with Urban and Suburban attitudes about wildlife and you can see that import of media when you look at this thing because people who live in urban or Suburban environment when they tell you the top-of-mind wildlife they know about this non-native stuff like lions yeah they're likely to know like what's what's an animal right in the MLB draft right and people who have a more rural or remote Viewpoint what are much more likely look when they think of Wilder to think of things that they interact with you know and not like the things that are on your mobile above your crib when you're a little baby and it sort of points and also there's a slight tendency I got to look at this more carefully but has a slight tendency to have negative feelings or think things are dangerous or bad the more urban you are in terms of native Wildlife two more has like a negative or bad thing and what they're pointing to his look at it more carefully in part of me to the authors of authors if I'm messing this up by just looking at this morning what are pointing to is the the the stirrings of there being a greater acceptance of decreased biodiversity meaning that you're kind of like okay with the bad things haven't gone and we're focused on like water animals will animals will be like a drafting hippopotamus 4.2 is the the the stirrings of there being a greater acceptance of decreased biodiversity meaning that you're kind of like okay with the bad things haven't gone and we're focused on like water animals will animals will be like a drafting hippopotamus in the things that the Disney tells me about and not like a possums and raccoons with your kind of gross</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you been out here now you want to the UFC events and then you did some training at AKA like when you are outside of Camp so you like whenever your flight is scheduled how much what kind of training you doing when you're not in Camp are you mixing it up now and trying to do a lot of Jiu Jitsu a lot of BJJ when in Milton Kim or they do so my make conditioning trainer Valentino got a jewelry follow me everywhere is with me today and then we just trained strange conditioning because before this was my weakness to condition everybody out of the first round so I never trained my condition I never took it very serious because I used to knock people out at the feels wrong so when I did my first five round was like so important so that's why I'm training a lot strange shirt and also yeah when I'm not I don't have a fight kickboxing fight when I trained Vichy I trained wrestling MMA and AJ is a completely different condition is crazy when you when you were with a guy and then you you get up and you're trying to strike for like say if you were if you're preparing for a fight how many days a week do you do strength and conditioning when I'm preparing for a fight everyday everyday everyday of course it's not the same training but everyday I see Valentino and we train together yet everyday I train more conditioning is trench more than kickboxing don't believe me when I say that I have a cool is my friend in the infant hold meets for me or should I can use for my myself your money for me and we just talked together we just playing a game plan together for fight we just I'm my own coach know that is crazy at your level TJ after that he couldn't teach me anymore because because of his job you know when I when I was young and then I just move from to Country Inn countries and countries to run to run turn on and then came back in France Paris and it just turned myself that isn't saying how many world champions I don't know I can just teach me I really don't know that's a good question I don't I don't know why did I but I didn't found a new coach I don't know Ruth his bravery is one of the big coaches in his brother Duke Duke roufus yeah yeah yeah text fight so my first coach couldn't teach me anymore I just float to I'm seldom because oh yeah because of, you know in my mind I was thinking about okay where is the best kickboxing the planet Holland so I went to hold on with your resume was famous for 2 years you know I was playing at Bordeaux Amsterdam drink two years and yeah the coach was Andrea Menard you teach me a lot you know I learned a lot there and when I I figure out that I couldn't learn anymore I just went to Belgium because I met Samuel Marshall is a very great coach for me is the best question ever I never had why yeah because because we need each other at an event in friends and then I saw one of his fighter it was fighting and then when I saw his technique is his condition it was you know his first round was looking the same at his 5th round was crazy a very high-level condition was very crazy and I see that's like this I want to fight technical you know and I say that's what like this I want to fight I want to Belgium and Brazil and I trained with him or so two years I was a driving always present or is brucella two years with Samir that I won my first bill again if you watch my fights before and the fight against two different fighter you do your camps with him now now because you live in percent and yeah I can't anymore so that's why I left I'm your butt in my corner when I fight the gym and I never found did the Timbers that kind of flooring so I cannot train with Annika what you know and I just turned myself my my friend hold me for me I train Reese Valentino the conditioning training for me was more important than the kickboxing everybody know how to keep us now we know how to keep birds but the difference would be make with the condition for me and it's Marv marinovich and the Skynet curse on and they've only trained a few Fighters but they've had very high levels of success because of their conditioning and what they say is that you already know how to fight so just let's concentrate on the conditioning and get your conditioning to a super high level and that when you're fighting you can just go yeah that's right that's why I said everything when I give advice is to two people to see what should I train this just text me I said listen between two two faces in the same level the same experience what's going to make the difference to condition in the fight you know if you fight 1 2 3 Rounds and then you f***** up you lose a fight type 5 Round And even if you're not good enough technically between two two faces in the same level the same experience what's going to make the difference to condition in the fight you know if you fight 1 2 3 Rounds and then you f***** up lose a fight right type 5 Round And even if you're not good enough technically you're going to win the fight because you don't get tired yet</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> kickboxing is huge in Europe and very big people I mean I had Rico verhoeven on and we discuss this like how enormous kickboxing is in Holland and in Europe and in America for whatever reason it never caught on eye. I don't understand I've been a fan of glory and I've been trying to tell people about them for a long time I cannot blame you was safe with that good that they legalize MMA anime just more attractive for people you know did people doesn't know s*** about about fighting the just watch animes like oh two people of fighting did that interesting you know like think like spot like kickboxing if you doesn't know the rules scanner yeah you just want and you don't understand you don't understand yeah two people so I don't I really don't know why kickboxing it's not it's not maybe at the same level as MMA in USA boxing is very respected in the United States and MMA is very respected but one of things that people like about MMA is stand up there like the Striking but the best striking is like Glory right but I think people love the cage people love the blood so small gloves. That's why that's what people like people don't like you two don't like how you say then no down to three MMA legalized in France I think gender is going to be it's going to be okay so they're going to have to allow strikes on the ground and everything every soon. Soon on generator Elite Fighters world champions like yourself Mega Jump 2 MMA then people might look at kickboxing as a stepping stone instead of as a valid individual sport yeah yeah that's right but you mean when a guy a step from kickboxing to anime like maybe people won't care as much about kickboxing because they look at it as a stepping stone to MMA thinking for a guy from a kickboxing two to Green MMA it's not very difficult for him if ya if you learn the crown game and defend if you learned that is going to be more simple than a guy who come from what I know my size is really different like kickboxing kickboxing when you fighting kickboxing you moves a lot already. standing Target instead of with or without you did if you watch without you fight they don't move a lot you know this but I still and the fights this is all about power for cakes or so different because the clenched because streets in weight is more like 111 album knees and wrestling training inference I get grappling training I think here in USA you can let me know. I'm training in France is very about takedowns or takedown defense of wrestling but you know this style of yoga training I get is a delivery with different like us because we start an outfit and we used to West and then after the takedown we continue right so it's not like an empty question right do you have a last no Lucha Libre it's what they called Brazil but I know you're saying so in America most Brazilians you get to the start on the ground already to start on the knees or something to happen who do void accidents because you know you got a class full 40 and go rolling around together and they're trying to tackle each other ready to start on the knees or something like that for who to avoid accidents because people rolling around together and they trying to tackle each other and</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let's just let everybody know what this about you were a game warden are you are game warden right and what that normally entails is like you know you find a guy and he's got three trout when he's only supposed to be normal stuff like these illegal grow-ops where cartels were growing marijuana and you turn from being a regular game warden to essentially once you let us know what how it worked out yeah it was it was a crazy Journey because you don't think of game wardens doing the type of work we were doing when it come to the the trespass grind cartel issue you know and what do everybody think they think a more check fishing licenses in 1992 you know I grew up hunting and fishing and I got my hunter safety certificate with with dad's help and 9 years old so I was on the woods in the woods are my church I just love you too cuz three generations of family my grandfather's career Navy my dad you know as an army guy and you know we just had conservation in our family you know for Generations so I got the job stuff to start came down here to Southern California traditional stuff fishing regulations night hunting you know working gear openers is really cool to be a deer hunter for all those years and then actually go with me no talk to guys on the other side and see all the good guys out there and some problems and then in 1995 I got to go back home for the Silicon Valley that's where I'm originally from born and raised so live in the suburbs kind of Foothill areas of other Silicon Valley south of San Jose there and in 2004 I've stumbled into El Cartel will become a trespass marijuana grow site and you know to specify this stuff now that we're regulating you know the last couple years here in California these are not sanction marijuana sites this isn't the legitimate industry that's doing it by the numbers and trying to this is always illegal these are always here you know on public lands destroying our environment of waterways or wildlife and on private land as well and on that situation had a good friend of mine that I grew up with on there was doing his mask thesis at San Jose State University both of our alma mater on steelhead trout endangered species red-legged yellow-legged frog and all the aquatics and these two creeks and this was right below Henry Coe State Park where I really met my first game or and there was an inspiration to get the job when he's water was really sensitive Headwaters coming down through this stretch for like 3 miles all these endangered species in it black tailed deer you know all these other great animals we like is conservationists they're thriving on this Creek NE call me when April and said hey John this is weird one of my two Creeks is bone dry and all the fish this feel like fryer dead you know everything living on this Creek is dead there's a bunch of like debris and plastic lining and looks like camping stuff that's down at the bottom of where this Creek Feeds out so I get in the truck and I figured thinking okay someone's diverting water up there it's probably a Rancher Nina for cattle operation whatever we always top of the hill Joe then we start the hike down and I'm by myself you know I got my I got my rifle got my gear going to be any radio coverage don't have any cell phone coverage and I have an unarmed civilian my partner biologist with me and we're expecting to find something very predictable that I'd seen of that point and that would have been a normal water diversion and when we found the Water Source in a beautiful Canyon I mean crystal clear water Trout Creek the whole 9 start hiking down at following this we see the damn see the water line about a hundred yards down this beautiful little create and there's much marijuana plants under their short cuz it's early in the season only got 2 ft tall and we see to Growers and they're not the Growers on tip of the you know that I would have suspected these guys are the only got rifles they got handguns they got knives and their kind of cruising working there plants coming toward us and I was at oh s*** moment you know if something crazy goes down right now and I got no backup I got a civilian with me these guys are armed and not your typical poster that I've ever encountered and we can get seen we kind of hit out you know he's a hunter I'm a Hunter we stayed you know you snore stalking and stand to the creek bank and just just watch these guys work their Plantation and went up the hill and I looked at this and where would we just walk into this is crazy we got out safely and that's when I started to bring another agencies narcotic groups task force has the Sheriff's Office started to learn other agencies in my area this is really on in the game did you guys do about that one grow up like when you found it like how did how they resolved that well we got a team together as fast as we could safely and usually takes a couple of weeks and I want to stay within a month we were back there now the interesting part was getting ones aren't known for doing this type of work just like you said at the start right so they're like well you guys know the area you went in there help us find it get us into the area but we're going to leave the raid and also of course this is your jurisdiction we don't normally do this type of stuff so to go for it so we were the bird dogs we kind of guided him in the area we had like 20 30 officers we kind of let him down to the canyon got him in there safely we found the two Growers we spooked on they didn't get caught that day they were they ran down the canyon nobody pursued some of us wanted to obviously because the environmental damages but the biggest thing a change the game for me that day was seeing the environmental damage so I was a 7000 plant garden and at the time we didn't know about these bands six substances these insecticides carbofuran that they're bringing up from Tijuana and transporting actually smuggling from cross the border to put on these plants to keep everything living off of it not to impactor cash crop and that was out there in some extent but it was so early when I'm really aware of the level of toxicity this stuff and how damaging it is so it's all new but we we eradicated that garden and then when you're done eradicating it we had all this mess and Creek right we had Camp trash we had fertilizers pollutants propane tanks all over this beautiful channel that snowdrake's has been diverted unbeknownst us all that water was totally poisoned that they were diverting to water the plants that's why that creep was so dry and we we eradicated everything and then it was like okay we're out of here and I looked around and went wait a minute man I know we got that I know we got the illegal marijuana out but what are we going to do about all this damage and nobody was Reclamation the damage or or cleaning up any of this mess so I the first thing I thought was we are resource issue that's crazy I mean you know spend my whole career up to this point protecting Wildlife Preserve in waterways for all of us to enjoy it you know conservation is enthusiasts whatever side of the fence you're on and nothing's getting done on that so kind of the light bulb went off a little bit that we need to do more to this at we're going to get involved we need to get involved in these type of cooperation because it was a biggest environmental you know Trainwreck I've ever seen and I'd worked a lot of traditional game warden stuff to to protect those resources so once they had gotten and ruin out and chopped all the plants up or did what they did they try to reclaim the the creek did they try to remove the dam and get the water run back again at that time no no one is doing it right and that's that it's exactly roller with what really really kind of upset me and again we were done with the game we were the game warden nobody really thought of us as Mainline law enforcement already do narcotics task force guys or anything like that at the time so I was going to make waves we just wanted to integrate and work together and wanted to unify these teams and what I really wanted to do at this point is get back with my command staff and you don't my bosses and go hey we got a big big problem out there man and there's more of this going on and we need to be involved even though it's not traditional because we're sworn to protect our resources and will decide everything game warden that you think of from the wildlife standpoint or Mainline law enforcement just like every police officer right we go through the same train and then what people don't realize is we go through two more months of additional training in a really long Academy that's all Wildlife specific Wildlife forensics Wildlife ID weapons identification all the things you really need to do the game or inside of it with Wildlife you know in the backcountry so to speak but we needed integrate with other agencies and going to bring them into our world if we were going to participate so that one case started the changing me to try to build those relationships and get into tactics and tactical circles with some of these you know SWAT and Special Operations unit so we going to do this job under normal circumstances if that was just being diverted by a Rancher sofa Rancher done that and then how would you how would you fix that we would have got with him and it was called the streambed alteration violation and it's 1602 North fish and game code is the section but and it's a very section cuz Waters diverted for a lot of reasons and you can divert water with a permit in certain circumstances but you can't completely the new decree that has Wildlife driving this Waterway the state for everybody to enjoy which this one was and if normally the case would be that they would have to reave just have the the flow come back to exactly how it was before to remove the dam and yet that would be up to the Rancher that would be up to the Rancho be part of a penalty you know what could be a civil it could be a criminal it could be a probationary sitting here okay so there was no real there's no law involved or nothing in place rather to when you found these grow-ops but there was no previous president exactly it was it was completely brand new in this was you know one of the first grows I think that any of Acid found throughout the state of California is gay more to me than other guys finding some things and working but being from the Silicon Valley and being inspired by those wildlands to everything I became later and what I stand for it was home send it home but seeing that and getting to meet certain guys in the sheriff's department of my first book goes into this whole learning experience of you know ad hoc jumping in with other agencies in doing it and wore this was the first book more in the woods wore in the woods in the woods and then they're basically 10 years apart and the cool part about that Joe is when you look at the differences we do some major comparisons in what Warren Woods covers is that chapter one side first I'm telling you right now because I was like being live here it is right out we're not in Kansas anymore. Was crazy the people the higher-ups that were in charge of trying to eradicate the grow up and it take the cartel guy down what so they are that was their job was just handling that it was just handling the de marihuana aspect of it right right I know the armed cartel guys so there was no one in place that was supposed to take care of the waterway that there wasn't crazy that it does it was one of those things that it was it was based on the fact that a conservation group like from an agency like fish and wildlife like us we just weren't involved where we would be looking at those environmental damages right right but from a Narcotics officer standpoint you may see the damages but it may not register there might not be a you know mandate or even objective to clean that stuff up and in back of the time DNA was funding all of our state's and all of our County teams based on the number Romero eradicated so there wasn't any recognition of the environmental damages and any type of funding based on how much Reclamation clean if you didn't I would change fortunately and we were we were a big part of making that change fortunately but and there wasn't a lot of thumb funding or or email Point Kickback or value to catching bad guys to catching some of these guys are doing the damage is so a lot of teams then we're dropping on helicopter lines cutting plants getting a big plant count I need for it taking taking weed out now is it so crazy I would imagine I mean in law enforcement but I would imagine there would be one person who would like detail plan and I would think that well what happened while we found out the discrepancy is resume the creek part of the plan it would think it should be really talked about 15 years ago which is really crazy yeah it was it was the start of a big shift in my career because I saw this is a big problem I also up until in 2005 we were on you know one of our first second third since the operation since it's one we just mentioned in 2004 and August 5th 2005 the game completely changed cuz that's when we were involved in her first gunfight and that's when my partner Warden who had training the academy Partners in the squad I promoted to be Lieutenant for 2 and 1/2 counties the Silicon Valley Santa Clara County Monterey part of San Benito 20 days before this incident happened and I had young wardens it wanted to participate and do some of the stuff I was doing with the other agencies on the marijuana you know operational front and this was you know right above the tech capital of the world right there in Silicon Valley Los Gatos we weren't really Steve Berry Country Now August right before the a Zone Deer opener we are gearing up for that three game wardens three Sheriff's officers good Sheriff's officers and we met on that for separation 2004 I just gave you the story on and they were in Harvest time they were fortified they had heavy weapons like SKS is the AK-47 derivative sawed-off shotguns and they had to grow setup where they were basically defending it and when we came in there was an ambush shot from one of the Growers and that was the one shot the bad guys got off and unfortunately that's the shot that hit my partner 3 Bowflex in that bullet went through the right thigh and tumbled through his right leg and kept going through his left so he's down and we're trying to keep him from bleeding out for holes for the better part of three hours waiting for an air rescue and we you know nobody in the country from the standpoint of a law enforcement team ever been counter-attack by these Growers chase him around and run away sometimes we find weapons often times we wouldn't but so this was just a real eye-opener like what the lucky we just walk into and plus my partner was real close to not making it and fortunately he did survive or I don't know that we be sitting here telling the story and talking about it but that day when I saw how well they were equipped the type of Weaponry they had in the fact that I almost didn't come home that day I went okay this is super dangerous we can't do this a standard Patrol game wardens we can't do this doing just the traditional stuff we should stay involved in it because Acyclovir we can't do this a standard Patrol game wardens we can't do this doing just the traditional stuff we should stay involved in it because aside from being so violent the environmental damages Jill were the worst I'd still ever seen and they just kept getting worse and worse the more operations I work in my home County right so we learned a lot from that there were a lot of tactical lessons are a lot of Team lessons a lot of things we could have done different and that kind of changed the game where we eventually got to what we're going to talk about a little bit later</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you sit down right leg on a piece of paper or do you write while you're in the army writing is a visual process yes and I can't if I write it down if it comes to Dimension one out I've never written lyrics that I thought were genius and actually committed in the paper and saw them and they be and they could it's like they dissolve from this three-dimensional Beauty to like oh it's too much no garbage it's f****** Bazaar I know and it's not always like reasonable but it's my process at this point how did visual if you really listen to my songs they're like photograph like it's like flipping through a photographic album almost if you really listen to like what I'm doing it's a very visual I see the pictures from pictures it's similar it's like but it's in my brain is its there so you senior visual in terms of like the the story of painting like the guy outside the liquor store or the imagery yes it or like you know the song like like Jesus where it's like just kind of cultural like f****** pop culture reference after reference leading down a path of just like stream-of-consciousness pop culture references you know me I'll go on tangents you know me but it'll be all within an energy inside the brain like music to like entities that shows or whatever they want to know the lyrics so they can know if they should put it on a relation or whatever if it's probably not but even when it comes to that I have to have cyclic recited to somebody and have them type it I can't it'll it'll just kind of taint it to me brakes a barrier of some sort you did everything vaporizes so do you how do you capture the davarious Beats do you record it as you're coming up with it there's a few different ways to have sex for me like you know if I'm doing like The Hip Hop ish or hip pure hip hop project out there be a beat involved always first you know I'm going to be somebody have a tracking will be like let it bump and see what word starts popping up I like we're playing bouncing wordplay but I doubt it can't just be worth play for the sake of it has to like tie into some sort of like idea when it comes to a song it's usually I string together some simple chord progression and and start and end CNN if I once I see something I really like it'll just like I said pictures of start coming up and you kind of just try to describe the picture a little bit and sometimes you you come across poetry when you're describing the picture you like that's good there's a lot of like not that's not good you have to watch the life of its finish in a weird way I'm about to nut I mean we both have children but like you're you're taking this idea from kind of garbage e idea that you know there's a premise there and then likes over a f****** series the f****** shows or nice or f****** maybe months you find it you know what differences and then you got it and you get to rock it for maybe six months that special if you're lucky enough to be on that level you know it's almost like I almost envy that, I wonder if you guys ever ended the, kumquat doesn't quite have that yet so we can like he has this you know badly of material that he hasn't had the trash yet you never even talked to Roy wood about that was just on right before you heat that's one of things he said that you shouldn't do TV's like 10 years look at the sea like be hardened like via polish Samurai of stand-up you know but I disagree I say let him see everything from see all the b******* all the stuff sucks all the terrible jokes who cares just keep going specially the progressions there when you eat go get takes a hit so it's good it's always good puts everything in perspective and I wouldn't produce my own records until like maybe two albums ago because I felt like if I'd made it through an album without being like seriously challenged I didn't make the best record I could then just being involved with a bunch of really seriously good producers I learn to challenge myself and it even the records are produced for myself there's other guys involved producing with me that are that I know are going to be the ones if that's some day that sucked that guy around and how committed you are to certain ideas I think this song is solid dude you outside of singing the song do you ever go over the song and Ponder like what you're saying or how you're saying it like how do you cuz your stuff is so it's so interesting because you're you're you're telling these stories of your experiences in these songs and in a lot of them and you're also having fun and you're also talking s*** you having a good time with them as well but when you decide okay this one is going to be corded like this how do you make that conclusion for me it's again if there's not like cuz I I can also even if I'm not doing this for this trait wraps on this times when I get a track from a producer that I just love the track and I'll build something around that other than that it again start with a guitar and I'll either create a very rudimentary drumbeat and lay down the guitar and maybe a vocal I have a very unique voice you know it's not like so it's seesaw between the guitar in the voice tone start appearing that like resemble other instruments to me like it almost starts telling you what to do all that's not the sounds I could hear all roads in there or I do the Baseline should do that you know you can hear that and the guys I surround myself with her beasts that share the same you know they know all this I hear that tell you what to do with it if you really listen to it believe that cuz I I kind of did you know one of the things Santana told me you know that I always held onto is like you know go and have experienced this once or twice while Britain very similar songs to friends of mine are people I know that was like woah I maybe not sounding but like the idea of wow I bought something that was exactly and he said like you know we're all just antenna that like catching energies and shittin like bringing them in and you know bring it take making some of that energy and sometime look at that same energy in similar things happen you know enough so I always look at that a deck look at my ideas like this but also because I don't write them down I equated to like my children like this like my ideas are like little animals that are wild and ice not see them and I think they're amazing and I want to play a song Until I know it so well it has to stick around it. I got a tight rein it to stay and if it stays the next morning that's it it's kind of answers your question the next day if I ride if I'm on to some and I'll write a song I'll sing it 200 times if I get it close to done and then I'll go to bed and then if it's there in the morning in this in the same form that we recorded if it's gone I didn't get it wasn't mine and that's happened a lot everybody with my my fingers in my ears and write it down and hear what I said I'll sing it 200 time so you know what I mean so if I've done it 200 times and I don't wake up and know it it's f****** trash. Supposed to happen so it's like I'm not turning them out like that I took you know and I don't again because of that there's not like this crazy Archive of garbage that's going to be released when I'm dead it's not going to have it is not going to happen is not a happy cuz I even saw as I start to record if I get halfway through it and I'm like not even sad by what he gets erased there's a few things out there that I wouldn't release but they're not in the House of Payne days and they're not bad that just like they weren't for they didn't have a purpose for people see bad s*** from great artist I do I think it's good it's good for everybody have no part I mean I'm the guy that but I'll f****** live and talk about it for five minutes of the show and be like at least you know it's not a f****** tape right I'll be like that's real s*** you know I'm with that I'm just like it's my process and slight just the way I do DJ Muggs and my man don't take lost easily do that would like that f****** with garbage do it again sex for so long that that's Armour it the first time now is going to be decent and I mean so it's like I got to push myself to print to be better than decent but when I know for a fact when you put something that you're happy about it oh yeah I think so but that little. and put your lights on totally on my own that that provided me with something that I cherish like some people cherish private jet rides which is I can do whatever the f*** I want and still live pretty decent not super rich guy or anything but like better-than-average a good life take care of my family but creatively I could do whatever the f*** I want and it's a beautiful thing like I'm on my whole new shitt My slogan is f*** it I'm 50 man that's my new shitt dog I'm on bike I don't need get you can get a ride on me man I'm 50 I don't even care how's that if you do you go I'm just trying to have fun live my life go home hug my kids and f****** know that nobody could put them in school and they had a great day and then my universe is complete getting a ride on me man I'm 50 I don't even care how's that if you're a liar you go I'm just trying to have fun live my life go home hug my kids and f****** know that nobody f*** with them in school and they had a great day and then my universe is complete</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I keep thinking that one day they're going to come up the artificial Luke Skywalker type hands and that people going to want them instead of regular hands that's what I'm worried about if they came up with an alarm they're working on that right now they're working on some sort of I don't doubt any man you want to hear that wild one alright I went on you know when night fuking smoke and I went on a little YouTube Wormhole situation and somehow I don't even know if it's a YouTube video or someone else but I wound up on this video that was like world's smartest kid thinks that CERN blue the world up in 2008 all right and I'm like what the fuc I'm watching video like 20 minutes into this kids talking about things that are super smart and it's kind of like to show you he's supersmart you know what I mean this kid is Dad's doing the recording I believe we're relatives somebody very close to him and he kills into this whole theory of how he thinks when they collided the the electrons I believe it in the in the in the super collider CERN they caused some crazy chain reaction that blew up universe but they also weighed that they created an atom that weighed too much and he is the first 20 minutes is also explaining infinite parallel universes so with the kid whines up and with his theory of like one atom weighing too much in weight and is that being just enough to shift our universe into a parallel universe who's after I watch this everything I saw four months was talking about like it would be news down there on the news like I don't know what Universe are men anymore or it's Spider-Man into the spider-verse like all these everything I saw for like 4-5 months after question this video is like Multiverse s*** like s*** about multiverses and it's got me f***** up. destroy the universe during recent experiments which has resulted in us living in a nearby parallel universe instead welcome Eddy effect you know but it's crazy dude what cuz it's not just this video so I can watch it and that YouTube algorithm start sending you down a whole bunch of other and I mean you start here in Yuma and it's like it and then again everything that came out there was all these shows I would see or movies or news things about Mount the Multiverse all of a sudden was everywhere around me it was f****** nutty dude so I'm f***** up about that s*** right now everything do I open up a door to a parallel universe you don't think they would do it stranger things you mean yeah stranger things I mean things are strange right stranger things but sorrow world climate change that is the weirdest one to me climate change other than if you work for like the oil industry or something to wear glacier just posted a whole new thing at any or 80 by some in the 80s or Glacier picture of it and I'm just now and it's gone but I'm not even saying like blaming anybody for it I'm saying just missing it as an issue like let's pretend that people have nothing to do with it it's just I wish people had nothing to do with it because then we can go holyfuck is getting hot how hot is it going to get like we can just figure it out like try to say it with this is a natural cycle this is something some people still say right okay even if it was just a natural cycle I wish humans weren't in the equation at all so there was no argument I wish it would just be like hey guys it's getting really hot what the f*** do we do is if we had no control over whatsoever not saying that we shouldn't take steps to fix it we definitely should but I'm saying that if it was impossible for people to created it and it was happening around us maybe we will be forced to do something maybe before I go to Higher Ground get the f*** out of that do really hot spots you know make you wait what's Canada like I mean maybe that would be what we would do if there was no other way but we know that at least part of what the problem is people at least part of it from how many people start it want to start arguments about that what's the benefit of arguing against that it's happening I don't understand happening you see it getting warmer you see the statistics you see everybody freaked out the Amazon Fire have you seen to snow as f****** horrifying to see those photos from there just ended at believe it's purposeful I have heard that is some people are burnt away on purpose is what I understood compromise man you're the mean no matter what side of whatever you are on truth is Ben has been seriously compromised because there's a counter opinion to everything and if you're not Adept enough to really get involved and find factual information you can literally counter any argument there is with with something that doesn't mean either one of those things are true let's go find people just want to Google that shitt get on here and move on with their dad you know in and it's laziness on our part A lot of people don't want them it's like f****** this thing that everybody's posting with the goddamn f****** Instagram I don't give you permission or Instagram or whatever you you subscribe and and and adhere to their terms and conditions and some you think I'll picture of a copy and pasted Instagram thing over something else from Facebook f****** 12 years ago and it's it's bananas just like you suspect is wrong but you do it anyway if you suspect the strong take the extra time or just don't do it at all yeah I've done that all the clown in it and then immediately after it Dana came up it was him Mike Perry puppy has a specific job in the government is that what it is bounce the idea of multiple universes many times watch it just you're going to invest it give it 20 minutes or 15 18 minutes whatever it is and then you'll be like oh wow it's a fact into a nearby and very sick our universe but not quite the same and depending on your choices and how you live your life it's how you wake up and what new when you pop into any other side and everyone's just a little bit different the whole world changes just a little bit each time you make a decision one way or another everything changes when you wake up you think the world is static because it is when you're awake or asleep and when you wake up again you have this foggy recollection of the past and that's what you're going by you're going by every morning waking up with a foggy recollection of the past and that's what you doing in here if you're assuming that nothing's changed and everything static in While You Were Sleeping 8 hours nothing weird happened he's dreaming what is all that about I don't even know we have no idea what that is that soup of possibilities it's f****** swirling around in between your ears while you're snoring up a storm and then boom you wake up are you sure those memories are real are you sure that this isn't a whole completely new University living in today or simulation or simulation simulation f****** another genius super wizard kid who was talking about that something about simulations I forgot what I was high at the house with what with the guy who has my studio Divine and it and and and we were just f****** laugh and talk and Shadeland and I like like what if I may have heard this could have been so I'm not claiming ownership of the thought but it was like what it's like we just come from a universe like this so perfect and s*** and it's pouring and we just plug in to have all these f***** up like weird problems and that's why everything keep whipping weirder and crazier because I got kind of why we're here that's part of the ride you know that could be it they could be the only way you appreciate love is to know hate the really appreciate it and it could be the only way we would appreciate all the good that we have is the balance it out with all the bad that we have I'm going to start to overwhelm each other one way or the other there's an imbalance takes place in the to all of our f****** problems of society and when you you think about how long you going to be alive and what it is that you're doing here and why you're doing it and all those weird questions and answers that go on inside your head it's off your Distributing energy right you trying to figure out my Distributing my energy right my am I living my life in a way that is like the best I can do with what I've got right now that's it mine fox that's all you got to do though I mean I didn't even know matter what we're saying if you woke up everyday and that was your objective you couldn't really go or do much wrong magic

		<div class="paragraph"> found out like today yesterday like what teachers are kids have you know I mean it's like there's the whole like cultural parents circle of knowing who's teach which teachers you want which ones you fell in there is like I'm not going to go until weather we got what we wanted or not but it's like the f****** drama by this is hilarity to be it's like it's such a such a crow like Master teacher we want nowadays it's almost like the opposite that someone is going to get you attempt to make sure he knows when people are going to take s*** from him in like you don't understand that mentality the flip like that teachers like Jordan's f****** losing his mind in class teacher raise their voices that you know General example here but we got paddled out what we like it I was like I live there from 11 so somewhere in that range the f****** whitening in Florida William Powell and meanest kid got this I remember thinking even though it's probably like 11 or 12 or whatever it was when I got in a fight with this kid I realized this kid him in like badly burned when he was young and we were in school together and he was like missing part of his ear and his his neck was all f***** up and I was thinking like this guy like he's not doing so well like this is made me realize I scrap over nothing because he wasn't doing so well and I didn't realize that until I was in the principal's office with them in the fight like we couldn't fight in from the principle that was the authority figure we're both like subdued but I was realizing when I was around the mean guy he's a sad guy that just didn't get any love and he feels like you got ripped off by life cuz he got burned when he was a little kid and it made me think getting power just cemented it like agree with it you know the guy didn't hurt me he didn't try to hurt me and try to hurt the other dude either but it definitely battle this has to be a legal thing thing on it man you know I mean that's what we grew up with you guys I think I think there's appropriate time and place I really do but I don't know about that I've never spank my kids but I've never had to actually commit and do it so I don't know yeah I know it seems like it might not be the right and even would have bought physical Justice for me she would be a rare thing let me give you an example of when I'd like a time in my life when I bother even Bible using guns when I was very young we go out and shoot and like not hardness everybody take us out and shoot in the mountains out in the manual Sports back in the day and I forgot I had a very good gun education and understanding of guns and one time when they were away I f***** around with his like pump shotgun and f****** accidentally f****** loaded it and f****** thing is shot into the wall all right she's an apartment to this wasn't a house this is an apartment building turn another apartment but let's tell possibilities that when they came home a few hours later that apartment outside with surrounded by police like we've guns like they didn't know what happened at neighbors all called cops didn't they hurt a shotgun but so after they all settled it down and I got my ass kicked at last. Night by my father and and you know some people nowadays would say that's f****** rock but no I f****** could have bucking kit a human being easily I just you need sometimes no like okay this is because what you just did could have wound you whooping f****** the penitentiary for the rest of your life so an ass-kicking doesn't seem as Extreme as you think when you put in the balance of that so when you're getting so like a level of that I think especially for a boy can throw that feeding you know how to be a little rough but I think there's a time and a place where like hey so you if you're going to stop and get me on you you got to let him know here's this will be the rest of your life if you keep down this path that's that's got to be that extreme to me for it to be a beating nowadays Adele Groner she's my mom was little my mom was little when was a little woman like 4 foot by 11 5-foot tops from the hands to like stirring spoons and she still started breaking it became shoes and and like you know whatever else the broomstick and then it became like with you wound around my mom was a Brooklyn lady most popular like we doing stupid I was not chasing me to bug you coming home eventually dummy little but she was fast she was fat fence you f****** a****** just so goofy I think it actually made some more friends at the time understand me a little bit differently do like oh wow dude alright now we understand kind of your whole day</div>

got me on this and that way we're a year where I it wasn't taken care of I was like why don't want to switch out and have any doctors that you know I mean like B2B difference lately kind of get you like that if you support anything that he does even adjust his business practices then you're racist like everything that you support if he supported you racist yeah crazy does defending a racist or not see this a trick and very effective soap opera don't know why this guy supports Trump but maybe he could explain it right in the real estate guy he's a big real estate guy related properties if you if you can't see that I mean if you have a problem with that and many people would write many people would have a problem with that but that's a different thing but if you if you if you hear what people are saying they're saying if you support Trump that you support racist so you support white nationalists and I think you're leaving so many people out of the conversation when you do that oh yeah I mean the guy got a million people to vote for him so if you're saying anyone who supports him some type of Nazi white nationalist then we got bigger problems we should break up on paper couldn't even apply to be right would never be accepted into a being a Nazi or a white supremacist worried about people defecting from their tribe or turning on their tribe and we we have this like a built-in fear of this kind of s*** happen if there's that aspect to it right it's the people who are worried about people defect and then you have the opportunist who can playoff that I do instead of having to win an argument or having that you know like convince people I'm just going to say you're with the other tribe you're in this bad group so you're don't even talk to that person and I don't even listen to what they have to say you're a f****** adult was going to say why you have to be so defined by your Troy you know I mean like I would love to hear the argument about the what does good for him for his real estate Ventures I'd love to hear it like an honestly laid-out argument of why someone like Trump's better if you're real estate developer and I might be a significant part of his business he's really good and less accessible to his grandkids he wants to watch grow up and go to college it's like I don't know I don't think this is initially just bad people that have a lot of money I think there's a lot of good people that have a lot of money is wanted to do all the good s*** really upset about an issue you always have to wonder like how much of it going in there was what what is upsetting to use upsetting to that anyone who supports Trump represents all the things that are wrong with America today in terms like white nationalists and terrorist attacks mass shootings and and in the end in dressage and if you if you support any part of that any part of your good for your business Chick-fil-A McDonald's businesses the completely different thing they're like making the country great and jobs and draining the swamp and all these other things like they have two people looking at the same thing and seeing very different realities confirmed but that was I don't know this f****** if the thing starts off with every day you're hearing on the news that the president is colluding with a hostile foreign power he's a Russian puppet he's working with what Amir Putin and then by the end you like we have to impeach him because he thought about obstructing the investigation that he was declared not guilty in this is getting weird and you guys were going to be upset no

respect my mom and my dad like they never started s*** and just walk around and able to personally find out it's cool I can still get f*** with but on the walk home it was great that's very nice very nice Department of kid who's really mean who's like bullying you in high school and Junior High School and that could fuc people's whole lives up sometimes people never recover from that s*** and it's a natural inclination that people have the f*** with someone is scared of week to get an animal's man you see the dogs animals yep the basic and bullying is that since nature it forces you to overcome cuz almost every fighter that I've ever met professional fighter was f***** with George St-Pierre who is like one of the greatest of all-time told the story on the podcast about he was driving his Range Rover when he was world champion through Montreal and he saw this homeless guy in the homeless guy was his bully in high school and realize it was like whoa like what's going on man what are you doing in like talk to the guy and try to make amends to the guide help him out a little bit just like f*** man this is his bullying hike when you realize like most people that are causing pain and inflicting pain on people they're in pain man thats why they're doing it you know it's like victims you know the victims of crimes often times perpetrate those crimes on other people that that happens when kids get abused at home to get beaten at home they're the ones who want to beat and kids up at school you know they they want to dish out that violence on someone smaller than them cuz they're getting it dished out on them by someone like Elsa power that's the constant victim narrative but on the other hand families of people that grow up that are martial artists like like all the kids know how to fight their the nicest Friendly's people they don't worry about it it's not the thing that f**** with her head like for me I knew I didn't know how to fight to a scary so I can every time some more f****** me about like headlock and threw me down on the ground and was going to punch you in the face I'll never forget this like I forget what was happening we were talk we would like I said something's he said something stupid to me I said something stupid back to him they just got me in a headlock and threw me on the ground and he helped me like that he's going to punch his like to bother I'm just sitting there going goddamn help with and I remember going that's it I'm going to learn how to fight this is ridiculous do you do you ever run into the people from your past you have a revisionist history on your relationship and not too much cotton balls deep in martial arts like my first year of high school so wide like halfway into high school I was already crazy I was already competing and traveling all over the place and so but I do want it if people have fake stories around the people that don't tell me things that happen to anybody story about some guy told him that one time we were on the street and some guys across the street were talking s*** I want to cross the street and kick both of them they had my that never happened never happens I'm a guarantee that never happened to the last I was in a street fight I was like 15 I'm like this never happens is not a true story opposite manner people come to me with s*** that I don't remember I just let him have it if that's your memory of us in college fine whatever when you're at what didn't happen when you definitely not like I know for a fact I was never in any street fights outside of high school had a professor from college excuse me in a phase of Facebook thread of Summer article about me and like all the other alumni are commenting on it and one of the professors I remember in 1994 when you said this thing to me in class and Storm by the time like I didn't roll until 96 she's clearly been mad at me all of this time about something that I didn't even do and I'm just there's nothing I can say this is Veterinary to find you know what I'm sorry for the s*** that I didn't do whatever but then she replies thank you it means a lot so arrogant brain I freed her of her anger or whatever the f*** it is you thought I did but great I just don't feel like going back and forth that's a great approach it's it's so much easier to evade I'm more of an Invader in a schemer than a fighter like I'm not going to argue with you and go back and forth but what I will try and figure out a way to do is over the next two years diabolically dismantle anything you stand for and believe in, but that's that's my approach to think like there's a comedy club owner that God is my witness before I die I'm opening a comedy club across the street Comedy Club across the street I heard the stories</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what comes with it that's why you're so good man did that that the Hustler mentality that's so important that stole important Network you fine people that you can that are as driven as you and then you just figure out ways to work together and do s*** but comedy is so so many motherfukers a lying bro they're lying and you lie you get the leverage and like it's like so the way I got hired on radio so at the time stop was that misses 2001 amount of college and if I can get on the radio then that'll give me more access in the city and I can host my own Comedy Night by hosting my own comedy night I can offer money to out-of-towners who also have comedy nights and do swap out so I needed to get the the radio gig so at the time they were doing some sort of contest or some s*** who's the funniest and Birmingham some s*** and do for the contest it so I knew it was long story long story short is that about the radio station I asked the guy that I'm Buckwild who's hosting I-57 not the same song but why different iCloud comic I go get cool not done enough for the comedy club in Birmingham to know that on black weekends the black radio station hosts the black comedy night on Friday stayed throughout t-shirts and all that s*** so I go to the comedy club and I told Bruce Ayers and said hey I just got hired at 95 7 and they want me to open for DL Hughley this weekend and goes okay that's fine I'll go back tonight I know you don't want to f*** with me but I'm opening for DL this week do me a favor watch my set if I'm funny put me on Monday morning because you got a deal so I get to the comedy club at Friday and all I have to do is keep Buckwild Bruce tears apart so that neither one knows what the f****** lie was and Bruce came backstage and you just act like you belong and you act like the truth is the truth kind of merge in with that s*** and Bruce Game of Thrones okay go out to the t-shirts and then you bring up Roy and I went out and it was 7 minutes by f****** Crush like just when you need that one set to go right in every syllable every f******, is perfect and I demolished in front of DL Hughley and I walk off stage and bucwild says see you Monday morning and that's how I got radio it's just what we going to do not f****** book me I'm already not really working the comedy club I'm already not hired by you what is the penalty for this lie is this lie will this life send me to jail know that you don't have but if you've performed somewhere else outside of where you from you performed across the country yeah what you basically dislike the comedy version of a subprime mortgage loan he kept the house that's amazing captain man I just thought I came up man cuz I got it when I was when I was 19 so put credit card from stealing credit card to college so I could have gone to jail or dish it could be a lot worse living in the back of your mind forever house mean but know this is having a choice I have to freaking do this I knew it dude who was one of the original credit card fraudsters his name is international style and international style and international he was a real nice guy but he was a famous loser at gambling and that he would make millions of dollars on credit card fraud he had an organized crime Empire and this what they would do back in the day remember they had this transparency like they would run your card they'll put on machine negociar Chuchu carbon people who worked in these department stores would take the carbon and sell them to him he would take those carbons make a totally new credit card out of the car AC with some sort of machine and then they would distribute them to these guy they would buy Goods with this stuff and then they would sell the goods and then guys would come to him in the pool hall with paper bags filled with cash and all he wanted to do is gamble on pool and he could never win and when I'm telling you never win that I was playing with dirty money and he knew it his head was f***** up he would be staring the 9-ball would be in the hole and he would be no dudes did you find something from him something very weird just happened what happened so I'm typing typing International Sal right and I hit space bar into things come up credit card thief and pool player but when I click the search for that nothing shows up because of us cuz I know all the Talk international Sal before I and him being a credit card Thief mom was actually taking care of him when he was in hospice he was he had cancer he died of rectal cancer Mouse jail for quite a long time but then got out and is doing the same goddamn thing again was crazy though is that when you get arrested especially for like some white-collar s*** like that like what they don't tell you about getting arrested is that the first thing they do is try to pin other unsolved s*** on you so before you even like get a mugshot of anything you just go sit in the room and they go here all the mugshots of the people we are looking at for similar crimes do you know any of these m************ need to get a handwriting sample Denny as in like this and that when you find out my all I was just a petty f****** teenager that just took a credit card to get some jeans and then you start realizing I do there's an entire f****** Syndicate of s*** happened in this city that I didn't know anything about they trying to f****** pain on me and that's when the fear sit in cuz I probably won't go to jail they do not care that is already a criminal that's when I got in the comedy that was the f****** depression like that was good f****** moment like oh s*** and then when he was in jail picture pictures together then you put it up on his Instagram he took pictures with the guy kidnapped he's like 31 years ago I kidnapped this c********* our friends that's a beautiful thing no man is a Redemption and being able to make a mistake and get back in the mix and learn how to be disciplined who's in jail and when he got out of jail he not not only did he have like a drive that other people probably couldn't comprehend but he knew what would happen if it went bad again he knew what would happen if he slid back down that road again and apparently likes Corrections often said when he was getting out you'll be right back in here and I will be I will be 32 years ago I made a mistake so why Redemption is about</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> going to see when you play people clips of Obama talking about the importance of securing the Border I like to play those clips statistics of how many people he sent back and telling people to not come over with their children will be separated from their children it's it's one of those things where people like don't like that they don't like to see that it really is deeply disturbing to them that Obama campaigned on this idea of protecting our border cuz we all agree on it would Trump yeah I mean he definitely said something for you yeah yeah for sure but emotional person I tend to look at what is the policy so I have tried my hardest to move the debate towards when it comes to immigration towards a matter of sustainability matter of sovereignty no matter the rule of law and I do believe in this idea of a managed border or do we not and you know that Trump has made the Democrats so crazy that they move erratically to the left and it's interesting to watch people always say like both sides of got into extreme I always find that interesting and two ways to manage to measure extremism one is our voting record like how often do you really but with the other side you can measure that pretty carefully actually and you look twice in a YouTube video maybe where you watch all overtime all the red dots in the blue listen to sort of mingle together and their voting records and they slowly over time move the sides so both sides are responsible for that like a lack of lack of actual compromise the lack of deal-making we So Cal do for your stuff you vote for my stuff that that doesn't happen anymore eating his reasons for that we can get into it another way to measure extremism and it's the actual policy changes so that we can observe that and I think I think it in that respect I don't think the right and conservatives have really changed our policies around we got more I think Alexa is vastly more extreme and then they've changed their policies radically medicare-for-all open borders I mean effectively open board then I like to use the word but when you're saying decriminalize it when you're saying no infrastructure all in the Border when you're saying no more ice detention beds you're effectively saying open border cuz you know anyone forcing you don't want to stop it so I don't I don't know what else to call it the green New Deal socialism the good word now so I think that on that loan that measure only one side is really moved to an extreme as far as pause policy positions go and do your point look at Barack Obama and he's not the only one who can look at Chuck Schumer's old comments on the stuff I mean it you could have written those statements for them people coming over here better for the life the real issue is drugs and crime what can be done to mitigate the fact of the Mexican drug cartels cuz that seems to be our biggest worry our biggest worry is it cartels and cartel violence but there's a sustainability and sovereignty criminals drug dealers the vast majority are but that just because you're a good person and you want nice things doesn't mean you get to move to the front of the line on immigration also important to note for people that don't know it's kind of a shocking statistic we let in more legal immigrants than any other country about how does someone get over here and how do we know that they don't have a history of violent crime sure like for a merit-based system with the president propose I think is absolutely right we we have the opportunity to choose the best people from the world to come here and if you're a refugee we have a system for that and if you're an actual asylum-seeker we have a system for that but we should be totally opposed to this idea that just because you made it to walk across the border that all of a sudden you get to cut to the front of the line and that's exactly what's happening right now Lupe's rehab if you bring a child with you our laws are written so that we basically can enforce it we cannot enforce these laws in this is for the Flores settlement heard that a lot what it means that you can't obtain a child past 20 days so if a family comes across her it's usually it's usually just a part of the family cuz what they actually do they split up now they split their own families up because they don't want to deport one of the parents is that make sense you can't detain children which effectively means we can never adjudicate these claims in time whether it's an illegal Crossing issue like a criminal act of 13.0 u.s. code 1325 illegal Crossing or just they're claiming Asylum either one we can't we can't adjudicated in time so what ends up happening is a catch-and-release when they say Okay show for court date what incentive do they have to show up for that court date so you know earlier part of this month so did you get to a question of sustainability let's say all the tail hundred thousand people are perfectly good people but it's sustainable sustainability question and it's also fairness question why do they get to cut in front of the legal immigrants why did they get so much more priority over all of the other people who want to be our country around the world and they don't have that opportunity across the border which system then we have to put a stop to that and then have a good conversation bubble maybe we need more workers okay well then let's increase worker visas if that's true I think we show sympathy about on them because they're poor people that are trying to do better for the life whereas we look at people that are coming over from Canada and if we had a hundred thousand people from Canada illegally immigrating into our country every year we could hey Fox get back over where you are like you guys have a great country already don't have the problem of a lack of opportunity in Canada the way people do in Mexico giant disparity between North America in terms of like United States of America and Mexico the economic possibilities the ship allows have to be written blind to those subjective terminology sure you know that night that's really important otherwise why have like why why even have a system at all if you just if you if it's enforced based on feelings the best-case scenario would be Mexico becomes like Canada chickens are not the one ones that are actually we're having an issue you know it's vastly Central Americans to get the United States this stems from loopholes in our loss okay so because they're actually border us or our laws work we can actually just put them right back for the most part single adults to weaken our system works okay with that the problem is if you bring a child until after 8 so everybody tends to bring a child and what it was also causes of human trafficking children don't belong to these pants I guess you know if they look at DNA testing the trying to try and work this and that is what's happening now and we find that good amount of kids don't belong to these parents so they bring over a kid in order for them to stay and what will happen is the motorcycle that kids border patrol often sees the same kid coming through a different adults and it's terrible what are the main countries who these people are, Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and again it seems like the only way that anyone could really truly is if those countries could rise up to the level of Canada so they could be right commensurate with the United States in this is what the left says we need to do and I don't disagree with it all the problem with what the left is suggesting is that the only thing we need to do and that's just not true we all talked to enforce the laws but it is a bipartisan I think agreement that we we want to develop countries closest to us encourages more creative look at development and Central America the bush Institute is talked about this a lot and I think it's a really good idea which is basically economic empowerment through through digital infrastructure so here America I mean a lot of money just based on the gig economy every individual can Empower themselves and and work towards that it's really cool they don't have that opportunity down there and it's a lack of digital infrastructure whether it's Broadband or whatever working for the investing in the right things as opposed and and work towards that has really cool they don't have that opportunity down there and it's the lack of digital infrastructure whether it's Broadband or whatever working for the investing in the right things as opposed to just made that that you're you're corrupt politicians can line their pockets with and we can feel good about ourselves with ourselves back and think like we're doing good for other countries really not again feel good or do good so he's a good question to ask and so I think I think we're I think we're working towards this solutions in Congress now</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> disagree about recreational marijuana use your apparently not in favor recreational marijuana I can be convinced but I'm not there yet now amazing you gave me this amazing coffee was actually reduces inflammation gives you yellow look at all so I'm definitely definitely more open to just the federal legalization of medical marijuana and all the benefits that come with that I think the science backside up pretty well sure on the recreational side I'm happy to leave that to the states okay and then there's the argument of states are having trouble with something xcetera because the federal government doesn't miss still make City legal might my issue with recreational marijuana still is is it's any good news is not a strong opinion I have this is not a hell I'm dying on by any means but if we're going to change it I want to understand what the point is like what the benefits are of it recreationally I understand the benefits medically very well but the recreational benefits and I want to see how this data plays out in places like California and Colorado I'll see if there's an increased use among young people cuz there's there's there's very good signs that says if you use marijuana a lot under the age of 26 are going to have cognitive issues for the rest your life along with lot isn't that you know we're never going to put that back in and so legalize something you're telling okay so it's a make the age 21 or what is it in California will you done though is you normalized it for teenagers cuz you said well yeah but legally there's nothing there's no issues with it a lot of people who live their lives extremely productive those people lazy b****** well yeah but I helped you out and I have a lot of friends who don't smoke pot the pot is it tool just like a hammer you can build a house with a hammer or get hit yourself in the dick if you're f****** crazy like Scotch you could drink Scotch recreationally can have a couple glasses with some friends and have a great conversation and it's a social lubricant and people enjoy and I enjoy and that's why we got a bunch of bottles of it over there look but but drink way more scotch it even close to the to the basically cognitive incoherent that should be was just one bite of a brownie you you would but not me I smoke pot all the time I could smoke pot I could have smoked pot before this podcast and the exact same podcast how can I had several hits if I gave you several hits you'd be obliterated and you'd be so paranoid he's their car and you think the government come and get you and they going to close down the Congress and it's a lot of it is based on her own ideas and perceptions and I had a lot of these misconceptions in my own head I didn't really I smoke pot maybe six times or so seven times before I was thirty years old and then when I was Thirty I started hanging around with a guy who smoked while my friend Eddie Bravo we start smoking pot together and I realize I thought this is an incredible tool for creativity like if you use it correctly and yeah it makes you paranoid but I think a lot of wood that paranoia is is you being acutely aware of your vulnerability and your actual real place in the cosmos your real place in society in the real dangers of driving cars in the real dangers of being in crowds of people that's not it's a weird uncomfortable feeling but ultimately you get through that and you're going to be okay in a culture that is not know they have a problem with what you're saying it's a personal level I'm not opposed to what you're saying at all I like when I extract myself from the personal situations I've had with pot and I'd look at it from a policy perspective I think there's something going on with my head pugs so the problem with illegal criminals salad the same problem we had during prohibition this is what popped up to Mom right we all know this this is this is a number one probably have the Mexican drug cartels number one problem is if there's a goddamn customer base United States and then making billions and billions of dollars selling illegal drugs and what's the solution to that and I don't know me not look I don't have kids f****** heroin to be something you could buy at 7-Eleven I don't want you to be able to go to a store and buy math you know but I guess there's a whole other conversation about Connecticut to depend upon the person I get paranoid and I want to do more things cuz I don't want to be a loser yeah that's what happened to me when I smoke pot I think it accentuates many aspects of people that are already lazy if you are ready lazy and you have a problem with discipline but I don't if you have a problem with disappointing you smoke pot yeah you're going the whole situation Define why not but I am but I do have to take into account the entirety of the situation and ask myself what what is the benefit is of society Society doing this like what is the people nicer enhances sense of community and makes people more aware of your surroundings I mean I don't know I think alcohol is much more of a social lubricant definition mean or two but I'm getting along with people going out and interacting with human beings it is good lowers your inhibitions so it allows you to talk more freely with people definitely encourages more sex and more terrible decision making and driving to but this thing about marijuana policy problem test for it and propaganda yeah what it is versus what it really is 35 so like grown up around this my entire life isn't so it's and I'm not going to to measure how much do I owe too much alcohol is is well-defined and we also just hundreds of years of experience with like other culture with how to figure out alcohol how to deal with us to have thousands of years of experience or how to use cannabis but it was suppressed in the 1930s by William Randolph Hearst and Harry anslinger and the real problem is make drugs illegal only Outlaw sell drugs you prop up illegal Enterprises is coming in next next month or next week rather John Norris who is a guy who works for the state he's one of those guys that have to go around and find his illegal grow-ops on public land and it's f****** extremely dangerous can overdose side I just want to see what the data comes out as from Cara is it mixed right now frankly I think we need a strong education program to let people know first of all if you have a problem with reality if you have schizophrenia in your family if your realities already slippery marijuana is not for you and I've personally seen people that have struggled that that do have an adverse reaction to marijuana and then go off the f****** rails it does happen this particular with Edibles Edibles in particular to knock people for a loop but then there's other people that it doesn't do that too and I think the way to study that is to have actual funding and make it legal where you could you look at things across-the-board figure out why the battles we should fight him to the federal level we got to start with a medical so I think that I think the science is clear there let's start another reason I'm a republican because I believe in so much slower policy-making do it like it with these these conversations have to play out in society and we don't always need to solve the problem right away like there's a reason for that things must happen so I think I think medical conversation is the one we should be fighting for the recreational side is is a few steps beyond that when we get to that no more generally when people ask me that I'm like this has that the medical thing is I think of you talking about right now I appreciate that conservative perspective in the slow approach to things and I understand what you're saying but what bothers me more than anything is that American citizens are not doing any harm to anyone could be criminals for something that's been used by human beings for thousands of years and doesn't show any real problems I don't think young people to drink but I drank when I was young I mean I didn't drink a lot but I did occasionally I don't think young people should smoke pot I definitely don't encourage it deeply discourage it and I tell people look there's a reason one of the reasons why I enjoy is I didn't start smoking really until I was Thirty and you know I take time off all the time it's not an addictive substance to me it's psychologically addicted to some people in there might be some evidence of the very very small percentage of people it's physically addictive but not like alcoholism not like a lot of the things that we can just buy any where are you free on it but it but only because I just think more due diligence needs to be done it's not this is not a something I'm being really opposed to well I think anything for young kids could be a real problem especially for young kids with a brain is still developing and trying to find their way through life and you give him something that severely distorts reality whatever it is I wish we had that same due diligence the way they prescribe psychotropic drugs the kids cuz we don't you know that the parents discretion so many parents are putting the kids on Ritalin and Prozac and adderal and you know you're right you making kids speed Frieza as a posted relying on cognitive behavioral therapy which is yeah and work much better because you're getting at the problem you're questioning your questioning the untruths that you're telling yourself as an effectively with CVT is a good practice and you can call that hyperactive or you can just say all that kids got a f****** great engine that a lot of gas to figure out a way to get this kid engaging what they like you take that kid putting in front of a video game because I have any problem focusing now what it what he has a problem with this shity classes with boring subjects bright and teachers that are uninterested and so many people are being labeled as being problems because of the blame something else besides reality how do you saw this I have a ton of experience with opioids because I've been injured so many times that you will ever have a problem getting off of them once you know yet it's devastating it was absolutely devastating and I didn't I never knew this was 2012 so I didn't know how devastating it would be because I just stop taking off I don't think I'm in pain anymore and then I didn't know what was wrong with me SEK I don't know how to describe you just really sick and your body craving the pills you haven't you but I didn't know that I think so you're just feeling the sickness Disturbed The Sickness it wasn't I didn't I didn't quite know where it was coming from and then you need to tell your doctor and that we didn't tell you that no you didn't tell me that just like it matters with addiction went went teenagers are hooked on opioids when that one dealer gets into the system like you change that person's brain forever and they're always addicted to a really bad ways and like it's different the way the way I always remember it like it's ingrained in my brain too but it's different cuz I was older if you got an injury today would you be would you be reluctant to take them now now I have faith in my ability to two act responsibly like I yeah you know when so that requires a lot of things but when he went in this is this a little bit gets to the War on Drugs philosophy like do you just not do it because we're losing all the time and I actually disagree with that pretty strongly because yeah you might feel like you're losing all the time but you are mitigating it and Supply does Kratom and especially with something like opioids at that one dealer gets into that one high school in NM get those kids addicted at 1 party and those kids die 10-12 years later we watch this happened I've been to the funerals and it's it's devastating in that supply that that the Man was created by Supply so like that again. There's no there's never black-and-white to anything so stupid stupid like it's complicated complicated. Epidemics I think a good indication of that could be done to mitigate the song Florida off and sell it to the Russians you know the whole deal with the pill Mills to give her it was a great documentary called the oxy Oxycontin express it detailed how they had pain management centers in Florida set up right next time they go the doctor was next door to the pharmacy that only sold opioids yeah and they and they didn't they didn't have a database I can get my opioids when I go over Jamie he's a doctor he could hook me up and then I go down the street and get more MP and there was an Express from Florida that went up in the Kentucky and Ohio and all these different Sprite we're having giant problems they found out the pills were all coming from this one area who is a Vanguard slammed down pretty hard we're going to know why there's a problem is a general policy approach we show is really questioned why the problem exists in the first place and in with the characteristics of that problem are people dying and they're not like they're not overdosing on oxycontin overdosing from illegal forms of it or heroin is laced with fentanyl so I had attacked the southern border that's where it's coming from waves of immigrants were turning themselves into border patrol they're allowed to cross because the drug cartel say they can cross okay that's why they come across an organized groups and then they turn themselves in the border patrol and they and they claim Asylum it was bring a kid with them so they know they can stay but what's also happening is just down the road the drug cartels removing the fentanyl another or other drugs across this in a bulky truck mostly like marijuana things like that so small they can just bring it another other drugs across this in a bulky drugs mostly like marijuana things like that then they'll so small they can just bring it through trucks to Ports of Entry so and so we need sensors to actually detect that and we're getting those Gringos put in place more and we need to secure the Border because it's where it's coming from and where it's coming from South of the Border which is China so the administration actually did that we got the Chinese to say at least that they'll do it and never know how much</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now one of the big issues it's in the news right now is the trade war with China and this is a huge issue and it's made me dive into a lot of really weird stuff with Huawei and with the Chinese government involved in and very corporations and it's a hard concept to grasp for the average American citizen that the corporations in China or not be connected to the communist government that this is the work hand-in-hand they do the bidding of the government that work together even though they are profitable radically profitable they also do things specifically at the bidding of the government including inserting ship that can allow people to spy on people which is why they're banning Huawei device isn't with the same thing could be said about electronics and aminos entire Apple stores in China that have nothing to do with apple they don't even make their own stuff and call Apple stuff thieves yeah very strange right what do you think about this sort of like tiger war going on right now that we're seeing play out publicly well I think the Chinese deserve every bit of it for all the reasons you just stated their intellectual property theft is is rampant and it has been for a very long time and we've been in this position where our business Community doesn't want to back them too bad because they want that market to be opened up and they will be very conciliatory to whatever the Chinese want and where to get openings to that market and Trump is the first president to receive know when enough is enough until I don't know why exactly he's doing it exactly. He's been talking about this for a very long time and I'm not overly sympathetic to trade Wars especially with our allies and I was happy to see us getting to a deal with Canada and Mexico I don't see a point in in in in strong-arming them but which I know how much more sympathetic to it and I think that that should largely be bipartisan either you don't even see Democrats slamming Trump too much for this consequences and so I would like the president to be more forthright about listen we're going to feel some pain too cuz when you implement tariffs affecting people Supply chains when you do that you're hurting American businesses to ask to be a reason for that reason is the Chinese are Bad actors and we aren't we aren't sort of an economic cold war with the Chinese thinking 50 year terms we thinking for your terms baby huge advantage in the sense if you need advantage that they can prop up their businesses and and and and and put forth their belt and Road initiative synonym in China 2025 I think it's getting that wrong but you know they can they can manipulate public opinion to encourage the statist policies and there's disadvantages to that to that means they're much less Dynamic the fact that they steal everything needs to never be competitive they're not truly a great you know great nation where they're making themselves out to be because they're thieves and it I think we should point that out but we are in this cultural war with them we are in this economic and of Cold War that's that's it nothing new but it is coming to the Forefront and so we got to be careful I would prefer you know if we do we take fight to the WTO we actually have a good history of being successful in the WTO against the Chinese and we go after singular companies like Huawei that would that would I would like to see that you know again I'm sympathetic to the darrows but they do hurt us a good competitive market we do well when there's free competition so we tend to want more free trade and we're free competition cuz we know we can handle it so so when there's not that it it it it can tend to hurt because we very complex Supply chains throughout the world and then stick no to that Sidelines play book that tells you exactly how you should go forth with us and they just now and then sell their decision and and and have a good end goal in mind and I think I think we could do a better job of having that but but in the end I think holistically are more sympathetic to being hard on the Chinese</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what were what we see is just very extreme talking points first of all very extreme interpretations of the actual problem and therefore leading to very extreme solutions to that problem sending twelve years and why not have a green new deal right like it's it's your operating off of a premise that is highly extreme and it's not it's not healthy political discourse it's meant to set and have a villain always comes back to the villain in the oppressor always comes back to this everything everything Somebody Like Bernie Sanders has can be traced to this specific ideology where one person is to blame for what institution is to blame I think that's extremely unhealthy way to look at things and I'll do until actually dishonest I don't know the parameters of a green New Deal the new green deal with it all the time what and what is the idea behind this and then an idea that if you do that you will you will have zero emissions in the next 10 years do clear remember when the talking points came out from the Green New Deal didn't like nuclear so that's how you know it's not an actual environmental plan or at least associated with carbon emissions and then climate change because why would you ban the other one reliable piece of energy that we have that has zero emissions with his new clear so you know it's not about that it it also includes free healthcare for everybody includes free college so it's like it's like every socialist plan wrapped into one and then they caught an environmental plan in advance fossil fuels and things like that so that's a fundamentally what it is it's a wish list of of things like that fear of things going wrong you know there is amount of nuclear energy has been used in this country versus the amount of times we've had nuclear disasters and there's also the problem with these old systems that went like Fukushima that were implemented in the 1960's and 1970's they they're not as good yeah that's true but we we do have the technology to make them go in there and I think we should look at ways to research more tries not modular nuclear devices that are maybe we can get you Adam should have nuclear charge of a nucleus changed our the new green deals just wind and solar concentrates on chest windmills and solar energy ideas to replace the grid with some sort mean California it seems like it could be just put solar panels on everybody's roof in California probably reduce the amount of electricity that we need from the grid radically night and in so this is a complication of wind and solar in general is the boot you need battery backup to really make this work and that technology just isn't there just theoretical it's just not there off the grid with solar power to do that but when they don't like the plants shift weather but not at night 12 hours sun is enough will only if you have batteries only if you have the batteries to store it if you didn't we don't right now for a few hours if you want to if you want to shift the entire energy grid to that we do not have the massive amounts of some good dad on this I don't have enough time I have its massive is massive amount of batteries and Farms to actually hold that is an energy density problem with wind and solar system physics problem to the science can only go far even the theoretical limit to how much a battery can hold 400 it which we're not even we haven't discovered yet but it's a theoretical like capacity of a battery still make it very difficult actually do this and so it's it's just not realistic also consequences to wind and solar like massive solar or wind turbines of space needed for 4 for solar and also where you going to get that at the special materials needed for solar panels like other consequences to this and it's it it is not till 11 if that's the only possible way to do it is not. We should shun it okay that nobody saying that it should we advocate for own above approach if our goal is less carbon emissions than we need to be focusing on one hundred percent of carbon emissions meaning the world's carbon emissions focuses on 15% of carbon emissions destroy fossil fuels will have a utopian society full of wind and solar from the batteries don't exist to make that work but hate will make it work so then that then I thought 15% of the problem and has almost no effect on on the actual climate so when I say 100% of what I'm saying is technological innovation carbon then let's actually focus on carbon capture so I just dropped a bill of lading act and it basically repurpose is Grant funds in the department of energy to focus on carbon capture for natural gas plants so we have natural gas plants in Texas that are zero missions they taken natural gas they operate the the facility to create electricity than they recapture that carbon and they power the facility with it your own missions for Goal Zero missions let's do it works and also by the way that plant can keep going no matter what does that I would have a day giant building but make an air filter like a huge building the size of an air filter but carbon capture air filter the size of a building but apparently they're doing that apparently China is in the process of building things like that I've heard of some things and I think the air pollution problem carbon capture site it's definitely happening with all the oil companies actually doing it because there's a 16 interest in the only gas industry to reduce carbon emissions is a huge interest and they they realize where the conversation is going and we should encourage that you know so there's pretty impressive big projects going on by a lot of these by a lot of these folks what the green new deal is encapsulated with the green New Deal is basically more of an emotional plea to people that are worried about the future in that sea wind and solar as being free and clean alternative to dogmatic approach to those by themselves understands the Congo is a lot of a lot of places that have these good intentions often lead to bad things to look at the ethanol issue when we decided that we wanted ethanol or gasoline well I think it was Indonesia and Malaysia but they cleared tons and tons of forest to to make room so that they could so that they could produce the ethanol oil alright carbon emissions increase rapidly because of that you know all because of our good intentions and like that these incentives and the second third order effects tube to make room so that they could so that they could produce the ethanol oil alright carbon emissions there increase rapidly because of that you know all because of our good intentions and like that these incentives and the second third order effects they matter we have to think about them when we're we're talking about policy and if our goal against Fargo's less emissions and let's let's be thoughtful that how we approach that does not decide on a solution and then look for reasons to backup that solution</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> 1 things you said that you disagree with Bernie on was lobbyists yeah yeah agree with his notion that everything is attributable to some kind of corporate greed and therefore lobbyists it's just not the source of our problems it it's it contributes to it in some ways for sure these are not these are selfish actors they they they have a roll right they're advocating for a specific thing but I think politicians like to point to them is like the boogeyman remember everything that I have not I did not been my experience that it wasn't his not been my experience at these lobbyists of any kind of excessive control over politicians I just don't see that okay babe you know that the corporate back and give you $5,000 that's it I mean this isn't this is not in in no way shape or form and they buy anybody off transparent form of doing things other talking point that sell darkness is not true people who work for Corporation they pulled their money together they can't use company profits just because his personal night and they have limits and what they can donate to that on back and then they use that to advocate for whatever is important that business and I tell people where do you work I'll ask you work what industry when will give me whatever industry must you definitely have a pack lobbying for you on Capitol Hill and I'll just point out bills will say listen this is problematic in this one this would hurt our workers this would do this and put us out of business like don't do that and the other they're selfish actors what can be wrong with their this is advocating for their thing but that weekend also our democracy individuals can donate more than its own individual cap is $2,800 to a campaign and then a couple like you and your wife and double that okay so it's Cobo Financial there's also influence in terms of just cronyism and people reciprocating getting along with each other and working establishing long-term relationships where they agree on things and they make deals and they make deals that might not necessarily be in the best interest of people like deals in terms of like what business is get subsidies what businesses don't get subsidies what things getting outdated what don't what like to hear the perfect example of how do I think we should have left power government that can't be bought off like that you know you won't give her you want government is cronyism certainly happens Rhino say listen like those you know and who can who can lobby as the bigger the bigger company so there's there's some agreement here but it's I think there's still someone misunderstanding of what's really happening so yeah can Lobby regulation that really hurt who's at fault here it's the fact that government trying to excessively regulate so much and it and it creates a crazy situation where there's no longer competition okay then that's a that's a real problem now you know it did that excessive influence do it again it's not something I've seen because there's a lot of competition for influence anybody can come to your office and they all they all disagree different interest that actually compete with one another and they represent different interest it's it's not it's not self-evident to me that that influences is it certainly not bought and in it and I don't I don't necessarily believe it's excessive either I just not what I've seen everything I'm doing it don't come to me when the public support for policies and public support for for for bills and how low the public support is in comparison to things to get past and how when the public what it was things that the public absolutely wanted like across the board had something in the range of a 30% chance of getting passed through whereas there's many things that the public absolutely did not want across the board also had a 30% chance of getting through and they were talking about the various influences that may lead to these policies getting past now the argument is that your rep your sing Representatives Representatives don't do you justice and pass bills and enact policies that would help your community and help you then you'll like them at office but the damage gets done while they're there and the idea is that these people would then go on from there once they've established that influence and once they've helped these people get jobs in the corporate sector get jobs that represent what they've done for those corporations while they were a representative supposedly of the people I think it's in a really dig into like what issue they're talkin about what issues not supported by the poet. That's why you got to unpack those statistics I think you really understand what's happening there but I think that's too cynical of a way to look at politicians I just know I don't feel that way around about my colleagues on the left or the right 7 months start, you just like they just they don't have this influence another not listen to that they present one of the ones they generally be with obviously did they already agree with you bringing up very my new things that are that you just would never know about if they didn't bring that to you billions of dollars on drugs for the elderly in people afford them feelings. But by law the government's not allowed to negotiate the price of those trucks okay so know the price negotiations how did that happen well how did it happen it it's wilted never it was never a thing to begin with so that the government should be able to negotiate prices right the question is what is the price and in the other thing I have to point out is there's already a strong force against the pharmaceutical industry insurance companies because they have an interest in making sure that prices as low as possible they're fighting all the time against the pharmaceutical companies in the healthcare industry all of these groups are often played against each other and then it's politicians we kind of look at all of them we say all right what are your arguments were your arguments to make those decisions based on the overall good but you're going to piss everybody off when you do that Pharmacy and then it becomes a pretty good question like what is government's role there cuz I've I've when I first looked at this problem I said yeah just negotiate that make sense I learned a lot more I learned a lot more and it's not because I met with any lobbyists it has nothing to do with that is because I meet with Healthcare professionals and experts and know this issue really well and Economist who it's very far from self-evident that this would work and it's far from self-evident that would be beneficial at all back to make a difference you know when we when we look at the differences between Healthcare spending between us and other countries the drug prices actually very little to do with that they're able to negotiate those but they also get they also get last choice for medicine okay when you look at a Great Britain and Canada that they're not getting the premier new drugs like we have the United States do we get screwed As Americans because the patent laws are not enforced in these other countries to our Pharmacy or pharmaceutical companies get ripped off in other countries that's a problem and how do we start so that should be something we fix ripped off in that they've done the research to create these drugs and these other companies in other countries is copy these drug addiction are except because they have socialized medicine and their obligation is to provide medicine to the people so their obligations to they don't care about these copyrights they just care about getting medicine to the people know some people would argue that that is in favor of the population in favor of the people that need Healthcare I would argue not sustainable that might make you feel good with talking to then long run profit even if they're having their property because they're charging America was America's basically paying for this is why it's important for like trade agreements to say hate you guys have to enforce the same patent laws that we have otherwise this this is not sustainable situation eventually you don't make a profit right and that's and that's not fair for American the new NAFTA deal was negotiated this with usmca are you happy you have to you have to align Ascent incentives when you're talkin about any policy we have to dig a few layers it's never as simple as Bernie Sanders says it is it never is he always make it out to be so simple it's greed everything is attributable to great everything is attributable to 1% they only they they they on the lobbyists they aren't all that and all of that but my point is it's just not the overarching and we have to have those conversations they only they they they on the lobbyist in all this elements of Truth and all of that but is but my point is it's just not the overarching think there's noodle there's so much more complexities to that and we have to have those conversations in like we're just we're instead what we see is just very extreme talking points dream interpretations of the actual problem and therefore leading to very extreme solutions to that prop</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when people talk about issues in this country there's a there's a giant does a giant divide with one thing in particular and that has mass shootings mass shootings and gun control there's a giant divided between people that are Second Amendment Advocates and people that want to round up all the assault weapons and take away all the guns and they think the guns are the problem when you see this pretty disturb increase in mass shootings in this country what is what is your take on it what do you think could be done what's awful their terrorist attacks and I think it's safer to call them that the The Inquirer how you define a mass shooting to find when we look at murder statistics very very low point in our history I mean look at the early nineties is vastly more murders by gun than we have now I just statistically speaking what's what's that because of this isn't do they know there was a massive going to war on crime I think in the nineties increasing police you know you have the crime bill that went through with Travis it's worth a lot of debate right now in the Democrat primary and there was a approach to fix that okay gang violence and we we live in a much even though you wouldn't think so because of these kind of theatrical again I don't know what to call them because because the person doing is trying to commit Terror and for different reasons of course but but attach themselves to some kind of reason but in the end they're they're angry at something and they're taking some kind of psychotropic drugs over Diamond that they've gotten to this point in the so you know how do you fix that we have to understand the problem we have to diagnose it and then we got it and I think we have to be realistic about what the solutions really are and what our ability to influence those outcomes really is and that's it that's an emotional conversation for people you know what we've been doing with the last few weeks of course it's fun center in the debate so but we got to have it what can be done yeah how many is to go after the tool right to go after the guns I don't think that's the right approach it's not it's not against not clear that that would actually solve the problem is there's two there's two main requirements when you're looking at a reproach to gun control it's like doesn't infringe on law-abiding citizens rights number one what's the answer to that and to is it going to actually affect the outcome that we're trying to affect is going to feel good or they're going to do good okay and I think the vast majority puzzles failed both of the standards are they they definitely referring to abiding citizens right and they probably wouldn't even solve the problem examples assault rifles that was not an ARS assault rifles they're really the reason they are because they're called carmelites at the brand assault rifle is not a is not a real things on a real definition and but what if you ban them rifles are responsible for less than 3% of all gun deaths of two points 6% of all gun deaths to Hammers and knives I think are responsible for far more deaths for for 2.66%. even if you don't have a gun I can stop by Hammer yeah but you're pretty goddamn people about an AR quite realize. They think they're gripping it then they control the gun that's not true we can do what does though the room so have you thought about this I mean if you if you had a magic wand and they said hey Dan Crenshaw what can you do to solve this Mass Gun Violence what can you do to solve these mass shootings at the Target the source of them and it is not an easy conversation now which include four or more deaths but these are usually gang violence so gang violence has if it's in a category right so far this year and some of them they do include gang violence right. I think it's it's two or more is that what it deemed mass shootings yeah it might be more that we have 50 at the dramatized shootings at these that these guys are doing it all started with Columbine and it's become the sort of CopyCat crime has occurred over time and it like we didn't have this before that and I think that's interesting I think it's something that take note of and it and it's not clear what you do about that you have to have to look for signs of people before they do it and so one bill. I'm on which is a lot of Fire people just I think misunderstand where it actually is is the Taps act which is the threat assessment of prevention and safety act all this does is give local law enforcement the ability to apply for Grants to get training and and behavioral threat assessment training and data analytical tools to identify these threats beforehand people that are opposed to it they look at it like red flag law they they they combine those two quite a bit. stacked doesn't actually have anything to do with guns and red flag laws the depending on how they're implemented could take someone who looks like they're erratic or who has a penchant for violence and then say you do not have access to guns right in theory that would that would be how they work and they would fill a gap I think and it depends on the state some states have all the ability they need to see threatening behavior in the rest that person but it depends on criminal law within that state fill that Gap the concern with red flag laws obviously is is there really due process a lot of people here that are like okay that means my neighbor can tell on me and they're going to cut my gums the next morning yeah I mean if that's how the law was written then yeah you better be against that cuz that's a terrible law and intend to be fair to a lot of the people who don't like red flag laws they see how these are written in a lot of states in California has one and and they see how does a written and they say just doesn't protect due process how can we possibly before this now they on the other hand there hasn't been any cases where there's there's been some obvious abuse of that law either so you know I've encouraged the conversation I think the conversation has to happen at the state level because every state has different criminal law that's working a lot happens if it it said that does not happen to the federal level the only other controversial approach that I've heard is putting armed police or soldiers at schools which is like that seems incredibly disturbing to me now that you have people not opposed to it but it's disturbing to me that you would have to have someone standing by ready for violence we have guards everywhere when our schools because we've never had them before and they sort of signaling that we've reached this point of impasse where we have to do something about it and we're not doing anything to prevent these things from happening what we're doing is pretty the people that are going to be there when these things happen rapidly get used to it a gun-free zones or the first thing they were attacked to send me an email to counterintuitive response to this but it's it's true I'm going to commit a terrible act like you're going to go to the place where you know nobody is caring I really looking for a fight but that's there's some truth tonight and it itches heart is so hard for people to have this conversation again and there's a cultural fissure here to there's there's some people don't understand some people who like guns as a cultural divide there and I just don't like people who like guns guns guns and that's just not true and wanted things that people like to gloss over is how many people have defended their life and defended the lives of their loved ones with guns in this country every year it happens all the time I've got a whole list of examples that I could read to you right now unfortunately one gets brought up during gun violence statistics and talk about how many people die from Firearms every year in this country there are also talking about people who've defending their lives and defend the lives of our loved ones people get their houses opening to all the time by armed criminals and they shoot those people and they live to see another day and that person dies and that is the whole reason why people don't want to get rid of guns and I want to bring something up along those lines so it's far more likely in countries like Great Britain that you'll get your house broken into while you are there for more likely than in the United States like a bye bye bye good order of magnitude actually so that the why is that because they know that there is no gun in that house does a good chance of the kind of that he'll be 100% yeah even the Liberals like what is that due to crime rates in relation is there's less crime getting out now it's not fair to say that the causation that would be intellectually dishonest but it's an important correlation to know it's also important good per capita places like Switzerland and Israel have far far more gun ownership than we do people don't realize that true I wouldn't come in here and lie to you but they still are with the people like the people have the guns okay and I'm at a rate higher than the United States they are at how they stay neutral but they have almost no crime almost No Cry Israel to almost no crime except for the obvious issues that Israel has in general with Palestine Israeli conflict but it is a criminal act like a very little times like this is interesting about concealed carry data here in United States you know how do you solve this problem think about is 50% of all gun crime you're like 2% of all counties so highly concentrated you can you can so as we look to solve this problem like we would do after really peel back some layers hear the coup is coming the prop where is it happening why is it happening you know we can't attack the tools but it's just it's so far from self-evident that would work also so you abandoned are you actually stopping 3% of gun does no cuz why don't they just use another gun different weapon one of these a truck like they can use it they want to kill they can kill that the horror that we're seeing is that they like to kill this way and maybe that's why is that a guy like go back to Columbine it all started with that and that's interesting we should look at that like what is driving people to like that well I think there are a lot of people if you look at mass shootings a lot of these people when you read their descriptions they're very disenfranchised and very angry and when your franchising very angry there's like an archetype right there's a an image that you have in your mind of shooting all these people that wronged you I mean this is evacuar victimhood conversation and then the real conversation is how many of these people are on psychotropic drugs and what are those what are those drugs and what are the effects of those drugs have on people when you look at the numbers it's f****** stunning whether it's anti-anxiety medications are ssris or amphetamines or let it whether it's what whatever they're on that alters the chemical frequency or the camera of the biological structure of your brain in terms of like what chemicals are in there serotonin and dopamine with these speeds so many kids are on adderal and in various types of speed that stuff radically changes the way you look at the world how many of those drugs contribute or are factor in these killings I don't know if correlation equals causation but I do know the correlation is phenomenally High voluntary involuntary side football you're dealing with a lot of times he's these guys got a really shity roll the dice and that's there's no other way to describe it they did got handed a terrible hand of cards and some of them were pilled up and angry and abused and they have access to guns and then next thing you know there's a mass shooting is what would Bernie Sanders is on here there's one thing I thought I agree with him on which is we have to look at the effects of these trucks and I really what they are I don't see anything wrong with that I want to look at the guns they just wanted to say it's a I mean I don't necessarily think that really angry volatile people that have criminal records should have guns I think they shouldn't right so the guns are we already Outlaw that we do and we probably should you know have some understanding of who you are before we give you a gun the real question is what is understanding and how do we go about doing that and how do I keep people from making these incredibly rigid rules means particular regionally right if you have the states to decide to have incredibly rigid rules that preclude most people from having guns that can be possible if they've just devised their own tests and you're honest about your perspectives on things and that's the fear that's an honest. I have because you have what is the limit you know if you're on psychotropic drugs you be barred from having weapons front of course not you know when and how do you how do you manage that and anyway we do it now again you have to have committed a crime of some sort so there's other things too few abused medication if you abused medication federal law like you're you're you're barred from owning that you know that's in the dishonorable discharge from the military things like that so there's already a lot of standards that actually preclude you from from buying a weapon and there's a there's a third be a very vigorous debate on how you add more standards to that and it keeps you from buying weapon that's what I've read the thing that domestic abuse do I came up with from dishonorable discharge and NFA with an NFA firearm NFA refers to the National Firearms Act so that's what band like automatic weapons based on the general court-martial conviction a person who was convicted of a crime that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year including dishonorable discharge is prohibited on compressor yes that's what it is to tell if you were imprisoned not just a disc all the time no one has one thing that makes sense this gets you a very deep question about what are cape and I think delete apps on this before they why does government exist and what are we capable of solving and what needs to be solved by ourselves know there are there and what is just inherited human nature is evil and we hate it we don't want to be there but it is and it is it is it appropriate for us to screen to our politicians they save us and it's sometimes it is nothing we can solve it we should try but we have to we have to do it with some kind of constrained vision is tomasello would put it about what is possible and then let's reasonable about what is possible and then hit those two categories I said are we infringing on the rights of everyone for the sake of doing this and second is it going to actually solve the problem in those are those are very important questions and if we don't frame the debate within those I think we're we're we're not doing we're not doing Justice to the problem itself true but again no one seems to have any logical course any logical Clearpath like this is how we're going to reduce gun violence this is how we're going to stop mass shootings other than arming all these public places and I was in Rome recently and when you go there it's f****** standings military vehicles guys with guns just strapped ready to rock just standing by all over the place and I was like to be that way military tank that you know yeah yeah yeah but a mitigate something I think armed security at schools I think certainly mitigates things that start school safety go so I don't I don't I don't think it's just because of tangible things and I think they're perfectly reasonable and overseas I mean I don't regret a minute of it I can be hard at times moving around alot I used to be better not bad I'll do an interview in Spanish so it's all really not bad by any means but it's not great so you can go to a Taqueria and hang hang conversational Spanish Spanish</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is experiment in self-government which is a completely new thing in human history that's redefine the way the rest of the world governed itself mean this that's what America really is is it perfect f*** no but humans are perfect there's not a goddamn human anywhere that's perfect is not a single culture anywhere that doesn't have something that's inherently wrong with it the best system for imperfect human being right and it's it's a system based on the fact the unavoidable fact that we are in perfect and that you cannot you cannot constrain Mankind's nature to the extent that progressives would like to there's a there's a belief from an extensive is Marxist ideology and then going to French Revolution thought that you can perfect human nature that you can get people to be perfect eventually if you just get the state enough control and and stop certain thoughts that are bad keep those down keep these Elevate these other ones you can eventually get us to where we think we should be I think that's utopian see how that's ever possible I think are u.s. constitutional system understands that you know it it's not about her got together and just made a bunch of stuff up right there where they were there very well-versed in history this study that relentlessly and they took ideas from Jerusalem and Athens and Rome and London which of these best ideas in these best practices and they said this is probably how we should govern refreshing to say why government exists if they were going to say that in the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson wrote that the Declaration of Independence was it was it is declaring its independence it was also declaring why government exists and it exists to protect the unalienable rights life liberty and pursuit of happiness when he gets these ideas from guys like John Locke is life liberty and property or those are unalienable rights and you protect right to can't give them to people but you can protect them because they're already inherent in you their natural rights in the Constitution told as how to govern to make how do we live together will there should be checks and balances you should have an emphasis on local steak because because the problems are closest to the people and they should be closest Representatives down at that level 51% of the population should be able to tell the other 49% what to do you know we should have an electoral college so that the biggest population centers can't tell everybody else what to do is important structures they can bet it in the Constitution that allowed us actually last I think as long as we have with the oldest political that's the oldest document the world Constitution I took a long-standing constitution I think that's important realize to it's very bizarre that they had the insight to realize that she could go so sideways that they put all these checks and balances together that actually can reasonably well in a reasonably well way work today that mean there's a lot of people that disagree with a lot of the aspects of it one-person-one-vote it would like that they don't think that representative democracy is important now because we have this ability to communicate that we didn't have in the eighteen-hundreds you know you had to send a f****** Pony with letter on it in order to get your word across now you can actually tweet and you could vote online if we so damn it and we made it legal but the Electoral College do you feel like that that and especially with like things like super delegates do you think that that's still the way to do things and he's still an effective way to why is that because the alternative is the 51% versus the 49% and that that that would that really boils down to is New York in Los Angeles telling everybody to the President should be the vast majority people don't live in New York and Los Angeles the art exactly the problem 20 million + 7 what is it 9 million or something in York on Tuesday but not the issue where I can see you really are at your your your when people congregate in the population centers they also tend to start to think alike and I just think in a more fundamental level the difference between Democrats and Republicans difference isn't it a lot princess of course but a really kind of simple heuristic I think about it is the word Democrat and Republican who won believe in a fair democracy One Believes In a republic I was in God believe in total pure democracy but but when you're saying about Electoral College you are saying pure democracy or saying 51% of the population can tell the other 49% what to do electoral college is a is a checking balance against not that gives those states in the middle of some kind of voice that they wouldn't have otherwise had it makes them flies are reading Iowa right now baby in Iowa if if if we didn't have Electoral College could deer hunting there that's a good reason to go but still equipment to put the reality is it they would only they would only be campaigning in the big population centers they wouldn't bother going to the rural areas because you ain't get the most bang for your buck going to just the populated areas because you only care about 51% of the vote you're just going to go to those main population centers and you're only going to talk to them going to care what they think I don't think that's good that's not a good that's not good for democracy especially such a wide diversity of preferences and and styles of living across countries still important to be physically in a place to campaign like to physically go to Chicago to Campland physically go to Iowa want to see you yeah people I think people want to see you you know that's a good argument to be made that Hillary Clinton lost because she just didn't go to Wisconsin so I think people stuff people want to get to know you want to see you well the good argument Hillary two people didn't believe she had enough energy to go and campaign and I don't know I never met her I can't I can't tell you what the inside look at that campaign was it said Snowden work</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> your social engineering aspect of it in the social engineering aspect of it is it's very problematic for me it was an article was written recently and was one of the guys he was saying something about me in that no silencing white nationalism and keeping them off your platform is not censorship which is the the the dumbest way to sort of boiled down my position on censorship and ignore the real problems of other people deciding what someone can or can't say and what is or is not offencive one of the best examples is a woman named exclusionary what's the word exclusionary trans exclusionary radical with she was in a debate with people about whether or not trans women should be able to invade feminist women's faces so a person who's biologically male who becomes a female later in life should be able to make decisions in feminist debates in the sit-in any ride and get into their Sports and all that says yes but a man is never a woman this is what she says okay Twitter apps to take it down she takes a screenshot of that she takes it down take a screenshot of it and repost it like f*** you like I'm going to put it back up again this way then banned her for Life For Life you know who's on Twitter with no problems man is not a woman she's f****** correct biological it biologically correct made if we want to decide socially culturally that we we're going to accept this person as a woman is a completely different discussion but she's right she's biologically correct right and you know maybe this person identifies but she's saying you're not a woman and you're Banning her for life is crazy this is that it won't culture in its most boil down pouring is nothing to do with white nationalism it has nothing to do with race it has to do with a person that feels like their own particular protected group being a feminist being a woman and and and trying to like carve-out rules where women are protected and she saying I don't like the fact that these trans women or entering into the space and dominating it in certain aspects right and it's is an example of is intersexual wishing that they've created coming coming to terms with itself and you know they are a lot of the feminist groups aligned with us against the equality act because the equality act would have put into real practice this into concrete terms biological man getting into women's sports yes and so a lot of other things by the way but on a deeper level it's interesting to watch that intersection of Coalition just implode and it stems from this desire on their part 2 of 2 divide everybody up into three categories of oppressed the oppressors and they've been the champions of the oppressed right in the world cultures the champions of course that's how they label themselves they were they live with their intersection of Coalition is is the oppressed and then they lump in and out of this whole other kind of intersectional Coalition of oppressors and they connect call with the worst of the worst witch is white supremacist Nazis not to do you're out and they say you're all connected with that somehow even even if you're just making a pretty bland statement about biological men and women somehow that connects to this and this is how you see them reason their way through it and what that does is it undercuts real basic arguments because you're attacking the intent of that argument because you're connecting it with the worst of the worst right we did it and so if you're connecting all of these things you disagree with with that what you don't even have to make an argument anymore yes and the idea that you're going to somehow or another convince people that everyone is a Nazi just because you say so that's not going to work it's going to work as people are going to just they're going to go to the other side you you're making more Republicans with this crazy talk what the f*** man it's a it's a goddamn ancient flag of representing our separation from England and our want to be able to start our own country we that's what it was exactly and it gets to a deeper culture War one of those many fronts on the culture wars this is a big one is America based on bad things are good things are we good intrinsically good or we bad that this is this a huge fissure in the culture War right now and you know it wouldn't when we and I and I have a lot of fear that that that these things are blowing up in that were destroying the things a few things that hold us together as a country like what makes us Americans it's it's not ethnicity not religion is I really geographic area because their geographic area has changed over time it is it is ideals is ideals in his ideals are symbolized by certain things in this USS Constitution the Declaration of Independence how the national anthem like these things matter and I think it's very important for a culture and Envy in this actual ties back into this sort of oppressor press kind of ideology because if you tell people that they're oppressed will then they have to look for an oppressor and it starts small it starts with your parents or your boss or somebody don't like look at their fault that's why I have something bad happen to meet somebody else's fault that it grows into groups identity politics and putting identities against each other institutions okay this is kind of this is about Bernie Sanders this is he doing this often is blaming institutions for r4r for issues constantly that has metal that is morph into blaming the entire country the entire country as a as an American ideal is to blame and I just think that's really I think it's historically inaccurate I think it's inaccurate objectively but I just think it's dangerous I don't think it can go anywhere good unless you just want Total Revolution some people do it just it tears us apart right and we're getting divided along we're we're allowing the pop culture to get involved in this too so we can't share pop culture anymore because you're the musicians are getting involved in politics and then Comedians and late night shows and it's like okay well not have to Country can't even watch it because those people are just tell him that stupid they are losing these basic symbols that bring us together and there were lots of losing a pop culture that should be something we can just share is this before just tell him in that stupid they are losing these basic symbols that brings together and then we're also losing the pop culture that kind of brings us together that should be something we can just share and then not talk politics but that's been removed as well and I just the culture war is it's it's not going to get direction I'm hoping that this is an adolescent stage in the development of this strange country that's an experiment self-government that's what I'm thinking</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Beenie Man appreciate it I'm glad to be here this is pretty cool you are rose to prominence through a joke isn't that strange thank you and Saturday night and everybody the seal Community is not prone to righteous indignation kind of reaction there they're more likely they were more likely in private to just double down and make fun of me more you're struggling just to do all your last minute things to get the vote out and so this was it was it did not Don upon me how big of a deal this was going to be at the time it felt more like an annoyance it felt more like I've got to come up with a statement and I'm seeing people really upset about this but I'm not going to lie to them and tell them that I'm emotionally upset like I'm emotionally triggered by this that would be a false reaction on my part so we crafted I think the the right statement which was listen like it's offensive doesn't mean I'm offended and you don't have to be a few. The choose to be offended here and it's just a general rule we should try hard not to offend people and try not to be offended okay there that's it and I apology to my high horse and play this play this aggrieved victim role which is which is the expected role to play these days we don't want to do that good for you good for you for not doing so refreshing but the joke was kind of funny I mean I have to admit he said he's look you look like a bad guy in a p**** film that was not the expensive part what kind of pornos what is I in the war or whatever that's what's up Brian that would let you know after I've gone on the show and seeing how they do things and how carefully scripted it actually is it's it's it's it's unclear to me and it always will be and nobody will ever come out with the actual truth on this on how that mistake got made I think I think probably Pete Dave I'm just giving him total benefit of the doubt and also have after having met him and ended you know having a general rule that we should try to give some people some space and assume that they're not the evil people that we might assume they are he probably just kind of looked at the line and didn't feel like finishing it and just said I would ever and it just in it in that but that caught in that in that created this you know what would actually was a pretty offensive comment but you know did he mean it will never really know the whole premise of that joke was mentioned I mean that you said as much right they they said look at these gross people we don't like them and just to appear somewhat Fair will make fun of One Democrat I mean they did they did say that the thrust of the entire skit was obviously not well-intentioned but I'm not sure he meant to be as deeply insulting no Joe Rogan look so deeply into why, two things but the majority the reason why they say offencive shed is cuz I think it's going to work that's why nothing it's not like they Harbor some deep resentment or anger towards any protected class or anything like that this is like what people are non Comics look into it guarantee 100% like this is going to work that's all it is just going to get a laugh things you talk about that are important to you that you trying to figure out how to make funny but for the most part especially on something like Saturday Night Live with her all kind of competing to be funny together and it's a very weird show it is it and it's it was cool to see you there watching how it all takes place you know they they come up with these wacky ideas they they test them out the writers go try it out there to see how it goes they change some things will do it in front of an audience will see how Their audience reacts and I'll go with that I just want to be a part of this when they actually have my input on the what was great about it though is that you came back after that and he apologized to you and you accepted it graciously but it also got it mean it was great for you cuz it got people to know who you are and then I started paying attention to you after that I started watching some interviews and watching some speeches and different things and I found you to be a very reasonable right-wing guy which I think we need way more of in this world you know it's like beaches and stupid things and I found you to be a very reasonable right-wing guy which I think we need way more of in this world you know it's like and is polarization of left vs right it's his seems It's so toxic right now that when you can find people that are reasonable and intelligent and and think along logical lines that you could easily following okay maybe I agree or disagree with this guy and I see where you coming from</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yet we are getting out of a problem in politics as politicians and political leaders I think I forgot to explain why we believe what we believe and that's pretty important you know what I think too often talking points are relied upon it's not necessarily but they're not persuasive because you haven't gone a couple layers deep information get a deeper understanding of why you think what you think people are ready to hear that they're ready for some Nuance that being said it being in politics you wouldn't think you wouldn't think that we're getting any closer to nuanced conversations and political conversations on podcast are opening up a whole new door where you understand people like Tulsi gabbard or Andrew Yang or Bernie Sanders of the people that I've had on his podcast 1A things that I've talked to people about this normal person that you hear him talk and you know it's is always in these very quick sound bites on television that he's always yelling about wealth or race or something uses like a madman most people in Congress or not exactly we we make small talk in the elevator these things happen Bernie and particularly these in the Senate's I don't really interact with him at all Tulsi gabbard I didn't mention her we do we do have good conversations that does happen we disagree vigorously done lots of things turn volume and overseas she's she would generally she's much more of an isolationist than I am but I remind people were talking about that particular subject why do we keep troops in Syria why do we keep troops in Iraq why do we keep troops in Afghanistan isn't the war over when we bring the boys back home and did the answer this is not a conventional War this is not something where you sign a peace treaty with a uniformed Army it is it is a different the different situation some guys like me over there so they don't come here we send guys like me over there so we keep pressure on them and then prevent them from the operational space and timing to commit another 9/11 have to understand that these people over there wake up every single day trying to plan another 9/11 is that is that is what they do and an increase in and Isis activity just the drawdown that we already did having serious so you know that's a that's a fair disagreement again but she's a really cool person because we do talk and then I can die tonight and I'm just like her the person we just disagree on things but little respect their to play Devil's Advocate some would say the reason why they want to plant plot another 9/11 is because we're over there I disagree with that is so it looks like at the assignment example what exactly did we do this guy you know rejected Saudi Arabia from Invasion from Saddam Hussein that's his homeland and he hated us and when we left we never occupied Saudi Arabia we left when they asked us to leave after we defended them and prevent is another an invasion from Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait what is it we did to make this guy so mad in the answer is we didn't do anything objectively speaking he hates us because of our Western ideology he hates us because he hates us and antennas hard for us to understand cuz it's not logical the truth and it's it's 11 it's a prime example of why we eat with this this this is a long-term fight and it says that it's not likely to go away anytime soon and I'll be the last thing I was the world is a very small place we can we pretend that we to ignore things going on in the Middle East we can pretend that they won't come here but the reality is that's a 12-hour flight and in the in the in the speed of information travels even faster you know when we were seeing a lot of attacks in the US and in Europe Isis was at its peak as it's as it is if that's its peak strength that was because they were able to radicalize online noticed that they stopped having that power and it's because we actually took the fight to them there's certainly are some conflicts between their ideology and Western ideology but why on Western values but why is it that they're dedicating their entire life to try to take down America and it's that is exactly why right but I've been at its core we are infidels that at its core there is that there are taking extreme view of Islamic fundamentalism in believing that we are infidels that must be destroyed I mean that's at its core it's at the less political reasons in a little bit more emotional reasoning some part of it because of common with a common theme in politics these days where anything bad happening must be America's fault must be decisions we made it maybe but let's exactly make the case if that's if that's if that's true I think there's an automatic assumption and it's not self-evident to me where in what are we in a hundred and how many countries do we have bases in what's the number to know it's a lot of my bits it's definitely over a hundred if you were one of the people of those countries a deal with that and you saw like the Drone attacks in Yemen that have killed people in wedding parties and the kind of s*** that we hope never happens again but has happened in the past if you can kind of understand why there would be a hatred against the number one superpower in the world will opinions in these countries are not are not homogeneous or either they're vastly diverse there's a million people in Iraq but not all Iraqis right ones who understood right of it it just depends on who you talk to so everything is more complex than a simple and a simple black-and-white scenario where America's batter good it's just it's it's always more complex than that so you feel like if we did pull out of all these countries particularly pull out of Middle East Afghanistan and the basis that we have over there that it would be very similar to like what's going on in Iraq what happened in Libya is a power vacuum vacuum gets filled by bad guys it'll 100% happen that way you know when it says there's not a doubt in my mind is not down in any experts Minds who is looking at this but also have a base somewhere that is better that that is that is at the discretion of of that local government there's there's no case is here except in the case of Syria their local doesn't want us there that's the only case that I can think of that we don't have an agreement a status of forces agreement with the government there so it's quite right to painted as some kind of imperialistic occupation is Justin this is not how we how we do things and that have standing of foreign policy they look at our military bases overseas and they say hey let's bring those people back to attend these wars what stop spending this money but you're not the only one that have told me that's in particular not the only one that's told me that says has a military background saying it's virtually impossible to prevent any of this stuff without having bases over there that's hundred percent right yeah you need you need that relationship with the host nation of course that you want to partner with an externally what we do is special in Special Operations I'm wearing a hundred plus countries were there to partner with them right there doing our own thing where they're partnering and training and equipping and enhancing their capabilities so that that's part of what we're doing the in the other Party's Just knowledge we want to know what's happening we don't know what's happened what is why we have embassies everywhere part of that is just relationships and knowledge and understanding of what's going on because we can't look at it from afar and actually get it. It's just it doesn't work that way so it in and it got night and I think it is reactionary to just assume that we have bad intentions all the time and everything is America's fault here that constantly mostly coming from the left but but by the isolationist sentiment certainly comes from the right as well and and it's a reaction that the reaction to the Iraq War until the mistakes we made their the reaction to Vietnam it's never that's never left the American psyche in many ways but these matters are complex and they deserve Vietnam it's never that's never left the American psyche in many ways but these matters are complex and they deserve complex reasoning and Analysis and a little nuanced understanding and I just think that's how we should look at it when we don't say that we're always right that's that's not what I'm saying</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> competition doesn't mean being mean it doesn't mean people associating it and equating it with either violence or aggression or a toxic masculinity this all these words that kept throwing around for people feeling bad because they lost but that feeling of feeling bad because you lost something is extremely valuable in your life it and I don't want to say it hardens you because it doesn't hurt you emotionally you still are the same amount of emotional availability but you get you're accustomed to it I always tell people young men get involved in martial arts especially Jiu-Jitsu because you going to do it you're not going to get brain damage you could strangle the bunch you get your ass kicked all the time and it teaches you humiliating humility and then you learn after that that you can get better and then eventually you become the hammer instead of being the nail that's that's something you can actually apply to your real life you can understand that these lessons of failure and humility and humiliation and just getting like all that stuff pays off ultimately if you just keep showing up and that's analogous to life in life if you can just keep showing up and keep working hard you're going to have setbacks you have bet you don't let them to find you and you can move forward but if you don't if you just like the world's toxic we need to Nerf everything and you know everyone needs to save space while we're going to make a whole Island full of pussies and we're in danger of doing that what is an egg what you're saying is intuitively true that hardship creates a stronger mind this isn't this isn't this isn't science as well and in a lot of psychological research you know this is and we know it to be true but the reason I like I love the the subject of psychology because it kind of tells us things that we already into it to be true and and it just makes sense and I certainly one of those there's a lot of studies that show people who suffer trauma end up better for as long as they're telling themselves to write stories and so this ain't got going to the swap my book to you have to tell yourself the right story about that trauma you have to tell yourself that you are resilient and that you and that you are empowered to overcome it that's a very important narrative that you have to tell yourself if you tell yourself it just happened to you and it's not fair everybody got to get you I wouldn't wish that psychological State on my worst enemy you would never wish that upon somebody you like and that's and that's that's that's an important truth I think you have to tell yourself when you were in the military is this something that they taught you or is it something that you learned through example I think learn through experience so you know the reason bugs somebody as basic underwater demolition / SEAL training it is it is our 6-month trial by fire selection process that we go to become a seals the very first thing you do that's where you see all the infamous footage of g i Jane and hell week and all that stuff that's all it's all firstbasin Buds and so yeah about but is dehydrated not a realistic movie for the least realistic movies in every single aspect about the SEAL Teams but is it the point is is is that there is a there's much at the hardening of the mind that occurs from hell week it's like a it's a it's a it's a increase in confidence in a pretty excessive weight like if I can push my limits this farm and what else I can do and and then you and you continue to push those limits I mean just even after hell week you do it what we what I would describe as controlled drowning and in second phase where we where we learn to be super cam underwater under the worst conditions meaning you can't breathe and you're about to pass out and you're still going to go through procedures in a very specific way you have to learn that that that calming and then eat any push another lemon and you push another limit to bet that by the time we do get the combat we've already suffered so badly and training that the combat doesn't feel all that bad and we're ready to get your iPhone out of your head like I did you're ready for that to you understand it and it's it's not surprising you don't react as an emotional way when it does happen because you've allowed yourself to be harder than you plug yourself the right story about that what is a traumatic experience the first time through again so why we're running with the boats are at so we run with you two or three Northbound boats in our heads are basically kind of boat to use and river rafting and bullion everywhere with them some estimates maybe at the 200 miles and just how weak alone so it's it's one of the reasons older older guys and 25 and older have a lot of heart a hard time getting his friends your bone structure can still handle that they just didn't meant amount of punishment that it's taken and you know except for mine we call that we know when we make fun of each other and say all next week jeans you have their why you broke your leg broke and how much time do you need before you went back to do it again 6 months so I was all three classes with bone elect tibia back in there 6 months later a lot of times I know a guy broke his leg and he was use f***** up for a good solid couple years and it was a risk because we weren't sure frankly the command was getting impatient they're like we're not going to let you heal anymore 6 months is that so go for it and you know but sing because I knew it broke right I haven't I felt that I rounded a corner in my journal and kind of took me to the rest of that run then we sit down for lunch and I couldn't get back up from from that seat like it was it was the journalist worn off there was something bad bad Leroy long there and there's always this question that the instructors last are you hurt or are you injured what is the difference then you're just quitting a person that's such an alien thought alien question are you hurt or are you in there there's a difference do they have any courses where they explain to you how your mind works and how to overcome questions and doubts that the creep in your head are they just they're teaching you through fire right and we wouldn't want those courses how to do is you got to face your fears and understand who you are and it's a it's going to be okay to drive you crazy crazy I don't mind that somebody's trying to do that I say that we wouldn't do it because the point is the point is that you're already that person you're a seal before you got there okay we're just we're just making you prove it are you already that guy okay because you never had a choice and another check my bank account no plan B through this with no plan B if you ever thought for a second that maybe I can make it through buds like maybe I'll make it through hell week I hope I do not going to make it. There's a choice there you're you're telling yourself that you actually have a choice anything after the primary on March 6th that it didn't now you could argue that that was probably not a great idea. That's some kind of implant what works but but but mentally was more of a mental state then it was like I don't have a backup plan on not saying don't have contingencies in your life I'm just saying it only you know when you've actually decided to quit right there cuz it's one thing to be like I have tried to be an artist for so long I'm just not good at it then you quit what is it really quitting or is it just facing reality that you was not good at being an artist you know that's so it's it's different to distinguish between those two things that you know you know if you quit because you actually Ali that you does not good at being an artist you know that's so it's it's difficult to distinguish between those two things but you know you know if you quit because you actually quite you gave up on yourself and that's and nobody nobody can really judge that for you and I just I think that's an important lesson and that's how you make it through but cuz you never had a choice</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you were growing up who what was the the fight of the influence you the most hands down Floyd Mayweather and Roy Jones jr. you know I used to love watching Roy Jones jr. I'm pretty sure everybody's everybody's was a fan of Roy but set aside Roy always watch the Floyd Mayweather and Pernell Whitaker I was too young for Sugar Ray Leonard and them so I'm old enough for that I was there for Sugar Ray Tommy Hearns that the other shut the Sugar Ray Duran like I was there for all that stuff but I watched everything when I was when I was young my coach meds minor he used to always take me to his house and watch box and tapes that was the keep me off off the streets and keep me out of trouble until I went to the gym is he still around spell tremendously yeah it's always in our culture has a special place for the highest level of boxers is like special place of admiration and I just feel like with guys like lomachenko with guys like you with Canelo and Triple G this is a great time for boxing's fun to watch matter so many Errol Spence Jr so many Elite boxers right now it's like a really exciting time for sure sure you recognize your place in history to recognize that like you're a special dude of course of course like I always tell people when they mention me and Errol Spence of course I want to fight. Tell everybody that I always say with or without him I'm going to the Hall of Fame when you look at all the things that out of accomplish in the sport of boxing people that's in the Hall of Fame didn't even accomplish that you know so I was I just tell people I don't need him you really need me what we need it box right don't you give me your boxing boxing needs that means it's one of the beautiful things about winning Canelo and Triple G do get together and you see these guys never respected way classes that are in their Prime it's fun and I don't like that's what everybody wants to see that's what I like what was the holdup you got to ask her we all say want to fight you know tomorrow you know if you wanted to so but we know it's the real issue you won't happen but would you think that he's waiting for the right time marketing wise or do you think he's ready for the right time where his skills he feels like or able to challenge you like what do you think is the actual hold up I think is has something to do with top-ranking PPC scramble I want to see Financial because the money will be there if the fight was ever made I just think it is you know Eagles but of course I think it happened I think you know me being with top-ranked and stand in the way of a lot of things happening it's interesting that promoters are boxing promoters work together well at all like you think about it like the UFC had to work with Bellator and put together some world champion fight every basically the so many times you get a champion versus Champion if two different promoters and have to decide to get together and make this happen most of the pot that's probably what it is or what network is going to be John and sold the kind of paper views that he's sold and then you know and achieved is sort of level of financial Fame as well as I people he's famous not just for being the best boxer but famous for being insanely rich like that's part of the fame to be promoted same as well as IP police famous not just for being the best boxer but famous for being insanely rich like that's part of the fam cuz they promote it probably try to do the same thing as well</div>

I wonder if he is going to it doesn't usually get to brutal I think you know you can't roll like one of the things about having a strong neck is when you get punched you can kind of control your head from moving around too much some guys can take it better but give head gear on is like extra weight and your brain sloshes around inside your head to protect you from Cuts more than anything is an argument that cuz it's not how much is better to have had your uncle is a little more cushioning but otherwise like it's being makes me way more dangerous and took it off because I was surprised you did that for your end watch your head you feel like such moving over your face so I tried to get them to take it off and they wouldn't and then my head you're broke like in the first minute of the fight and they're like I f****** take it off cuz it was like</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think that about football helmets to if they would actually be a safer game if they couldn't Clash heads with a helmet on that they wouldn't do it they wouldn't play like that that is just not true big it was don't give you didn't understand anything about the cultural significance football and they showed you all the brain damage and they showed you what it is you feel like going to make that illegal if anything should be illegal money and weigh the risks versus the reward that a bunch of middle schoolers are snapping necks and Mike it will never play football but it's so much less of a dangerous sport than football and every one of them every one of them has major major issues to get blindsided in football that you know you'll have your eye on someone and then you get head-to-head taken out from someone else that doesn't happen as much an MMA but I mean when people get like head kick knocked unconscious that's not good for your brain I put you back in at least the way they used to like when I was a kid but it's still getting knocked out over and over again getting like a Conor McGregor one punch knockout or fighting Nick Diaz and just getting like but a little bit at 5 round probably you probably better off getting one punch knockout I'm get up and go right at your we can customize right keep on fighting where's an antenatal stop it if you cannot defend yourself so probably definitely better the other thing about a counting 10 counselor punched out cold cuz he was flat in MMA that would be the end of the fight and we are lucky it wasn't cuz he got up like a f****** superhero and even one the rest of the round the outbox and for the rest around survive the initial barrage and instead of catching him as he was coming in as Deonte was being Reckless he caught him one time like stung him now that he's winning the rest of the round after getting almost obliterated CTE right perspective about boxing to me is that your people will get hit and then they get hit and grab someone cuz that's just everyone's Instinct and they grabbed them and then you travel little replicas no no no keep right now defend themselves it shouldn't be you can't defend yourself other than punching back that's kind of crazy like but I could grab them and just stopped his punches don't know against the rules and what kind of rules we have like you can only beat me up if they're going into a clinch probably going to end up on the ground at some point some late because of the rat has this break up a clenched over and over and over again to make boxing happen like even when even when you're a professional boxer and you don't know anything about wrestling or grappling you still end up grabbing the other guy cuz that's just like the only time that doesn't take places when one guy knows how to strike and the other guy doesn't and you see a lot of those video chat online where to do decide to get into some sort of a street altercation in one guy actually like a boxer call there's a bunch of the bad thing about the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is like you got to always be aware that people like that out there cuz there's always guys who can punch you in the face if they know how to wrestle to and then keep you away and just keep punching you in the face you better not to take him down a skill like definitely don't know it's like and we we bubbly I like both times I like just stand up only fights I like watching those and I like mixed martial arts fights what I think like Terence Crawford's coming on next and I think watching someone like him box like when you see the skill level to that guy has switching stances do not kind of befuddling people getting their range picking them and then just teen them up with perfect timing like that's almost only well that kind of artistry if there's no wrestling has no leg kicks it is only the boxing that's the only way see that like that. Kind of like beautiful, that cuz otherwise you would do other s*** to me all you would leg kick you will try to take him down and that so like the level of dominance that are real Floyd Mayweather little real world champion boxer has with their hand hard to really appreciate till you see it live and you know like what you're saying like if you're in the building with a guy like beating somebody up on their sparring like you you guys are playing two totally different games we have bought boxing it's like I literally like a boxing is like very much a sport and I think MMA is the closest thing that we have to competitive fighting hundred percent that's sort of like the difference until you know all things considered any but you used to be able to punch the Ball Z was a f****** great video of Keith Hackney fighting joe song else on got it I got him in a headlock and keeps acting as just hammering his dick I mean full-blown over and over again yeah dude that was f****** brutal brutal there's a lot of head-butting back in the days it was an effective weapon and it makes us that's awful but small finger locks and there are bones allowed to hit with these bones but you can't buy that and that way is a type of Muay Thai where they put ropes over their Knuckles that's the only thing they have and they're allowed to head-butt and it's a wild as s*** and they do headbutt combinations on the pad like the do tap tap fish use their head and train it left way but this is a brutal form of Muay Thai where you're allowed to head but then cuz they already elbow and I think that you know they're thinking both I can need pushes the dude had the way and then immediately comes in with a perfect head but boom just slam them in the face on purpose with the top of his head so he's trying to hit like his eyes and his nose and a soft tissue is trying to hit that with the hard part of his forehead this way the way he's doing it you taking a really hard part of your forehead and your smashing against a soft part of the eyes and the nose this party or forehead is hard at all most guys who break their hand in fights break their hands on top of the head</div>

He literally had no idea what happened Ben askren was saying he has no memory of like anything in the arena after that last long because he's going in for the takedown and he's got a strong take that right so he's going in with everything he has face-first and and Monday can do it running at him oh my God it's done the biggest impact I found Sports ever seen as we're talking about football players crashing each other that's the moment of impact the dangerous thing that two football players crashing their bodies into each other exactly that yeah and they super athletes cream at momentum I mean it's not see how crazy is it to be undefeated never to lose to anybody and then that's your one of your one blemish is like the biggest meltdown when you talk s*** like that and I can lose he's got to eat at those words amazingly that's part of the marketing himself as like he has his own down home version talkingshit boom roasted thing like you can tell it's like he's almost kind of playing a doofus character why the f*** are you but when you Flatline him like that after annoy him annoying the f*** out of you do you know what that word schadenfreude hasn't worked was that word yeah it's almost like in a weird way that's what he was trying to get Mouse ball to do like go crazy so take that under there but if it doesn't work out it goes very bad at all just took that chance of that flying knee injury any practice is over and over and over again and he kind of knew with the way circled C the way Circle to Circle off to the side and then came out in that way we'll see we knew we would go Adam with right said he was like I was I was real confident he took me down I was going to get back up and that does kind of demonstrate that like if you're real concerned about the takedown you're probably not going to open with strengthening into a flying knee who is known for being Miami backyard fighting videos 80 lb and he cannot adjust boxes dude up and it was so bad and all the kids were found with chickens run around a backyard it was so hard to an end up being as soon as I think Strikeforce fusiliers my son and MMA and he's had a pretty crazy trajectory to be where he's at right now he's right on the cusp of being one of the biggest stars in the sport he's got some of the best hands in the division.

Does. The best fighters have an understanding even if they have ego problems they still have a pretty good understanding of who they are and that's that can benefit you if you use it I'm sure he probably went through therapy and didn't necessarily he could probably have figured it out on its own wake me up in a horrible horrible what where the first lovey had was an old boxing training to turn them into a murderer that was the first love that guy experience his life was horrible man and from him being adopted by custamado when he was a little kid and having extreme physical gifts as well as his perfect storm they said when he was 13 and they put it in with a sixteen-year-old want to believe that a thirteen-year-old can be jacked like that is all the way to 20 extra fees or can you or can you get a release for the mall because when he came on was it The Hangover movie the company that did where the tattoo artist that did is Too Faced tattoo sued for like I think one for like millions of dollars</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the other thing is really cool to say because she's there on his own. Shadowbanned on Instagram tell me what you think is going on because I text him when that happened cuz I looked it up yes and his name is at the top of my list do you like to take it like a case-by-case scenario was the person that first and Tim are they already following him do they search his name a lot that they block anything is ever done people told him he meant having a hard time finding your Instagram page and so he asked me about it and I said what do you mean and I see you right now you are my feet if you go to search me so I'll get on the search you swallow a search Andrew Schulz nothing mean a bunch of other people but not him and he's got a lot of followers let's do it right now screen real time I follow him so if you're not already found a space space space now hit search why don't you see Andrew Schulz fans I know it's not him I'm just trying to figure out what it is so just in that search it's not showing up and it wouldn't show up for me on my phone either not doesn't make any sense cuz what is you have a half million followers how many followers you have ulz but it's not showing up it's not showing up on my knee and now we might be being paranoid here and it might be just something in the search algorithm that for whatever reason his things and showing up and husted say Andrew has a Schultz I don't know why has he was at the end of it. Okay and maybe he thought that has he was f****** him up he took hezi out of his name in the Rampage so just as Andrew Schulz now but even though still you can't find it you have to type in Andrew scholz all together with no space and then you'll find them it that's what it just did people both ways so I go up if that's what you're saying then I'll go out on a limb and so to say this year sure what is manipulating that search result because you can manipulate search people on certain social media platforms is has been revealed through hidden camera conversations with people who wear whatever moderators are Engineers are people that work behind the scenes on Twitter or Facebook and state they do manipulate algorithm manipulate searches and Shadow ban people and there's a lot of people particularly conservative people she's not conservative but what he is is you know he's a raunchy comedian and he might have done something that someone felt was not woke or what have you and they want to slow down the broadcasting of a signal that's entirely possible I don't know if it's true though I would love to have a logical explanation that so why he's not showing up he's you know he's complaining about it but it's a shadowban anyway go follow Andrew Andrew Schultz s s h u l z s h u l z u forget that you have a lot of power a year everything you're the product in the old model you just kind of waited to be anointed well he's got millions and millions of views on his special on YouTube and if you stop and think about if that was on Comedy Central which, Central didn't want to give him special he probably would get like maybe a million people would watch it when it came out and I'll be the end of it I have a special enough tickets are watching it just YouTube is accessible you can be in comedy jail I came out and I'll be the end of it I have a special enough thank you for watching it just YouTube's accessible you can be in comedy jail you could do a crate special and no one can find it on YouTube and look he went straight from not selling out clubs to selling out theaters like that no cell.

		<div class="paragraph"> and for people who don't know your career was taken from you in a way that you feel like didn't medically make sense they stay told you to stop fighting because they'll explain the whole heart condition thing what it was it was in the build of the month heart beat so it's another bunch of cells in the hall to produce an electrical current and it can confuse the heart cause cardiac arrest it can cause an electrical issues with the heart I never had any problems never any symptoms and side effects or anything like that so basically what they told me is that if I wanted to continue fight tonight it's having ablation so they have to go into my heart and that's a burn that the the cells that were produced in the second electrical Cara I push myself to whatever limits I think I've gotten I'm hoping to find some more but I push myself I know what my heart capable of and I just never down to that I've never felt before guns that consider that the Carotid artery in the femoral artery and they go into the heart but Lorenzo sent me out to California I'm not having any sentence I went back to you can then I was busy for a few years during the country but I did go and see a specialist cardiac specialist for athletes and you put me through the same test the points that what they'd seen and he said that it could have been accentuated because I was in the middle of weight cut and I was in training Campos tired you said there's nothing in these records that show that you can fight and you not save to fight will have the paperwork now so for months and you saw the testing pulling I just got options I would like one more cuz I never felt like I showed while I'm fully capable of I love my body just to kind of figure out where it wants to be naturally 182-184 is perfect for me so my plan is just to kind of get to about 85% condition and just sit there and then like me this weekend is a great example it's like in a Paso Diaz fell out and there's no one else around that's the kind of place I'll just throw my name in the Hat and just to be available and one of those fights would be perfect for me just one of the veterans of the game someone that's not too concerned with the rankins or anything like that dropping Grapevine and then step back out again until you know how you'd like to approach it you want to immediately jump back in five someone with a big name of the show I wouldn't I want cuz I might be one more fight I want someone one more that's it I want someone that everyone knows that though I don't know I would love it but I feel very sad Nelson got knocked out in it in Glasgow I see the reactions of that family I know what I put my family through and because I'm at time to kind of step back and allow them some time to you know that the souls on is calcified to it so the idea of me fighting anymore what's legal what's illegal that wasn't really about about why I was doing it was about I was basically being an ambassador for the sport while I was in training camp so now it would it would be far more of a journey I'll be able to really Embrace a lot more in focus on myself you know and now my camera guys I'd like to document the process I'd like to be able to speak quite candidly to the camera I'm just Bank a load of stuff so after the fight of the oldest oldest footage that I can put into send to kind of give some insight into the that the mentality of the fighter and the ups and downs of training camp to Media day to the press conference and you like you know you confident and stage and you should talk in your opponent and you smiling and stuff like you might get back to the dressing room and you might be exhausted you might feel like s*** you might you might have been playing the game for a particular reason and then there's a good reason you're playing that game and I think that a lot of those mattresses going toward because the sport move so quickly can I stay inside until I so if we are going to expect this how much time do you think you need to fully prepare where are you at right now I always welcome percentages I would say physically and can I would say I'm about I don't know about 50% condition 58 this again the one thing I've noticed is and I smoked most days like my conditioning like always is good but I can just get out and run 10 miles and feel comfortable with it and that's never changed so all I want I need to do is just kind of just kind of tests that the toughness in that condition now and push it you know it says it's to the point where I feel uncomfortable 37 ibuprofen since 2009 you know I just died.

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah that was a that was a rough one man but it's it's interesting how about Francis is bounce back in francis's nuking everybody now it's just not Mental Health there's no real learning process that because of not found anyone to challenge them so then they get into the UFC and then we get to see them go through that process in the UFC and I think that's what we've seen with ngannou you know they took him get into a well title for someone's already show him something in these games made him feel vulnerable to that process is really annoying because I appreciate understand where he was at you got to give Steve paid credit for taking f****** bombs and then fight me and he took bomb that fight especially in that first round like Francis is always in it when he's standing in front of you when you stand in front of you he's always in it and they managed to just slide away from most of them the ones you got hit with you went with them rolled with them the ones you got hit clean with you just absorbed and kept going and growl so here's a question for you then do you think you take punches better if you expect the person to punch hard probably because I would say that you took bigger punches from and gone win that fight in the in the punch from DC and I would say probably more vulnerable to the punch from DC because he probably wasn't expecting DC to knock him out could be wouldn't expect to get caught like that in a clenched either that was really perfect utilization of the clinch work combined with that crazy big overhand right I mean he really perfectly for that and it was something that obviously was a part of his repertoire I was not something that was just always just happen to be there for the moment he set them up for that and that that was just a perfect right hand and he caught him when he was looking I mean he just didn't didn't know that punch was comment clip them dropped them put them away the real question is what's it going to be like now that you know zaddy seek and knock him out and me is he going to fight from the outside trying to land big shots is going to avoid the clinch at any cost now and I got a big height and reach advantage you keep DC off of them and then also when a fighter is had a lot of Wars like him would you need us on toes the first fight was a war right I mean he's had some Wars in career stringify dhingana fights true fight was Awards to get stopped in that fire you know how many the mark hunt fight right who's chaos until he wound up stopping them how many of those can a fighter have how many those can a fighter have before we see them start to fade in front of our eyes and I'm not suggesting that we saw that with him because he was able to withstand the scariest f****** heavyweight striker in the sport and I think the DC punch was just a punch he didn't see and it was perfect and it just put them away happens again so surprised if it happens again because I think is going to be far more respectful to fight the DC's got power now for sure 100% UFC debut and like he did fight long is a real good long job in a low kick and like recently he's kind of crowd these work a lot of steps in very close with that right handed which often offered to clinch the DC and so many people that I think I'm just going to get in there and just bombs away with these people who makes it exciting it's I think he is the least appreciated successful heavyweight champion ever and I don't understand it I don't understand that he's got everything he's you know he's firefighter and active-duty firefighter he's a knockout fighter you mean he knocked out for do moving backwards with a perfectly placed right hand he's a f****** animal when he fights super exciting he's been smashing everybody he's stopped he won more heavyweight title fights than anyone he defended the title for f****** times no one's been able to do that that's how crazy that division is and still does not get the respect he deserves and he seems pissed off this week as well good that can send me cuz then the idea of of what happened in his head might be very different to actually happened well you really think they would let him know Michael not being Gino just one of those punches that he got caught with you might not let me know give DC the credit for you know opening that vulnerability up all the different people discuss tactics though it doesn't make any sense to me that insulates himself that well and for sure is coach is over at strongstyle they've Definitely Maybe go in there and fight if you trying to get it back the question is is he going to be able to use that Long Reach in that height and that power on the outside and keep DC the f*** away from him cuz he's got a considerable height and reach Advantage can you stop those takedowns can he keep DC from getting on top of them can you know if he can do all those things you can get very interesting and you know I mean I think that's really where he shines you look what he did to Josh bar f****** throws into the air like a rag doll when he was in the Strikeforce Grand Prix with a monster at heavyweight you know in the wrestling is unparalleled so do we get Jones at heavyweight then I hope so I do I really do I think he wants to do it at light-heavyweight though I think he wants to prove a point what DC want you out of that that's what I'd heard and I think I might have heard it from him and he but I wouldn't if I was in his Camp. So f*** all this dieting bro what could you do you know when you have a belly you f*** people up you know he doesn't worry about food doesn't worry about cutting weight he and he's fast for heavyweight must like Andy Ruiz you know I think there's a benefit in that there's obviously people there's people that knew the Andy Ruiz was a really talented boxer coming in but there's other people that looked his body missed him but when you see the efficiency of those punches like and the fact that he's able to uncork so many punches in close and where is Anthony Joshua's giant arms is long length gets a little bit smothered by that closer distance closer distance in a fluid quite possibly say something to be said for that physique as well there's an addition to that comes with that you know like you look Anthony Joshua and yammy looks like a physical specimen but the drawbacks would be obvious over around 2 or is that an Andy Ruiz DC they can just they just keep flowing the momentum talked openly about being far stronger in training as a heavyweight when he was alive headways felt better I really do you know he beat the greatest of all-time I mean the greatest on paper of all time at least at least on paper I feel like performance-wise there was moments where Cain Velasquez was in his prime why I said like that's the motherfuker. To me I mean I know it doesn't play on paper because he was injured x a gang surgeries but when he was in his prime and he was terrifying he does didn't stop he didn't stay at welterweight Colby Covington style endurance as a f****** heavyweight yet he didn't make any sense and smooth and just Relentless Relentless no one more Relentless in Cain Velasquez in his prime for him it was almost like his body couldn't handle the strength of his brain like his mental toughness was so incredible but he just couldn't keep up with it I just incredible but he just couldn't keep up with it I just started his mind just press forward togogo you know his in his cardio is just Preposterous didn't make sense DC looks in good shape</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> replace 10-15 times in different angles and all of a sudden now see something like a lightbulb moment I love those moments but yeah Anderson had many of those moments in his career where you recognize that he had seen a pattern and then he just struck on that pattern and hit paydirt me like Jesus Christ yeah success is Lebanese outputs love but then Aziz success rate increases so does his output ridiculous like I don't know any of the fighter that does that know he's brilliant in his output is preposterous as output is so outrageous but not as outrageous as Colby Covington Colby Covington might have the most outrageous output in the sport who's the better wrestler who has more power and who can keep that up for the longest does Kobe can keep that s*** up for 5 rounds he's done an amazing job of getting people to dismiss him because they think he's a piece of s*** with his Maga hat and all the chatter it's f****** brilliant man because what he's done is just insult everybody and anybody get a lot of people talking about him and then f***** people up so it's like what does a crazy combination because Fox with their head they don't want to lose to this guy they don't want to hear him talk s*** after he beat your ass is going to still talk s*** f*** there's a slight I don't know depending upon the person but it is at least light burden and experiencing that from a person might be a big burden maybe you're one of those people that has a hard time getting f***** with and you can't it keeps you up at night and then second maybe. Diminishes your performance 20% maybe 30% it's terrifying Robbie Lawler just kept bobbing and weaving and hoping for these openings that were never there or did you call me just on you he was punching some ridiculous amount like one every 2.4 seconds or some crazy s*** to be broke the work-rate right yeah yeah something like that but then I just I just think that the intensity of of Kobe's burn them out faster than expected when you're an explosive guy like Robbie is where he fires f****** hurricane speed bombs at you just and when he does that he's going to 100% 100% Kobe never goes on a percent if you watch him he's punching like 70% 60% 70% 60% and just stays on you stays on you very Nick Diaz like India's his early days Edwin Diaz fought Frank Shamrock perfect example examples that pesan you keep talking s*** and put that pace on you and he's hitting you a lot so you're always tight throat is tightening up tightening up and it's just draining your battery and you don't want to lose this guy cuz he's talked so much yet and you like while you talk so much when I get ahold of them and guess what when you get ahold of him he's great. The problem the problem is all those things the fuk with you plus he's a great fighter so the meanness the s*** talkin all the the Maga stop the strippers that the cringe you like oh my God right and then on top of it the f****** output inside the Octagon you like s*** he's doing all that and he's f****** me up he might have f****** I'll be even if you didn't do all that but it does all that I don't want to lose to him and he's f****** me up God damn mama before Marcus Davis where I thought to myself if I lose hair I'm going to like it already f****** stupid I think that Kobe is doing a brilliant job of playing a bad guy like pro wrestling style and I think he didn't used to do that early in his career he was a hard-working guy who just went out there and fought his ass off but people didn't give a s*** and they weren't giving them the credit he deserves and so he turned heel and from that he's become the interim Welterweight Champion is one of the most talked-about guys in the sport he took on a character that's what I think and I think that character is super successful with f****** with people you don't mean and he can f****** fight magic you can't underestimate that that kind of cardio the cardio's crazy do you do that for five rounds that's bananas that that Paces insane strong as well open the gym I would imagine Rubber Soul is the kind of guy that still trains like he's in his twenties like he's like on it everyday well maybe or maybe they train together and when they train together Kobe was getting the best of it I mean I think they did train together American top team you know I may be Colby new to get out wrestling manuvie just stayed on him he would break him and out wrestling I mean when someone has a wrestling Advantage it goes back to this one more time is a big deal this guy is better technique than you and he's not as tired as you are cuz he's fighting more efficiently and then he gets hold of you and then block them on my back and then you like God damn it and then you try to get back up but you can in the bells over to get back up here I got to keep this guy from taking me down and Pumbaa takes you down to dance again he keeps punching you undefeated keeps hitting you and making you move backwards and you was looking to land this big bomb but is never an opening for it you think it's going to slow down but he never does so Kobe against khabib throughout Paces the other one dude that they can get Ted Nugent to sing the national anthem I think that's an amazing fight if the khabib ever did want to fight at 170 I think him vs Usman will also be an amazing fighting I want to see Colby new smart and that's the fight right I mean and I also think if you're going to have an interim Champion you should treat that fighter like it's a champion just take their fight you can't take their belt away if they don't want to fight right now because they're injured or because they need surgery or he twice and we have to respect the championship title otherwise people are going to look at interim championships like it doesn't mean anything it should mean as much as a championship like we're saying you have to fight for the title next so to say that they don't have to fight for the title nice and we're just going to take that thing away from you just take it away like but you still fight the person still fight it so they're still didn't lose you just take it away because what is there a mandatory Contender that the WBA WBC ibf know it's just UFC UFC decides like who fights and fights when I'm happy that they have interest in the room championships cuz I think there's times and places for that but you got to treat it like it's a championship and call me never lost the championship UFC decides like who fights and fights when I'm happy that they have interest in the room championships cuz I think there's times and places for that but you got to treat it like it's a championship and call me never lost the championship performance</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> are the results real excited about you being today is because this weekend it's a great fight card like the Steep a dc-dc rematch is an amazing car amazing fight for that card I love the card in general but the Paulo Costa yoel Romero fight that's the one that perplexes me like how does that go down what happens when these tool f****** Brahma Bulls smash heads in the middle of the Octagon first of all it's all time best body fight ever right how do you bypass luggages without Rocky statue of God's oath of them options for bodies if you could choose like it's flip a coin these guys getting robbed either way might have an advantage cuz he he's so freakish he's so freakishly built that in me you can't imagine someone having a better body you just have a different bodies just the two of them there AOL in right there when he's posing it doesn't even look real Christ he's such a test the think the difference in the in the in the spot between the two is that I think will win American five of five rounds and he would take his time early but cost a comes out throwing gun stray away very very very dangerous and he's fast is fast and Powerful the thing is though is he as fast and Powerful as you're well he's beating really good guys like Uriah Hall but this is the cream of the crop mean I mean he's in there against the motherfuker of all motherfukers at 185 he talked about a dude who just can explode on you and send you flying through the air he ragdolls people he does Peep the s*** to people when he's a wrestling them you just do what the f*** he jumps at them was shot when he knocked out Luke rockhold with that left hand like what the fuc get the f*** out of your medicine is David Goggins stole Souls is a ridiculous time maybe gas think he's a different guy now I really do I mean I think I think Paula Costa is at the top of the Heap for a real reason now on a lot of it is dedication what lead is smile I love that guy training he's awesome Paulo Costa it's working with them and I've talked to me about him and you know how crazy Willie this is like food just like 100% eyes on the prize he goes that's all he does his train he was just got us some party does a f*** around he's just concentrating on measuring his food and training so what about the money that Ramirez coming to recently tell if it's real you got eyes to do die so I guess he saved a couple of shows in Europe that could have gone by. On South story for you from the come out and we have a flight on the card we have published by two against Anthony Hamilton and the voice confirm my are saying that that fight wasn't going to walk in so just to drop it off to schedule strange and I'm not sure whether I would say you know some areas of Poland is a racial undertone I wasn't sure whether it's because Anthony Hamilton was going to get some he if he walked out on stage the next thing I've got quite a unique perspective cuz I can see down the two tunnels where the fountains walk-in to the floor and I saw this whole bunch of likes skin ATS with black bomber jackets and Boots just come marching in and they filled the floor space and then they went over and sat down and one of the blocks and just sat there waiting for it and it was because he was from arrival for both of them yeah I heard about that that's right I heard about that and that's why they cancel the fight yeah they moved over to Australia I feel like Romero in coste plays out if you had a bank on it so I gave you a hundred bucks or what do you say Isis playoff I think caused the Stars fast and I think he pushes Romero back up against the fence Romero defends it you know covers and covers throws a couple of shots to push across the back and a nothing in the second round comes and goes to come crashing forward and Romero catches him with something right hook over-the-top something like that the technique I'm watching out for that cost 2 which is going to be useful for amera he throws a great buddy kick the left hook and Ramirez got this bad habit you can see all the way through the Whitaker fight every time someone throws a Kik he does this overdramatized scoop with his arms tonight. Out of the way if he's partying out the out the way that body kick is any wide open for the left hook so that's something I'm watching out for with Custer I just feel like he's overconfident cease willingness to take risks and the fight that Romero's patient can take his time is never in a rush to get The Knockout because he knows he can get it at any point in the fight like his patients might playoff and customize my walk onto something imagine if he chaos Kosta and we play this over that you look like a goddamn hero. VyStar I was like holy s*** here we go by Francis encounters going to be gunning for the title again he's going to come out guns blazing Derrick Lewis goes to war every single goddamn time they're both enormous my f****** nothing nothing nothing with cruise on that night somebody else who you were working with and they said the word that you never Sager in the heavyweight fight as soon as it's about to start they go there's no way this is Going the Distance heavyweight fight as soon as it's about to stop because there's no way this is Going the Distance yeah that's a rough thing inside of his driveway and I remember this</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> having five kids but like I'll do like if I talked about having five kids in New York City in at a show in New York City people are like you're crazy and then if I talked about having five kids in Boston and I'm generalizing people in Boston might be like you're crazy I came from one of those families and if I do it in Utah who will be like yeah we are crazy for having five kids so it is the same joke and it's the same point of view tweaked a little bit and it's so fun kind of traveling around and learning that material and learning the impact and how it's digested will Comics have a unique perspective on America because of that because we don't just go to these different places but we also perform material and all these different places so I think like I've been talking a lot with Comics lately about like what was your reaction to Trump winning the election Comics saw it coming more than most people live in LA does most people live in LA very liberal left-wing convinced that you know this is even it didn't matter who you vote for Hillary was going to win California no matter what like we were this was a pro Democrat State and when Trump won I ran into people that were shell-shocked they couldn't f****** imagine I mean I wasn't surprised by the the logic behind some of the people that voted for Trump last time that are sheepish to admit it now I understood some of that logic but I thought it was fascinating cuz there was a time for me cuz I tore with Ted Alexandro a lot and he's like he's like he's like an Occupy Wall Street guy Progressive and we would tour and he would have during the election he would have some material on Hillary and some material on Trump and it worked ever worked in Texas worked at Tennessee which I think is the most conservative place outside of Nashville and and so it work everywhere and then the election happened and that same material and it wasn't just the context of the post-election it was I described it as people looking at the ceiling is that people didn't want to hear and I think some of it is people like we deal with this all day we need a break from it but it was both sides till like Trump voters were more emboldened kind of like that's right and then also the left people were like please can I I just want to hear Jim talk about horses for 10 minutes Jeremy and so there is something fascinating because Bush was when w was president during much more people coming up to me going how dare he is you know start the Iraq War and with with Trump feel like you probably didn't have anything to do with that yes I would say that my takeaway yeah it's people are definitely fatigued I think we have political you really stop and think about if you're alive for 75 85 years on this planet and most of your waking time interacting with people is discussing politics how much of it actually does affect your life other than those conversation those conversations it's a giant part of a lot of people's anxiety part of the arc but the real life like getting up in the morning fixing breakfast for kids Sunday commentary on how all conversations lead to Trump like it's just every conversation eventually gets to and then Trump did something like that but it is I was also thinking like cuz we we live in this very precarious time and you know a very divided country on a lot of different levels and there's so much drama and there's you know you know what environmental disaster impending and I and again to my point of like is we finally figured it out this is the most dramatic. Be compared to World War II and with my children and my children who went just want to play on iPad we're just mesmerized. Like what and in the takeaway was not over the Germans are bad and not these are bad the takeaway is a human's are crazy like it's just a matter of months that the same people that were your neighbors that you would go to their kids birthday parties you were waving goodbye to because you got their apartment and I'm like like it was terrifying like human beings it's very easy for us to go yeah it was the Germans it was the Germans did that you know is lithuanians but it wasn't it was human beings that were like manipulated like that yeah if we catch the wrong leader yeah right next to that's that is a World War II helmet that's a legitimate World War II helmet and a bayonet it's a good reminder filled with little holes and s*** there's apparently places in Europe where you can find thousands of those things to solicit headed out there areas in France that are impossible for people to go to because there's so many rounds that have been shot into the ground and so much toxic chemicals and stuff from World War that to this day they they don't want people traveling time it's an enormous size of the size of Paris it's in really yeah give me to find that the punishment like they would just be like this I also learn this in Greece they be like okay so as punishment we are going to murder an entire Village so we're in your lip what and by the way again we can characterize this because on the internet when like raping pill what's the go-to tactic is that I will conquer them will rape until you know there was some guy so you know what can I just pillage I Justina I got a girlfriend now and I don't really feel like raping but we were talking about that to this day 20% of all marriages beginning kidnapping yes 20% so one out of five marriages started with the groom kidnapping the bride like that's how they had to get me because he raped her so in order for her with Romaine or it's unbelievable it's f****** crazy it is the red zone in France is so dangerous that 100 years after World War II it's still a no-go area is all sorts of rounds and Munitions and and there's all sorts I mean there's so many Rockets were fired into this area that this s*** is still in in the soil and everyone why why do why is this surprise humans also have a really real short-term memory problem like we don't remember things like I don't think people really appreciate you know that World War II was like seven years ago we go to that bar it's just it's just terrifying it's it's hard to believe but if you're in the wrong place in history at the wrong time like right now if you were in Libya Libya right now or Syria is a failed State I mean you can watch slave auctions in real time right now terrifying terrifying place and it's because they killed Muammar Gaddafi and then the rebels took over and then it became of Felts field state is chaos and this is right now in 2019 if you were unfortunate enough to be born in Libya you are stuck there right now and you're living in hell you're not living in Manhattan in 2019 worth wonderful Jim Gaffigan environment we're barbarians are running the show this can happen this can happen and this is one of the reasons why our democracy is so important one of the reasons by compassionate so important kindness and talking to people it's also important to look at things objectively and labeled Things based on compassion and then looking at things it in in an intelligent non-biased way so we can really get a sense of what the landscape really is if you are everybody's a f****** Nazi and everybody's terrible and white it's my privilege that everyone's a criminal everyone's bad there's real crime in the world is real terror real awful things we have more Unity we have more in common than then we promote you know what I think is a reflection of the success of comedians podcast is that what people don't realize is that comedians really appreciate a different point of view we actually is like your friends that like weed agree with in fact we almost find it entertaining like let's talk to this friend because I know I disagree with him and we can have that banter and I think that the Piggly in this cancel culture there is until like you get these comedians like you hosting these podcast having these discussions and and comedians have kind of like the boldness to step in it and say hey I don't know about that where is Lake City from a societal basis there's a dumb question don't question why we're pursuing this because if you question it that means you're not a True Believer and we're looking for True Believers where is and by the way it's just interesting because I think you don't have a friend Tom shillue who I loved who's who has a show on on Fox Nation and it weird cuz like 6 years ago and I did this interview and I talked about it and and I could see the interviewer go you're friends with someone that works at Fox and I'm like yeah you know it's like it's okay it's okay he's not a Monster yeah he's not killing you know he's not putting children in cages I'm good friends with Steve Hilton he has a show on Fox you interviewed Trump by my family and his family go on vacation together it's like why it's it's it's this strange thing where I'm like I can understand how important these beliefs are and I can understand how threatening democracy is and I can understand how we have to face our history and and all these things but it's like the discourse has to remain doesn't it yes we have to be able to talk to each other and I think that's one of the kind of died with the Trump election people were like you're with us or against us you were the for him or you or your fear for the future and compassion and caring about everyone or you're a monster and there's no there's no discussion about finances or the best way to run the economy International Trade the same thing that they criticized about W saying you're either with us or against which by the way being a father of daughters you know is also a line from Beauty and the Beast felixstowe I'm sometimes and sometimes not get messages on social media and maybe like you know that some of the people that like your comedy are Trump supporters and I'm like I hope so my I hope that I appeal to a lot of different people you know I it's a very strange like I remember the success I had and I'm so grateful for the success that I've had Beyond The Pale I remember it like I came back to New York after I done this to him you don't know what stand up you don't know how long it's going to last you don't know what's going on and I came back and I remember someone reading an article movie was in timeout New York and they're like he's very mainstream mainstream and and there was recently A New York Times article he is very conventional and I'm like what is that do you mean like conventional in that people want to go and see me perform like a lot of people like that you like that's a crow I'm like that's he's you know you know it's like it's so we live in this age like there used to be two medians and I think it's inhibited some people success we're like if it's like Bill Burr one of the best comedians today and I think people are sometimes people in the media are like you know the wrong people might like his material I get that from this podcast it's it's a very strange it's it's it's almost kind of ate you know that and I don't know if I've talked about this but like you know like there's this cultural revolution that is occurring that is its well-intended but it's almost it's almost puritanical and it and by the way I'm not somebody I'm against any form of censorship but I'm also somebody that believes that if we can articulate transgender terms that make people that are transgender feel comfortable there's nothing wrong with that we can adjust our language we do it all the time but I do think that there is kind of this almost puritanical thing that's ironically happening on the left that is what we do as comedians we used to make fun of the right for does that make sense panicle thing that's ironically happening on the left that is what we do as comedians we used to make fun of the right for does that make sense yes very strange kind of like what you guys are doing what you doing forever and if you're right then it doesn't matter</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> if you want to know about a person you know saved politician or would you know an actor, cuz you're writing about the idea that you're going to figure them out with just a few hours of Google searching it's kind of crazy the rushes to Define someone in either very flattering or very unflattering ways that's really where most of the energy goes most of the stories are either hit pieces or their fluff pieces that seem to be propped up by a publicist yeah. I feel it's so like I did this movie that came out it was just a small Indie comedy where I was a guy who had to separate families and they didn't know about each other so it's like he's a good guy now but he had two families and it's a comedy it's set in the 90s and the reviews that didn't like the movie that didn't surprise me you know or the criticism but like a lot of the reviews were kind of there was a tone of like how dare this white male have to look they couldn't get Beyond look it wasn't like they would insert like a social commentary onto a platform that way not for that Jeremy like it was if it was there was a portrayal of and they were great female actor actors that played my wife's and then there was some reviews there like they under serve them and it's like you know what the movie was really about my character and his son you know and but like people were frustrated about story but because of the day we live in it it had to be kind of deciphered through this kind of social critique that is just absurd and it wasn't here and there was a lot of reviews like that well they feel like there's an obligation to discuss that now too if they feel like there's some sort of an imbalance actually like good between genders on a television show or or intersectionality if it has something to do with race or gender or politics are they feel like that this is something that must be disgusting one of the things that I hear from Friends there are very frustrated so when they pitched shows the only pic shows the network they have a story and I D like this is what we're trying to this is the thing they like okay where's the diversity questions about an Irish family that lives in the Bronx to tell you stories about diversity diversity to meet their criteria like you can't just have you can have a story as long as the person's it like you can have a story about a paycheck family and it just be all about the Haitian family we need to get some afterwards but when there is no longer viable storyline and it like no one gives a f*** if you're Chinese or Indian or from Pakistan different varieties of people and there's no judgement I can't wait for that time until then we just have to deal with these observed people that pedal in this is narrative that you have to have no x amount of what I was reading something or someone was saying that I should run for I should moderate the presidential debate not talking about the way here's the thing it's and I think you'd agree with me I'd I do think there's an imbalance and we do have to correct it yes and I do think that like you do and it's great that we have the knowledge and the Forsyth but humans were just clumsy clumsy you know with you when you know more complex than that medium we could have cared up here there's a new ones on every joke he does like people can sit there and be dismissive but like he's like you know what I can't do that joke before I do this joke where is people in their speech in there but I almost feel is like when green book one cuz I saw it after the fact I was like I'd like there's this this belief of all you know you if you play a disabled person you win and but it's much more of like that movie winning was like yeah you know it's it's you know the great crime of America and race so it it brings that up it also deals with you know homosexuality and like the struggle of that which is profound I can't even contemplate it but it's like that's why the movie one and it was also we love Italians America was Italian food Boston and you know that's you know that's there's certain things that America loves so I was like oh that's what it want I'm not saying it's a bad movie I wasn't great I'm just saying that's why I want and it's weird it is a little weird but it's one way to look at it is the darkness without light right there could be no there can be no real appreciation of true diversity without an understanding of racism like in it did to have it around and its ugliest form makes you appreciate the people that don't express that there are traces that are just even-keeled people that appreciate everybody will you know that there's also this too is that you know I'm I tend to lean left I'm pretty liberal socially and but any know when play selected and like there was the women's March and all this stuff there was this I had this thought process of like how do I how do I do no contact how can I contribute how can I help make this country better which it sounds grandiose which it is but the thing is is I really believe that it's like anything I think at my shows it's like people are kind of like break from it yes you're in like 8 we're all thinking about it all the time feel like all right there's a tariff a Chinese tariff what does that mean I don't know what that means is that American farmers destroyed what what's going on but like when they come to my show they don't want me to rehash it yes I think that's one of the keys to your success is that you provide a vacation fun silly well-thought-out immediately brilliant sort of vacation but also pointing out that humans are webcert where stupid of people makes me concerned stupid ass we are so stupid like we just think humans think we have it every generation we think we have it figured out that's the shortness of people makes me concerned it's working</div>

softly once in awhile you delete a picture you OCD butter in your toast now I don't I don't eat straight away to straight black coffee into the office have an office and I try and write I sit at the desk I called going into the shop and I sit there and I write and I make sure that there's no appointments until noon anything I'm going to do I don't do until noon except if I'm going to go for a run or workout I'll put in a couple hours and then I start to fade I'll go for a run and then come back and continue not sorry before the coffee if I'm up early enough and the house is in top I'll meditate first 20 minutes before you can write before coffee before I write yeah wake up water in the face Maybe brush teeth up into the office and then take 20 right away because it's more restful than sleep so even if you had like a bad night's leave your tossing or whatever was going on your now ready to to go through the day what kind of meditation you doing TM meditation weird thing about that right some people think it's going to call T it's not right but it wasn't there a while back and think so no my misconstruing it was something else I'm very into it doing it for a long time it's great but I don't like yoga and like all that kind of stuff unless you can hit a little hippie dippy with it and a little too preachy and then I'm out me too and this is totally basic simple when I was taught that there was nothing you know hippy-dippy flaky about it really living that life and you can kind of feel it not bullshiting us to take classes from South Africa but he was like one of those genuinely spiritual people would say these things and you could tell it wasn't trying to manipulate you or Namaste you or socks or he wasn't trying to b******* you that's yeah and then there was another guy I saw the dude's wife and the court giant disaster acoustic guitar making eye contact with him what side of the organization organization been the subject of controversy label the cult by several parliamentary enquiries or anti called move into the world some also suggested TM its movement or nautical TM movement has been characterized in a variety of ways has been called a spiritual movement a new religious movement a millennial movement how a new book exposes the Dark Side of Transcendental Meditation have like where it would happen like there's no place to go honestly and ignorant of it so explain it to us yeah there's nothing it's very kind of made it very simple to make I've always had my head that maybe TM is different maybe maybe going and learning that would kind of dial it into a little bit losses on it so I took four classes you went and saw this guy hearing California and just go for an hour for 4 days in a row and he teaches you what to do it and the analogy is that there's this reality is just in this tumultuous ocean wavzwear on the top or on the surface that's where we live and this is just the way through Mantra to get you down below the waves to sit for 20 minutes and it's very freeing because there's no there's no controlling your mind there's no forcing it to come back and compresses no you're never you're not you're not thinking about what you have to do you just do the Mantra do the Monitor and then let it go and if your brain starts thinking about work at thinks about work of a star about your wife it's just let it be let it be let it be and 20 minutes you pop out of it and you feel not right away I don't feel changed immediately I'll feel you know I have an Apple Watch in my heart rate is low like it's 4250 all the time or when you do know when I'm doing that how much does it normally probably like 82 right now how long does it take to find out if it's going to take awhile or nervous system a respite that's pretty heavy it's pretty great what would you like me to do it yeah but I don't feel like right away but but like I will notice it hours later that I have more energy like I'm still going what is the process of how do you do it I just sit and what's the Mantra everyone has an individual mantra funny weird if you just kept saying Jerry Seinfeld I'm outside doing first thing in the morning 20 minutes and then sometime in the late afternoon all you do is you sit and you just chanting mantra I do my mind and you don't say it out loud as you're just repeating the Mantra in your mind you just try to stay on path of his keeping I just keep saying it and when I don't try and stay on the path I don't force anything I just keep saying it but if your brain belly BBQ in a living let go is that okay it down now I'm not that great of a comedian it adds another four hours to your day and it's really true when I when you called me today and last minute to come in I took 20 before I came cuz I was dragging I went for a run this morning I meditated this morning but then I went for a run I came back I was writing and you called and you're like can you come on over I was like yeah that's cool but let me drop for 15 minutes before I get in the car if I'm tired yet like it's towards the end of the day and I've got something you know at night that's a little later does it help you make decisions yes how did you still make the decision to do a radio show at 7 in the morning because I'm not afraid of it because I know that I can meditate and I'll have energy you don't have to worry about getting a good night's sleep ever know I can meditate and then I'll be okay for the show that's crazy I can't do that you should go you should go okay I'll hook you up with the guy just watching YouTube video is that good enough I've learned so much from YouTube. I'll have you know it's true why can't you learn it kind of dial once since I learned it initially just to kind of tune-up tune-up there's not that much but it's just you know they give you a little bit so you know it's like playing tennis or something I don't know just hold it like this I alright okay we're like in yoga me like you think you're doing this but your elbows are out and bring them in the instructor will give you one thing she'll say one thing about your with the way you're standing of the way you keep your weight and like so much harder I know what you never would have learned it home kind of a similar thing and it just an overtime so that's what it is on a daily basis but over time it's it makes you more chill things don't bother me the way they used to bother me just a the day aggravations work you slowly transform without realizing it do you know who Dan Harris is Sam Harris Dan Harris Dan Harris from know from what is the show Nightline is that weighs on anyway he's been on the project for a really nice guys got up and he's got an app called 10% happier and it's just a meditation app he wants people to know that it's been super beneficial to him anyway he been on the podcast for a really nice guys.

		<div class="paragraph"> no yeah the worst possible scenario like did you see once upon a time in Hollywood I did so those flower kids right through the murderous flower the man sometimes we think about people just on the Olympics cuz that's a possibility it's such a glaring one I get the disproportionate amount of energy and interest for the most part most people are super fine Beyond assholes ran exactly and even the Manson cuz there's probably a couple of them that were fun I bet there was the girl who took off the girl who was like a me right back oh yeah oh that's crazy yeah I thought you were going to say the actual Manson kid take off in real life Gene was always I've known cheating for years he's always super respectful about Bruce Lee but he's also he's okay let me put it this way if that actually did happen that way if Bruce Lee fought Gene the bell jingle bell would grab ahold of him in obliterate his brain on the concrete 100 out of 100 times in the movie where I felt like them I don't like you I don't think it was ever really like that important historical figure from martial arts and I get it's just a crazy Quentin Tarantino movie night at the end of the movie did not I mean unspoiled I don't want to say what happened but make takes Liberties for entertainment's sake with a lot of different things have some random dude that you know is a stuntman and Bruce Lee's a buffoon to him and he kicks his ass on the side but with that said Gene lebell Bruce Lee Jim about would crush him that would have been him in that scene would have been a different thing man he's a gorilla right I mean he's like a judo champion of neck cranks and Joint locks and he is strong like a f****** bear I mean dude in his prime he was a tank of a man really far bigger than he was a small guy but Bruce Lee was an innovator in martial arts and one of my personal hero early innovator because he was the first guy to think that you should combine the best elements all these different styles when I was coming up man I was doing Taekwondo and you were brainwashed to think that Taekwondo was the best martial art everything else was b******* and you didn't even practice it so if I was practicing other stuff like I get some Browns from some pizza if you were in some schools that were less open-minded than mine you know my school was a little more practical than some of them but he would say come through or death like all they wanted to do is grab ahold of you is going to pound you into a f****** tree and it's not a goddamn thing you can do about who was he was in a bunch of different movies as a stuntman The Green Hornet became friends so that they were very good friends and he had nothing but good things to say about Bruce Lee he said he taught Bruce Lee a lot like some of the movies that Bruce Lee Bruce Lee use an armbar early scenes in Game of Death that was from Jim about martial artist Bruce Lee was a thought I mean Bruce Lee was a fantastic martial artist and like I said one of the most Innovative guys ever we don't even realize how much his style had a gigantic effect on making Untold millions of people sign up for martial arts class including MIT right did try to combine them as unheard of it the timer done Exercise from a lot of these Kung Fu like circles where did he learn it from a bunch of different places mean he learned an AUX alerted in China he learn different things for different people I know did you worked a lot of different martial artist credentials gorilla well UFC changed all that s*** yeah yeah Dan what is his what is his competition accomplishments blue belt yellow belt he's but if that that makes sense that they can a base it on him cuz he really was legendary stop mad as well when that be cool though if if Tarantino have the inside scoop on that story maybe they were friends like that didn't go down like that big right fight right right right a fight Jesus Christ they have a different there their back or their course so goddamn strong a few Judo guys I've ever rolled with a lack of consequence of Karo parisyan was one of them I rode with him and he was like growing with a chimpanzee disheartening when you grapple with like a like a really good wrestler that are really good Judo person they just have this insane ability to manipulate body so it's crazy okay it says that he won the national heavyweight to do championship and the u.s. USA overall Judo championship title so he won the national heavyweight title and he went on to win both too heavy weight and overall champion in 1955 as well that's a big X you do title especially for back then in 1954 the probably wasn't that many Judo championships was probably fairly recent think we're Judo come from Japan Japan Japan Japan because count mayeda who was this traveling judomaster he taught people in Brazil taught the Gracie's so the Gracie family in Brazil. They took that Jiu-Jitsu and they were fine and they made it much more much more emphasis on submissions cuz of Carlos Gracie and Helio Gracie and Carlson Gracie and like the early Masters are really amazing amazing story of one really one family the kind of revolutionized the way people fight on the ground they just soft-focus that right I remember ESL about sidonie on the set, so they put me in a headlock or something so LaBelle went up and grab Lee he started making all those noises and they became famous for the Bell said but he didn't try to counter me so I think he was more surprised than anything else so you probably just grab them got a headlock and labelled lifted lie on his back was call the fireman's carry around around the set with him and put me down or I'll kill you least you down or you'll kill me LaBelle said holding lie there as long as he did before I'm down saying hey Bruce don't kill me just kidding champ back on his feet again lead it until the balance Dudley recognized his lack of grappling was deficiency in Jeet Kune Do style martial art to do is developing so it wasn't really a fight but this is what I'm telling you is so f****** powerful and such an amazing Judo got that if it was a fight it would have been right really quick right so if that's who he was supposed to be portraying in the middle of that showed that the Brad Pitt character was Judo Champion that became of martial arts later maybe this guy was like a roofer treated like the Jeffrey Epstein you're trying to keep my life it's those people I don't understand their thinking I don't either it was so good oh my God either it was so good oh my God are you not entertained like there's a lot of times and I movie I was like f***</div>

I'm not allowed to come and get me that's not true that's so not true but it's kind of a personal thing because it has no meaning if I say it then you're going to say something back now there's something attached to it that's why you don't say okay you know what I mean mental attachments to it a religion wasn't it a problem if you said God's name are they like certain sex of religion that don't think that you should say God's name whatever God's name is whatever it's Todd Yeshua or whatever it is whatever the name of God is well obviously well obviously obviously misinterpreted where people take the words and the things that he saying yeah willfully misconstrue them they they purposefully change what he saying to make it more offencive more unreasonable people are angry why well it's hard to say I think part of it has to do with the way he initially came onto the scene of because why transgender things yes was he was very concerned they were forcing people to use certain language bright new pronouns were saying like why do you have a problem with people's pronouns he saying that's not what I'm saying right the problem is not whether or not I would have a problem with someone pronouns of problems being legally compelled to use these new words of some of the inventing here I am not doing that right the government telling me how I want you to be compelled to say they're there their pronoun right it's a slippery slope of control more than it is a thing of culture or of morals or Compassion or from being Progressive he's not saying that he's saying it based on his very deep understanding of history and of some communist dictatorships that have gone horribly wrong Marxist philosophies that he's aware of that he thing right horribly dammit dammit dangerous is implemented on a large-scale I give you allow large groups of people to control language into to legally compel people to say these new words your inventing this is not good this is a bad path for human right it's bad. All these people who oppose what he was saying they were labeling him as transphobic they were labeling him is homophobic all these different things that are not true right then he gets connected to this Pepe the Frog thing right because he thinks it's kind of hilarious the internet is taken on Pepe the Frog as like this meme the feels good man frog I know that gets you know the whole thing there a certain group of people out there will decide Tom Popeye some sort of all white white nationalist white supremacist Nazi person a frog you know why some people have used that frog in a negative way some people most people use that Frog as a joke like rails badman the Frog alright people on internet forums would constantly and consistently use that Frog as a joke or humor and mocking and making fun of things and has a British would say taking the piss is taking the piss with a frog but you that would have the frog with like a swastika armband he had on shorts because they is there internet people see if you leave something on the Internet eventually a symbol of Nazis stop using the cartoon flash even Alex Jones had to pay out a lawsuit because Infowars used an image of that cartoon flag issue I'm pretty sure that's true but it was a nominal amount it was only like you lost in Corbett has like a very small $15,000 for a lot of money for $15,000 I'm sure that probably cost a shitload of money but the point is that this frog has like all these different meanings so as soon as it gets connected though to an awful thing yeah then immediately like you got to go out that we can never use that frog again now given what we know and here's where it gets really weird given what we know about the internet and that specifically foreign influence on memes sure like Russia there was factories that were making funny memes about Hillary Clinton funny memes about all kinds of things yeah and doing so in order to get people upset or laugh or to mock mock certain ideas and and push the narrative one way or another through humor they made some really funny when there's a woman named Renee diresta she came in a podcast explaining shift for a project she had to go through hundreds of thousands of these things are really funny do they know are made by Russians to try to get people upset about certain things she how many of those Pepe the Frog things came from a frog that was mocking everybody and the Frog like was a really good symbol to make someone think that you're a fool do you say something ridiculous and trying to push her something is in a meme with you what you're saying but he looks like an idiot and Granny frogs mocking you but you can't beat the Frog look up photo of Jordan Peterson with Pepe the Frog cuz he took a photo with these guys when they had like a frog flag and he thought it as what we're just saying that you guys are taking the piss of Flat Stanley guys are holding up this Pepe the Frog flag Riordan is laughing and smiling with them and one of them has a I think it's a make America great again hat on these kids aren't human trolls they're alive out there in public trolling with Pepe the Frog flag and a make America great again hat oh my God call Jerry wrapped Jordan understand this and talks about it and discuss is it in length and he makes it makes sense right so that's one of the reason why people are excited and very easy to label people in certain ways to die it's very easy to label someone as a misogynist right now I know but if you listen to the breadth of his work yeah this is not a bad person he's a very good person real practical ways to you know is he says clean up your room and live right personal friend of mine I like him very much how do you how do you say you think about these things that you're trying to 2 obviously clean up your damn room clean up your damn room but he's got a lot of great advice he's also a very very insightful person what about all of his on a bad guy at all people have this horrible thing they do today where and when they want to dismiss someone instead of instead of listening to them it's still listening to them and debating the points that they have or analyzing them in a jective kind everybody's attacking every Everything sucks everybody sucks everybody stupid everybody's racist everybody's dumb everybody's ridiculous everybody's a liar everybody everybody says you're not on my team here in someone else's team is just so much of that today there's so much I heard somebody connect are practical trying to find a way through the woods to those writings like you always just heard of it is growing up as a Catholic kid you just kind of heard them is like their stories and they're obviously you know they're metaphors and whatever but I never heard somebody really say no it's because it's how you treat your father and other way you're trying to figure out your way through life that's what these things mean it's a very fascinating listen yeah he's got a very unusual way of interpreting Biblical verses and stories from the Bible search for meaning and right you know exactly and how it's her two interfaces with man's search for meaning and right you know yeah exactly it's like like a practical way too kind of you know approach the world 2-2 in a time when we have nothing to hang onto it's kind of interesting stuff to think about</div>

how you view the world totally different perception of what life is worth and what life is like yeah and what kind of violence have to deal with on a daily rate gone I know there's a lot of very dark places so I don't like to travel you'd only traveled all I do like to travel but I don't I'm starting to cross off a bunch of places or places that don't have the same kind of my friend Justin Wren who runs fight for the Forgotten charity he was just wearing a shirt at the beach if he has a new intestinal parasite that's draining him he doesn't know what the what's going on and then no joke what happened in the Dominican Republic people died because they were drinking from the minibar to hear that story yes yes stuff in the minibar that wasn't actually alcohol yeah the store that I'd heard was that they would put cheap substitutes for one of the alcohol was supposed to be so the people would pay for it and then you know they would steal the actual liquor it was something else and then people drinking is like poison they're dying people really die out that's terrible I hope he's okay described it saying like the one thing is concentrate on statistics and I don't know if this is true we should find out but that if you concentrate on statistics and it seems like a lot of people died in the Dominican Republic when they're over there but the reality is that it's not the way we're looking at it because we've chosen to start focusing on people die over there but in fact it's like commensurate with people that died over here when they're on vacation right that is Wheatley it only a certain number go to that Resort you know any meaning here I think so massage places in Laguna Beach hookworms responsible responsible for the The Stereotype of the Southern dummy know what do you

stereotype came from wow how Wild f****** crazy that's insane you know how many people are getting right now getting Lyme disease and Lyme disease almost doesn't make you lazy it's Rex your health tick on a freaked-out should freak out for 24 hours yeah and you know but you also if you do get infected you have to get on antibiotics really quickly Superfast there's a woman who wrote a book about Lyme disease possibly being a military biological weapon that accidentally was released really yeah apparently this is a popular thought that there's something Lyme disease that Lyme disease doesn't necessarily make sense how quickly it came from this one area like this Lyme Connecticut area and how rapidly it spread and how devastating is impact was and there is apparently there is has been some research that's been done not some quite a bit of resources down on various biological weapons and various distribution methods and one of the thoughts of a lot of these distribution is infecting bugs affecting bugs with some designer disease and then infecting the population like if you release the bugs on this area that you wanted to attack like at a certain point in time and you infected Giants chunks of the population right then you would be able to go back there 10 years later and everybody be f***** wow this is something that biological diseases with Anthrax like terrifying but they've made those yeah forever you know they had that and people been aware that forever yeah but the idea of it being something that's in a bug and that can infect you use Louise that's terrifying are you trying to make yes well there's also never had these mosquitoes before there's a recent case of horrible disease breaking out in the east coast think somewhere in Massachusetts there is some horrible mosquito borne disease what is that what is that thing say about the text about Lyme disease what is the book called bitten circumstantial evidence linking outbreak of Lyme disease in the 1960s US military semi will say this b******* but our personnel and the community what does that when Smith announced is a man okay this is too much their says there's just too much evidence for a reasonable man or woman to just turn the page and say put on your tinfoil hat this is just a conspiracy theory Smith said and yet people with credentials will say that which begs the question why would they even say that Chris Newby wrote the book Benton said she discovered circumstantial evidence linking the outbreak of Lyme disease the 1960s that's what you said in the US military as proof do besides an interview that she had stop right there with Will burgdorfer American scientist who discovered what causes Lyme disease who told there shortly before his death that he had been instructed to keep his research and a possible cause for Lyme disease a secret my hypothesis was is that the biological weapon they were trying to cover up that my hypothesis is that was the biological weapon they were trying to cover up said new be a science writer at the Stanford School of Medicine in California I believe it seems like a lot of malarkey she said I can't connect the dots right now survive Lyme disease my theory is that it was a genetically engineered bacteria but as a journalist I can't prove that someone she saying then she's just pulling stuff out probably but I think that at your bread yeah that scares me more than anything of some sort I would feel like we should be keeping you some medicine in the house like medicine yeah plaquemines what the plague is really Vista flu there certain things you can take if it's knives crazy War bugs probably nothing but there's so many people in so gross and you can see how the people just coughing in the airports without covering their

		<div class="paragraph"> you know there's something weird about when you watch some p*** where they pretend to be school girls and you know I guess you can come inside so you know there's a lot of step sister stepmother p*** stepmother stepmother and stepsister dude with his stepmother now those are fun but it's very popular you know that's human sexuality you know everybody has something they're into so I guess they make a movie for all of it but also they're always looking for a new forbidden thing that's a thrill for a lot of people ride if you'll sexually suppress to only watch p*** like on my car to stepmom she going to do it so it's like I'm right so it's like forbidden yeah yeah yeah but you with the west-world thing when people get told what to do too much when they're young doesn't develop this desire to do forgetting things right right yeah yeah you get bored people if people like outrageous things and it does outrageous things are not outrageous enough anymore than they get more outrageous somehow or another ride it that's right that's why you shouldn't go down the path right you should start that's why you're healthier working out like crazy or being obsessed with cars or being obsessed with sports so I could you want to get more and more with it what you're dealing with tires and I doing with human beings that are being trafficked through Florida with the idea that they might have some Fame you know what I mean that's where it all happens right now it's pretty devastating very funny talented she was in parks and rec in the office and the office and she made a documentary on just like all these young girls that especially now with social media and wanting to be liked and wanting to leaving all these promises of Fame and that what you think is amateur p*** and is harmless there's really a very high percentage of these people are being exploited and very differently but is there any kind of acceptable p*** like what it was like 35 year old ladies that are just freaks or not real out of people watching them f*** turn on camera to the trouble you know I'm not that I don't think about them at all concerned about them so we're concerned about the women is that wait for it because we're sexist are we are we putting standards on the females that we don't put on the males because we don't think the women can handle it or that you don't we don't think they can make that choice we don't think that they should be allowed to make that choice or if they do make that choice we think there has to be something wrong with them and they need to be protected or is we don't have those feelings man I just know that so I think that's when you thinking about what leads you to that place there's a high probability that some man did something awful to that girl when she was young watch the pouring so is that something we inherently know and how do we know that yeah yeah because men are big and aggressive and can do no no no that's not what I'm saying when you see someone that's in p*** do we inherently know they've been molested do we just know or mean when you doubt it. But I think but have we investigated it like there is a high percentage of women that do p*** this is a fact that have been sexually molested what I'm saying is your distaste for it is it based on the knowledge of that or is this an inherent perception that a woman who would do that must be damaged so something must be happy must have had happened to her when she was younger that was awful otherwise you wouldn't be doing this well it's like going to a strip club and probably 80% of the guys are just seeing somebody dancing and 20% of the guys are thinking wait you shouldn't be doing this you know what I mean I don't think 20% at strip-clubs I don't know maybe higher I just feel like you know what I mean like I think we're able to I'm sorry to cut you off but I think I think human beings are able to not see everything that they want to see because they're enjoying what's before them right but I'm wondering like why if it's a man we don't have any gases because we don't think of a man you know if a guy is an object of sexual desire for women we don't think of him as a victim ever I know which is unfortunately a lot of things happened to young boys you know what did you hear about this guy tattoo in Katy Perry you about the song no now she says maybe she's not so whenever he's accusing her of sexual assault was calling sexual assault and she pulled down his sweatpants and exposes dick to some people right right and then you would love Katy Perry pulling your pants off I love Katy Perry problem suppose your pants down in front of a bunch of guys to pick up my keys into my pants during her vagina was exposed to all these strangers I was at I got a piece of s*** that was your daughter or your wife some guy pulls your wife f****** sweatpants people I got arrested in New Jersey she blew a 14 year old boy they gave her a 10-year suspended sentence attenuation on 10-year probation no jail time and she keeps her teaching certificate she'll blow you to that girls f****** crazy she's just just love sucking dick she's my God you can talk her into it it's all I can afford to a lady blows 14 year olds every cop thinks she'll suck his dick too right don't you think they're crazy there's a lot of different ways to be damaged right and that's her damaged but what I'm saying is like what is she doing she's a grown adult see how you been you looking at that there's a lot of different ways to be damaged but if that was a grown man having sex with a 14 year old girl you wouldn't worry about what f****** damage he has you be worrying about what damage he's doing he even worried about her being damaged I'm not worried about it damage he has you be worried about what damage he's doing the even in that situation you worried about her being damaged I'm not worried about it but you don't have any but that's what you said right or what you were thinking about was her being damaged right not her victimizing the boy right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so have you been have you pay attention is Jeffrey Epstein stuff a little bit things going on I think I think he's very powerful people he had stuff on too many very powerful people likely right probably yeah yeah they took a really creepy high-profile case that my have connected a bunch of really powerful pedia I don't I don't necessarily believe that it's you know the people from like it's Trump or it's the Democrat I think there's other very powerful people that would have wanted this guy to go away for sure you know what I mean yeah yeah you said you didn't know that he had a cellmate and hang himself is choke them yeah I mean he could put that noose around Epstein's neck and then squeezes arms together and just pull on it until the guy hangs to death in Angola go to phone her and how did it pass jacked has huge bald guy free in the South yeah he looks like his name what he go to jail for the deaths of four men alleged cocaine drug conspiracy he's that big and he's 51 how many cops are smuggling steroids in their a****** to get get to this guy is there a rope left in there with him this guy probably Solutions you keep getting me the juice I'll keep this f****** guy on ice and right they didn't they said this is the one conspiracy AZ is the one conspiracy where nobody believes the true story that I've talked to know nobody Michael Shermer things just happen and people kill themselves has his taken he likes a lot it just seemed just make a scroll scroll down a little bit there okay a new conspiracy theory development I've seen regarding suicide they made it happen on purpose first let it would anyone bother concocting conspiracy theories about him being murdered murdered by clandestine outside forces of course. As with JFK Diana Maryland at all Fame warped perspective in fuels unwarranted speculation first of all this is not unwarranted second mall if you don't think that powerful people have people killed you're hilarious like that is willfully naive they do do it says remember the adage regarding conspiracy theories never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence or chance true but you shouldn't do that it is possible but what what are the odds there's something because he's in so many circles and touch so many super powerful people it's different house in New York City Johnson Controls a lot of stuff that's where what's going on in the house the guy there's there's so many questions about where his wealth was the color of his house did Neil Denis by balls on the entrance and set the other s*** about the house is crazy to the same color it's painted in the same way these really flag is and this there was an idea that people if they're wondering like how far this guy's influence goes and where it comes from and look at this house how does this house on the f****** island island is like a building there no big deal out of Mar-A-Lago yeah but I mean a flute with him 26 times I've never flown with if you have to be my very best friends and I tour with all the time have I flown with you 26 * 450 evenly ever maybe if we flew together it might be a little more than four or five in Monday 10 and might be tended when I've known you for years now is not been 26 x so Bill Clinton it was afterwards Jerry probably 20 times would find out about oh really when he got busted with shortly after that and then he's been on the Run since time it wasn't I wasn't Trump talking about it with Howard and Howard Stern was he talking about cuz he was sentence woman pursue this pretty heavily she was a journalist and she were to pursue the story they already wrote about about 2016 and for some reason the media didn't really pick up on he said he wrote letters to everyone what the name of this woman that because this one woman really doggedly pursued this story and I was because of her and I think a lot of it had to do with her recognition at this guy and got in his creepy like right now sportscaster James Brown sportscaster Kratom find out is this Brian in his groin I'm sure it's a good show we really have to start doing stuff like that yeah ridiculous shows All Star postmenopausal chips look like these days high school that's right and if he looks that good today that's incredible taking care of himself must be yeah he's doing something right. Run around after teenage girls good life floozies flying over Bill Clinton Rihanna. He thinks he's not really that they faked his death it's so creepy God bug got good care of how what good he's gone maybe not man may be nice, Maybe not maybe if he stayed alive could have told us some stuff about some terrible people that are still alive doing things he's the worst one I don't know about that he's a creeper how do we know that we know he's a creep most likely but we definitely don't know if he's the worst at all those people that he was creeping with super powerful people doing crazy s*** yeah there's got to be some stuff right investigation I'd go after the hard drive sometime if that's where they keep it all I did find hard drives filled with stuff that he had they did that he had with the very young girls and suggestive poses and pornography but they were talking about how many different photos of young ladies all ride on his computer all right enough with this guy yeah that he had with the very young girls and suggestive poses and I don't know if it was pornography but they were talking about how many different photos of young ladies all ride on his computer all right enough with this guy but I don't know if they were young like it legal or young like 18</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you know what else is that trip that I did with your pal that open my eyes I never done those things IV vitamin drip are buying brother I swear that a bag and a half and I was ready to run through a wall in your house which we had a year to show there in like I showed up wasted I think typing like New Year's Eve UFC highlights how about that hard in the paint in the paint he's the only got listen to say what you want about Dana and I do like it like really saved can you imagine if another commission do this another hundred this but I do like when he does spit that's what he saying is the truth like sometimes he's on one you like what the f*** these guys over then sometimes I overthink Edwards theme cyborg steam whoever did it with her it's her boyfriend or whoever it was that edited that video that lied and put words in his mouth is so f****** stupid you don't think that they're going to do something about that you're out of your goddamn mind when they edited that video to say that whenever I'm talking public I'm not telling the truth which is not what he said at all and then they have it edit and cut right there I'll tell you this right now. Dana's to Smart at let's say he would let say he thinks that you think you would say that in a public forum the cyborg when they're face-to-face like that and you don't think you realize there's cameras around he's way too smart for that so full of s*** me and Nate Diaz had our conversation I say any of that stuff so I made that all up but also they did was They're bringing back s*** that happened five years ago cyborg want an apology from me I think it was that she wanted apology for me I think it was her boyfriend or someone on the team I apologize to her me and her knowing around face-to-face and I took a photo with her afterwards there's a photo of me and her on my Instagram would you see you're just like Amy like guys were goofing around with drinking and fighting and I said hey I'm sorry about the Joe I promise no more jokes and I said I'm actually a fan of yours and I want you to succeed the UFC and I wish you the best of luck no hard feelings of kind of hurt my feelings and I'm sorry I got a promise no more jokes I gave her a hug we took a picture together and that was when was that 2017 his only because meaning Narrative of that cheese Bastille she's this monster PD's right once we don't talk about Jon Jones Jon Jones got tested positive for this tiny amount of something that probably came from a tainted supplements she tested positive for a serious steroid and something that you like a woman taking a steroid is different than a man taking his to MediaTakeOut female-male you don't have to do. There's been people who have tested positive before where that's not their narrative Brock Lesnar destroy but also yeah a good way to look at me look at her fight you look at the fight with look when it gets dark is when you go back to the non testing days like the Gina Carano fight kids veins coming out of her face to look up chica to ever fight MMA there's a video does a picture rather cyborg holding genus face and punching her and you see the black fingernails and and she's got this mean look at her face and she's punching Jean and the faces I bring us one of the cyborg is it that one French Jesus Christ but she's holding her face with those black fingernails and just crushing Gina's had to beat the s*** out of her but it said Gina was a beastman and she hung in there as long as she could but the consensus was that cyborg was Juiced up enough individual side not so much when it comes to the the feminine like those looks Department see I get that marketview and the Beast I was taught Kyla Harrison on you that is the pfl she's a two-time gold medalist judoka monster and she want she's in the pfl she's in the tournament there and she's she wants to fight cyborg why does she think that kind of cyborg has gone down this road in her career and then I picture on you know if I found the UFC near me it is my belief f****** wrong I don't know but this is how I would do in this is what they're doing is what I think would it bother you will see as nice as a person cyborg is there's no other girl walking this plant that looks like cyborg really because maybe PD's do your point I'll do Ronda Rousey and Miesha Tate so they're going to push those girls more because that's what people can relate to more than a girl like Cyborg and I don't think I'm saying anything no one has assumed already and it's the end I like time works at the nice person and I don't think so I was a bad person I think her management and the way they've handled things have completely factored and I think we're going to battle with UFC was the worst thing and stop he is a nice person in every time I've ever known him interact with her and looked even that last fight and there was a thing with the Spencer fight like that people are saying that you guys it was biased commentary know it wasn't that girl survived that girl survived person that has come to about time bragged on this girl and she cut cyborg face wide open one with one elbow fight it's like when John doesn't destroy someone your time at the other guy was Cyborg to expect just emergency one judge thought the Thiago won the fight I don't agree with that amount but that's how close that fight was there was no one that thought that Spencer won that fight after it was over but was amazing that she was able to endure the f****** beating the side were put on it was a girl</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what is that your daughter your daughter goes and joins Isis so I can just think about this that the Manson Murders why I'm so until I have no idea got problems but the man throws those girls like 17 in 1917 will they were also homeless so you're dealing with people there probably is crazy crazy and then they didn't know what they were going to do to the house does Once Upon a Time in Hollywood that their depiction of it that the Whiskey song blocked it I cannot get enough of the sixties on a 68 Porsche like amazing Bruce Lee was a philosopher whiskey of fighter was he really that much of a badass I don't know like I've heard I've heard he is a Furby right now he's not been really a lot of fights I've heard I've heard both so what I thought was great is they put like Quentin Tarantino put his perspective on it looks like I've heard that narrative and I loved it because I've witnessed it all the way up heard where he wasn't much of a badass like you don't have a crazy record and the problem was in real life is no evidence that he was ever at like an egomaniac dumb who's very interesting guy and very insightful and I do and I bleed in his like a philosopher and he's brilliant but when it comes to the actual toughness we don't we don't know we don't we don't know for sure but that that's one and you've heard that narrative before right what narrative dad like like he's not actual tough guy well what I had heard was that it's at the time he was incredibly innovative did martial arts but he didn't really fight and he have like a sparring match once at a tournament and he had some street fights but he didn't you know he wasn't like Jon Jones and that but then I'd also heard that it was this bad ass and fought other dudes from JoJo's and he's amazing it's a f****** Quentin Tarantino movie and know what that day out I don't give a spoil the ending with the ending to that's not real well that's true then they had a totally different ending like you're living make believe everything don't know what's real in that stuff for like I'll see. The ranch is real where they went Charles Manson who's barely in it the Manson family no but we do know another about Bruce Lee Bruce Lee Was His Brilliant insightful guy and in that movie they made him a caricature of that and you have a problem with that I did whether he's been in a million fights are not the weight what he's done for martial arts is some presents it's amazing what he did so take that twists for me and that's what I want from the movie family's reaction oh my God the sisters starting to his daughters pit yeah she's been more shredded yeah I just crying trying to say I like the twist because it's not real busy you stop producing beat the f*** out of bracket quick punches you living in the legacy of her sleep which is probably true but in a Quentin Tarantino movie that was f****** great man I thought that movie was brilliant Bruce Lee things because they made him look like a dork but everyone sucked his dick soap to mix it up real guy that has a real Legacy and they made him look like a buffoon it's the movies though I know but it did you know you're making the guy look like a f****** idiot you but anyone who wasn't really an idiot he wasn't happy at all not at all for martial arts I don't know why you like the thing that's good I like the twist like you feel to be Brad Pitt up I went and he knew how to fight in the reality is a bigger guy who knows how to fight really knows how to fight 230 lb and paste thinking about it too much</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> here's my thing back to the the mass shooting the gun control with the semi-automatic weapons if they said hey man if we get rid of semi-automatic weapons there won't be any more mass shootings like this don't you think in general most people like yeah cool take him in really that fun are they that cool to do that it doesn't matter whether you need them in terms of the the way they are looking at it they're not going to say okay you take them because their ideas the government eventually wants all your guns are going to start with assault weapons and it worked their way to all weapons what if they assault because the mass shootings because they don't think that they should be able to do that they think that the government does not have the ability to take away your guns for real problem the problem is crazy people shooting people the problem with automatic guns shooting people going to go after those people that have the guns that have never done anything all day you're going to say will the second amendment protects my right to keep and bear arms Amendment written the 1700 that hasn't changed through the thing is though is if you can't hey well pump if we can get rid of these for now in the future Wicked to go what I'm saying is killing people left and f****** right dude you got to get off the road with this thing so many people are dying like get rid of f****** frog yeah but that's a simplistic perception of what's actually going on no one's going to think about it that way they're going to think maybe the people that don't have guns going to think about that way that the people that are asked are going to say this is a slippery slope that give them any ground like Jolie never going to vote for him they think that if you give in in any way shape or form to take him out free slope and they going to take away pistols in California's already reduced the size of the magazines but that actually I think that was voted back like I think that was ruled to be unconstitutional they had like limited magazines like you don't have a magazine like six rounds or 10 Rounds or someone I know was 10 I think they're trying to make it lower but that Dad has been reversed I'm pretty sure here's my thing with the mental health call Nick at the mental health plan there's a mental health problem all around the world we have a gun problem that's not true the menzingers just hear the mental health problem in the United States is extremely exacerbated by the use of Psych drugs there's way way way more to brother have nearly as many prescribe drugs in Europe as a Duet washer obviously not everybody on psych drugs that murdering people did the problem is many many many layers right there's people that are abused there's people that grow up with a lot of violence with people that grow up and they now there's their psychotic they they have psych drugs the psych drugs or disassociate some people just be bad apples though like does it always have to be a mental illness like all these shooters just happen to have mental illness all of them well someone just don't suck at life maybe some suck at life but almost all of them I mean in the 90% on psych medication who was murdered by his wife when she was on an SSRI and on cocaine like people when they're on those drugs it's it's a varying reaction and suicidal thoughts are very common as well as homicidal thoughts very common in also the feeling that things aren't renal the people that have talked to you that were on ssris that got off of them nothing seems real the computer simulation bank and I think that's a big problem for sure a crazy person with a semi-automatic weapon is a real problem and you would want to take a semi-automatic weapon away from a crazy person the other but the problem is if there's a guy like you was a semi-automatic weapon ever Ranch somewhere and you just like shooting coyotes and f****** f****** metal targets around the and you don't harm anybody in you're a good person you are technically protected by the 2nd Amendment and why should you but okay but then what about your pistol should you take a pistol what about your shotgun what if you get a shotgun and you f****** keep relighting it depends on if the people are not armed they're running around him all you can tell alot of f****** people with shotgun automatic you're the smartest people I know Bernie Sanders a smart motherfuker this he lives in this world when you said what are we going to do his aunt has like his good as mine it's a good thing to be scared because there's no one out there has a shining light like one answer you like that's it the smartest Minds in the world you can't take away salt guns assault rifles you're not going to do that they're not going to give the constitutional right now they're still out there you'll get them but you have to go door-to-door and search can't do that everyone's thinking we'll have that's not realistic like some s*** how else you going to get those guns from. The answer is it the other thing to me that such thing as I used to always think his kid to on or in their basement on bread at their these losers and they have nothing to live for probably true, most nine out of ten but then you got homeboy like you're over and where was in Ohio who had these chicks are coming out he's banging in a few girls had a bunch of girls that I can we saw signs he's always talking about mass shootings he was also Elizabeth Warren supporter who wrote a post about the need for gun control after different mass shootings I mean he was a real left-wing guy and this is something that they've been the media is ignoring cuz it doesn't fit the narrative to the narrative is there all white male right-wing you know he was left when he was laughing like yeah he's a leftist I mean he he wrote leftist he him as his pronouns on his page wow yeah I mean he was but do them he's a psychopath they're saying the kid that they caught in Endicott and I don't talk about Massachusetts bums me out when did after this when we want some else but they're saying the kitty Cotten El Paso who do the one who do dinner up Diana when she did die but he was saying that shows No Remorse sick f*** yeah I did it man like you kidding me dude you killed kids like you're damn right even better than we almost these f****** immigrants that come here and get detained if anything saying that they should definitely kill him and they shouldn't have definitely torturement just just just a quick but having him around doesn't help anybody either a good thing though and hopefully someone gets me and shoots me so I don't have to go through the legal system that's the way it'd be way better die real quick so at least he doesn't want this that's a good thing I said all white dudes in America and Instagram took his post how crazy is that how you write they took his post down I'm crazy they put it back up right they did show me has some Power Man of all the different people that were wide that have committed mass murders manage name the last time the last time there was a black guy that committed a mass murderer was those f****** guys in DC they were shooting people out of their car I don't have the paper as a son and father yeah it was a guy in a younger guy name the last time the last time there was a black guy that committed a mass murder with those f****** guys in DC they were shooting people out of their car I told her the paper has a son and father yeah it was a guy in a younger guy with a younger guy was his son</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> 5 can of pop in these days it was almost at its struggle City about a year ago a lot of killers but no one that is a real promising threat to Jon Jon Santos put on a fuk show but I got to go you said something about it right you don't know that although I will say this acentos is bad as f*** and then before that Anthony Smith both amazing Fighters John candle holder John's Gaylord and it and I think there's no argument but I think they're starting to be a little chink in his armor maybe you think so Fry's especially Santos's f***** up like that John did not Blow Me Away by John I know means and Santos had one leg I think you want that is buljan go undefeated probably at that a good amount of money on that but there's a guy like I could I don't think you can send outside and beat John like a Ray has like a guy was super technical and long you're not going out smart John on the outsides not happening I think it's going to come from a guy like Johnnie Walker feels like a spinning heel kick Corey has crazy cardio that's a great white yeah you're right and you know a lot of s*** Kobe did to get the well core he's a really nice guy and his guys finish last. Sometimes they win rocket ship go crazy though that looks like part of the spork part of the sport is how much money can you generate because it's not just about how well you perform as a fighter and about how many people are interested in you fighting this crazy but that's the nature of the Beast and that's why I hope that having a guy like Corey on my podcasts or you having them on your podcast lets people know what a great guy that says like this has got a route for he's a great guy casuals don't put a reasonable gravitate towards out if he wins they well well you've got to become undeniable she's slowly get yes he's slowly getting there and he's got one of the best trainers in the f****** world you know Mark Henry is the s*** in the best and his Camp is f****** fantastic is got Marlon and Frankie down to play the game via DC Jon Jones season nice as they come doesn't talk s*** the first right now but that sells just off their talents but if you can get a guy like Jose Aldo Conor McGregor start recording with John Jones yeah for the heavyweight title I think that's the future fight that's next weekend week I think that steep a fight Jon Jones heavyweight phones for the heavyweight title when John's Champion if John could be steep at or if steep a can beat DC and then steep they could be Jon Jones and they have a ribbon depending on how to fight ghosts look the bottom line is DC not steep a senseless one round knocked him out cold for the title again man and and say Jon Jones Daniel Cormier number to khabib northri Jon Jones in real life okay every single one there's one lost in his career it's a nonsense once they're trying to reverse I'm one hundred percent support reversing that laws are set at the very least make it a no-contest John dominated that fight smashed him there's no f****** way that's a lost if I don't dude just stop shipment pound-for-pound was Mighty Mouse and Mighty Mouse you know the caveat was that he never beat anybody like Jon Jones beat wasn't the same caliber fight it wasn't a DC and then we lost a hammer so who know there's no arguments specially light-heavyweight there's no argument is Jon Jones everybody else can go pound sand does not his own even close if he goes up who knows if you will have the same cardio who knows if you have the same if you'll be as fast there's something about guys going up but look Luke rockhold same same story he goes up the light heavyweight he's got all this extra bulk on them now see I don't think Jonathan the drugs are like 2:40 I think he doesn't come in at a f****** lean mean to 25 to 30 doesn't cut any weight that's why we drink that anyways I hope you don't f****** does work maybe he just comes in and looks just like Jon Jones at light-heavyweight he just doesn't cut any way that's all I mean I don't know about now but all he really did is go with heavy weights Ragdoll Ragdoll I'll tell you what when he fought ospi talk to Jackson afterwards and Greg was saying I don't like the fact that he's been doing all this powerlifting and it goes and I feel like that played a part in this fight. So Jack the Giant but I don't know I didn't think I felt that it was OSP I feel like OSP Rose the occasion is a dangerous guy is a super athletic eyes big. Powerful left kick you know when he's an aqua Weider OSP fights awkward and you f****** and he catches you allowed to explosive impossible takedown typically shows a broken arm okay the entire last I'm with a broken arm and never even said a thing about it he was fighting with a f****** broken forearm he's a beast mrbeast and that's why I think John didn't look so good in that fight I disagree that he didn't look good because of the weight lifting but I don't know him the way Greg jacket wasn't around cancel that being a Jon Jones d********** even with Pete you can f****** fill up anyone who he fights on whatever PDG want you still beating them wear whatever he's doing it with her is taking things are not that you could give his freaking opponents as much as they want to not beating himself argument Sportsman take nose man to Smart to technical I don't know I don't either and we don't have to if you don't have to know that testing is strict yeah we believe that what he got was through tainted means and I don't even know if it was supplements you know the big theory was that he got cocaine that was laced with creatine I hope the problem creatine apparently according to someone who I know who really knows their s*** was Annex visiting expert he said this is very common that when you buy cheap creatine cheap creatine often has other s*** in it because you're buying it from China and from other places that have unscrupulous mixing thing and I listened as one of the owners of Onnit I know that this if we never had our stuff test positive for steroids but we did have is when we looked at the early batches of Alpha Brain we had independently tested you know when we first when Aubrey and I first opened on we didn't know what the f*** were doing in terms of we hadn't run a supplement company before and there's a lot of learning to do more things that we learn was that when you're buying stuff and then you having stuff mix the people that are mixing it if you don't get the very best people you're getting people that mix stuff that don't clean out there that so you might get Winstrol in there function so the people that are selling stuff we're selling similar things vitamins and I like so but we did get our stuff tainted innocence with other nutrients that weren't supposed to be in there so then we had to do some investigation and then we figured out what the problem was and we adjusted our methods we change the way we change the people we work with and we did a lot of different things but if you're buying cheap creatine that's what could that's what coke dealer you'll do nicely by to create a shady dude what are methods we change the way we do change the people we work with and we did a lot of different things but if you're buying cheap creatine that's what could that's what coke dealer use icy bites you created are you saying the coke from a shady dude</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> are you guys okay Jamie going to get the Boost real real Pro going on how about that Colby Covington fella and it's tune in to watch him lose which is he's doing it right in all honesty we like him cuz we're balls deep in UFC and MMA weight like my brother who's not that big of a fans like this really doesn't like I know what he's doing this guy is amazing and you do it for five rounds for 25 minutes and where's yeah it's it's fascinating the general fan like all the s*** but he's doing it right because talking all that s*** like you only see schedule f*****-up human Jon Jones posted you let everyone that he knows like Robbie Lawler let everybody down you know I'm saying cuz he wants everybody wants Colby to lose Bryant Kobe's doing the exact everyone's playing into his game plan. early career will way more excited he's a Savage but he broke his hands bunch of times correct and you know it also realize like this is not the way to have a long career and walk out of it with all your brains intact will think think I'll good John Fitch was like Hey I don't like the way my face cool your cut what the f*** I'm 20 year old man yeah I think they cut them just because of this room we have a bunch of that are you really strict keto I sent you and Brian to text your boys up to 273 I look like s*** my girls like now you look fine it was lying man on the scale it's not fine you boys Makita 14 days left yes it's 2 in the afternoon bro yeah 2 in the afternoon to buy alcoholic now if a regular person Robbie Lawler is one of the biggest f****** Savages to ever compete the sport he's an animal and Kobe shot him down he shut everything down and shut his entire game down and he did it with an unprecedented work-rate he made he was punching one punch every 2 seconds. Which is nuts I mean that is it for to do that over 5 f****** ground against one of the greatest welterweights of all time Robbie Lawler and win every single f****** round some today I need not even close me Robbie occasionally would swing and connect and then Kobe would immediately him three or four times more and then take him down or clench with him and beat him up and it was amazing Colby strike is not terribly that it's very pretty damn good re Technical and the volume volume is incredible if I'm fighting Colby like I'm getting a guy like campaigns if I see my point running with Cam Hanes not the another ultra-marathoner figure it out welcome Morrow can't run that's right you can't do road work his legs are filled up yes oh yeah it's not getting any better his knees are mangled but you're doing something right well he's cardio is off-the-charts to but it's just he does different things you can do a lot of different things to work this morning is that a swimming you can do a lot of assault bike that Echo Bike the Rogue makes that is as good as Jacob ladder yeah yeah yeah yeah I feel like it's lying to me I workout every morning on that thing applies Arden thicker yeah but you eating like an animal still says I burn a thousand calories probably Lobster f****** sandwiches and chips but he's amazing style that style of wrestling and striking and as a person who's fascinated by tactics right I liked his tactics or incredible because he's he's got great discipline to never he's never bites down his mouthpiece and throws as hard as he can never everything is like a calculated the output is all the same it's just constant constant take out now this is a marathon to wear your ass out it's all he's just constantly hitting you constantly moving forward constant volume and it seemed like Robbie was waiting for him to pause in front of them or get a little tired so I could fire shots off and the bobbing and weaving the Robbie was doing like what was all that about just a minute just a minute real time and probably just trying to avoid getting beat up I mean this punch is just about Colby is Levemir hate him is he doubles down cuz he got on the mic and his line about Matt Hughes oh my God I was watching it and I was where was Derek Post in the sun Ahmad my openers and when he said that they were aware of that's fantastic it's a cuz it's it is messed up that's his character man but he's a heel and he just double down so hard so hard to Matt Hughes is really close to Robbie Lawler he said he would take a lesson from this boy Matt Hughes and get off the train tracks when the train is coming he's just all fair in Love and War yeah controversial ruthless sheet that he could say and here's what else would so we're impressed by his tactics right you know what's even more impressive as a former fighter it's stressful enough fighting another grown man urine with a steel cage sweats when they're really good it's f****** stressful now imagine talking all that s*** pressure in still perform then get on the mic I wonder if he's ever just in bed is like damn he has a real shot at being a real Champion a real shot I know he was already the intramural champion possibly don't count either because your contract isn't you don't get when your Champion, but you get bumped up to higher pay interim chance don't get bumped up right before I feel like in this face major wrestling cardio the only thing I see I would imagine come out as can be a slight favorite because of his power yeah one kind of distinguishing kind of factors come out has a lot more power right tomorrow is to throw everything at like 50 60% she was slaying in Summerlin that first round against Robbie they were exchanging knockout artist bright knock people out to but his approach is to throw everything at like 50 60% she was slaying in Summerlin that first round against Robbie they were exchanging who would have connected to control for either guy he was getting robbed</div>

I don't care this is your your crazy please do not use gender like what the hell does that change anything and by the way if you can't deal with a bunch of people moving around and distract making noises and s*** just stopped get the f*** out of everybody else to deal with your f****** weak mind go home go f*** a goddamn Bigfoot right a Bigfoot f******* and make millions what is the seminar about about being an a****** communism socialism no f****** thing they do in every single f****** thing that everybody around them. Everybody has to comply and everybody victim too because it's impossible for that to happen. Everything you said there's always one person even if maybe they were listening to something else and they didn't know that that's what they were supposed to do whenever so then there's always going to be your always be a victim of something someone's always said the wrong thing they've always done the wrong thing and all of your worth is from something outside of yourself and you know don't have to deal with your own but also do that what used to be acceptable year ago now is unacceptable a year from now it'll be something else after a while you won't even be able to say colored you going to have to say the c-word right have to say you can't say people of color which is National Association for the advancement of colored people which is bananas people I feel get people stop having attachment to words you could stop having the mean and it's like they wouldn't hurt you well about that he would call People by a bunch of ethnic slurs and then say you know the problem not saying these words is that if you say these words enough time they lose all their meaning and it's not going to hurt somebody I'm paraphrasing but this is the opposite you know what this is and then say you know the problem not saying these words is that if you say these words enough time they lose all their meaning and it's not going to hurt somebody's feelings I'm paraphrasing but this is the opposite you know what this is</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you know I had Bernie Sanders on yesterday and that guy is running for something cool and briefly looked into the comments of one of the post and so many f****** people are so goddamn toxic they're just battling it out left and right misrepresent his position with rubbing someone's calling me in all right white supremacist white and do ants like what in the f*** that's so high supremacist page storm front of the founder of storm front of my apartment LeBron I'd I asked him about it and it was critical I was criticizing those like you can't claim you're going to have violence with people it's so it's so f****** dump and then all the proud boys s*** that happened with violence came far after that but people are like blaming me for having him on or even know what the f*** it is he's the co-founder of Vice that's you want to really like I'm not religious or anything but it's like we are all God's children like there's missing this whole thing it's this fight against each other but the problem is that do go on shows and try to reinvent themselves you're helping them recruit people before he was on my pockets though there was recruit people for him to recruit to the people need to understand like he wasn't there was nothing like I had a mom because he was this guy was funny and you used to do a lot of interesting vid right he f***** up when he started that group and he f***** up when he's calling for violence and telling people to choke a b**** and punch people and grab these people doing it in response to the violence that antifa was was pushing on right-wing people that would have these meetings and show up we're back at them it's all crazy reham was all poorly thought-out but the idea that that makes you a white nationalist cuz you talk cuz you talk to him and it's so f****** stupid but it's like this is the world we live in and everything's so it's like you left or right your blood out of white your 1 or 0 it's like there's no gray area with antifreeze you in the one moment that you and then there's no before or after there's no growth there's nothing it's like crap just said that you said that like not like I clarified I took it back I Revisited it I just a lot of things people do when you talk or you just you know you say things like you say things like you don't even know what the f*** you're going to say when you're saying it when you're talkin a long phone conversation and like this in a podcast and someone wants to take a snippet it's not doesn't make any sense and it's this is the world we live in today everybody wants to paint everyone is toxic and everyone you want to paint so many people I should say want to paint people as being a problem or negative thing it's like this is the Twitter world where 20% of the people make 80% yeah well I tell I'm happy you're going to be in your life if you're expecting other people to come cour to all of your demands and did all their stuff out of Thrones not trying to be happy or trying to do is somehow or another score points and rack up was distract themselves from their own life by focusing on these external issues at The Thinker critical and super importance of them are running for president presidents very important issue and most like 95% of time I avoid comments but for whatever reason I just found myself flipping through it because I want to see what the people think about Bernie it seems like every time I check if they paint people in such character caricature AOC she is a woman who I don't think they're I don't think I've ever seen anybody work so people work so hard to miss characterize her or paint her in a horrible light and my clip she says things that I don't agree with ya why is everyone so f****** angry like what is this will people and put all their thing on things aren't you know his beliefs and like when I was in my whole like you know when I was actually angry and feeling you have this whole system around you and you know you can't hear the other side and you have to like everyone has to be a villain in that are they there either with you or against you and I don't know it's just too much is unhealthy I had to tap out I stopped paying attention to a lot of stuff and I don't know if that makes me ignorant I just got to live a happy life no I don't think it does make you agree in about being able to talk to people we don't have social cues you don't have empathy not looking at them and people say the meanest nasty s*** it's insulting people dunking on people is more important than actual command trying to get those extra little likes the main point would be they want to get your attention holyshit they got Joe Rogan's attention that's so cool you know they just want to feel alive or whatever. people have the impression I try to not take anything personally it's like you don't know me if you don't like me like that's weird you don't know me you shouldn't really have that much of opinion it's like not finding a validation can't find a good stuff for the bad stuff in the comments you can't look at the comments for good things it's just as bad as looking for bad things some people think that's a good idea to gauge like whether or not the conversation was effective whether or not you could have done something better than navigate it more efficiently or more more painting for the make it more entertaining for the people to listen to come for the constructive criticism there can be some of that from some people the problem is you're trying to manage all this data at scale right you're dealing with thousands and thousands of humans that are Charming in and a lot of them are deeply unhappy lot of people are commenting on things or just really frustrated with their lives or listen to you when you're like f*** men if someone saw or listen to you when you're like f*** man if exactly</div>

Dutchess from hallucinogens in chat to but it's something I struggle was like I have to look back at me a child predators and I'm like I forgive these people because they are from the same light I guess what is the what's the wacky think it's just you sit in silence of the church is there's two types of programs in unbroken I was unprogrammed which is the super chill when there's no Bible talk there's no preacher there's nothing you just sit and benches facing each other my meeting house had these old explain we talked about it's a meeting house that you made up with nonsense really look at each other but there's facing bunches and then there's you no benches here so you are kind of all looking at your facing each other and what are you do you sit in silence someone would do that growing up I went to a quaker school to him over little kids reset to sit in silence like 45 minutes which is impossible it's about 82,000 saying I would wear shirt that had like things on it I can play with like at a shirt with a phone and I had like a cord and I would just wear and I would settle arms instead of my alarms didn't go off I just had to be doing so it was crazy you just a little and you're just bored medicated to Ritalin and stuff no but when I was older it I don't feel like it a little bit but I was pretty good at being like I don't want to do these things you don't feel like it affected YouTube Connecticut yeah yeah it's so it is interesting cuz it is I can only imagine with her to be a parent you just there's all this information coming at you and you're dealing with your own s*** and a lot of people didn't go through their healing process or anything to so it must be so hard to be parents just got to be crazy eyes I think about it I never want to have a kid until I did some hallucinogens and then I was like I was very angry in the past and something that I work on the line I just wouldn't want to redo patterns and so bad. But I do think because I've had I had such traumatic stuff I think I would be I think I could protect my kids so good with Quakers are allowed to medicate their kids it's part of the doctrine yeah I just doesn't 16 cuz I just wanted it just triggered a lot of things in me and I went real crazy for a second I just had a lot of trauma that I wasn't dealing with it wasn't this embarrassing if I was hanging out with a lot of really like I got really mad mad I just wasn't I wasn't dealing with stuff and it just kind of pushed all the stuff forward for me and I was just like sexual assault stuff just came up look at them a lot of people that were angry and were marching around and stuff we had some personal triggers that it happened for those so because of like the grab them by the p**** I think I have a different view on those things and I you know I was running around still mad at who am I, mad at I did a lot of like when it first happened was like f*** man I did that for about three months I got I got out of that but really angry and just projecting and piss smell the stuff and it's like there's a few there's a few men on that right there's a feel but there are few people that lights up setting the drinking days the drinking Days Inn from my childhood you know I had I had some f*****-up should happen but you know it's you can't it's just important for me to not blame a large group of people that have nothing to do with my trauma and it's also when I get triggered what I needed to learn was that's my responsibility to handle my trigger and I can't just be running around like this like unsheathed sword and I can but I'm going to cut a run around me the thing that people do when they blame everyone that's part of that group you know it's so, it's so you never there was a real problem a few months back or Liam Neeson was talking about one of his friends at something that happened where a black eye done something murdered one of his friends from his friend something awful and so he would go out at night with a bat looking for a black eye to start trouble every was Furious out of yeah I didn't do anything and I was in a terrible state of being honest about this I'm not proud but I did Express those things and talk about it and say I am embarrassed that I got have lash out at me for still a couple of things I don't f****** I don't have the capacity to hate an entire group of people and I certainly like I have brothers I have my. I don't do anything so sometimes you say things and that's not really what you mean of course and then I think right now it's going on and I checked out a lot of stuff I don't pay attention to a lot of things anymore cuz it was just like I can do and how I can feel good and how I can I just want to make people laugh have a good time if you'll feel good I want to feel good it's like I can't do that if I'm in a constant state of taking it all this information that's just pushing my buttons pushing my buttons all the time but it's the best way of describing it you have a physical diet and if you have a poor fish 2 and something people don't think of all the time you know I remember who described it that way but it's the best way of describing it you have a physical diet and if you have a poor physical diet your body sick</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what happened with Neil deGrasse Tyson that Neil deGrasse Tyson got in trouble for tweeting something the other day after the mass shootings right people pissed at them because it didn't pull up pull up the Tweet up cuz it's pretty interesting cuz it's it's just accurate and people were angry and they're saying he's using his platform irresponsibly and no he was trying to let people know that although these shootings are a tragedy they are a small number of deaths and there's so many other deaths that happened here goes that's 48 hours to USA horrific Lee lost 34 people to mass shootings on average across 48 hours we also lose 500 to Medical errors 302 the flu 250 suicide 200 car accident 42 homicides be a handgun off and our emotions respond more respectable than two data now that is not a bad tweet but I saw a scientist who was writing I am unfollowing him he is using his platform irresponsibly virtue signaling really because what we saying is not that there's anything wrong with feeling her horrified by these tragedies me he sang we are with horrific Lee lost 34 people to mass shooting please saying it's interesting that there's people dying left and right all through this country all day long just not at the hands of one person so we look at it differently and he's just saying he just giving you data as a scientist and that's that's exactly what it is he's a science gas and so a scientist can separate the emotion but people don't show people apology people will consider a mass shooting a much worse than you know heart attacks yeah so listen to that so this is the other thing yesterday I posted in reaction to the horrific mass shootings in America over the previous 34 people spawn mixed and highly critical responses if you missed it I offered a short list of largely preventable causes of death along with their average today death toll in the United States they significantly exceeded the death toll from the two days of mass shootings including the number of people 40 who want average die from hand gun homicides every two days I've been noted that we tend to react emotionally too spectacular incidences of death with the implicit that more common causes of death trigger mild to responses within us my intent was to offer objectively true information that might help shape conversation and reactions to preventable ways we die where I miscalculated was that I genuinely believed that the Tweet would be helpful to anyone trying to save lives in America what I learned from the range of reactions that is that for many people some information my tweet in particular can be true but unhelpful especially the time when many people are either still in shock or trying to heal or both so if you are one of those people I apologize for not knowing in advance what effect might we could have had on you I'm there for thankful for the Candor and depth of critical reaction shared in my Twitter feed as an educator I personally value knowing with precision and accuracy what reaction anything that I say or write will instead my audience and I got this one wrong respectfully submitted and then it says Neil deGrasse Tyson now even that people saying not enough not good enough for response it's almost like today there's certain people today that they don't give a fuk whether or not you're saying something with sincerity whether you are sorry sorry is not enough like they don't want they want to be mad at you and even if you're sorry if you admit you made a mistake there's no forgiveness there's no Road to Redemption there's no what does no I get what you were doing I think that it depends on you know as far as is the sorry enough for whatever depends on the pattern of the person now with Neil deGrasse Tyson this what I think happened in here this is my opinion he's a scientist so he gives information so he saw this and said oh wait a minute this many people died from medical mistakes this may be an end people didn't react what he doesn't where he messed up with the timing yes you don't say that today after the Manchu you say it. Maybe a week later or something like hey you know people died in a lot of ways Baba blah now what he saying is I didn't know that I'm a scientist I don't I wasn't aware of the emotional impact thank you for telling me the emotional impact and I'm sorry that I hurt people's feelings which to me is totally legitimate especially coming from who he is and what what I would think the scientific mindset is now there is some people like exactly what you said they decided you're a terrible person for saying it so that apology isn't enough there's nothing he could do but see that there's certain people right there's nothing you can do that's going to change their mind you know you you look at look at the Obama birth certificate rights or even when the birth certificate came out there's a certain percentage of the people that are still like what now that's fake like there was no way he was ever going to be American to these people already did you know are you you travel you know like I treat you know there's certain groups like you ain't going to get them write their minds made up in their in their bubble they're in there whatever it is and they are surrounded by like-minded people like you said like this is the disadvantage of the internet right the advantage of the internet is all of this information the disadvantages you find people who only think like you and you only talked to them and you build this bubble well and well yeah so there's a group of people a percentage I don't have you want to describe it that decided the moment he said that this is an unfeeling horrible person level I mean I sent you do my thing with it with the mass shootings I'm like listen we don't care we say week we care individual like it's very sad for that families to me that the worst part of a mass shooting is somebody went to Walmart that day they didn't know what's to be the last day tour life didn't ever going to see their family again Somebody went out to in in Ohio they didn't know they never come that's the tragic part in that is sad but in the grand scheme of things we don't do any that we don't you know we we say it doesn't work before we even try like there's nothing we do that changes even after Vegas when they said they were going to ban what was it called the bump stop or whatever it was that thing that helped shoot faster and then ultimately they didn't even band that you know so so is a society we say we care but we don't cuz we don't change anything you got to change something nothing changes if nothing changes right over there where we're getting way off track here but with the outrage thing did not reach me she delivered truth with no emotion did he said horrific Lee I mean he was talking about the tragedy yeah thing is it's just people are looking to be upset oh absolutely absolutely people look for for something to be mad about or something to be outraged about and that you know what that takes away from it takes away from real outrage yes right if you're outraged everyday then you know then okay so what's really outrageous because I'm going to be set I'm going to be upset at a scientist for giving me scientific data what do I want yet I guess the timing was the issue was just giving you all sorts of different horrific deaths that occur all throughout the country and I think on that same weekend there was some impressive number of people that was shot and killed in Chicago like yeah Chicago Chicago's and the thing is you know people say what what about the gun laws and it's like yeah but they're all you got to do is go to Indiana like you go 2 hours away and you can get whatever you want just so you know that's the that's the thing so so I can't you know what are we going to set up borders and check every car coming into Illinois can't you can't do that yet it's it's but yet his thing I think was a time and I'm like you that didn't offend me I get what he was saying and this is schitts can't offend you if your rational human a can of fania unit you know what bothers me when people pretend to be ignorant of something and they're not how so what when people like like for example with this like there's something like oh we can use this to to create some it's like against Neil deGrasse Tyson or over that it's generally it's generally politicians do it right when they they say something and it like oh I didn't know that was offencive alright I guess you did but you know your followers didn't you see what I mean like you can document shootings right so that the whole thing of saying that Trump's tweets had nothing to do with it yes I did just now they didn't directly but yeah it did normalize and this guy use the same language of the you know Invasion etcetera so you can't say that it's completely unrelated you know I mean you can't you can't don't pretend and again it's not saying directly but a but you can't pretend there's no connection right now quotes there are people who are intelligent enough to know that but they'll say no so there's no game it's like yes there is and you know there is don't feign ignorance that's what I mean in dating a really f*****-up one was that guy's an Elizabeth Warren supporter who actually wrote about gun control I mean he was just a horrific homicidal f****** psychopath and you have to have some there has to be something wrong with you to do that you like even you know eat regardless of your political beliefs has to be something wrong with you but you can be sparked or you can be egged on by the words of of leaders or political people are powerful people in middle of influence perfect way to put it yet people have been to and that's why I think people of influence have to be responsible in what they say yeah you know but but this but Neil deGrasse Tyson this is a different thing I think this is just a case of a scientist pointing out information without you know like like you know you were talking about earlier dorks nerds whatever you want to say to do where it's like that what it's just information I'm not trying to be emotional people like well you have to be when you have to disconnect you even though you're from a lab environment you have to understand not everyone is one of the more uncomfortable things about today with social media as if there's a bunch of people that are really just they're just authoritarian there there they demand certain types of behavior and they do so under the guise of compassion they do so under it like they're trying to enforce the way people communicate like the Neil deGrasse Tyson thing there's no indication whatsoever that he was minimizing the valid s but I'm pretending that he's doing so there was some people who believe he did but there are a lot of people pretending to be play voice is Alonzo too many words too many people out there spewing again that's the date we speak of the positive in the negative video of the the the middle the comments voices the D reasonable voices at least heard of course now that's Facebook right Facebook's algorithm favors outrage so if you are on Facebook and you get upset about abortion that's kind of s*** you're going to get in your feet right to get mad about climate change they going to get a lot of climate change talk goddamn that make people nuts in the bubble you don't get to hear the other side you know an end and it's not even it's the reasonable part of the other side you know what I mean like politically yeah I'm left I have friends who I called reasonable Republicans and I could talk to a reasonable Republican can't talk to a crazy Republican write-in okay if you if you say that the mass shootings are based on transgender marriage and we can't talk we we got nothing like I'm sorry I can't work with you but if you say that taxes should be lowered to stimulate the economy in blah blah blah that we can talk about that yeah we can talk about that unit you know I mean that's that's that's the difference and you know and just just like on the left look I believe in the environment this and that but now if you're asking me to give up gasoline we may have a problem I may not be ready to go that far just yet</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now we're getting to the end of your our here so climate change is obviously an enormous issue for our country and for the world what would could be done and what do you think you can do as president that can somehow another slow down this this process a personal we have to have a president who won like Trump believes in science than I do and what the scientist to telling us symmetrically it is that we have fewer than two used to Transformer Energy System or else they will be irreparable Damage Done mellitah country but to the world now climate change is not just an American issue so we could do tomorrow to all the right things but of trying to rush her an Indian recipe Brazil and Africa does not do the right thing you know when I'm going to make the progress we need so here is what we have to do in my view number one we have to tell the fossil fuel industry that they are short-term profits and they make the short-run profits are not more important than the future of this planet I don't think that's a hard sell to make you cannot keep producing a product which is destroying the planet in the United States and around the world so by saying that you're saying you would have to move a we would have to move consciously away from fossil fuels know if so what's it like in if we do that how do you tell the fossil fuel companies to tell them you can't sell fossil fuels anymore by the way in the midst of that we do what we call is a adjust transition the guy out on the oil rig today simply wants to feed his family in the coal miners today want to feed their families and we're not going to leave them I'm a co-worker probably the strongest per worker record of any member of the Congress that is not my intention to throw these guys out on the and women out on the street and ignore the pain that they will go through we are proposing billions of dollars to rebuild those communities and make sure that those guys and women get new jobs so when I just discarding people in the fossil fuel industry but ultimately the product that they are producing which is now called in the mission is destroying the planet so we have to move away from fossil fuels in a very bold way into Energy Efficiency right now in my own state of Vermont that all over this country there are buildings which are incredibly wasteful windows we don't have the insulation we don't have the roofing the doors that we need to keep the buildings warm in the winter and cool in the summer and we can create just an incredible number of jobs just retrofitting outbuildings second of all we need to move very aggressively to sustainable energy like wind and solar in California doing a good job with when I was doing a job Texas doing a good job we got to do much more solid or easy potential output prices old is dropped in recent years and we are going to not only transform the energy system in our own country in the world in working with Rosharon in China because in this issue we are in this together and here's my dream and maybe this may be a utopian dream the world right now is spending a trillion and a half dollars on weapons of Destruction designed to kill each other and maybe just maybe if we had a kind of leader and I hope to be that leader who says the world instead of spending a trillion how tall is killing each other maybe we'll use those resources to transform the global Energy System and save the planet broke his and her grandchildren that's the golden I have these these ideas sounds great but in the competitive environment of global politics how would you convince Russia or China or any of these countries to do something that would put them in some sort of a competitive disadvantage if we do not do that in 50 a hundred years everybody's going to be terrible this event no I'm saying that I'm not telling you that tomorrow what's going to happen but you got to make the cakes gluten is a dictator I dislike him intensely in Ochi in China very what are canceled what's up with that crazy people and presumably they have concern about their kids and their grandchildren this is a planet on The Siege I don't want to become a science fiction you won't see in the movies the media racing toward or blow up there what do we do 41 after prohub alright we were faced with a war in the East with China war in the West in Europe with Hitler within two years the United States are transformed its economy to address and win the war basically into a three-year Kyrie industrialized number we can do it we can leave the world that's what we have to do so in your eyes we have to look at the economy almost as if the same kind of threat or excuse me the environment it's the same kind of threat as Nazi Germany and act together look if you asked the defense the bomb us the CIA UFT prevents people all over the world tell us what the great national security threat is you know what it is is climate change there's a lot of people that are skeptical this how would you convince that mean this is a big part of the problem right this will give us a narrative that you hear from a lot of people that do you know climate change is not a proven science and climate change is a hoax and when this is something is repeated over and over again and I'm sure some of it has to do with lobbyists and some of it has to do with the merchants of doubt they go out there and see the world with disinformation to try to increase their profits and key I need to practice as if they're currently enjoying it was your what I'm thinking about you listen to us with mold with the most but I can remember tobacco and cigarette ads on television the fossil fuel industry is lying right now and the president of the United States is either too stupid to understand what the scientist. Element or he is lying as well climb what you look I am not to sign this is not my idea I listen to the scientist the debate is long over climate change is Real by God look what's happening around the world has the warmest month in in the modern history of the world why was like the warmest alike or warmest month in in the modern history of the world like ice is melting heat waves in Europe all right just look out the window at what's going on so this is not Bernie Sanders talking this is the scientific Community climate change is real it will only get worse if we do not act boldly to cut carbon emissions</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> no on the subject of drugs marijuana is obviously a big issue in this country and we've seen many states make it recreational including this one what do you think could be done and what should be done to have this across-the-board especially federally you know I'm there's a guy that I have on the podcast coming up soon his name is John Norris and he wrote a book on the cartels growing marijuana illegally all over this country and selling it especially particularly in California now because it's a misdemeanor because it's do recreationally in selling it with all sorts of horrible pesticides on it all sorts of like very infected deadly chemicals all of this because it's not federally legal because we can't have sanctioned license companies doing an ethical job of growing something that any responsible law-abiding person should be able to consume okay let me see this one I ran for president for the Democratic nomination in 2000 16 I talked about a broken criminal justice system which ends up having in the United States more people in jail than any other country we have more people jailed in China does which of the Communist was I return country and what I call for them and I call for now is the legalization of marijuana in America right now you have a federal law is called a controlled substance act he has heroin is marijuana there at the same level that is insane heroin is a killer drug you're going to argue the pluses and minuses a marijuana but I don't want to eat heroin so we have to end that that's what I will do is president of the United States I believe we can do that through executive order and I will do that second of all we have now is number of states and I'm very proud I talked about it during 2016 but seemed kind of radical the need to legalize or decriminalize marijuana the way it blows my mind the drive to Nevada I think you're even California Seaside corporations by I will not run it for years ago people getting arrested for doing that is being destroyed the records show if you were arrested have a criminal record for selling marijuana that is being expunged in that is the right thing to do. We can argue about the pluses and minuses I'm not a great fan of of drugs other people smoke marijuana couple of time didn't do much from the other people I guess have different interests a couple times people got different experience I'll brush or the other problem is of course with illegal drugs comes get this horrible cycle particularly in inner cities where you have people that are incarcerated for illegal drugs illegal drugs seem to be the only way out the hard drugs when we're talking about cocaine and all these other drugs how how does one stop that and would you ever consider legalized all drugs are decriminalizing touching on a real tragedy and when we talked about criminal justice in America we have over two million people in jail they are disproportionately African-American Latino in Native American and here's what I think I think of the wealthiest country in the history of the world what we have got to do instead of building more jails and lock more people we really do have to invest in our young people especially young people in distress communities words that mean if we can and we can do this with the proper amount of resources make sure the kids and I dropping out of school if you drop out of school today you know so you drop out in u.s. second or third year of high school you don't have an education do not have any drops killed and the answer is you will you'll get in trouble self-destruct it makes so much more sense from a human perspective protecting our people as well as a financial situation has been 80 billion dollars he had to invest in these gets what does it mean it means making sure they get the education that they need paying attention having a good schools making sure that they get the jobs that are out there doing job training there was a principal in a school and Southern Vermont I'll never forget what she said was a working-class school and she said bring I love these kids I am not going to let them drop enchant a mentoring program just watching the kids will mostly at risk so that they would not end up going through the cracks and getting into trouble that's what we should be doing is a nation and when we do that we invest in the kids we got them jobs we going to vegetation the likelihood is that got the likelihood of them falling in the bad ways is significantly reduced the all those things sound great the uncomfortable reality about drugs though is that when drugs are illegal criminal sell them and there's obviously a need for drugs in not necessarily need but demand for drugs is a demand for trucks in this country that's absolutely fueling Mexican cartels and illegal drug Runners inside this country mean there's there's a lot of that how do you how do you curve that if drugs are illegal but you're raising a deep question the opioid epidemic is interesting because there's so much of it that's coming legally that's not the cartels that's the pharmaceutical industry is illegal yes why is it that so many people are turning to drugs to alcohol by the way and I don't mean to drink tonight but I mean serious alcohol problems and tragically to Suicide we now have for the last three years something that a historical never happened before in modern history and that is I would like to expectancies actually going down and this is hitting all over the country but especially getting rural areas and what the doctors are saying is that these are diseases of Despair despair so you're in West Virginia here in rural Ohio replace Vermont any place and the job you used to have earning a decent living is now in China your kid can't afford to go to college maybe you can afford Healthcare you got nothing to look forward to under that scenario drugs become alcohol becomes a way out then at the worst case scenario is suicide so I think what we're talkin about is why is this happening open Google Earth and how can we how can we re-establish hope and optimism in the American people and that gets back to a lot of other issues it means if people have Healthcare is a right that will certainly play a role in this Lena Walker to the doctor when they need but it also means that people need decent jobs to pay them a living wage at man who have to rebuild rule America we have to rebuild communities in urban America it means that we have to have a great educational system and people that all that's great Bernie that's Utopia it is not utopian this is something that in the wealthiest country in these through the world we can afford and we should be doing rather giving creating a situation where Amazon pay zero in federal income taxes so to answer your question as add appointment and again I'm not here to tell you I have all the answers but there are a lot of people out there who have basically given up hope and for people are just drugs is is the alternative so what you're saying is centrally is that if we can do something to mitigate the spare then we'll do something to at least stop some of the demand for these these eleague I believe I just look like smoke if I am optimistic if I'm excited about going to work tomorrow and I'm seeing my kid doing great in school and you know when I get sick I can go to the doctor's office and have a sense of community my downtown is not hold water. Because businesses with left but we haven't you have a community yeah at least stop some of the demand for these these eleague I believe that is the case if I am optimistic if I'm excited about going to work tomorrow and I'm seeing my kid doing great in school and you know when I get sick I can go to the doctor's office and have a sense of community my downtown is not hold water. Because businesses have left but we haven't we have a community yeah those like the strong likelihood is there will be less diseases of Despair and drugs other than we currently singing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now right now we are a week of not even a week out just a few days away from to mass shootings in a row and whenever these things happen there's all these people that want action but nobody knows exactly what to do this calls for gun control this calls for mental health reform just calls for me what if anything can be done to stop these things from happening and how have you sat down and tried to come up with some sort of a solution and is there a solution look I would be lying to you if I told you I had a magical answer I don't and this is such a horrific situation I hope you know we were in any way we had a town meeting we're in the batter actually in Las Vegas when El Paso happened and we just tell me and I said let's take a moment of silence remember the victims of pray for the survivors literally the next day another Park Las Vegas I have to do it again and I said I can't believe that just yesterday we did this I have to do it again this is I don't know what the words my friend assault weapon shooting up people and that we almost become to accept this as a normal part of American life is as incredible as it is just totally demoralizing alright so here's what I think there's no magical answer and but let me tell you what I think first of all this is the reality the reality is that today as we speak there are approximately 100 million guns in America that we have more guns than we have people we have between five to ten million assault weapons and an assault weapon as you know is a military-style weapons designed to kill human beings kind of rapidly so that's and then on top of that we have again nothing to be proud of but we have a number of mentally unstable people people but whatever reason I walk in the streets that suicidal the homicidal that we have I think the answer is and I'm not the guy to invent all these ideas but some of what we have to do first pool if you want to own a gun in America you have got to look we have got to know that you are a stable person in that means that we need to expand the background checks that currently exists okay so we got to know did you beat up your wife have you committed crimes etc etc what is the state of your mental health don't make that Universal number to right now that there is a background check if you walk into a gun show it does look into a gun shop but you can buy guns in various States at a gun show and you don't have to do any of that I thought you ought to go to what country you sell me a gun I don't have to I don't have to do that I can today legally walk into a gun show pass the background check and buy a Dozen guns workout and sell them to criminal elements who will use them for bad things so I can go as our issues that most Americans believe we have got to deal with him we can go out to lie I happen to believe and I believe this for 30 years that we should not be selling or Distributing assault weapons in the country they are weapons of mass destruction in a sense they kill people rapidly As we soar and I thank God by the way when we talked about both Dayton in El Paso thank cops with that very pretty quickly and did an incredible job cuz I thought guy had walked into the nightclub there could have been dozens and dozens more people killed in hit it within a few minutes. I happen to believe that we should not be selling what Distributing an assault weapons in this country that's in my view. So I believe in a ban on assault weapons and I think we have got to begin thinking about when we have five to ten million we have to think about a strong licensing procedure in terms of who owns this is 11 so that's the sum of what I think there are many other things but those are some of the ideas that are out there now the legal gun owners who are law-abiding citizens who would never in a million years think about going around shooting people but they love guns they hear this kind of stuff about like Banning assault rifles Banning assault weapon they don't even like the term assault weapons right they liked it refer to them as our individual names for whatever they are these people feel like this is an inexorable part of being an American that you should be able to own a gun it's written into our Bill of Rights as written into our way we where this country was founded it's the second amendment what do you say to those people that don't that don't want to give up their guns but it wouldn't do any want to protect themselves they feel like these guns are viable options to protect cells from criminals and Joe will be a senator from the state of Vermont and the state of Vermont is one of the most rural states in America every form that holds thousands and thousands of people around the woods hunting and something about a tradition I believe in it and I believe in the Second Amendment or the woman I asked of the, I think you're absolutely right 99.9% would never in a million billion years think of doing these horrible things but Hmong but we are living in I think that we're all going to have to make some concessions to the reality of what is going on in that is that there is a small number of call him what you want to pray for people who are prepared to do that you know we know which Grail you remember that terrible New Zealand I'm sorry that they the terrible shooting it at the mosque and they moved pretty quickly in an aggressive lights off. I wish I could and in the best of all possible worlds yeah any weapon you want help with insulin when not living in the best of all possible worlds with living in a world where was shocked Everyday by Haro so I agree we are living in a terrible situation there's hundreds of mass shootings a year now which is insane and if you look at the number in comparison to the rest of the world it's crazy like a big one in another country likes 3 mass shootings in a year we had more than 270 but how would you implement something like this well we argue about banning assault weapons have been done in 1994 we banned assault weapons I believe I believe was for 10 years that man was undone by Republican majority and it didn't I'm not suggesting by the way than anything tomorrow that would radically change everything can I prep my remarks by telling I don't have a magical solution you got hundreds of millions of guns out that you have people who should not be owning these guns who get settled by god-knows-what and and do terrible things all we can do is the best that we can do but to say we can't do anything I think it's a real disservice to the Mercantile think of something else that bothers me you know in addition to the horror of seeing people lying on the street that is what doing to the children of this country and I think we underestimate that I have seven grandchildren and in for them and for kids will love this country you're going to see The Falls coming kids going back to school you're going to see him schools All Over America drills are this is what you do if somebody walks into the school all right you're going to hide under here you go over their kids a couple months ago but the young people in my school are increasingly frightened terrified about what could happen in school think about what this the trauma the trauma of what this gun violence is doing so I think what is Americans they ain't no easy answers here by Pitbull going to have to come together in and figure this one out and do the best The Weeknd no would that mean forcibly removing these guns from people's homes FBI knocking on somebody's door wasn't taking that that's not what we do in the market if you have 400 million guns already out there and I'm building more every year right now as we speak gun manufacturers or make money manufacturers are making more guns cuz it's happening right now so if those guns already exists there's more than enough oh yeah how would you stop will get I think look I do think there should be a ban on assault weapons so that means that manufacturers would not be able to produce ourselves Nazi military obviously obviously yeah okay so you do in your point is well taken if you have 200 million guns out there you know there are approaches no one has any magical solution that I've giving you something else but I didn't mention and that is the role of gun manufacturers use that if you want a gun manufacturer and you are selling a hell of a lot of guns to a gun store in an area which normally would not think these guys know what city is by what what towns by comedy guns and if suddenly there is a tremendous demand you got to be thinking and be why it's so many guns doesn't reflect the population in the area you got to deal with that issue with a gun on this cup have to take some responsibility besides the guns any of this what happens if someone has to be insanely mentally depraved this the only way and many of them are medicated and many of them are on pharmaceutical drugs they have been since they were children including amphetamines like adderal and Prozac and all this different stuff that has varied effects on the human brain what could be done what would you done to analyze this to find out what the cause and effect are and to try to figure out what role and how much these drugs are responsible to respond by saying that goes without saying that we have a mental health crisis in America and for whatever reason they are all whole lot of people in the nature of our Healthcare System new back to healthcare I guess I just talked to a woman literally last night and we had a a town meeting and she said this is unbelievable she said running I was in Las Vegas when the turbo shooting took place okay and now I am and I can understand this perfectly I'm seeing the Dayton and I'm seeing watching television El Paso and I'm cutting a PT PS PTSD reaction a woman called at my office in Burlington Vermont and she said I'm worried about my husband what he my brother was his brother what he might do to himself or somebody else we're looking for mental health counseling we can't find something that we can afford it so we need above and beyond gun violence we need and that's why I believe in Medicare for all mental health is Health Care you break your arm that's a health issue with a mental health is medical issues and we have got to make mental health counseling available to all people in this country when they need it. 6 months from now at a price they can afford it on the Medicare for old would be free so that's the only one number to your point about studying the impact of drugs on people's behavior and possibly resulting in Violet absolutely deserves to be funny we should be studying the impact of drugs in my view this is a Layman I'm not a psychiatrist I worry very much that we are over medicating kids in schools you know we have this deficit of deficient issue with your kids are running around in their active you know what I was a kid we used to run around later I worry about that whole business but your point is well-taken I think we need to study this issue and make sure that these drugs in fact I'm not causing kinds of reactions that we will regret Lee very very much that we are over medicating kids in schools unit we have this deficit of deficient issue with your kids are running around in their active you know what I was a kid we used to run around later I worry about that whole biscuits but your point is well-taken I think we need to study this issue and make sure that these drugs in fact I'm not causing kinds of reactions that we will regret

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let's talk about the education because the idea of free education is wonderful thing for people I mean the idea that you get out of college and you are in debt in an insane amount that you might have 10 20 years we have to pay back and and I know many people that are in those are real people who are getting their Social Security checks garnished right now here's some places it's literally a lifetime now a lot of that is me and Skyler in some way be preventable by what we're talking about here. How you would pay for it I mean I'll tell you exactly how would we pay for every idea that we have we paid for up and we pay for it by understanding that today we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality and we have many cases the wealthy and large corporations thing nothing but very little in taxes he was the issue in terms of Education 40-50 years ago you are now working working class person you graduated high school especially if it was a union around you can go out and get a job and making it the middle-class you could own your own home to get send your kids to school looking pretty good like to meet in the middle class 40 or 50 years later there's an explosion of Technology there's a growth in unfettered free trade and it is clear now that most people to make it into the middle class are going to need a higher education at college or maybe a call training in order to become a skilled worker it is insane to me to deny Working Class People in low-income people the opportunity to get that education because the cost of college has sought so over it I say is that a hundred plus years ago the American people said that we should have free public education I went to a public school my parents can pay a nickel went to kindergarten I went through the 12th grade pretty good education and Brooklyn New York all that I'm saying is the world has changed and high-school degree is not good enough anymore so expand that concept through college now guess what 50 years ago do you know how much the University of California very great University cost in terms of tuition-free what's it now state colleges all over the country with tuition was virtually free and then what happened for variety of political reasons States and the federal government started cutting back on higher education and put more more burden on the student with higher and higher tuition which is where we are today so all I'm saying is in the year 2019 2020 if I want working-class kids are going to go out and get the jobs that are out there they need a they need a higher education tuition-free in terms of the cancellation of debt which is my view you got 45 million people who are dealing with that I'll never forget this is where I really hit me I was in Burlington Vermont I had a meeting on an issue at a young woman comes up and she says she's a doctor she graduated Medical Practice I was in Iowa a young woman $400,000 a day this is not unusual for medical schools and in dental school and fifty thousand hundred thousand dollars we going to college while getting a master's degree we promised these young people decide to go to college. Well the answer is they have not been able to do that so what we have proposed in one piece of legislation of to use to make public colleges and universities discovery that will cost 2.2 trillion dollars long money over 10 PIAA. We do this through attacks on Wall Street speculation which will bring in 2.4 trillion Oz we bailed out Wall Street 11 years ago and by the way these are crooks on Wall Street who engaged in illegal Behavior taxpayers against my vote bail them out we can bail out Wall Street in what we can cancel public colleges Wall Street speculation what what exactly do you mean it will be a tax on all of the sale of attacks you people buy and sell the stocks and bonds all of them are the bring lot of tax on it and by the way it will have an impact on speculation by cutting back on the high-frequency trading between Elsie so you would just there is there's no current tax on the wrecked so you would put a small amount and that would do the job that would that would raise more than enough money it's a very small toy existing small how much it depends on the nature of the transaction but it's less than one-half of 1% really if you go bankrupt it doesn't matter you still do that and that that's kind of crazy I mean if you have a serious medical issue if you're held up whatever whatever have it's awful you go bankrupt most of those things are resolved but not student loans right to the end. Has to do with bankruptcy law which was passed against my boat and why you want bankruptcy and I should have mentioned about the Healthcare System a half a million Americans every single year go bankrupt because of medical bills with the campaign what's right what's to do you know I'm open mics I've been paid off my student debt because I'm going nowhere because the interest rates are high and I feel very much which is the case that they will start garnishing taking away my social security check taking money away from me so people are carrying this burden the result is that they can't in many cases get married and have kids they certainly can't bite home to Camp by a car they are really crushed white home to can't buy a car there really crushed by this debt and what was their part what did they do they try to get a higher education I've been pretty crazy and a lot of them when they do is higher education they're 18 years old magic making a decision when your brain isn't even fully formed can affect you for the rest of your life</div>

	<div> <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqzRRE23mxM"> Bernie Sanders on Raising Minimum Wage and Corporate Tax Loopholes | Joe Rogan </a>
		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> just talked to you about your supported by majority of the American people these are not radical ideas listless AAFES one step at a time cuz you mention a lot of important things are let's go with the minimum wage thing now the argument that I've heard about the minimum wage being raised to $15 an hour is it there entry level positions for high school kids for people that are just getting their feet wet in the marketplace to learn how to work they learn their making some money after school that they that if you charge the businesses have to pay $15 an hour to people like that to entry-level people that they won't be able to stay open what first of all they will be competing against each of your business, business and both of us have to raise our wages at the same level we both have the same burden so it's a brat spread across that is what my conservative colleagues will tell you the truth is I don't have it on this right in front of me young people do work at McDonald's in the minimum wage jobs a significant and majority of the workers are not kits they are often then I met them at McDonald's are they all workers who have children themselves when we work very hard to raise the minimum wage at Amazon and it Disney we put pressure on both of those companies and they did the right thing and when you talk to the people at Amazon who got that raise these are not kids these are people in there these aren't ordinary adults who cannot make it on 12 or 13 bucks an hour so I think the argument the old are old kids is not really quite awkward well not even that they're all kids but that if they are kids what would you think about making a minimum wage for someone under 18 that's different from a minimum wage of someone who's a legal adult I'm not I'm not put that I think we do it and look at many of these young people got to have their own beats I just thought young woman last night who is working going to college working full-time trying to take care of her family as well so I think that the minimum wage has not been raised in 10 years it is now $7.25 an hour which is clearly unacceptable cost of housing California love this country is rising Billy rapidly people can't afford health Camp College I don't think it's asking our employers too much to pay at least $15 an hour no I'm glad you brought up Amazon is the one that won the things that always freaks me out is when I find out that enormous corporations that make billions of dollars have tax loopholes where they literally pay no money how is that possible and how do you stop that it's the same thing as the truck companies how was it possible that we pay ten times more for insulin in this country and four other drugs than the other countries around the world so what is is the goal of major corporations in America it's the be deregulated as much as possible so in some cases that I can pollute our water our air environment is also not to pay any taxes Trump campaign is my tax plan is not going to benefit the wealthy it's going to benefit of working people while turns out over 10 years 83% of the benefit the end of the top 1% that's what these guys. call the ranking member on the budget Committee in the Senate and some guy came forward representing one of the big business organizations and this is Leroy agenda their agenda was to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and to do away with all corporate taxes so what you have right now that's that's what brand is about they want at all so is you indicated you have a company like Amazon owned by Jeff Bezos who happens to be the dinamarca worth 150 billion Amazon paid 0 in federal income taxes and it's not just him dozens of Corporations paid nothing will very very little and on top of all the night you got these guys able to stashed all over the world trillions of dollars trillions of dollars in the Cayman Islands in Bermuda and looks a burden of the tax agents that is insane and that is cut in why is legal Joe it is legal because they make the laws all right now on the heart and soul of how does it happen that on issue after issue the American people to working-class of this country want something nobody pays any attention to it but billionaires want something and it gets done and that has to do with a corrupt political system right now if you are the Koch brothers or some multibillionaire you say to the leadership of the Republican Party In some cases to the Democratic party but hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars coming from one or two people and here is my agenda I want tax breaks I want to trade system which will enable me to shut down in this country and go to China or Mexico and pay people that 2 bucks an hour I want to be able to do more pollution cuz I like all of this money I have to spend preventing pollution of the air of the water that's what I want you to do and by the way I'm worried about the deficit so you may as well cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid how many Americans actually believe that we should give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid very few that is both the Mitch McConnell and Mitch on the show that is exactly what he believes but that's ridiculous right if you just took away that we should get tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid very few that is talked to Mitch McConnell on the show that is exactly what he believes but that's ridiculous right and it seems that if you just took away those tax breaks the enormous amount of money that would come from those corporations having to pay their fair share would take care of lot of the expenses of all these things that you're proposing exactly</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what are what are the misconceptions of you cuz here's the here's the if you go to the knee-jerk conservative reaction you talk to people who are not interested in anyone that wants to be a Democratic Socialist they hear the name Bernie Sanders the negative implications are that you are somehow or another going to take their money right annoying to you yesterday and also that I missed the Maduro I'm a dictator or I'd love to and the truth is Joe that if you look at the issues that I can paint on it what I believe on they are really not terribly radical they exist in many countries all over the world for example just thought on health care if you'd like the idea that Healthcare is a human right not a privilege a radical idea but I don't think it is and the truth is we are the only major country are the only major country on Earth Healthcare to old people as a human right and get we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on Healthcare the function and you can argue with me if you want but the function of the current Healthcare System is not to provide quality care about it is to make tens of billions of dollars in profit for the drug companies and insurance companies that's the function if you go to Canada and I looked at the miles away from the Canadian border zero you got it you go to any doctor you want you don't have to take out your wallet and yet they guarantee Healthcare all of their people and they spend one half of what we cement that's kind of what I want to do and I don't think that that's terribly radical we have a program that which everybody knows it's called Medicare was started by Lyndon Johnson back in 1965 it is a popular program old and I want to do Over a four-year period is to expand it today eligibility age of 65 155 4535 everybody wait. That's about it and I want to expand benefits to include Dental Care Hearing Aids on eyeglasses as well that's better not to work do they have problems so what's the hurdle okay I'll tell you exactly what the earliest that hurdle is exactly the same thing as in every other aspect of Our Lives it's the power of money alright listen to this over the last 20 years the drug companies alone have spent four and a half billion dollars in 20 years on lobbying and campaign contributions that's what we're up against the knowledge and I mark my words short. Of time you will see TV ads California all over this country demonizing Bernie Sanders he wants to do this terrible thing to do we want to do that they have unbelievable amounts of money and politicians are frightened of that power give you one example back in 2016 I got involved here in a little way with an effort on the part of the nurses to control of the cost of prescription drugs in California may recall that if it was about one item in one State Hearing health do you know how much the drug companies alone spent at the feet that I bet they spent $131 on one Bal an item in one state last year the top 10 truck companies make 69 billion dollars a week ago I went to Canada with a number of Americans quit dealing with diabetes we bought insulin in Windsor Ontario for 1/10 price 10% of the same exact product being charged in America so you got brings the ring gauge in collusion and price-fixing who are incredibly greedy and the result is many elderly people many working people simply cannot afford the medicine they needed this is unbelievable and the reason for all of that stuff as we are the only country in the world that does not negotiate with the drug companies that they can charge you any price they want and that has to do with the fact that we don't have a National Health Care Program Medicare is not negotiating a touch that can really be implemented inside of four years I want you to think back think back joke in 1965 you had Linda Johnson is President and by the way this idea of national Healthcare this has been talked about literally since Teddy Roosevelt concept Healthcare is human rights breakable spot with the elderly were most impacted by by healthcare costs and sickness will start and they did in 1965 without the technology we have today they implemented Medicare 19 million people elderly people signed up in the first. So if you could spot a brand new program and have 19 million people sign up with a technology that is way way behind where we are today why can't we offer for you. Something expanded I don't think it's a a difficult operation so when you talk about the drug companies in the lobbyists and the enormous amount of money that they spend is this does this exist anywhere else other than United States lobbyists on that level in the reason you have is you have a National Health Care Program and so forth and they sit down and negotiate with the drug companies they have their own approach but every other major country on Earth you want this is a reasonable price tell me what your profits are with your expenditures off this is the price for us you can walk in you know if you have an illness you can walk into the pharmacy tomorrow and the price has been double do you say does bombas what happens if they just raised the prices they could do it any day they want any price they want lobbyists are in general when people talk about lobbyists attractive wow there's someone with enormous amounts of money using that money to gain influence and politicians and it shapes regular people that shapes Our Lives mostly in a negative way this is the way most people looking I'm not saying it's correct why why do we have that system in place like why do we have lobbies why is it legal for someone to spend exorbitant amount of money exorbitant amount of money to affect our civilization to affect the way our culture War yeah let's look like and I'll come back today in America you got three people only more wealth in the bottom half of the American society you don't see it on television to 92% listen to this over the last 30 years but 1% Casino 21 trillion dollar increase in their wealth the bottom half of America Cena 900 billion dollar decline in their wealth so what do you have in America today is a relatively small number of Eagle credibly wealthy to blend I deal with these guys everyday we can all talk about rich you don't know what rich is what multibillion-dollar operations are incredible power over our society and if you want the pharmaceutical industry billion dollars in profit was sitting around right now so I call right that's great how'd we do better next year what strategy do we have withdrawal of ads on we're going to work with other during the CNN debate that I participated in the debate Breitling little debate the drug companies in the insurance companies hadn't had telling how bad so-called how bad medicare-for-all would be so they and they use their power over politicians that use their power over the media onmedia to make sure that they make as much as I can profit but it's not any different with Wall Street it's not any different with the fossil fuel industry what the prison industrial complex things guys have wealth they have power and they could care less about the needs of working people in this country and that's the dynamic of American politics right now and then I will campaign look with taking them all on it and it makes a lot of people uncomfortable but we are taking on all of these entities and Olaf and all of their power and that's what a political revolution is about so the real problem seems to be that they have this strategy of unlimited growth not that they're not providing medication that people need to save their lives means obviously it important to have a pharmaceutical company cost right so there is good that they provide but the business aspect of it is where the problem lies right they have great researchers but if you check how they even spend their money they will tell you so all of them research the Bell Witch riding with chocolate cancel tackling diabetes Alzheimer's pictures of course they are but the bulk of their money is going off and will be called me to drugs that make modest changes in the drug which really doesn't improve people's well-being in order to make profit so the answer is yes we need obviously rigorous research and development and by the way your tax dollars all about tax balance walking goes to that research and we don't get the benefit of it in terms of lower prices so it's Joe it's a business model issue Exotics agreed issue and how would one stop that when you're dealing with this the kind of influence you talked about 69 billion dollars in a year I mean the resources they have how would you stop that kind of what we called a 64 on American history and you about the real changes that have taken place in society you think about the labor movement and working-class people standing up and saying to their employers when I going to be treated like animals anymore you can hire and fire at you can't work Us in 15 hours a day we think we deserve dignity and you think about the growth of the labor movement but I like saying we're going to end segregation and racism in this country the about the women's movement a hundred years ago women in America didn't even have the right to vote thing about the gay rights movement about the environment the only way to change takes place is when Ordinary People come together and stand up and fight and say that the status quo is not working and that's what I believe and that's what we're trying to do so with the message of our campaign is its us not me cuz I can't and stand up and fight to say that the status quo is not working and that's what I believe and that's what we're trying to do so with the message of our campaign is its us not me cuz I can't do it alone let me be very honest with you are elected president tomorrow I can't do the things that I would like to do that I'm campaigning on unless millions of people working with me to tell the corporate Elite that they cannot get it all</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you get frustrated by the time constraints of the debates are absolutely it's you shouldn't even call them what they are is a reality TV show in which you have to come up with a sound bite and all that stuff it is the meaning of the candidates and it's the meaning to the American people explain the complexity of Healthcare in America are in 45 seconds nobody can have you to try to do you know I think the DNC is in a difficult position they have 20-plus candidates they want to give everybody a fair shot which is the right thing to do and then if you don't have 10 candidates up on the stage what you do but there are other ways that we got to do it because the issues facing this country or someone normous and in some cases so complicated nobody in the world can honestly explain them in 45 seconds what encourages people to do is to come up with Sound by to do absurd things of I yelled and scream on the show I took my clothes off we got a lot of publicity right thoughtful answer to a complicated question it's not so sexy for the video we don't even have a chance to reply to it was so ridiculous to have something that's not put all those people in marijuana did you laugh about it did this happen did that happen all these different things with was evidence withheld that's how these are a long conversation but it takes us to another issue and that is a nation we do a pretty bad job in analyzing And discussing the serious issues facing our country and our immediate you a certain amount of time hours on television and use those hours anyway want one of 15 minutes just remember was Pro yes and people used to laugh at Ross Perot because he has to get up there with a chart with all this stuff and enemy and made fun of them but in fact you tried in his own way to explain his point of view to the American people if we need Siri the bought a chunk of Maritime and then plead his case another country's you don't have to buy that time but the obligation is if you are a network you're going to make that time free and available to candidates do you think that that's something that could be viable in America we could could you convince CBS and NBC and ABC to go along with something like that have to pass legislation to make Facebook and all that jazz with why bother doing it in this particular medium that has an inherent time constraint the internet has revolutionized politics in many ways good ways we use our social media I will email list which is very large weed everyday was sending out stuff another candidate so doing it the same way my television still has a very important role to be clean I'm sure it does but I mean form like you online let you can do right here right now you can't get that on television what you could I mean if you want to interrupt you every 15 minutes sivananda interrupt you every 15 minutes no no no no what I'm saying about is it is in what goes on in other countries if I'm not mistaken I don't hold me to this I think in the UK you remember the Labour party or candidate is 30 minutes of time and you do with it as you want to speak 30 minutes on health care whatever it maybe you can do them reeling and they don't interrupt commercial</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> a lot of people that they learn how to deal with life through the struggle Jiu-Jitsu because the struggle training is so much harder than most of the struggles that use face in your daily life it makes you more accustomed to dealing with uncomfortable positions for you I might my other daughter had some health issues I get to in the morning something like that did not call the doctor and said look at got to go and get these inhaler something at the pharmacy man I was wearing my pajamas driving crazy to the pharmacy and as I'm walking in half a guy walking out and bumped his show them Miners and Son of ad is a few and that man to turn them on when I find some go home and I did not recognize him but he keeps staring at me and I approach a how are you I betrayed Jesus before as I do remember me did you train here before no I bumped into in the pharmacy thank you for hurting me I can walk away from something like that then I feel sorry for the guy I'm not going to sign all my friend of him know I'm not afraid it's just a fact I'm saving him to get hurt today he's one of my best friends he's my lawyer my dear friend is being trans used for she's that I'm almost 20 years left and I want the difference to between Jiu-Jitsu and kickboxing cuz it kickboxing you you can only hurt somebody you can't really like hold on then we go hey hey hey come down and employers electron to figure out what to do is like he's fine he's fine calm down but Nomad didn't hurt him he just held onto him and then basically just mounted up and grabbed a hold of his wrist and was controlling men went when we say she was Yeats was a gentle warrant we mean that yes give you the choice to choose to hurt someone or not signs that that person had something already going on their life right and we choose not to our time and it's funny what you need you to tournaments and then we go like how we going to pass their self and back in the days in Brazil have some fun time to go to a nightclub in fight breaks through and he react breakfast sandwiches you too but not hurt anybody and not because we choose or somebody provoke know we get people coming towards us nevermind biggest guys in the place that we just make sure like men with take them down hold choke somebody out but no scratch and underhand those people becoming students of our school right cuz all those little kids can do that to us right and that's one way that's funny in the 80s that you just became even bigger with some of the altercation on the street we convinced the person that we just fought we just choked to come and become a shipment didn't like that day and then I'm coming in that they feel humiliated but at least they feel thankful that you didn't injure them for sure enough to give you that sense of control that you have you have that rises where I was going to be a street fight with someone and they're swinging if it's strong person has a strong person they're good athletes have strong arms and then they throwing punches at me if I get hit I'm in trouble no matter who you are if you get hit you in trouble most likely I won't get hit if I know how does it how to fight and I keep my hands up and I move right but if I get hold of you you're not doing anything to me like there's a difference between like someone is untrained and some was trained like if a Jiu-Jitsu black belt grabs a person and gets off actually gets control of them there's no lucky you're not going to luckily submit me you know it's not going to happen but you can luckily you can hit somebody can happen in a street fight someone has a little bit of sperm and they have power and there's a strong person they can hit you as much more day and that's the only and we also want to train and was the only opportunity PowerPoint and has his before we closed at this time that's the danger zone and if you think for a second a lot of things that we do on the ground in Russia to you just bring those two people are panda close the distance is the same thing in a lot of people today they don't do the same they trying to fight standing on their head the distance is the same thing in a lot of people today they don't do the same they trying to fight standing when they hold different than when you're on the ground the way you move your lies that way play God is the same thing when it's standing work on the people's body as a whole has a sweep to make somebody fall and and we learned that when we get close to someone we make this size and I'll be affected as much as could if you have a distance</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what do you think about this new trend that you're saying like you saw it particularly coming out of John danaher and Dean Lister with the leg locks like leg locks are so big and in Jiu-Jitsu competition now when we learn Jiu-Jitsu and still today we will not learn anything related to lags until we get a blue belt the main reason that behind these were to be able to let you develop guard concern anything just to learn how to move your hips and butt wipes and hugs Putlocker something very effective but if I show you right away I might be stopping some of the evolution of your game or the other birthday to train with that he can learn to make even better his foot lock right that's why we hold back until people get up when you chew into G2 to learn leg locks but you didn't did nokie everybody searching a hurry then a lot of snow geese Cruiser first thing people wants to lend a hand when I let him hook and sheets with ghee I want to learn Amber wants to go straight to the lag they give people want to go straight to dance but I think particularly because of the success of these legs lockers against high-level competition finding that which you also will force guys to pass also be on the legs only but definitely work in severe danger let people wrap their legs around your leg hook you there then not everybody can get out of that and if you don't tap your going to get your knee ripped apart for sure and that's the real problem with leg locks is it so many guys wind up with pretty devastating knee injuries did you shoot Sue was for safety with did practice but the competition does not allowed you got understand in the eighties if you have any problem your career is over right-to-know surgery that really was emailing record today is different the medical side make possible for you to put a brand new knee over there without stem cells is very very difficult to fix those unless you get the menisci like I'd part of my meniscus removed and my left knee and then you see them and you want to train for longevity and you can understand Chuy's I think some of those things should be kind of fun was creating a pro-league into this receipt to World cuz a lot of people they get hurt before even they learn what is U2 is that's why my only concern is the danger all those who hooks in leg locks does if you get somebody who knows he might have or he might roll to the right side even though a lot of guys to get hurt yeah but if you hold somebody who doesn't have much experience in one of those straps it's for sure injury they brought the wrong way and rip it apart themselves even if you don't squeeze it's because they don't know what you do and that's my view off as an instructor today you're not ready for a legs yet I go to the Nugget don't go to the naga tournament yet you have to learn first in the stand for your own safety and also I want them to develop guard cuz when we get tired with pool guard when you get tired lie down to sleep you don't sleep standing you sleep when you lie down and Juice uses the same thing you get tired you going to pull guard and that's one of the ways I see some of my students in the tournament they get tired he's a top guy send his that pulling guard and he's tired he's already Winston that's why you have to have a good guard just to survive and rest to be able to continue we surprised though that this noogie leg joaquin's her taking off the way I did it because of the success of have so many guys doing extremely well in some of the guys that come from the new Gigi originally doing so well some of the guys that come from the G world doing Yogi dipping find some challenges to adjust to jet lag I think it in a way you have two ways that simplify cuz if you get somebody in a foot locker lock lock there we go in at the same time you complicate cuz you see a lot of Scramble now and a lot of injuries he's going to get hurt but I'm is the development and evolution of the the grappling world and I think it's amazing that sooner or later somebody's going to find a ways to protect better and better and better and better they were forced people to move on what you seen that I think now is against each other the kind of stalemate and you seen them winning by rear-naked choke or armbar again they're not using that against each other I do now I need more than that to yeah they're using them to sweep or the use them to set up other things they're trying to exploit other holes like maybe they concentrate too much on leg lock so then they they're open to arm bars or chokes I remember when when I learned in the beginning we have foot lock eyes the last resource let's see I'm fighting a guy and I'm not able to submit him that's how we used to have in the 80s look at this is my deadly weapon if everything that I do is not working today is the opposite my first shot is Footlocker in the mall the way it's not working I'm going to choke him yeah you see so few foot locks and MMA it's interesting right is he like you're so few figure 4 foot locks boxing MMA it's interesting right you see like you're so few figure for footlocks to get hit your face your arms are both around that you can get</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> we'll talk about Russia collusion and they talk about we kind of lost our way right and you know everybody's kind of guilty about whether it's Mueller and his investigative team with his Congress or whether to the general public you'll kind of lost away over the past couple of years imagining somehow that the big story here was Trump collusion right now that was a political Dodge right that was a shell game that was being played on us it was the big story is what did Russia specifically do what exactly did they do how do they do it how successful were they show us some case studies of a specific examples that's what investigative team should have been doing for two years and then deliver that information and keep throwing it out at the public and keep talking to the public about it I guarantee you there's a Gru and others happy that we didn't do that right because capabilities to do it again so I guess that's why I keep beating on this it I don't think we really focused our attention to where we needed to because we all get lost in this political b******* and I think it's so easy to spend these narratives and to get people upset about anything right and there I feel I feel like a lot of these are test cases like they're trying to see like what happens when we spin up the store how how outraged do they get at that story will look at it look at this issue of racism that thing gets thrown out there now to the point where it sits you know I hate to say it but it's it's almost losing its its meaning in a sense right they just keep hammering away and can any anybody they disagree with and I'm talking about the hard left gressive you're racist right it's not possible you could possibly disagree on policy and I like that whatever is that the squad I'll give a s*** about you know where they're from I care about the fact that their policies from my perspective other people aren't sure love them let you know I screwed up and I'm screwed up about their policies as well I'm not a Democratic Socialist right so I I have a problem with everything from you look at their the green new deal right in this idea that we going to roll this out and about the economic impact window or I think what they're doing is they're just they're playing to live there a base and they're doing it successfully and people hear about it nobody wants to be righteous if we want to make sure if I care about the environment grass get rid of admissions that'll be a great idea and whether it's that are open borders and the idea that somehow or you know do I think we're running concentration camps down south for detainment centers and you know what you want what you want to make it better will great let's let's do what your job is let's make some changes to the to the to the immigration rules and laws let's put some more money down there and make conditions a little bit better this things we could get it in terms of concrete steps but we don't we don't seem to want to do that we seem to want to just throw shoot around at each other and and I but the open border singers is this is worrisome guy named John Norris was just on my friend Steve rinella podcast of the meat-eater podcast and he is a warden is a game warden and one of the things that they had to deal with somewhere along the line was they had to become enforcers for illegal drug drug drug marijuana growing these establishments in public lands in National Parks so these guys that were supposed to be just catch people with too many trout on a Stringer are now being forced to stop illegal grow-ops and it's all cartel members and what he saying is that 80 90% of all of the marijuana that gets old illegal in this country in the Midwest and all these different places where it's illegal is coming out of these grow-ops and a lot of it is Tainted with dangerous pesticides because these guys are trying to direct actually using poisons to keep animals from eating the marijuana so these kids what the f*** is that they're buying this pot from these illegal places know it's testing this stuff you don't know what the f*** you're getting you very well but could be smoking pot poisoning you here in California to the point where you can spend all day on an ATV and then still not you know get to the end of one of his plots of land and a plot of land and anyway he's had those incidents such a massive piece of property that ate a bit of small element from a cartel will set up a grow spot there and you know they'll camouflage it's very well. They bring in the piping for the water cuz it has a huge amount of water job in it it's it's it is fascinating I feel like we should take those guys and reprogram them as well as carry a hundred pounds of piping on his back and walk 8 miles into the backwoods that's a f****** industrious individual you got to lure him away from the cartel with a better deal yeah that guy work for a corporation 3 miles of hose on his back that's work that's not evil that's what I tell my boys is evil spawn I think it's in the short-term it could be more lucrative got a good eye open borders not a good idea a lot of bad people that are getting in already and it's not it's not a stretch this is not if anybody they would imagine this to be a stretcher or it's going to take offense to this every nation maintains borders Every Nation maintain some elements of immigration controls and Border Protection the idea that we shouldn't of the we should somehow feel exceptionally bad about it is is I don't quite understand that mentality feel bad when we someone who's just a poor mother was trying to come over to America to get a better job because she's stuck in Guatemala and socks over there and there's no opportunity whatsoever for her to excel right that's a different animal than someone who is a member of some f****** terrible cartel gang that comes over at how do we differentiate and how do we make it so that that woman who's a mom can come over here right how do we make it to its legal that's a real question what and that's when I was heard about immigration controls immigration process and regulations and policy and then nothing ever gets done and so maybe and again I think one of the things that's interesting about Trump is SSS Strange's as it is the environment I mean maybe the fact that he is disruptive sometimes doesn't seem to give a s*** maybe that's a good thing cuz it gets us talking and get to talkin in the area that we haven't before and in ways that we have before so maybe that result maybe like the Chinese at the Publix just going to wait for him to go and then it will get back to business as usual that may happen differentiate between someone is coming in illegally because they want a better life versus someone is coming in illegally because they're literally going to commit murder and sell Fentanyl and deal you know right it incredible harm to whatever Community they wind up in and they are a member of MS-13 and they're going to there's both things are going on at the same time and you're a heartless person if you don't want that lady with a child from Guatemala to come over here and do better and she's probably going to work as hard if not harder than any good old-fashioned red-blooded American it's over here trying to make their way through this world and why should we be able to have this opportunity when they can't win the beautiful things about America right it's like if you a poor person that you live in Baltimore you can get your s*** together and get out and you can move to maybe Silicon Valley can move somewhere where there's more Prosperity is more opportunity and you poor people in Baltimore sure they're all out the I heard there's a sort of the word what is the word station gestation of rat infestation infestation when you talkin about certain neighborhood crime and rats you still your racist democratic this. Of time because it's so intense there was clearly discussions within wherever the DNC or elsewhere that this is our policy we are going to push this and we're just you just keep hammering that work racist racist racist no matter what and it's going to stick and it and it does because you just get hit by that hammer and you kind of you're staring into the light you don't know how to respond so answer but I think it's b******* because it's like calling everybody and not see it see how it loses its its its importance in its and its meaning and then you know anyway it's it's a it's a strange strange time but I think you can do both you can you can take care of that that woman with the kids or kids and and you can also look at the issue of border security right and enhance your ability to understand who's coming across the border cost money in it and it require effort but you can do you can do both I don't I think you can do both but I think the real big picture the real big pixel give you how to look at the solution of objectively the real problem is Mexico has like real economic situations that we don't have here in America there are far worse off in a lot of the areas and as is Guatemala as is a neighbor El Salvador neighboring countries that are economically devastated until they are not until they come up and experience Prosperity you're always going to have people that are committing crime cuz you want to try to get by and you're always going to have people that are going to want to try to get to America cuz it's a place where is more opportunity yeah the real issue they know she was dead so much better over here with immigration and and movement of people over in Europe coming from but I think that's You could argue that National Security from the US perspective would warrant improving your ability to impact Nations like Guatemala El Salvador wherever I'm working with Mexico to not just improves her the security the liaison that goes on and improving that but you're right I mean working conditions criminal or crime and instability that's in our national security why should we give countries money well in part you write him sometimes you give him money and it just goes down some s*** hole and it doesn't you know what I mean Thomas country I'm just a little bit goes into a hole and never heard and Corruption at the highest levels rayshun to view that is sort of the top-line issue why are they why are they on the move right well like you said they're on the move because they want a better life because where they're at and good yes how do you work with him and that's you know that's I think people sometimes look at the rock up a hill it's never going to happen and so maybe they just stopped right but we've ignored Latin America Central America South America for decades is how we ended up in part 1 I would just how we ended up in part with with Chavez and you know Maduro if the following and some of the horseshit that went on down there because we we ignored it we didn't give it the resources we didn't give it the attention we didn't treat it seriously as a national security concern we're all focused on wherever proving relation run southeast Asia or elsewhere so yeah we need to refocus and I think ultimately do we see it immediately know but I think</div>

Creepy because the guy like you has a gun when you're a great guy and I wouldn't be nervous good guys right that's not good guys get a gun what he's talking about is there if you you will it but you wouldn't shoot me they flattened out cuz I mean I thought I mean that's your that's right now for the money honestly I don't know how mad you get a gun with a weapon in your hand be like I can I'm playing God when out of this guy can kill this man right now this person right here by the Yeah it wouldn't matter what they accuse him when I'm saying is with the accuser because they didn't he got he got away with it right now he was accused the right it wasn't charged for this parking lot shooter that's why they can't even charge him know that's what I'm saying he felt threatened on the ground and there's there's there's closed-circuit footage of it when my my question was what if he had lied down lie down flat on the ground with then he be women when would they would what would the line be where they decide to charge them okay will you charge me as lying down I just asked you. Blood is that still stand your ground there is a manslaughter trial apparently now updated as of shoot someone who's on their knees would never threaten what are the gun and they have a gun purely for census for self-defense that's a different thing you know when you have everybody can have a gun that's you going to get a certain number of those f****** guys and they think I do you think they're in the right I think I'll go get guns New Bright imagine how scared of your kids to go to school now more than ever before but you also feel more filled with fear cuz you were you worried</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> houses in Italy like that like me Shelby School small family businesses small family restaurants like people that work there nobody likes like that bothers the owner and the daughters the manager works in the kitchens like wow this is crazy I still do that business yeah man just certain places where that's not the case though but you got to really appreciate the one things you preach about going to Italy there's just like a bunch of little places I mean they have nice doors like if you're in like Gucci s*** and stuff like that they have nice stores there but the restaurants and all the places where you buy things they're not like they're like people shops right and just like I go to Craig's to to it it's just family's weird like it's the money in the house with a real familiar works out that makes sense and that's also why I'm not real big into the reparations for black people I mean I don't really know the ins-and-outs of it people keep saying like we needed get ready for Twitter I'm saying this I'm saying how about we incentivized parent if you're watching your kids instead of like they're just out there to me like let's say is is reparations talk about I don't know infrastructure in Black communities and that's the case with in listen to buy keeping the parents there together or if they're split up it's just like if you guys are teaching your kid and eat and he's in school every day where he survives your 8 years old school shooting every family gets like you know a big bonus you know or if you make the honor roll you know like you guys get this as a child who buys me to go to school of education is going to make better people have better society that seems good on paper no kissing incentivize like how does divisor why I'm saying like always good good for a lot of them for a lot of reasons kids like they're they're depressed I feel like I have a chip on the shoulder because nobody's home watching them and they go to these games to go to look at the other things right then because you're just not being watched right but I think the idea behind reparations is that some people at one point in time we're profiting off of slavery those people use that money and that money has become a part of really large businesses many many large business give me $1,500 that's one that I think directly should be the lucky you have to wonder like if you made like where do used to sell babies baby selling business and then your your grandson inherited all your money from selling babies okay the grandsons cool I mean he just goes golfing and he's not criminal fine it's fine but is it fine didn't his money come from baby selling right let's trace this money like here's it started out as much money and then your dad got that and then his dad got that and then how many generations okay so you're saying she had to pay that money back and what was it used for anybody that is on the synthesis is there black right at 2 and would like a percent of a person Black coming to get how much of this you know the Jones Plantation you know Fortune I'm not saying that I'm saying that what the the smart thing to do would be to figure out what damage was like if they really objective it looked at what damage was done to communities where slavery existed for hundreds of years in this country before it was for you're hundreds of years right and then it ends these people live in the cities and their discriminated against in there locked up it wouldn't they would sort of one thing that I learned about who was telling us about this that they they would disproportionately arrest man from Reconstruction Era in them the worst ever black people in America is not so much slavery as it is the Reconstruction Era because they were just mad that black people are here small crimes in prison right genetic people hit me in the indentured servants you become just another form of slavery how you can make you a slave again just arrest you for hanging out in the street they put you in this Factory and have to do this for like nothing Fox like this supposed to be punished by the supposed to be rehabilitated and taken off the street but we're going to make them work for no money I know I'm in so smart why don't you like black guys we got to start making white guys work for us while we do the same thing we're just a smart well those all the areas that were affected by that in the fifties and sixties there's a residual effect that has never been addressed like the government has never said we've got to figure out how to make these spots better because the your mother so f***** up is get slavery was there and then the subsequent tests to figure out what to do with those sort stop short does not like at like bug Baltimore and places like that has Detroit south side Chicago we just murdered anybody except the right side Chicago they're just really poor areas at what that's what it is it just like it's not a war zone in terms of like it's official resume the government but best depression and that's that's a no then classism does it's like they're telling you to kill yourself because you're just poor and you don't know what to do is like but that's not true I mean I'm glad you guys and I got one games like that and it sucks down there their they're so depressed because they ain't what they seen it or not to get out of it and they don't see anybody who's gotten out of it so they feel like they're stuck there's a lot of kids that grew up in bad situations they feel inferior yeah the feeling. Because of the clothes they wear or how much money their family has was going to have you on our house parents through I think through activities I think getting those kids involved in things that they can get good at that show that they have value and that with hard work comes rewards in some of the greatest success stories in this country are professional athletes coming out of impoverished neighborhoods become the global Superstar is loves that don't that some of them it's like you can't you can't fix all that's taken place no you have to sort of figure out how to how to improve the way people look at life the way people interface with life is very hard if you're trying to do that but all around use violence and crime and fear and your brothers all levels are out there like a Siri health problem in this country this like even an infrastructure probably just accept the fact is in this isn't your problem so freaking to put money back if we remember if we're going to repair these black communities but my church but also you've got incentive incentivize parents to be there but I think it's a good idea but I do know that you know she's a very powerful well-spoken lady but she was talking once about this thing that they did where they had these parents be responsible for their kids truancy and so they could go to jail like the idea was to make sure this is correct make sure this correct Jamie cuz I think that the thing what they were saying was they were there going to have cops go to visit when a kid has been okay and they would sort of threatened the mother that she's responsible for the child truancy your mother is not the father who ever was there in this case one case they were talking about specifically this lady had to figure out a way to get her f****** son to show up at school he could go to jail you know I did it work I'm sure it worked right I'm sure everyone was probably terrified is that really what we want in a mirror we want people to be scared that you might go to jail if your kid has to go to school so if the kid doesn't go to school you're going to lock someone in a cage that is so threatening that's bananas that's bananas he's 16 or whatever the f*** you like when are you and yours that's that's really that's how that's how the Soviet Union becomes this true f****** Empire of authoritarian what's update the jail sentences of some parents in multiple counties were in quotes what she said an unintended consequence of a Statewide law but I'm looking for either into this in the says this is from Los Angeles Times what was his speech actually that she gave or she explains how she defective shoes hard on people being truant I think your idea what my point was I think that your idea is better cuz instead of punishing people for not doing it incentivizes him for doing it and if you could decide imagine that is a project right you were saying they like it takes 18 years to see an 18-year project where they were doing that and just incentivizing kids to succeed and all the sudden they can't just start succeeding like crazy if we had a big jump because it was like financially Violet you're competing right you're saying it like takes 18 years to see where I can find an 18-year project where they were doing that and just incentivizing kids to succeed and all the sudden they can't just start succeeding like crazy if it would have got a big jump because it was like financially Violet you're competing for a great idea</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> 20 things that the Romans always knew that make you my family so you can control them if their families oh that's f****** powerful tradition who killed somebody to keep them in line for they did it with them done in the mafia they done it with a lot of people always been something that people do to put fear in people you get people to when you have a lot more to lose when you have a family they broke it at that way there's certain people that mean when you study how to get people to listen to you and to behave and it about to strike fear in the populist that's why that's why they don't want abortion laws wow that's deep right if the if there is someone that is really thinking we need we need to make sure the people have families so that they'll be more vulnerable if there is someone that is following that philosophy which is not my thought it's like people that want to have an iron fist to control the population the last thing you want is a bunch of young single guys running around with no attachments cuz that so cools get successfully completed that's why you should be inverted babies no condoms do babies know birth control no babies if someone really was plotting out a culture that way like really Mastermind it and really saying that not just knowing that it is the case that people do change for a children but then doing this and promoting this on purpose specifically to control people if that was the case yeah they would do that against abortion because they would want more people to have more kids so they trolling what does crazy crazy to think that way but it would only be like one factor I think the major factors religion because if you are if you are pro-life and a candidate is pro-choice in your mind a lot of times people decided that that person is against like God's law that person wants to kill children right don't feel like compelled to vote you know to it to vote against you if you pro-choice I know but like are they thinking about you know what it is mother doesn't raise this child now you have this you know this mother who's going to love this child that she had that you guys made her have and this child who's this love was child now and they both know she's got mental illness and mental illness because you know he's looking for she's like this kid will my dreams you know this husband didn't stay that kind of thing you just your you're making me communities no depressed and sad you know and you guys to have that you're not raising this kid you know you have money in account and it's just family pocket all these things you're saying a true it's one of those things where you could see two to like a distinct patterns but infinite different varieties of the Cleveland the world sucks because the baby was born or the world's amazing babies born bitten what is it that's the real question like what is abortion what is it is it killing a baby or is it a medical procedure like which one is it that's where the debate Falls in Pro tours are pro-choice or pro-life it's not that these pro-choice people are evil people know they just don't want anybody dictating me sound like an evil organizations created by Satan snot snot it's women that don't want you to tell them what to do reproductive system that's what it is they want to be able to make the choice himself but then there's other people that are pro-life and specifically the more militant ones which assassinated abortion doctors me there are there are people that firmly believe that even if it's just a couple of days old rice it's a baby in that any sort of procedure to stop that in its place is murder your murdering a baby and there's no if ands or buts about it and it's like the way they look at the the Looney then that they they buy into this b******* and you know that that's a narrative that you know that's how they that's how they really believe and people demonize people on both sides of it as if they're so different and there's no way you could ever think any differently the way than the way you're thinking it right now are the most human subjects because it shows how complicated it really is sorry and if you try to pretend it's not then you get into late-term abortions and like will what's up there when when is he get weird for you weirdness right it is weirdest I got to go breaking my was a teenager and she had abortion I'm sorry she had a miscarriage Nature's abortion and then I she she would I was 8 weeks or 9 weeks and she was flushing out chunks of what she was calling the baby so mean at that like everybody she's so yeah that's something like that I mean that that's what you said that's why it's so messy and it really is messy because you don't know what is what right now she's like it it did traumatized her make sense crazy process the human body goes through that men will never really understand because there's never going to going to be an opportunity where of body grows inside your body and then comes out of your body the way a woman experiences me that's mainly do women experience something that is so alien to anything that the that males experience they grow a body inside of them it's very it's so different we're so did it so different like that is or how they interface with the world they did their training they want to protect the nest to keep everybody safe and they going to have a baby inside for now they have to take care of this baby and care for and then the baby will become more people and they start mating and they get become adults earthlings why comes out of their body and for us man we just we just shoot loads with so easy because like what the arc when we do when we don't have a baby and what we do when we have a baby is the exact same thing like you too when you have sex with a woman and she gets impregnated it's feels like regular sex and we have sex all the time and you don't get pregnant an extra person like what it is obviously but when you have a baby you look up what happens to his body right when he's having sex in a babies conceived versus when he's having sex and nothing there's no difference to hit me doesn't feel the difference that wears a woman literally her body will f****** grow a person a person with a brain is she serious she's sharing just wasn't things with his things kicking inside of her like that experience the f*** you up for a man I do not like if there wasn't a way that you could record what it's like to be someone and then they give you a little chip and he would slip it in there and I could I could see you like you would allow people all of your feelings the way your skin feels the way your emotions are the way your psychology is set up you would allow people to literally be you for a couple days and the chip would do that to sit in your head and you I would I would like to feel what it's like to be pregnant real Lancer I don't want to get f***** I don't want to get sucked I don't want to eat that was the only way I would wonder what it would like to first of all be a maternal woman that I mean really curious as to what do the hormones feel like what it must feel

I mean that changes history nothing what we're going to do we're getting a big house over there in Mexico somewhere in the in the know where is you know so we're going to have a swimsuit if I can't be no clothes Camp so we're just going to be really focused for this fight we're not underestimate him him or anything you know we just got to work hard and do it again so show people what I'm capable of now how much change is now that you're the do you have do you change anything in your camp and stay as far as your strength and conditioning as far as long as we have all the team and other stuff that we near the nutrition is the shaft the coaches know that all the all the stuff that I need to to win this fight especially training and all that that's the main thing and training and discipline and and you know praying to God now I'm coming into the fight with Joshua the first time did you have any Trish nails did you have a strength I did have one the plan was not to lose too much weight and all because the guy is really big and all I wanted to be heavy so I could carry his way and no work for my favor but I think the main thing I'm going to do I might do a little bit of way just to tighten up a little bit but just stay busy that's the main thing you worry about like if it's not broke don't fix it like there been guys before the main changes in the way they prepare and those changes like maybe but just stay busy that's the main thing you worry about like if it's not broke don't fix it like there been guys before the main changes in the way they prepare and those changes like maybe f*** with her confidence or they didn't feel as good they didn't didn't perform the same way no I don't think we're going to be changing too much of that stuff and how long is the training we have a good sparring just just exactly what we did for the last fight I think that's we're going to be doing just more intense</div>

Cuz if you're concentrating more on girls sexual things and you are on other things that might be more important than your box by just a bit about that I stabbed it called jerk off first then think about it and it was like always different scenarios where if you just jerked off you would never do the thing afterwards so many things you would never do if you hate your job clouded you all your judgment would be you decisions should be made just how can I get rid of this come how can I how can I do this but that are going like I haven't masturbated in two years and I'm more focused and I use that testosterone is an engine for other things is that just them lying to me well are those guys winners are the losers then I got worried about Seinfeld episodes just climbing ice ice cap it's like it cuz I got onto the I signed onto a form online of all the guys that own the sex dolls and I monitor conversations just like see what they were up to some depraved f*****-up thing we're guys are just like practicing murdering I didn't know it was I just want to see it's lot of guys that are handicapped it's a lot of guys whose wives died and they feel guilty moving on with a human woman who would dress his dollop in his wife's clothes he was like you know it's like she's still here which makes me think she's been dead for a while Truckers are the Instagram models that I and then their conversations for a while they start to like not want to f*** them anymore cuz it feels weird like and they anthropomorphize them and they they start worrying that like there was lonely and they get him and friend and start some kind of consumer life so when it comes to robots I feel like I'm more worried not about the robots with more hell we're going to get emotionally attached to them like the way at the end of ex machina he thought that she was going to no loyalty to you I might not be here but this I do think they're these are going to be like iPhones or something I think one day you're going to go over your friend's house and he's going to have this really hot girl in lingerie and she's going to be cleaning up and you feel like is she real they couldn't do this when we were kids this is a new thing so amount of time between weird kids to my love would you like me to recite a poem for you talk now the good and bad okay let me ask you a question what do you think about p*** do you know what I like about you what what what you like my electricity keep you plugged in dirty b**** you can ask her how do you like to have sex biking funny but it's why because shoot you can ask her like other robots going to take over robot brothel where's that there was one in Houston but they shut it down because people were so freaked out and scares in one place Scientology put them on one building I'm thrilled that they're on a castle on Franklin I know where they are they're not in the wild Castle I'm glad they're there I've just keep them contained boy this is like to test drive them just out in front of everyone scared of a new breed of realistic dolls will put them out of business was he a survey of hookers pictures will say if would you rather your daughter at 18 go to prom with a robot man or a man some old ass car and then go to a Tesla wow to be whether it's a hundred years from now or whatever it is indiscernible from you and I are making the mistakes with algorithm has so many smart people have to make down Alla release and they're like almost too smart to differentiate between a husky and a wolf and what is blinking pull up the camera on her stop stealing my thunder she just salad and feed the Tails differentology it but they didn't know that they had fed all the photos of wolves there was snow in the background so the robot was actually looking at the snow and the background and so the foreground so it could play it all the world so they had to rewrite the algorithm to tell it to look at the foreground into the background cuz all these brilliant f****** people that didn't think of the dumbest thing you know it was a people making it almost too smart to think of the dumb thing that the robot needs to</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> get super into Terror management Theory recently it's basically like the guy that back Ernest Becker this is my dad died a couple years ago and I hadn't really had a lot of death and I started kind of just I started getting into you called it to untie Monday or like you're doing too much s*** realized like when you have death in your lip basically Terror management theory is this is something you know of course but that because we have a the cortex number basically the only animal that can ponder the future in the past like we know we're going to die and we can't tolerate that anxiety it's too stressful for us so we basically have to keep ourselves busy and do English it to feel important if it went towards we have to have titles we have to get things in order to have extensive immortality right it's basically just managing anxiety of knowing that were rotting everyday dying and could die at any moment it's just like a false sense of Fallen longevity there's a great book called the worm in the whole Solomon summon Solomon I read this book and I totally blew my mind cuz I realize so many of my behaviors we're just about this fear of death because it had been sort of right in front of me so quickly and his death was so freaked that it just had a really hard time coping with the anxiety of death coming so suddenly and so shockingly in like just f****** up pretty bad but I started just making myself busy with soup irrelevant s*** in order to try to cope with anxiety and so I got super into Terror management Theory hair like they trying to manage the terror the daily Terror than we know we're going to die I'm better than you and like cultural superiority stuff I have to there's a guy named Solomon the did it talk about it just because you need so badly to feel important that you start to sort of have the delusion that you're better than other people just because you feel so insignificant cuz you know you're going to die you know we know where Speck of dust we know this is all ephemeral and fleeting and that we don't matter so we have to do things to feel like we matter so you don't superiority over people in order to Shield yourself from the futility of your existence to procreate the idea cuz we know mortality is so present in our amygdala all day everyday that I'm better than you there for me to procreate more and we are going to sustain and propagate so that we have a sense of lasting yes that's why we want to make a name for herself that's tangible things got it drives it's an anxiety that manifests in materialism workaholism needing titles of s*** like that subjugate all their employees and yell at everybody and like that's what they're doing cuz I got super into a cuz I didn't recognize my behavior I felt like 10 of the zombie I was like trying to look set of all these TV shows and it's like writing all these movies and I was just like I don't think this is so weird because my dad just said I should know exactly what matters in life which is none of this s*** achievements or money or any that but I was super into like I buy this house and I need to get you know this and this thing in this watch this is so not who I am trying to cope with all of this anxiety about death but they'd only studies were they put showed text a video and subliminal messaging put one frame with just the word death imperceptible to the actual eye and afterwards they showed people pictures of woods are cities inside where would you rather be and you normally go beautiful Woods Nature and they always pick cities cuz you just have consciously felt more scared and want to be in a place that was safer s*** like that on some level know that we're only superficially at the top of the food chain you know if we're out in the woods with a bear and there's no guns or cages it's we're going to lose the gay didn't we just know how vulnerable we are that's interesting because I would feel anxiety attached to the overpopulation aspect of cities the guy didn't we just know how vulnerable we are that's interesting because I would feel like there's some anxiety attached to the overpopulation aspect the city so sure there's got to be some of that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you want to talk about Huawei Huawei Huawei subject to a lot of people that are inclined because they are at the tip of the spear when it comes to technological innovation in the cell phone space young and I know that they're doing that with and in regards to modems and a bunch of other things as well but it appears that leak and a lot of companies are exclusively using their 5G modem has 5G rolls out route to the Chinese government they do they claim they don't they claim look we're independent we would never do whatever the Chinese authorities say think about that sentence think about a company with a global reach Oak Huawei of that importance to the Chinese State and think about them saying trying to say with a straight face we wouldn't we wouldn't do the things that the Chinese government might ask us to do that long or they would be a change in the Senior Management of the business so always been called out they've been called out in Europe and a certain point you think Germany and others that are deeply involved with Huawei now in terms of the 5G infrastructure made this decision look it's financially better for us to work with Huawei and we can set aside the security risks are literally made that decision reading an article about that very recently that they just decided to have some sort of a risk-to-reward conversation and they said there was a risk is worth the reward you know that's that's their calculation from the US perspective because we are essentially two superpowers now right I'm in China's you know advancing and and we're not the lone superpower on the stage anymore and so we are the number one and you know our calculation has to be different so we've been going at it and I know everybody I think it's been it's been pretty well covered didn't used to be covered very well but it's been pretty well covered over the past couple of months and now what's happening is we've been in these trade negotiations with China and I think unfortunately I think the current Administration the Trump Administration is going to blank and I think there because Huawei is such a huge issue for the Chinese and the idea that we would prevent are companies from selling into or purchasing from or dealing with and that we were have sanctions on other countries that that do they view that as such a threat to their own interests and their own future that Huawei is front-and-center with any trade deal so they're looking at doing any trade deal unless we make concessions on Huawei and I have a feeling the Trump Administration is going to make those concessions because political perspective they want to trade you you actually said to Google that Google's going to stop using the Android operating system for the for the Chinese phones for Huawei phones at least not let them license out the so why Always actually been at least rumored to be in production of their own operating system which would mean they would have to have their own not just operating system but they did have to have their own ecosystem that have to have an App Store that have to have all the all the Jazz that we have today when you do sign up for you buy an Android phone you have asked Google Play Market which is this huge resource of applications and soon as you take that away you've got a kind of rebuild that whole thing from scratch by a outlier here that's going to happen is they're using Huawei devices to some degree yes babe been slower to adopt and and and kamesh their infrastructure with always hear people don't know what we're talkin about could you please just lay out what's the concern what do they think that we'll always doing Huawei is essentially the way to put this would be imagined a Communications Network that's the globe and Huawei builds and provides gear in serving going into 5G there are leading provider and certain and then than financially they they can offer countries much better deals than than other providers what they are an intricate part of that Communications web so if you imagine that walkway is a state-sponsored entity and will respond to Chinese authorities request for information or intelligence that's passing through this Communications web around the globe are our business Communications are military Communications intelligence Communications that that all kind of go through at some point this interconnected system that's the problem because they're essentially building back doors into that system that allow them to suck Communications out of that Network and use purposes it's a great intelligence tool right so if you think about it and Away basically that's it say it is an advancement on the idea that you are wiretapping somebody or you know you could give credibility to intercept some communication they link themselves with the EU what happens with that military Communications right with the EU are military talk to the military and and and we got NATO concerned if there's an element in that infrastructure that watches in and has a door that opens to some walkway gear right then the danger here is and they had back doors discovered in the past and then while we put your hands up and go off but we didn't know that was there will correct it and then it turns out they don't correct it and then sorry about that information overstated right and so this ad that's why it's a problem for us because you know if we we convinced Australia and end in the five eyes Nations new zealanders and others not to work with Huawei and then they Canada you know which is willing to do at the CMAs Communications infrastructure with Canada so all of a sudden the fact that they're doing business with Huawei but we're not we're still at risk we're still in Jeopardy because that information is still flowing to some degree where it's accessible to it to Huawei and their ability that it to get a job people listen to that n**** why is that of any concern was concerned because used to be in the old days it was a it was us in the Russians so we Union rushes for Rare Earth minerals labor dosage access to Naval ports doesn't matter what they've been busy doing that because they view themselves at the top of the food chain now I guess we could say about okay fine maybe it's their turn or something but that's not how I view the world you know and whatever maybe and I think the answer is know what the opposite with the Hostile nation is doing at the know what the competitor is doing and second business they have to spend enough to stay ahead of that even if it's a small amount you got to stay ahead go ahead and it's it it behooves us not to fall behind that's never a good thing I know we don't always do things right but as a nation the world is much better off with us sort of at the time this is going to sound wrong a lot of people just the top were more altruistic maybe I just I don't know if that's the word or not but I think that's my view lot of people say b******* but you know how to detect like when they really say if they would release a Huawei phone and which is a really really interesting than just a few years ago Huawei was not even a major player by any stretch the imagination now it's the nun new cell phone provider in the world past Apple which is incredible when you consider the fact that they barely have a foothold in the American Market they very few people by their phones and if they do by the phones they buy unlocked phones from overseas yeah it's really kind of crazy but is there a way where they could detect whether or not there is a backdoor in these phones mean or is it something where they could develop it to the point where you really would have no idea. pretty well yeah yeah it's a good get it's a good question but I I would say that as long as we continue what we're doing in terms of counterintelligence and and check advances and efforts in in cyberspace and elsewhere and Suddenlink Communications Hardware to stay ahead of potential hostile activity I think we're okay week we were good at detecting problems were good at identifying week does in in the system's the problem is again it's a global Community we can't isolate ourselves and terms of communications infrastructure just doesn't work so you know it's like a chain and a weak link doing their desire to get a trade you are they willing to blank on this because they they put their foot down right and now because we're so dysfunctional here in the States from a political perspective now you've got people like Chuck Schumer going well on protecting us from from it all comes down to politics but but this is something that people didn't even understand was an issue National like this is something I know it was even aware of until a few months ago and when I started reading about it one of the first things that I was reading about was yeah I'm kind of a technology nerd and so I was fascinated by some of their newest phones which were really far Advanced to what you're getting offered in the United States yeah and a lot of that ability to to create and Rec comes from over the years decades while we do our own research and development in a Willett let's just take it and Huawei is not the only Chinese phone manufacturer there's quite a few different ones over there but they're the only what's another one zombie where there's there's quite a few there are always been because of their size there and their connection to the government and because of the resources that the government's been willing to to provide to them the advantage that they have and the speed with which they were able to kind of embed themselves into other nations telecommunications infrastructure that's why they so important but the generals are there other companies course yeah companies we should be worried about that perspective it's not looked at before I spend some time on China because it's just a sponsor perpetrator of theft of intellectual property but drought friendly they are how that means there's a lot of wonderful things about China but I'm just saying the authorities right the government policy of no rule of law of no protection when it comes in which real property all these things in their aggressiveness and stealing information that's the problem but China is a country is a fascinating place China but I'm just saying the authorities right the government policy of no rule of law of no protection when it comes to much real property all these things in their aggressiveness and stealing information that's the problem but China is a country has is a fascinating place</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what's interesting about China do is you think about okay what you would be watching we touched on Russia a little bit his the alliance between possible alliance between Russia and China and it's an interesting dynamic in a traditionally Russia trying to have been together they've always been some areas of concern you know distrust at but there are signs are things happening that appear as if China and Russia decision to align themselves closer and that would be because they made that determination to somehow it's in their best interest you know I'm not necessarily that it's going to be that way for a long. Of time but right now in the current environment you see Russia acting as if what they want is a stronger Alliance military Alliance and political and economic alliance with China and it's it's it's an interesting Dynamic that we need to be we need to be aware of in part of that is no people against this idea then and there was this Russia Trump collusion and thinking okay well that's good except our relations with Russia have been this bad in a long time so maybe it's all a very clever mind game but they're playing because they're closely aligned but I don't think so so we've actually late on more significant sanctions on Russia attack them from an energy perspective in terms of our ability to create our independence from natural gas dad is damage to rush his abilities so I think there's reasons why there are two gravitating towards China right now but this idea that somehow Trump is super friendly and it's a useful idiot Putin it doesn't doesn't play out when you look at the reality of the relationship between the two countries the whole Russian collusion thing is a very confusing their beak on one hand you have the Democrats who are saying without doubt this Russian collusion and then the other side you have the Republicans to say the Mueller report essential exonerated Trump from being a part of any sort of Russian collusion I don't think either one is totally accurate I think there's a lot of like weird gray yeah I'm both both narratives I think that the Democrat was easier to understand and it just makes sense from their perspective why wouldn't I why wouldn't we push that to this day they're just still amazed that they they lost and so there must be some grander reason why we just have Chloe we couldn't lose to this guy said so and then it was also talking with everybody with the racist and Maritza talking and it's worked for them over the first couple of years on the on the on the on the Republican side book The Russians knew what they were doing right they were f****** with the election on several different levels just trolling through the internet it wasn't me I'm just placing stories and then they could it wasn't just trying to foment the divisiveness and discontent was also doing these little dangle things you know where they're at and they're looking to see what are they going to bite when are they going to do you know me think about that Christopher Steele dossier was a piece of s*** I mean if if we saw that in in the commercial side of things you know I got a business and Global intelligence and and and research and security that thing was just there was nothing it was shot for the Holt what's somebody should have asked tell me about your sources you know why are your sources talkin what was it you got to anytime you got a piece of intelligence right you got to do a few basic thanks to come from British intelligence but you know this Enough by all accounts decent enough guy but he entered the world of private-sector information-gathering right I've got a company that's what we do all around the world end and you you can't relax your standards just because you're now in the commercial sector right when you get a piece of information you need to test that piece of information and one of the first things you need to do is understand what's the sourcing for it and why did why do they have access you know how credible are they their track record and why by the way are they providing this information and how did it eventually you know make its way to this report and those are the sort of simple things that whether you are a corporation is gathering intelligence about a market that you may enter with a you know an investment or whether you're still in the business and you're not into officer and you're talkin to a source that works in some foreign Ministry somewhere you got to be a stress test intelligence it wasn't done bike with a song that's on negative information about the other the candidate and just run with that s*** right in the more times you would say it's like the old the wmd reporting that came out of the early days in a row at the more you repeat it even if it's one source and that's worse is a piece of s*** when he repeated people are going to buy it so absolute and they might still a part of it is in in the old days it was sort of a struggle for Supremacy in the world Ryan I mean I was that score that's what it was right now and their ability to chip away and faith in Democratic institutions at the core of a lot of the crap that they pulled and it still is me and so that's only went when you're talking about a propaganda effort like the last election what's their goal on a goal isn't necessarily at that's where they way they do they care whether one can of there another winds well maybe maybe they do right but you'd be hard-pressed to argue that you know they were working against Hillary Clinton who would said you know it we want to have a reset and you know and have a new relationship with Russia and work with them maybe they like to jump and thought yeah that's the guy we want to work with but over that the more important issue was in just chipping away at at did Americans belief in Democratic institutions get us all so that we question The credibility of a democracy and that's been the fundamental belief for propaganda efforts within the old KGB and now the FSU and and then so it's as simple as that in a way and it worked can I wear easily duped and and I don't know how you get around that I know how we walked at back maybe we don't but I think it's meant for public that that helps to battle this but we haven't we lost sight of what was important here and that is and so I think the public needs that it's a responsibility you like this you like where you live and make an effort to try to keep it right and you can part of that is being an informed public and understanding what the Hostile elements may be out there without being paranoid just understand it's a responsibility you like this yeah you like where you live and you got to make an effort to try to keep it right and you can part of that as being an informed public and understanding what the Hostile elements may be out there without being paranoid just understand why they're doing things in the way that the world operates</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that again you can argument and I don't want to get into a political discussion Trump has an unusual character and you know they certainly they extremely Adept at getting getting elected and most importantly he looks like Trump's baby brother yeah Daddy some waitress and Bam better this one's better I mean it literally looks like a young Trump cousin or brother something goes by Halloween by Thirty One October they're done and he's are done with the whole European Union Dynamic is a little bit like here in the US right if you're in the Northeast Corridor washing the York whatever Boston or you're out here on the West Coast that you you tend to view the world differently than everything else the rest of the mass of the country right which is why people lost their minds and they thought the UK is a little bit like that around believe in 2011-16 the people in London lost their minds they couldn't believe it may still to this day I think everybody else is just an idiot right so there's there's a similarity I think why in part Trump Neil feel sore that does kinship divorced but yes and see what happens for them leaving what's the pro brexit argument do you really want to have your country your Sovereign Nation run by a bunch of faceless technocrats living in Brussels who have really zero interest in your Sovereign Nation that's at the heart of it's not an economic decision people would make that that problem with brexit they wish I could well this is not a good thing that the deal at heart isn't an economic concern it's it's the issue of of Serenity issue of being run by Brussels and enter the morass of regulations that they've imposed the inability for the UK to make your own decisions about trade and so there's a there's a good argument in that regard is it going to be a financial problem for them it's not going to be at that disaster like some people throw out there and say oh my God patella just cuz everybody else you want to do deals right they want to do Trey it's not like Germany in in France which of the only two partners in the year that really matter what's the staying in the European Union argument not racist globalism we're all working together on this miss a wonderful thing and look at you know all the benefits of it free movement than the other free movement you know didn't really work I will have from from France and Jeremy's perspective you know they don't like to talk about that anymore is basically what we can join the United States United States size of States like Texas is basically bigger than a lot of f****** right European nations right yeah it is that Arguments for the immigration argument much like some of the other arguments that comes down from UK's perspective on don't tell us what to do and maybe there's still an element of luck we you know we were an Empire that controlled most of the planet for a while and always like to you know I have a little bit more say and what we're doing so there doesn't Independence be the problem is from element of luck we've you know when we were in Empire that controlled most of the planet for a while and always like to you know I have a little bit more say and what we're doing so there doesn't Independence Street the problem is from use perspective is if they do leave and it's not a disaster then each other countries going to line up right hand and Italy maybe I would be the next one so it'll be interesting to see what happens but yeah Bojo as they call him isn't interesting cat not unlike our present</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> because I'm talking about it. I'm not supposed to put that we were looking at military government organizations that are typically in the shadows right we're not releasing any sources and methods not disclose any classified secret we talkin about elements in units operational activity events that before now I pretty much bed and the shadows and some incredible people that's one of the best parts about this thing's been going out there to meet some of these guys are doing some of the speech and it's it's pretty amazing and when when they do release things like long long after I was reading something I forget what the case was about but it was something about how the the files won't be released under the Freedom of Information Act until 2080 periodically and she'll be looking at some historic but a lot of current things that are going on and in where the money goes right where we spend our money on when it comes to this high-speed operation set Special Forces and others are involved in so be it'll be very good I wish I was lucky to be out of work with again you know some really great people on the production side but just also going out there and meeting some of these cats they're just that they do is it's even after being around a while so I have it just amazes me it's going to be constantly accelerating to write as their consulate coming up with new and spectacular things that nobody knows about employ them right how we going to do this particular thing what's develop a piece of Kit that's going to allow us to do it but the running joke is always at they'll develop it and I'll show it to you before an operation put it back on the Shelf cuz they don't want that you're getting out there right and people finding out that they've got it so they'll give you like a twenty-year-old piece of Kit to use instead and you'll be walking around with like a phone the size of a brick knowing that got something high speed on the Shelf that's what everybody always thinks about technology in the government dudes. They have they probably don't tell us about how much of that is real it's it's pretty real have you seen some stuff that made you go holyshit yeah they can do that yes and because it's something John is imagine you got it you got a rock up on a ton of Target and your butt your before you do that before you get their customers on-site you're going to hopefully obtain some high value targets there are at that location if we did born in detention facilities you know what that did that that pretty much convinced everybody that was involved in this to just just Wacom right because then you'd have to deal with the aftermath you not to worry about are you going to get in trouble for interrogating exactly so grab the Target and get there until as a problem because in the pipeline dries up for the

night vision devices and and and that ability and low light conditions to to Monitor and do identify specific individual has always been a problem they make great strides on a to the point now where

database with new faces or with new photographs of individuals that you going after with enough of that to sift through they're getting to the point now with no light conditions that they can identify positively The Targets in that room at the Targets in that facility or that building whatever my pic and pretty incredible other other bio-data right I mean I got other but they can literally with video somehow or another they can zoom in on you with some scanner and recognize that this is a particular individual because their heart rate yeah this is there was an article about it and I know that there's a company do you know what hacks is hecs it's The Hunting Community as well because it blocks the electrical signal hecs it blocks the electrical signal that your body gives off and kept yeah that makes sense and I think they're doing work with the military as well to develop suits that will somehow another stop someone from being able to recognize your particular heart rate right and it does a lot of work on what they call us or the universe is there a distance do you have other data points right here but this is all part of it to some degree what do they refer to as the universal Soldier right there the the fighter of tomorrow and I mean I've never actually felt that that was something I needed to accomplish in any given moment from an operation went back that you can acquire for that Warfighter how do you create the perfect environment on that individual as he's moving through an environment to two being more efficient effectively lethal fighter and you know things like that identifying Target whether it's with a laser whether it's with low light or no light conditions where you can as you're rocking up on the target you can do that always thinks you know the ability to to carry more gear right humping another extra you know 10km whatever might be it's it's pretty incredible what they're doing and it's it's a joint it's not just a military they're working with With It was a commercial sector and academics to but anyway disappearing down the rabbit hole Elon Musk neuralink thing that he's coming out with their they're going to somehow or another insert fibers into your brain and then have a Bluetooth enabled device that you wear that's going to allow you to somehow or another interface with data at a much higher bandwidth I don't know yeah any of those words mean I just said but that was it sounded like you understood it that's in front of you like they have you had say you looked at the Pentagon really does have his lazarbeam Digger identify specific individuals and you have a map of a building that's in your head and they can identify the very location absolute perfect location of each individual person in that room and you could see that as you're running into this building you're seeing like a 3D Grid in front of you and you know it mean you could shoot him right through a f****** wall of information overload and you get into that situation right everything starts to close down a little bit right and Endor and so you got to start pushing some of that away and end now what you end up doing as you get the off-site you know Command Center relaying some of that information as needed but that guy that's about to breach that door you know he doesn't want a lot of data points anymore now having said that knowing her all of the individual soldiers are out there through the year that they would then be wearing it since it's an incredible effort that has been going on and end so they answer your point a long rambling answer yeah I've seen some things that are pretty amazing but you'll be able to talk about how did the government do that they just decide low listen it's not a bad thing if you tell people about this some of its not what you would refer to as classified it's just not readily available public information and it's not out there in the Domaine because people aren't aware of it are searching for it some of it does I think you're right some of it is able to do some of it does I think you're right some of it is what the military wants to say at times but we're able to do what we're doing this and often times it's because it's in a sort of a private-public cooperation and until that encourages other companies with Innovative Technologies to step forward and get involved in some of this man I guess that opens up all sorts of other you know some people are out there saying they shouldn't be working with the military</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that's a good point. So one of the things I wanted to smooth segue but we were talking about bit about technology technology is the 2020 election coming up is this idea of deepfakes the technology nowadays to create a deepfake of doctoring a photo or video and making it do what you want to do to try to convince people of whatever it is technology has is advancing and it's stunning what do you know Don Kyle Dunnigan is Kyle Dunnigan hilarious stand-up comedian but he shines and doing deepfakes and he's working with this other guy I think the guys called doctor Frankenstein or the Fay caning today he was doing a really kind of crudely with like face with you no face swap on Snapchat or Instagram but now he's moved from that to doing this really high-end stuff go to the you I must one look at this play this pretty soon you will become a baby again and be sucked back into your mother's vagina go to another Kyle Dunnigan video so he can tell what really looks like that's him to the right of that but mostly him like the Goldblum cuz that's a normal one this is what he did with the filters without doctor Frankenstein put in the videos he's always choking and it's bad enough that it's extra hilarious cuz it's bad but the new one that he did with Elon Musk is not bad it's to not bad but what you just shown I mean people look at that and I go okay and then but that you ride Eli Mustang is getting closer to the real guy but you can have someone like that say give me $1000000 or financial data on on Tesla is that happens but the quality is so far beyond even that now that we can be done by and it was talking mostly State actors like-for-like Russia and so did the problem we're facing now is it's not just every kind of what kind of aware you know the disorder that we divorce or whatever it is Twitter and the trolls that exists on there in the box and all of that but it's the video the ability to do the video there they released one that was done not too long ago with Nancy Pelosi it only didn't was slow down her speech Just slightly but just enough to make it sound as if she was slurring her words maybe she died couple of drinks and that thing was blasted all over social media and people to this day still think and they still talk about it like you know she's kind of losing it a little bit and I like her more by the way legit yeah she learned that hundred million dollars is definitely no Shenanigans Shenanigans but it's something that people should watch something people should read up on a little bit look at it because the technology is advancing so quickly that the effort to combat the effort to detect it into some companies out there and then it's only that the government is working to do that DARPA and some others are working but the effort to try to identify doctor videos write protected when you're talkin about elections campaign is is it it's going to be an increasing problem that we're not really discussing that much and Congress has been a little bit of attention to it right now but it's it's really problematic and there's there's things that that you used to be able to look for right lighting and annoys and just sort of the movements of the face what they call Micro heartbeats in in in all the little things is that is the subject in the video blinking for instance when your doctor it sometimes they do the blinking wouldn't be there now was it tell but the people involved in all of this in creating these deepfakes are working at such a pace that they're getting ahead of that so it's coming up with ways to try to counter it but I guess the biggest point is it just sounds like you need to be aware of it and they need to be smart about it cuz they won't be anybody goes to the internet and they they lose their minds and they believe whatever it is they read that agrees with their opinion and there's no bothering of checking you know whether anything is actually legit anymore or not but if that would be my one piece of advice going into 2020 sorry now pay attention don't believe anything you see until you prove it that's part of the problem to write conspiracy-minded individual this guy who used to work for the CIA is telling us not to believe the news wait I see what you're saying what I'm saying is that you were setting us up okay well it's time for me to go candidate are you looking at anything Realty on the internet now just be aware of the capabilities maybe that's a better idea putting all of this because you're right you don't want that part of the problem in one of the things that Russia doesn't and others who are involved in this whole propaganda effort one of the things they do want to do is undermining our confidence obviously and media so you know by me saying don't believe what you see I'm kind of feeding into that so you're right I shouldn't I shouldn't go that route be aware of what the capabilities are pay attention everybody should just be a little smart about what they're doing that's all exceso and also what we're looking at now is so much more powerful than what we have three or four years ago and three or four years ago this technology was not available for the consumer but now it is well that would do was let me think about it if not to get too deep but if you think about the photography is photography been around there benefits to manipulate photography Tom go to photoshop that kind of put it all in the hands of the consumer you know what you were talking about face swap the new face app to age people make it easier for whoever's got a smartphone to try to do this but what you really not the problem as well but one of the things that you really have to worry about it again sort of the state actors like a Russia an ancient Russia was behind the faces Swamp Thing stop that right there are Russian companies that are pushing this technology out there and what are they doing at every time you every time you do that it's recording data about you I'm not aware that you have to give your name and your email like to get that application and then they have a photo of your face that correlates with your name and your email so what they've done is they've gathered up more than a hundred and fifty million emails and faces and they have data on people yeah that is that's pretty powerful stuff like if you think about what Facebook is done right what Facebook is made billions and billions of dollars by essentially mining data right that's what they're about the same thing they're mining David Welch Russia managed to do that with a hundred fifty million people in a very very short amount of time just by making something cute we talked about this before they've been doing this since 1940 so busy trying to keep the USA out of World War II before they broke up with a Nazi is it was a serious break up but when they were still aligned they were busy paying off journalists and buy and trade unions and all the rest of it so they're not going to stop what they do because it's worked for them and it's just kind of in their DNA well I know my shade justifiably Shady how about that I like that okay that's a good trip being righteous individual when I going to do any of this yet you would have to be with willfully ignorant naive or just f****** stupid to think that Russia China these other actors out there I'm going to stop also I am walking to hold hands and unicorns going flying out of our ass it's not going to happen so yeah I mean I guess the answer to that is always the same which is yeah you better hope we do it we've been up we do it well cuz I'm sure it's going to go down like you can't just cut the military budget you just you can't just cut it out one no no military at all how much money should you spend on propaganda there should be some money spent on propaganda overseas right right as we're trying to manipulate them the way they're trying to manipulate we're America wear nice we're the good guys we're doing it the right way supposedly yeah there is that right there is what I've always maybe I'm naive or whatever that was always my thought process operation and people laugh at that or whatever but you know what honestly I'll be honest with you I've always liked it maybe I'm naive or whatever that was always my thought process operation doing this boy doing it for the right reason and people laugh at that or whatever but</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> there's people that want to forgive people though for thing like Rumpke remember when there's a lot of Roman Polanski apologists that were saying an amazing artist arguably the my favorite which by the way yeah I was reading that the guy that directed ex machina kind of loosely based the guy on Stanley Kubrick you ever see and then as soon as I thought the production to get her into I mean he wanted to sleep you weren't of bags under eyes he would wake her up in the middle of the night and he scream at her and call her c*** and I mean so good in The Shining and then she'll do it to make great art I don't know it's I'm not in the f****** take was amazing in the actor got all pissed off but the f****** work but you know you get to get credit for that so I did a show called Adam ruins everything you know that show it's just a smart dude and he just asked me to look at spot and I had to play a flight attendant in the 50s who was getting sexually harassed like that was the scene and because that's what I could Airlines used to do that they would sort of pimp out their flight attendants if you were engaged you weren't allowed to wear your ring play the episode The really originally supposed to be really hot right over the whole thing could be a certain size and you have to be young and then you got to kind of like okay whatever you feel comfortable with him is like no we have to do is we have to make this feel uncomfortable like don't worry about my feelings right now you know it's like you know so there is just as conversation about like a no hostile work environment and everyone needs to feel emotionally safe like what can you get today lowest I backed you have to kind of be like that's why they are method actors ranked they stay in that mindset because to maintain that mindset is really the only way to achieve it like you almost kind of have to be there all the time being in character thing like it when people like you know b**** about like when Christian Bale had his you know button is also there's the losers onset sometimes it f*** things up and getting away the fact that they recorded him screaming at that guy I want to know what that guy did who was that guy that guy might be a moron I don't know exactly what happened you know but I do think when Daniel Day-Lewis is like I'm call me mister Linker nobody to talk to me it might just be his waving likes f****** stop asking me if I want hummus like yeah yeah yeah it's an interesting movie When Sally Fields is killing I'm like no one's laughing at that it's not real Fandango weather that you know but like the one on Showtime cast real Comics member are Griffin was on it and I'll magical was on at that one on Showtime I'm so I just think it's interesting like you know Stanley Kubrick probably would be canceled today probably what was special about people don't understand what's required in order to achieve what he's trying to get me a Madman that mean he used to do complex mathematics in his spare time and then I'll show up like you didn't want actors acting like he wanted them he wanted them in the actual State of Mind instead of acting like they're in an actual state of mind looking one. So he really wanted Tom Cruise to be like exhausted and f****** pissed off and annoyed so he can go piss him off and then let me know when he's in that state terrorize Shelley Duvall is jumping up and down and throwing his arms in the air like freaking out working himself up before the scene in mean he is like those scenes that he did especially to ask for the bathroom door you can't just go into that cold you've got some of that in here driving down here that's why they say that the car on the road that's crashed on the road there's a red car in the beginning of the movie that's crash on the side of the road and then Stephen King's version there was a red car so Cuba crash that car and then it was a yellow car so he actually puts it in the movie to like trolls these little things to make you feel uneasy like continuity errors like he's cut to a scene there be like if there was a chair behind you cut away cut back and there be no chair should you wouldn't really notice in case you were like dissecting it but there's also a lot of weird references no movie to the Apollo moon-landing that's like saying that the Native American genocide apparently a pretty big steam in it but yeah and riding a bicycle around the carpet that he shot it both ways and intercut them so the continuities not work makes you feel alone yeah he's f****** there's a great documentary about the guy who followed to Brick around just like his assistant who's an actor and he was acting and something the Kubrick didn't cubic wind up hiring him as an assistant that he just did all Kubrick movies and hung out with them all the time it's really strange I believe right know the guy who hung around with Stanley Kubrick have the clout him doing so I'm just going to start working with no to his personal assistant you started out as an actor and he just worked with Kubrick through all of his movies yeah they just clicked together so he wanted working for him so it's like you probably don't know the name Leon Vitali scroll down please stop you you don't know the name Leon Vitali but the upcoming documentary film worker hopes to change that forever yeah and Barry Lyndon it's interesting because this guides or devoted his life to like to work with Uber would you like a movie every Flex 5 years or something it's like that's made a movie when it was ready now it was like 8 months and noon to understand right. No no that's up Francis Ford Coppola the post modern implications of the movie JFK did mixing I just f****** love the movie and I just want to pray about it and dissect it it's a great movie but the problem is they sort of he makes it seem like you know exactly what happened and the reality is we don't know exactly what happened we don't know who killed JFK it was very likely that it wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald though if it was that if Lee Harvey Oswald did take a shot he didn't take the only shots happened we don't know who killed JFK it was very likely that it wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald though it if it was that if Lee Harvey Oswald did take a shot he didn't take the only shots other people shooting</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what's going on with Iran caught a bunch of people that they are claiming our CIA informants and they may execute them yeah yeah they done this before they made this claim before and look around is hated a couple of parts of this that's one of the heaviest lifts in the business has been Intel collection on a run over the years I'm not talking about just recently but over the years it's been it's been very difficult they are extremely buttoned-up over there and they have level of control over their population and I would just you know at some point you would think well maybe the populations can object to this but you know hasn't happened yet so part of it is they came out with this I think 17 individuals that they claimed were cooperating with the CIA in some fashion or another and they you know they claimed they were fairly high-level individuals say I don't believe anything that comes out of their mouths at all I think they've they got a long long track record of of lying about a variety of things and so you know why would they come out with this you know perhaps they're cracking down and it doesn't hurt to come out and if you're going after some of these individuals anyway why not put them put the paint brush on but they're working for the CIA and then that will appease some of the population there so I'm not buying it it has been a difficult Intel task and in collecting Intelligence on on their efforts with weather ballistic missiles their new program as well as always been as always been problematic but again they've done this before we they talked about how we've wrapped up a CIA spying at work and it's it's kind of worship it happened to her propaganda I mean you know what I mean years ago right which was completely built by the Russians by the way by the old KGB they'd be owned and operated the Cuban until service for a long time still do day at one point wrapped up pretty much everybody we had on island and NL how many people do we have over there active it was a pretty impressive effort so it's happened Russia's you know done the same when we usually went with Russia usually when we've got a traitor or mole and somebody like Robert Hansen Jim Nicholson American citizens and seem like you know Joe and Mary next door but really they were Russian spies you don't have an aunt and uncle named Joe and Mary's already that you would say that I'd literally had an aunt named Joe and Mary on you buddy stop that we wrapped up in Jersey, there was there was that one that. The hot one remember I know somebody who knows the UN declaration never know she reason for being witches to spot people right it was it wasn't they were not these were not the heads of the of the organization right so their job is spot people live there be social meet people that might be of interest maybe it turns out that somebody in the PTA where your kids go to school maybe somebody's working for Raytheon it working for Sam Neill interesting company that's right and we'll look at that person and go yeah it is maybe there's something that is person works for whatever company in and you know that bnj could be it doesn't matter what the company is bought it like to be Qualcomm could be filled think of one that has the application to be Corning could be anything is also what your companies out there that that have applications that may be of interest mint into a prospective for a for a hostile state so then you know they do a little assessment and yeah somebody else will come in let me know within this is this group and they'll develop a relationship and then you know maybe that's half the person so maybe it'll say the guy works at a tech company and you know you're going to think I want to see if this person has any weaknesses know how can I leverage anything here and so what you'll say is not getting it and I doing the research whatever hey do you have anything you don't need to bring the classified you just saying you working at tech company and I don't know you have something that would be of interest you know my kids got to write the stupid paper and and you're not looking for anything of Intel value you looking to see where they'll accommodate you will they actually come back and go you can see that they responded to a little task and then you'd so you set the hook a little bit and then you just keep on working on that so in the meantime they're calling back to the KGB and saying we have gotten who work at 3:50 on right you notes information just and they say it just like that she's banging everybody doing that community right-to-know I want One Bank people I watch I liked about half an hour of the first episode and then I get angry I just sit there and I'm a very hard person to watch shows like that wasn't so so my wife was like I just can't know you can't you can't</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> talk about Syria and that end in you know Sade eunos butcher he still in charge why isn't charging because Russia prop them up and want to rush approximate along with Ron and isn't this at this a nasty piece of work there as an access goes you know we should have been able to figure that one out but we didn't in part because we have these these these impulses that say what we're going to do better and because we're going to create this ability for people do you know create their own democracy so yeah so anyway we serious again one of those places that nobody really wants to discuss or talk about and we got we got attention deficit disorder talks about North Korea is there some sort of a boycott embargo yeah that's another part of it is in part of that is a technology issue we've gotten better at imposing and enforcing sanctions then we used to being part of that is because our abilities to understand the movement of money tracking transact is better than I used to be so the sanctions is example we put on a round this is the most difficult time that this regime has faced in around since the fall of the Shah and it's because we've gotten better at looking at Russia China in particular that and traditionally was kind of circumvented the sanction or better at enforcing that and we're better at working with the EU and pressuring them so that's that's a good thing but I don't know where that's going you know I mean we're honest kind of flailing about a little bit they seize the tanker and I'll British tanker text you the couple but they're holding onto one in response to they were trying to ship a bunch of oil over to Syria against sanctions it exists right so so that anchor that was Taken 2 million barrels of oil and the British intercepted that ship now so beginning of July and in response the Iranians have done a number of things right but the most recent thing that they've done was a seized of British flag tank and they're still holding the crew and that's sort of example of their they're desperate because they've got an ability I think the withstand and their control over the population is so strong but it's an example I think the some degree of of them flailing a bit traffic what are they going to do what's their next move and I know people say why we shouldn't have gotten out of the deal and we shouldn't be no we can have this issue anyway because we know it's Trump's fault for getting out of the deal but again I don't have a lot of confidence in them sticking to the terms and agreements have any deal because they've never done in the past has always been an effort and it was broken the agreement so I don't know why suddenly they would change their tune if we can keep the sanctions on hard enough and forcing the table care about staying in power if they think they're going to lose that grip on power will come to the table to make a better deal and that deal would include us being able to access their military facilities and for inspections and we couldn't meet we have no access to any of their military sites in that country because we didn't make it a condition of the deal right so we basically said sure we want verification that you're following the agreement they said will f*** you in this is the these are the places that we agree to let you look at that's that was the Donovan over something that was the terms of the deal and so with any deal that we do with them in the future needs to be able to say no we want understand verification does John Kerry said that's what you want you want me to verify so when we heard about it what we're hearing the news from the people who proposed the deal is that Trump broke this deal and he was foolhardy to do so that Obama put in place this deal and the trumpet broken and it's hurting leaves us in this terrible Quagmire but what you're saying is that the deal was terrible and that they'd it didn't really give us access to understand back with their nuclear program was the right Terry program was so it wasn't a good deal wasn't wasn't wise to keep it if you are if your if it's a way that you judge the the value of a deal and they dis is what the previous administration about menstration did was talk about how you know it's important we verify and we've got verification well yeah you got verification of the sites of the around he has agreed to let us look at that and so yeah it was a deal was it a good deal know they wanted this day wanted to sign this Iranians knew it and so yeah I think that that justified saying now we're going to redraw this and even the EU which is been clinging to that the old agreement Haven EU says wow yeah we we couldn't prove it we could make it better but there's no if you just keep things as they were there's no incentive for the Iranian regime to to make any concessions or improve it so the point being as we're going we're trying to force them back to the negotiating table and again and that their self interest is to stay in power and remain in charge then you know if it was the economy in the condition that it's in currently if it gets much worse and they feel as if they're losing a grip on on under the population then I suspect they will come then I got to lash out that your aunt doesn't want it nobody wants a military conflict we don't want they don't want it. Can they close the Strait of Hormuz you know where you know depending on who you talkin to a fifth of the world's oil passes through or yeah early causing friction but they don't have the ability to shut down for any. Of time we've just got too much in terms of Leverage over there in our assets and so because you had partial verification doesn't give you anything doesn't give you anything that programs for decades and they just keep advancing their program out of the deal that you're hearing from Democrats is basically just a criticism of trump to show opportunity to</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> just started thinking about that thing you did with Ronda Rousey and who else was in the what the f*** is he doing did you get all the different Ronda Rousey versions they look like from Christy side Works in there we have a Miss Holly Holm we have we have met we have Rhonda on the hot one okay will do at home animate I have no idea how to animate you got a lot of s*** for this not really I mean cuz it's it's just pure comedy only when it's like when it comes to assholes so I don't like most politicians are easy targets because they're lying right away I think the best comedy we've had in many years has pain Trump cuz he's just he's set them up for you he does but it's almost it's what he's doing is so strange because he's not even pretending to be what we think of as a president like he'll attack people on Twitter it's weird there is no reason I feel like it's almost like that is the distraction to keep us all divide and keep us all guessing what the f*** is going on and he proposed that maybe maybe if you're good if you're good conspiracy theory you're going to put those together so there's anything weird like that going on that goes up there's a fungus it's going to kill everybody don't tell me it just can't be arguing like you know distracted by you know football is component of our government doesn't make us and then either fight tickets accidental don't think anybody I don't think it was pulling the strings I think it's just like part of the progression of what happened because half of the Kali Yuga Madness yet chaos going on at people capitalizing on that chaos and I definitely think there's lying and I definitely think these conspiracies but I think more than anything it's just this is the way the world is turning right now because of just how Society is set up and how disconnected we are to the natural world and how connected we are to the digital world and its way out but I think in the interim I feel like an attempted Rica going to help I think generally generationally there's a way out the problem is for Our Generation I don't know if there's a way out and I think especially People Like Us that grew up without any sort of internet and then have watched it transform and completely take over the world where is the idea of a world without internet is impossible to us it doesn't even compute but we grew up without it so what happened while we were taking over we're taking over by some sort of digital entity I don't think for us I think that this world has to be figured out by the people that recognize that we f***** up but we're talkin about learning from mistakes learn from other people's mistakes we're going to learn from our mistakes they're going to learn from our mistakes and they're going to have see people who grew up just like I mean like every other really f*****-up part of human civilization that people manage to over, avoid whether it's slavery or managed to overcome and avoid whether it's slavery or war with bows and arrows like they've figured out like that was not the way to do it let's move past this let's figure out what the Folly of our ancestors was and let's let's adjust accordingly I agree with it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> about psychology do you have a mental trainer or anybody comes like a sports psychologist but that's the day I started off with the guy I was telling you about all of your Lima also kickboxing world champion in different different weight divisions and I was training with him and he took me with his training took me to his training and working with him in his prime and without him knowing was teaching me so much about mental training because I was training with him and you would never giving up and the moment that I just showed something like he gave even extra you more gas when you start slowing down or that's what he still made my mental coach would that so easy my corner and everything when he says something I just think about don't want to disappoint this man because he knows what how important this is and I think it's from the start of last year or something I was really like little bit skeptical about talking to people like like a psychologist or something . you know it pretty deep with somebody you don't know is I don't know. Maybe my mind just doesn't add up you know where I feel good but still I got in this situation that I had to or I just had to and I went there and actually felt pretty good so from that moment know what how many things happened of what everything that happens in your life and he's got a process to all that stuff but I thought you just so many things happened in your life that you just can't process and you put them away on your back and you just fall off so I think of it the same way you were talking about physical therapy that like if you have a little injuries nagging injury I get a massage out everything loosens up I think of it the same way if you're not taking a good account of what's going on in your mind you can develop like little mental injuries exactly but for me and maybe a lot of people has maybe not nowadays but like from back in the day you talked to his psychology you crazy you're right right right right yeah that's what that's how people in Holland like yeah I approached it for a long time here for Fighters it was the same thing like most Fighters didn't need a psychologist that's not the winners winners know how to win you just don't be a p**** go out there and f****** fire but that's nonsense like his no pussies and professional fight you know but there is Edge get an edge can get an advantage whether you get that Advantage from getting massage or cryotherapy or from a sport psychologist there's advantages to be had so but I think that's what my what I got from my dad is just being tough being tough and being hard on yourself in whatever situation you're in just be tough on yourself and just because that's what he was he was tough on himself and so that's what I got from him but now I just think I could just to tweak everything up and just give mentally imbalanced and Presley when he passed away like almost two years ago it's just yeah it was tough. Especially when the the relationship we had wasn't like look like on and off on and off and it really was on it was like a lot of discussion that you just hurts and then things happened in your life and you try to process everything and give it a turn spot but it's hard sometimes and you just need somebody outside of your comfort zone to talk about that Brian and yeah that that really works and help for me so I'm very thankful for that and just you know I think always happens for a reason whatever positive or negative and sometimes you you know what happened and why it happened and sometimes you probably know whatever like a few years and maybe you never know it but in my opinion everything in life positive or negative happens for a reason and it's just yeah it's on you or doesn't if you decide that it does that it happens for a reason and you can find benefit in good or bad things than it does happen for a reason but you make that distinction that it's going to be for your benefit it can help you in the long run that's a difference between a person who takes things that happen adversity in life and decides that the world is against them can't catch a break the world to me over those people wind up becoming losers versus someone who says you know what we're going to be fine this is going to make me better and make me stronger is going to make me understand I'm even though I'm more vulnerable right now this is going to make me understand myself better is going to ultimately make me better at everything I do you decide that then they do things do happen for a reason exactly and that's the end that's one of the reasons I love washing your part podcast because that's what you bring and especially what I think for people that maybe sometimes struggle with certain things or like just explaining the situation anything like f*** what the f*** did I do to life that constantly haven't been just backfires on me it's I always think like you are responsible for the choices you make your life nobody else you're also responsible for how you accept or how you focus on your life exactly how you think about things and that how you how you process it you're responsible for it so and those those are things like are so important to me and that's why that's and that's what I mean with I try to surround myself with people that boost my Flame I would like who did I text who did I call it like you know those people need to boost my flame they need to be important one way or the other in business or in work or it can be in love or in family or whatever you need to be important in some kind of way I just need to have positively around me because I've seen so many negative things from my family side that doesn't work drains it drains you and I believe like it's like Karma if you your negative you will attract more negative things positive or positive things will come your way 100% I believe that was well do you have a visualization plan when you go into a fight like say like this rematch with Badr Hari you going to sit down and visualize scenarios do to train your your thought process to go over scenarios or to have a game plan and you are mine the way execute the fight the way you would like to imagine it of course of course think every fighter does and be warm to be set aside like to meditate set aside time to do that or you just do that all the time no it just just happens just doing it all the time you are in the car it just it just happens when you you think about what's going to what's going to happen in the upcoming months you just know that okay this is going to be next level okay but how are we going to approach despite what is going to happen What might happen if he does this I do that this could happen and that could happen before going into the this this person in this fight for so long and for like three or four months that's that's a long time so that happens and I always feel like much fun to people to do realize is that my confidence level during a. Of like 3-4 months into a fight goes like up and down up and down you are the f****** best of what you do and I think that happens to everybody except the process except cuz I've been doing this my whole life I know it's part of the process but still it's frustrating so and that's what Frank Zappa mental coach and a psychologist can help you with to cope with that at that moment so that you don't stay here and you do climb back up again but it's from your body being tired and then you say where does that come from come from anywhere you know from your body being tired like hey why can't I cope with this training or why is this training getting to me or JR's bar and why did I get get hit five times with the right hand and then block or react whatever so it can come from anywhere and then the monotony of training as well right now</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so he doesn't know the sport Badr Hari is one of the biggest names in the sport like forever he's he's a guy who he's stopped Alistair Overeem you know it's fought in K1 not everybody Kardashian parts for a long time and then he fought you everybody I was Champion I was beating everybody who said he's a champion but he hasn't fought butter that's like if he was on national television today if you wants to fight let's go ahead and deal with a bunch of legal trouble it was just like another fight then the fight at the end the fight ended that way yet I was too bad so but now we can do it again yeah so the fight was quite a while ago 60 yeah that's why did he so long for the rematch yeah there was a bunch of stuff going on in between and like last year he fought has the Girgis also a good kickboxing believe he's now doing MMA in Bellator and then after that fight they both got caught with using whatever steroids last year yeah so for him that was the first fight since your fight with him in 2016 is that it yeah I know that I'm sure he looks the same thing but it's just it's what's interesting is when you're in high-level competition like he was of course you know the days when he fought Alistair before out there made the transition full moon to MMA when you before you came to strike force and all that stuff that's that's a long time ago you know it's probably hard to get back into mean end to jump straight into top-level, 2 like heads Eeyore especially like fighting you at a champion that's a big leap right yeah so but that's the thing now we both have it so he fought last year March and I fought last year September so because I was in negotiations and still am in negotiations with glory for new contract so it's is both been a while for us but I've been before that I was like in the microwave we have much more momentum than just the thing about fighting to when guys take a long time off it's almost like they they lose the feel for it they lose energy not obviously they know how to kick they know how to punch they know what to do during shape but there's a feel that they have for the ring for exactly excited this site that this is what people do nice as I can't you step in the ring and that's true but you need detention you need that five of walking towards the ring stepping into ring all those people looking at you at that moment that's a certain type of feeling that you get and he'll be comfortable with it yeah and that that's exactly what it is or it becomes problematic and the older you get the less how old about her now standards in the morning hey Rico a just test at the events really strict when you are when you're there yeah that's that's a little bit easier to pass though there are two because I'm not on it I don't want to stay busy I don't want to think about it but whatever you do I just jump in there and just do what I got to do but that's why I told Lori now and again after this whole issue because a lot of people were caught like last year and they didn't expect that goes like hey we got to keep doing this because this is the way we make the sport clean yes and I think that's what we deserve because yeah we are at we are a good sport we are all athletes but I want to be safe in the ring and what do you mean with say you're going into a fight understand but somebody that uses whatever can maybe just punch a little bit harder in the beginning of the fight or whatever I'm getting more endurance exactly Amazon it one person's not that's you know it's it's a giant Advantage anybody says it's not it's just lying to themselves yeah yeah I'm not even thinking about it and kickboxing two and if there's a fight that I can tell people hey you got to watch you really want to know what kickboxing all about watch this fight the fight because you're such a wild man with such a knockout artist and you obviously one of the most successful ever you know I mean your your kickboxing record and Glory images the highlight reels amazing got so many great fights over there yeah I've been doing so good I really enjoy myself and that's what I said I want to bring kickboxing to a new level like that especially when you go over now and Holland like normally it all I was like soccer or whatever cycling or ice skating that's where parents were bringing their kids to in it this is cool when we go to three years ago what would make a change I think because of the Bonner fight that was so we were getting getting more airtime and after the Bonafide and everything that happened around him and surrounding him like the things you said would happen outside in the club and Disney that he was like the national a****** and that was like the perfect Flash and then of course yeah I beat him so bloated but unsatisfying the way it happened. He gets his arm injured or whatever he thinks happened but like you cuz you're suspicious about it then looking at the other arm and it just it's a fake thing for me but it's like but that's what I have with this whole thing that he tries to create it's like when he's getting announced and everything is like a butter re110 something fights and 90 Knockouts but I'm upset with what I'm doing when I fight an opponent and I'm fighting I'm looking for everything I want know everything about you and everything these days you can find on the internet so when I'm looking on the internet for example you look at Wikipedia and looking all the fight from back in the days K1 days and even before that maybe get to 6075 so where are the other fights does that mean like when you were younger in the youth. You did like 40-something fights did you knock everybody out I don't know my train has been there for years even before that and he doesn't know about it so that's strange because everything is documented on on the end of everything you can find on the internet so soothing is records inflated I think so it's got some crazy Knockouts though he got I think is not as crazy as they make it to me which is crazy because the reality is pretty crazy I mean you don't need to Hype it up any more than it really is Right nobody's been there for years but when I look at it I can't find it but maybe that's all that I'm looking at your suspicious I'm suspicious about because when I look at Wikipedia I don't look at when he was around it starts from when he was around sixteen till now sexy 75 is fine when you look at them in the early days till he was so skinny</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> first fight you had with bar holyshit was that crowd hot that was a wild crowd they even like jump to it that everything went crazy so well-attended in a f*****-up way said his arm was hurting you get an MRI or posted on Instagram I don't know I don't know for me it was yeah you know there was like an anticlimax it wasn't the way I wanted to end that fight but I think for the rest for for him this was the perfect way to end the fight because this is the way you could you could get a rematch would have lost no point in doing the rematch if you would get knocked out no point in doing so and then you eventually one yeah you know but formula for my feeling but walked into the Japs the first round and everything that's true but I was pressuring him I was pressuring him the whole time and I was trying to feel like where is my distance where I can hit and where I can where I get hit so hard sometimes Windows opened up so when you hit it it opened up again so I was like yeah it is what it is I'm not really bothered by it so I was pressuring person and I was like okay now I got now I got it but after the first round and then we jumped into the second one I was fit I was ready for I was ready for this fight and that's what I like to do I would like to drag people into the deep water so you're very fit for a heavyweight you have crazy cardio that's one of the things that I've always admired are you fighting style so you put insane pressure on guys for a heavyweight cuz heavyweights bigger guys tend to fight at a slower pace and less volume but you you push your pace and when the fight gets a third fourth and fifth rounds you f****** pilot on man yeah because I've been training with light guys for like my whole career so when I started at the gym I started it with the Superbowl SportsCenter with Dennis Corral he had Albert Kraus he was the fur K1 Max Champion any Adelphia Lima like multiple middleweight champion world champion so I was working with those guys like everyday and they just can't don't pressure any other or just go with less power and pressure them like they try to pressure me and of course in beginning is like still you get tired but at a certain moment you get like hey this is going better and you have to balance out how hard you swing versus like not going full blast but going to technical or knowing that you can start unloading the third fourth and fifth rounds Eastern Xenoblade but it's for me it's like I'm playing a game for me this is we always say fighting is a thinking man's game because fighting everybody can fight when they have to everybody can fight when does it matter what person when you put them in a corner and it's life-or-death everybody can fight but it's it's so much more than that it's has more than just fighting so and that's how I try to step into the ring with that mentality like he told me it's only an NDC like guys in Mac it with a guy like Nick Diaz like Nick Diaz is famous for not hitting guys hard he just stays on you just stays on you a lot of volume and then you get tired and then they start unloading a big-shot so that's what I like the biggest compliment I could get from an opponent and I had it like for my like my last six upon I got like three or four times this week oh now I understand why you are the champion I thought everybody but this I've never felt before and you're on a different level and that's the biggest compliment I could get because I'm in the in the ring for five rounds with this guy and they they got every Opera need to do everything they drink for with me for five rounds so I didn't knock them out we just fought for five rounds but they just did not know what to do and that's for me the biggest compliment I can get to be Technical and to just play your game exactly yeah I really love your rematch with Jamal Ben saddik was one of my favorite parts this you get tagged in the beginning and then you overwhelmed them and then when you put them away or so I called leash it what a fight what if I thought was that guy's a big motherfuker to that he's a big guy and I lost against in the back in the days and when I was like just a little little kid and so this fight brought something with it as well let's go I'm ready for you so yeah this was the best thing I Need You spit in my face during a press conference so I got some extra motivation for that fight well you played it out perfectly to wear even when he hit you and hurt you early in the fight you stayed calm you didn't get emotional you use good defense and then once you got him into the deep water you stopped in the fourth the fifth fifth round yeah once you got him in the Deep then you piled it on and then put them away the but then again it's the same thing for me if I ask how did you do that you got tags and I said but then again I made a mistake I switched the South Pole but instead of switching and stepping outside of his front like I was right in front of his of his leg and he was just throwing a left right what's training to that that's that's what happened it's not that for my point of view that he X death so it happened and from that moment I can do two things I can think okay I can jump into the fight to try to get that point or whatever that moment back or just thinking my mind like okay this round take it and let's go fresh into the second that's what no just think about okay I lost drama got four more to go and I got back into the corner and my choice hate you back so yep okay he's tired now yeah when he tried to unload on you he emptied out a lot of gas tank that you hurt forgot he's always a dangerous spider that that guy's huge what is you like 696 Southview so maybe that fights going to come but like I said now I'm in like last year the 31st of December my contract was finished with Glory so we've been in negotiations ever since so from that moment on I said in my last contract you guys told me to bother fight was going to happen and it didn't happen so that's what I want first give me the butterfly light and from that moment on we going to discuss</div>

I was blessed to be there in Standing Rock couple of dinner was ago it was one of the marvelous moments in in my life to stand there with them the group there was a multiracial group people came from all around the world and I am inclined from Canada for the most part it was a matter of the indigenous peoples coming together memories of Wounded Knee 1890 over 400 people trying to put pressure on the Obama Administration to ensure that a pipeline was not built that would violate the sacred lands and many of the Sacred memories of indigenous peoples and it was magnificent because you had the coming together of indigenous Nations because part of the problem is that you fall oppress people is fighting among themselves and the difficulty of coming together the first time you had two coming together with significant number of a digit peoples Nations unified against the greedy corporate Elites who are trying to promote this pipeline through Canada all the way down to the southern section the United States and it was his first one we got an announcement right when we were there it was freezing it was December it was freezing up there you're not but no we got an announcement from the Obama Administration for a suspension of it cuz I had planned to do at 2 I mean Obama administration and be very accommodating the Wall Street interests and corporate elead interests and so forth I even given me the image and spectacle of black president being a progressive and what-have-you much more Progressive than Trump that's not saying too much shrimp but we got a suspension and the in the struggle continues really but it was it intended as Citra Mendes ripples through the cultures of indigenous peoples than and their nations in terms of coming together and the fact that it was successful and it was a relative the joy in organizing the joy and fighting for justice the joy in the nightclub the joy in the church has a mass of temples and synagogues Joy is something that we need to come back to that one of the great secrets of The Human Condition what are the sources of Joy with other condition for the possibility of Jordan Rubin obsessed with pleasure for the last two hundred years or so there's nothing wrong with you pleasure but pleasure is not the same thing as Joy at all when you look at the sparkling eyes of your precious daughter that's not pleasure that's Joy you and your wife that's D deep Joy is it that's what indoors you could be broke as the Ten Commandments financially but that memory will bring you Joy that's not pleasure as Joy you and your wife that's D deep Joy is it that's what indoors you could be broke as the Ten Commandments financially but that memory will bring you Joy</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I was blessed to have dialogue with the BB King on a number of occasions his ability the king and lot of ways King not because he was the greatest blues artists but because he was a great Blues artist through his personality and through his generosity was able to create such a presence that he becomes the king in that way I had a chance to see him live you saw him no he was still standing was damaged in the late nineties absolutely the blues was a kind of high school Visa V the Jazz who are those went to college and psychology Majors study strong with Duke don't know about that because they know genius and excellent comes number of different forms most Jazz musicians don't have the genius of a Robert Johnson and yet you know Charlie Christian guitar is more complicated new variety different ways and Robert Johnson to so that you have to be able to be flexible enough to see the differences of development building on the genius of those who came before so you can end up being a very good guitar player who play unbelievable chords that Jimi Hendrix created us but you build it on Jimmy Ryan and it becomes almost not taken for granted but something you can use as a launching pad like Stevie Ray Vaughan did he Heroes great vibration that's a great exam and it's a lot of controversy these days about cultural appropriation okan white brothers and sisters really be part of a black Jean run so far to someone I had to download get my classes at Harvard up this spring while I teach a course of black intellectual tradition and I include them some white intellectuals is part of it strange career of Jim Crow for example by the great C Vann Woodward history of Jim Crow to the Bible the Bible the Civil Rights Movement word was a white Southern brother and I would have to make sure we don't understand completely by the way I can well let me ask you this is Eminem a part of the hip hop Tradition at the highest level in just a Year's yes he is his own distinctive stamp on it all in Oak to be another Righteous Brothers another Average White Band from Scotland why why'd you have to go over to have to go and make me love you and slow soaked in rhythm and blues careers like that today country in South Carolina for brother Bernie and I put it on and it shows again how you know that human spirit is always grounded in something local and particular like black music when it travels is it it's the route and the routes are black but the RO Utes is global</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the more important parts of being a person right is to really your diet of what you take in in terms of what whatever whether it's your art or whether it's your education try to take in the best and most inspirational on the most spectacular versions of human human Endeavors absolute reasons why Sports is a kind of American religion sure because in sports or whatever for I know that you got this you understand the role of Excellence with the Greek god or taste of that place but to be able just to turn on our television and see brother LeBron James doing that's another context that cuts across race class gender and so far LeBron how you do it than memories of Michael Jordan and Jerry West so important late 1960s because he wouldn't go to Vietnam Muhammad Ali along with Richard Pryor the richest it was a free as black and black man the 20th century but the boxing is so crucial as well as the other day of the other sports because for black people every other sphere in the society is unfair and I'm free but when you get in that ring and the referee is fair you finally get Fair competition play Jack Johnson was such a threat remember that Johnson I can write Brothers out there would be racial riots against black folk killing black people all across the country don't you get the idea to just because he beat the white man in the context of fairness you can beat anybody and that goes all the way to Muhammad Ali and that interested while he was a Pioneer because there was none before him Jack Johnson was literally the first all by him by himself and then there was one I think but not as famous but that was taking place at the same time so he would associate himself with the black Freedom Movement color Civil Rights Movement he joined the Nation of Islam under honorable Elijah Muhammad a man came and then became very close to Malcolm X and had to deal with the splits on when ultimately becomes you know I'm Orthodox Muslim but at the same time recognizes his political Consciousness was tied to the Nation of Islam and so forth and for him to do that dissociated with the honorable Elijah Muhammad Nation of Islam probably had about 0.1% approval in the country and probably about four 5% in the black community at that time black Focus black Christians were just afraid of the black Muslims but it was Malcolm X who is in it all of his genius made it so broadly conceived but even Chris just like my Jesus loving free black man but I can't live my life without Malcolm and he's Muslim to the core Ryan's praying 5 times a day Memoirs in history American civilization was very misunderstood the cultural Narrative of who he was absolutely my only credential I changed my mind they're not Devils too many goddamn this Behavior he's right call Lowe's of Devil's baby when he said the first thing he said what he meant he meant what he said when he said the second thing he said what he meant and meant what you said do we have like that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the people that don't suffer in those communities are torn apart of that Community there's a natural inclination to resist they don't want to do anything they don't they don't want to think they're responsible they don't want to think they're part of it then we want to discuss it even discussing it you feel resistance they will it in the state of denial yes trying to avoid when trying to evade know it's it's very very real that's very real but you know what also works with Ian community color this is again why I think we have to resist any monolithic care or homogeneous characterizations of people so they didn't time to talk about white supremacy you got the John Brown's and you know Mary Ellen Pleasant who was a black woman who was worth 347 million dollars in the 1840s why he's called the mother of human rights in California she do she made a rich white brother and he died on but she ended up when may ends about first thing she did she gave John Brown $1000000 John Brown had her in his pocket when he was at Harpers Ferry that's how he survived black communities you got okay 1% of population America loan 41% of the wealth you got three individuals who have wealth equivalent to 160 million fellow-citizens but within the black community the top 1% of Black Folk and what was 70% of the well so that means you got a lot of pressure is Jamal's invitations out there who do our Corto to live vicariously through the lies of black celebrities so it's all about presentation rather than substitute transformation you get that in politician you got a black president all of y'all must be free isn't that a beautiful thing live through him live through the family beautiful achievement magnificent achievement but it's not about symbolic representation only this about fundamental transformation so it's a challenge Mary Ellen Pleasant and others and Martin King and others are challenges for those of us who do have some resources they're still raise our voices because you can be black highly well-adjusted the Injustice economically terms of race and so far and the same is true you can be brown you can be so it's not just a matter of looking for that one individual who represents it's a matter of connecting that representation to from the middle Transformations there's no fundamental transformation you end up the whole generation of peacocks look-at-me look-at-me look-at-me all about for legend what does that do that flows directly into the cultural superficial spectacle last thing we need is just spectacle with no substance in that way and this is a battle within within the communities of peoples of color because it's not it's not going to be a matter of just pointing out white supremacy clause white supremacy part of the country is not the only foundation cuz you got resistance to white supremacy Lydia Maria child she wrote a book in 1834 call and appeal but that class of Americans called Africans it was deeply influenced by one of the greatest works ever written at that time by David Walker appeal to the colored citizens of the world she's a wife sister she is as vanilla as Doris Day in the 1830s fundamental of the black Freedom Movement right we'll see those folk need to be lifted up because what is that do that exposes our Humanity in terms of the choices we make not just the skin color we have now is it the same thing in terms of gender the brothers who are fundamentally concerned about breaking the back of patriarchy we know patriarchy shot through us cuz we grew up in the 1950s and 60s no man escapes but you try to reconquer all the same is true of precious gays and lesbians and trans focus it to be decent human beings who make moral choices I believe in the Primacy of the moral and the spiritual the centrality of the artistic especially the musical and especially the comics as the vanguards who represent a freedom and a courage and a vision to connect us as human beings cuz you can't really be a, what a wholesale Nazi ideology that you can be a Nazi genius like Martin Heidegger who's the Greek philosopher in a genius and a thug when it comes to pop when it comes to politics you see but a comic is got to be able to be open enough to deal with the incongruity and inconsistency at the sheer absurdity of it all you talked about moments of Freedom earlier and I was like one of the greatest things and they're killing his mom where everyone's together there altogether locked up in the last ER and they're all together there this is sense of community that you share with the people that are in the room it does bring people together even if it's for brief moments for a few seconds or how long would it take someone not to be trashed life consists of moment you know what I mean to the memory of what could be as opposed to what's inflation of the great August Wilson about the great playwright blackplayer ex deeply influenced by the blues Baraka and Bearden romare Bearden the great painter and Mary Brock of course from Newark like yourself would like Sarah Vaughan and Philip Roth and used to say that performance authorized this alternative reality authorize this alternative realities for the audience to get them to unsettle their conventional perceptions of the world world and that's what great artist great, but that's what that's what you</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> me and I'm one of the uplifting features of being rooted in the Arts and Music is that no matter how ugly and vicious and hateful things are it never suffocates the human Spirit somebody going to tell a joke and somebody sentimental Hollywood stereotypical way but you know that song by Stevie Wonder these three words you got that man can be kindled to smile open and connect in the world overwhelmed by hatred and distrust that shot the shot through all of us and we all contribute to it we all contribute to it you see that's one of the reasons why I even want to talk about you know brother Trump has any other gang so I called legend of the worst of America in the way in which Martin King represents the best that they are both America's apple pie but any critique of anybody ought to begin with yourself wow he was interested he was there with Mike Tyson and it was interesting cuz it was a chocolate Affair you know that you don't have vanilla brother there to come across to the brother is that it just so glad to be there hanging out with the black Brothers and what it is but a cultural dynamic because he was the richest one in the room and like that got a lot of money with Don King different kind of dynamic embrace you know it because that's the best of Black Culture leonine generation wagon say go back where you come from come on in his sister be part of this Democratic America is going to be red and black people because they are the ones whose undergo the Monstrous crimes against humanity the genocide of stolen land on the one hand and the peoples and the human bondage on the other those are the pill has the worst pillars of the country then you got Democratic Visions coming not just from Thomas Jefferson but they coming from the slaves like Frederick Douglass the Border crisis is a very interesting one right because it's represents the the fear of people from the downtrodden countries where they they don't have opportunity trying to get into this country but it also represents fear of criminals of drug dealers and gangsters and gang members make cartel members making the way across in and victimizing our citizens and make it as if the ladder represent so sad because he has a brother who speaks his whole personal identity on Christian being a Christian calling to question your Christian faith in nothing I don't have the authority to do that but the Bible says in part by The Works you shall know them the works of Love they exemplify and you do nowadays you got commodified Christianity had to come out and fight culture of a declining Empire and you get Christian evangelicals 91% of So Pro Trump 79% sees that he's doing the best possible job and you said yourself how Christianity lost meaning of the Cross and it's become so accommodating to the Empire and it was the Roman who put Jesus to death Roman Empire you had some Neil Colonial Elites who cooperated but it was a Roman Empire who put Jesus to death it was Envy greatest Empire of its day very much like the Persian Empire the largest greatest Empire of each day with Cyrus degree now you got the Roman Empire putting Jesus to death and hear Jesus is sent there by The Crowd by the mob and you say the best of Michael Pence so you going to, date yourself to Donald Trump you going to accommodate yourself to policies that are so inhumane and barbaric just to retain your position and kind of dinner rationalizing as a Christian we need some music and some comedy to try to get in contact with his Humanity to change him but most importantly you know you need to get him out of office you need an ability but with Pantages seeing him in reaction to those people just a failure perspective cold death Dallas some other narrative is that they broke the law in there that they're imposing Upon Our great nation and you know this is its crimes of opportunity to just trying to the trying to find opportunity to try and they're coming over here because they want a better life to not have sympathy for that and other than indigenous people then though I've been in my own African peoples that is the history and bring into the country those who are eager and have energy willing to work and sacrifice and a unbelievable contribution of voluntary immigrants to the making of American American that a nation of immigrants I don't like that language overlooks Brian voluntariamente like black people and end in slavery was not America's original sin that's another neoliberal lie that you hear all the time on the corporate media giphy indigenous people suffering has to be rendered invisible to highlight black people what's one of the least disgusting justices of the alcohol they reach music and poetry and resisted but the the social conditions are just but this beat they are the casualties of a settler Colonial Enterprise and we'd rather act as if they don't exist I mean we black people became Central because our Labour and our imagination and culture became Central and we had a ball bearing Civil War 750,000 people that have each like Precious and that has been the central event in the shaping of America but when people talk what race it goes straight to Blackness as if it did in his peoples and redness not intrical to it's just that they've been busy so invisible and the vicious attack has been so immense what's so complicated to that they have their own rules on the reservations they're allowed to have gambling they can have all sorts of they they have their own sovereignty in a certain way on the reservation is very odd don't know is true I was blessed to be there in Standing Rock though it was one of the marvelous moments in in my life to stand there with them the group there's a multiracial group people came from all around the world and I am inclined from Canada for the most part it was a matter of the indigenous peoples coming together memories of Wounded Knee 1890 over 400 people to remind people pipeline was not built that would violate the sacred lands and many of the Sacred memories of indigenous peoples and it was magnificent because you had two coming together of indigenous Nations because part of the problem is that you fall oppress people is fighting among themselves and the difficulty of coming together the first time you had to coming together a significant number of indigenous peoples Nations unified against the greedy corporate Elites who are trying to promote this pipeline through Canada all the way down to the southern section the United States and it was his first one we got an announcement right when we were there it was freezing to me was December 15th or whatever it was it was we got an announcement from the Obama Administration for a suspension of it cuz I don't plan to do at 2 I mean Obama administration can be very accommodating the Wall Street interests and corporate elead interests and so forth I even given the image and spectacle of black president being a progressive and what-have-you much more Progressive than Trump that's not saying too much shrimp but but we got a suspension and the in the struggle continues real but it was it a tennis Ascent tremendous ripples through the cultures of indigenous peoples and their nations in terms of coming together and the fact that it was successful and it was Lisa relative Victory it was beautiful and organizing the joy fighting for justice the joy in the nightclub the joy and the churches and Masa temples of synagogue Joy is something that we need to come back to that one of the great secrets of The Human Condition what are the sources of Joy what are the conditions for the possibility of Jordan Rubin obsessed with pleasure for the last two hundred years or so there's nothing wrong with with pleasure but pleasure is not the same thing as Joy at all you look at the sparkling eyes of your precious daughter that's not pleasure that's Joy you and your wife that's deep deep Joy is it that's what indoors you could be broke as the Ten Commandments financially but that memory will bring you Joy that's not pleasure as Joy you and your wife that's deep deep Joy is it that's what indoors you could be broke as the Ten Commandments financially but that memory will bring you Joy</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you think that much like this country is an experiment and self democracy a very recent experiment when you look at human history right there hundreds of thousands of years that we've been human there's really only been a couple years is a hundred years of this that's how you do think that that's maybe the lens that we should look at something like Democratic socialism through not that it can't work but that it hasn't been implemented correctly before that's exactly that's what we got to get beyond the ears of you're absolutely right see what makes not just United States experiments all around the world and very circumstances we become Central stage because we become a world power that understands itself as a democracy with all the contradiction that go ahead and Adama that begin as a settler Colonial Enterprise still got slavery patriarchy workers don't have the right to engage in collective bargaining United States until the 1930s love you down there and they know that collective bargaining why robber barons in our pain relief with soap do ruling class Harry Bridges longshoreman strong Union Jack London of the great socialist at Oakland right and what were they trying to do there was just trying to ensure that ordinary people getting access to job for the living wage peace and education thing that the children of the well-to-do have they have the same value of course there's a Christian for me they have exactly the same value how will they get it will here come so she was movement such thing first thing you want to do is against child labor laws that's the jungle Upton Sinclair they were dying at 30 it with no laws against child labor and working 7 days a week so the labor movement brought us the weekend and I'm not talking about the singer from Canada God bless you I'm talking about the two days we have off because if we didn't have that from the Socialist movement in the labor movement that have been working two young kids 7-Day they did that year after year decade after decade that's greed nobility see that's where that whole idea of the let the market decide falls apart because the market just wants profit right that doesn't mean that markets cannot be used in Democratic ways but they need to be ethical but they got be ethical you got to have some accountability and Regulation and child labor laws were very important breakthroughs at that time of your other you you had to do you need to have lost make sure the water was clean the food was regulated is a narrative that you get from poor people often or people that are lower middle-class that are against the concept of socialism because they equate it with people that want a free ride that's way they equated with people that don't want to work hard that Trend that that's it's a strange narrative when you consider all the things we talked about already like the what we need with the fire department in the police department and all the different ways that socialism does form utilities and different ways of socialism does form part of our culture and our community why do you think that that is this narrative and how does that narrative get reshaped because that Narrative of that the only reason why people want socialism is because they want a free ride that's a wonderful question but one is that you had first we have to listen very closely to right-wing brothers and sisters and conservatives and Midler's because oftentimes human meat like anybody else and then had their own arguments I don't think they have strong ones but they have their own argument so the first thing you say about that is what makes you think that the well-to-do don't have free rides what is inheriting wealth all about the connections are getting into the prep schools and then Ivy League schools in what even though they work is still a kind of free ride if they're preoccupied with this issue being free ride we tell him let's make sure that people do work hard and sacrifice and therefore in some way deserve what they have now if just based on that principle the upper echelons of American society would be indicted body individually I hate greed I hate Injustice I hate white supremacy I hate anti-jewish Prejudice I hate anti-palestinian pressures I hate patriarchy and so forth but the human beings would eat ideologies filtered through are still human being 750 billion dollar military budget Democrats voted for it to how much waste is in the military why is $0.60 of every $1 coming out of federal balanced-budget tied to the military why is his note close oversight and accountability of it how come American people don't know about the four countries that we are bombing or assisting other countries and bami wing write down pakistan-afghanistan Yemen absolutely Mali Niger Somalia on and on and on how come we don't know about the 4800 military units 587 around the world we got us Special Operations in 128 countries on 197 in the world I'd hardly any talk about it what about the innocent luigia hardly any talk about it what about the drones that we will drop it and not always on Military combatants but innocent people sometimes even disproportionately those are precious people to they have the same it's a robot doing it absolutely done long-distance remotely no hearing sensitivity at all remote drone operators is pretty profound to I waiting for the body of someone just killed in Afghanistan that Italian family in Chicago one of the saddest things you want to see in your life man has a family lined up and they bringing the body out and you said yourself how come there's no public Spotlight on that you see what I was growing up in the 60s Walter Cronkite Vietnam we saw the bodies during the Bush Administration is it illegal to take photographs of flag-draped coffins exact which is unbelievably insane that's exactly right and continue to under Obama and Company you know you say what wait a minute they are pandas ultimate cost and the change the narrative the tears of the families and they can't even put a public Spotlight on it. And then of course they lie to us as we are drones or not anyway killing civilians and end up killing an American and they have a press conference the same day in economic compensation for the family the rest of their life I agree with that but what about the drones that are killing folk and Yemen and Somalia in Pakistan and Afghanistan all they denied or even killing them and said quit lying that's John Brennan &amp; Company using both Bush and Obama administration to see how do we keep track of those in the name of what democratic accountability that's not socialism socialism is democratic accountability but there's been socialism without Democratic accountability and what do you get tyranny that's Soviet Union and Company but when you get capitalism with no Democratic accountability what do you get you get a predatory capitalism with gross wealth inequality and everyday people to master the poor and working people fighting for crumbs and is also this denial of it amongst the most patriotic they don't people dumb asses p*** working people fighting for crumbs and is also this denial of it amongst the most patriotic they don't want to consider it they don't want to beg factored in to what we think of when we think of America the great we don't you want you don't want two-factor in those innocent people which I was the last time we checked it was in the 90% right of people that are there are killed by drones are actually innocent it's it's some insane number</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> problem is this that though if we have to view Democratic socialism as a moment in the larger movement of democracy my dear brother just out as one of the great job philosophers and thinkers of democracy cause an egalitarian Freedom traditions and that's simply a way of saying that if you look at the world through the lens of masses of people who are poor and working people what are the conditions under which they can have security from domination what are the conditions under which they can have dignity by holding forms of Oppression at arm's length and for me it's not an ism in capitalism Visa V feudalism can generate Liberties and freedoms I'm forward and that's precisely what the middle classes did broken feudalism in Europe or Brooklyn feudalism in other parts of the world right you have to overthrow kings and queens in the name of personal Liberties but those personal Liberties were confined to often to White Brothers with property in the white brothers with no property that you were trying to hold on to their whiteness will it become like the white brothers with property or they make moral choices and said I want to be a person of Integrity I want to fight with the folk are being excluded and this is one of the problems and talk about race and white supremacy in America because you see we think too often and monolithic categories there's never been a white supremacy without fighting against white supremacy and that includes white brothers and sisters there's a tradition from and Brayden from Myles Horton of Highlander Center you got that wonderful picture of Rosa Parks she was at Highlander Center 4 months before she was arrested before she sat down on the bus in order to stand up for Justice right there Highlander Center undermount sewing who is Myles Horton white brother who brought black folks and white folks together went to Union Seminary training on the Reinhold niebuhr he had cousins in the Ku Klux Klan wow Thanksgiving dinner Rabbi Abraham Joshua help test show me Edwards I eat a whole traditional white Brother since we've been fighting is white supremacy you get it in the music back to buy their back he sitting at the feet of Louis Armstrong and he's a great artist Lewis Genius of geniuses and that middle-class brother from Iowa you ask him about white supremacy us Brubeck about white supremacy you ask any of the above Paul Desmond all of these folks who are connected to nations in which black Humanity Brown humanity is seen and affirmed you have a point in the book Race Matters that resonated with me that I never really thought of before and what you said was that because of the fact that the United States has this deep history of slavery in the slavery of African Americans that white people became white people instead of Polish and German and Italian instead of it being most other countries where they the Italians think of themselves as Italians and the Greeks are the Greek those were white people they're all combined as why people I never thought about that before though it would have been you've got these colors of American studies the way in which whiteness was created take for example an Irish brother close. Ellis Island has people been dealing with 800 years of vicious British colonialism imperialism vicious attacks there is famine is that in some ways created or at least at labeled and so on they get to New York and their toes that their whiteness in the house because we know the British or white we not British you are where you going to go on the Jim Crow bus and you just get off the boat from Ireland to go to the front you with vanilla folk you go to the back you with the chocolate for what you going to do and for our presses Jewish brother and sisters it wasn't even more complicated Holocaust Axe and sword but didn't they get disability are we going to be in the back with the black folk some of them did you see cuz you got a rich tradition of progressive Jews was it don't jump to it got back with what I got back there with the black focus group well we kind of lukewarm this is kind of move back and forth and then someone or simulate completely especially the highbrow German Jews were actually White you're in America now get beyond that old-world prejudice is a well you better check yourself cuz every Christian civilization we know is shot through with Jewish hatred don't don't believe the hype sooner or later it's going to be manifest you say that me and someone that way you can see the the discourse of whiteness Blackness Brown this redness and so forth becomes so so deeply rooted American law American Structures American perceptions and this is why the Arts also crucial because it's primarily in the music and then the Arts where the breakdown of white supremacy begins to take place in the country not the politicians it really isn't it really is it is no accident that the first massive form of entertainment in the United States is what the minstrel in blackface black Freedom the black Freedom somehow means less freedom for white there's a fear black creativity cuz that means maybe white supremacy July maybe they're human just like us maybe they just as creative imaginative and intelligent just like us then they hear the music and they say they got something going on the black side of town and we don't know it's like you go to see prior right somebody told you or brother Joe tells you that black. black intelligent black jeans doesn't exist and you go see pride with your parents are you going to waste making somebody lied to me I got to recognize that and then you recognize the whole tradition of Prior and Iran from the Coltrane on and on and on right and yet the structures make it difficult for us to come together we talked about up until 1960 that's a long time to 1776 1964 5 as a long time for both slavery and Neo slavery to be in place and here we are now 54 years later trying to create a multi-racial democracy which is a beautiful beautiful thing and it's already been enacted and in jazz groups Sly Stone's bands multiracial the combination that the study of the comments that you all have you sit down with Comics y'all talk about the genius across race and gender gender is if it's a natural thing that already shatters the white supremacist in the next in males premises categories of politeness black that's all in different silos but it's so hard to do it on the ground be part of the problem about race in America swap in very critical of a number of the Contemporary black intellectuals because white supremacy cut so deep in the culture people begin to think it has magical powers and somehow it it did just floats above American history as if it's just part of our DNA in a biological way but all conceptions of race in the modern world are grounded in predatory capitalism so that the talk about whiteness Blackness becomes a way of rationalizing social structures like slavery and Jim Crow and it has to do with trying to extract labor resources is an attack on their humanity and identity but it's tied to economic structure so to talk only about race means we hide and conceal the social structures that are generating unbelievable suffering for everybody everybody you see and so after the last thing you want is to talk about race I say something about gender in the way genius much more complicated because gender has been around for so so long every culture that we know almost but in modern conceptions of race are tied the modern conceptions of predatory capitalism here and abroad which include impaired Listen to Cruise Empires the United States comes out of the British Empire we engage in their heroic richest revolt against the British Empire it was a magnificent struggle that's what I like

		<div class="paragraph"> hold up by the Donald Trump of Gangsta over and over again and I and I say that because there's a gangster inside of me I got to reconquer it everyday why do gangsters when I see you grabbing a woman's parts that's gangster you Virginia inauguration you said all you talk about the Four Sisters in Congress saying we'll evil Jews no evil Jews they said evil doings of Israel every nation state has done some evil things right if there's a Palestinian state which I hope there is there going to do something evil things patients that has been associated with certain from the barbarism we know that but there's some good things some wonderful things about Israel some wonderful things about Palestinian to the formation of creating a state as well think about America a lot of people say they love American Music you ask sister to leave you a sister Priestly y'all Love Aretha Aretha Franklin means the world to me what about bear Jake Mary J means the world Mary J and the reefer or as American as Donald Trump even more in some way they've been hell off the deaf people been that 10 generation it is first drama which is conflict emotionally felt and critically reflected upon but is that conflict is rooted in incongruity things don't fit so that's a possibility of hypocrisy right and we know where apocracy is attribute of Vice to Virtue so that your standards and you fall short so you can laugh at it now when it's really deep comedy it don't buy The Human Condition see that's a deeper thing they'll see that's what you get check off and Shakespeare and Joyce and the blues Because deep comedy is the recognition of Memphis and incongruity at the highest levels of the Mind heart and soul that's a different thing don't even start with comedy with you know the clown it was who walk around slipping on bananas or the sophisticated professor doesn't realize that he got a banana hanging out the back of his pocket when he's lecture with the students everybody laugh and you don't know what's going on with us bodily base comedy farts and bananas and so far it's important but High comedy is the highest levels of human dignity love thought music mathematics metaphysics and then recognize all of those are congruous they're broken their fractured this dramatic conflict of incongruity at the highest levels of we are the species now that's deep stuff wrestling with in the Tower of London before he was executed in this dialogues on tribulation Socrates never said that to you what does that mean the founder of philosophy in the modern West has a love of wisdom but he never loves people because it's impossible to love human beings and not your tears you go to your mama's funeral and you're not shedding tears and you're committed to the socratic ideal of self-mastery and self-control you need to get up the crack pipe get off show her the depth of your love for her through being outside of yourself master the tears will flow you said the other way is like your daughter this precious thing that you got we walk here for your daughter when she graduates you and your wife will have tears of joy that at the moment for self-mastery yeah I come from black but we start with cries and so for the Hebrew scripture begins with the cries of oppressed people to write but then Jesus in his rage crucial does weep as one of the most profound versus and and then in the Christian Bible why Jesus wept unlike Socrates why did Jesus weep you went for Jerusalem he wept for Lazarus he left what Forest friends but Jesus hides and conceals his merge that's what Justin says in the Bible Isaac means laughter but it's hard to catch Jesus laughing without none of the synoptic gospels have Jesus laughing some people thought they discerned a grin somewhere cuz he turn Wine Into Water he probably had a little Grand on it think about what you're saying here is the complexity of human beings and when you're dealing with the situation between these girls are called himself the squad and Donald Trump and you deal with these very simplistic things like these chance of send her back or lock her up or they hate America or you know this this is simplifying things is is so attractive to some people and so attractive during political discourse right to during these These Times we're trying to Rally champagne and get get get the audience behind you this is when these simplistic things resonate but as a human being we know that things like I don't I don't subscribe to this idea that human beings are good or bad I think there's always either way I like the way Donald Trump sisters that would not want to share manipulation of domination is no doubt as a human being it's important to keep track of his Humanity I'll be at the same time what happens to the dominant patterns of behavior this is me about American Empire and head of the government is dominant patterns of behavior that are completely unaccountable people so long he's been able to get away but things I would no accountability at all that's what makes him a kind of up Peter Pan like figure until he became president he just hasn't grown up they love it I think they love it is exciting that the first thing that was able to do was to expose the prepackaged Commodities that we call politicians what can I tell the elite circulate in American Empire but then when they discovered lo and behold he now he's posing himself as some kind of oppositional figure and yet you tied the big money tied to Big military when it gets in he brings in the old school military people he still dropping bombs on the nine countries have been dropping bombs for the last number of years tax cuts out exactly the same dimension McConnell and others wanted he thought we had something different here you see and it has to do with the what woman's largest or do we have to be honest about this that we live in both a very fragile and precious experiment in democracy and we live in an Empire that is experiencing profound decline Decay and deterioration the simultaneous Deacon from the very beginning United States was really in some ways I'm much more tied to gold and resources and land and so this rig crucial Democratic experiment is predicated on the monsters crime against indigenous people that would never come to terms with so you get a lot of neoliberal chatter about America's original swim slavery that's a lie when was we had to decide whether we were going to coexist with indigenous peoples or dominate them and the decision was for the most part genocide oil effect in terms of domination so it's a settler colonial society a colony of Britain then we Enslaved the Africans who become the basis of our economy and the vast majority of profits made were actually tied to slavery that's why so many residence Force presidents in American slaveholders in the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and slaveholders and so forth that that doesn't mean that certain democratic practices were not being an active but it was an active for White Brothers with property the Wright brothers who had no property they couldn't vote at all the women of course couldn't vote until the 1920s domestic households in which they had to find some sense of fulfillment that's what the history of patriarchy misogyny connected and then tremendous efforts come to expanding expanding it this is why you would win brother Trump talks about socialism feed unrealized the Pledge of Allegiance was written by Francis Bellamy who was a socialist the song America the Beautiful with the one of those beautiful song Ray Charles sing that song it take you to a different Elizabeth Lee Bates socialist Professor Wellesley who was our greatest poet Walt Whitman Pete Isaac socialism who was our greatest philosopher John Dewey Democratic Socialist his whole life Helen Keller deaf mute blind graduated Radcliffe socialist Reinhold niebuhr the greatest Christian think of the 20th century democratic call Mandy Moore Society Martin Luther King jr. Democratic Zone Ella Baker Democrat Democratic socialism is as American as apple pie but with the Communists and the Communist threat and the Soviet Union and all this repression and regimentation and violation of Liberties and killing of the culottes and so far in the American mind socialism so you saw brother Lindsay the other day Ray you look like a cartoonist version of of of Joseph McCarthy what happens if you can define a community is pure and then characterize those on the outside or threatening as in pure and then view yourself as those coming to the rescue to preserve the Purity you can be back Grace gealey based on religion you can be based on politics preserve that Purity we saw it in the fifties with the hysteria comments for what Smith Act are deported or they taking the jail make the first the first city councilman from Harlem Benjamin Davis went to jail because he was a communist because they were the en pure looks like the Soviet Union and China on the mile that support so long but at the same time when you look at call Marks and his critique of capitalism me this is prior to let it prior to styling product uses capitalism it's time to this obsession with Prophet that puts profit before people and it will generate oligopolies in which there will be grow test levels of wealth inequality and the only way to p*** working people will be able to gain access to any resources organizing immobilizer and you can accept that Marcus and say what I've been a Marxist just telling the truth just hasn't been implemented correctly because argument has always been show me a socialist economy or socialist government that ever worked right right but right there's so many people that find the idea of socialism attractive because it combines this idea of a community with a nation and that we're all there's so many people that find the idea of socialism attractive because it combines this idea of a community with a nation and that we're all tied together and we we obviously have some socialist aspects to our civilization in terms of like utilities and their litter</div>

Roddy McGee from Vegas to DIY the UFC stuff to go do you know how crazy that is is like your tears gone doesn't exist anymore that's I kind of see that I don't know they know that you have this injury like maybe you have to ask for it I bet it's like if you ignore one of your top guys you would want us to be back healthy best as we can possibly be shows are prohibitively expensive for the UFC either if you talk to dr. Davidson or dr. Me I'll connect you with dr. McGee didn't know they were too. Why does new stuff now called Wharton's jelly that is even more powerful than any of the previous stem cell one that I had that s*** shot in my shoulder to the states all the states yeah cuz I got way more potent than it was five years ago cuz I'm way more you had a guest on and they were talking about going to Neil Riordan it's it's heavy s*** man they can they do IV stem cells to they do a gang s*** down there so let me ask you so what exactly does it help does it help with like regenerate soft tissue so like would that be like a tendon ligament tendons ligaments muscle injuries things along those lines they can run around ligaments regenerate tissue tears you know I got the stuff where you ordinarily would have to get things so not like he's a perfect example my friend John his wife had a labrum tear to shed a tear play remember hip and the doctor saying like most likely we're going to have to fix this going to be a big deal it's going to be like months off your feet like you have to you can't put any weight on it for I think like six to eight weeks or something like that well she got exosomes shot in there and then when they went in for the second MRI there's nothing no injury God 3D freaking so she had a little bit of a deformity in the bone of her hip that was causing an irritation against the labrum they sanded down that part of the hip that was kind of bothering they they like cat away the part of the bone that's intruding on the labrum so then clears the path so not that invasive a surgery and then six weeks later she's good to go home and she's rehabbing and everything and she still like they still had to cut her open a little bit Yeah but the big one was the labrum tear and all that was fixed play the part of the bone that sucks intruding on the labrum so that clears the path tells of not that invasive a surgery and then six weeks later she's good to go home and she's rehabbing and everything it should still like they still had to cut her open a little bit Yeah but the big one was the labrum tear and all that was fixed</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> try to do a good job of bobbing and weaving moving my head is slipping off the Centerline we don't realize kicks to you keep guys on the outside you have a weird Style I have a family of this I think there's plenty of us now. My dad my dad just had a newborn son I s*** you not he's 57° out of this f****** bird that's one and all the boys grew up we had this karate takes VHS tapes and we would imitate the characters and will black where the drunken master or where the white tiger white lion we have to do that fight Styles flexible and do like spinning back kick jumping off the couches and s*** like that and I think that might have trees because I was like we did that for years but that was the most combat we did we didn't do any like wrestling nothing traditional at all before I ever got in the martial arts to do that same thing I said throw kicks with my friend I don't know what I was doing but it's fine you like watch a Bruce Lee movie what's a you have a traditional martial arts background and what the way you throw kicks like you throw kicks like a guy who started throwing kicks when you were really young yeah but they're right you were drawn right which ones would you say like your roundhouse kicks your front kicks have great front kicks man you really good at keeping guys off of you give good movement you know I can't you got a style that's a unique style like so when when guys have to fight you there oh this guy is going to be kicking at me from the outside he moves a lot Bobs and weaves hard to hit it got a lot going on with your style very tiring energy you must have put out in that fight than he did you throw an amount of jumping back and forth and leaping in leaping out like that that's all I can file metrics it's a ton and that the good things credit till like the training that we do you know we get to I get to the right work I got that guy in a Rob Dibble show me who's a freaking psycho that guy does not get tired we called the machine for a reason with me cardio push and he'll be in there and grab two three sometimes four more bodies to spar with them like this guy just doesn't f****** stop he's out of his f****** but I didn't know exaggeration this guy is out of his butt is the reason why my car get your cardio top notch very tiring style but we do a lot of work I do my own strength and conditioning just from having a background in physical education in SUNY Cortland so do your own since I was a mature like writing my own thing won't program to like work on isometric squeezes and different type of explosive muscle endurance workouts and stuff like static holds like holding on on the Boulevard and going out to punches or I put together pretty decent program has been working I can't complain so when you do it how do you design it is the designer for the entire Camp what do you set it out everyday like where you want to be and you adjust it depending on how you feel and injuries like how do u d a b schedule that exactly like that when I'm further out from the camp or not in Camp it or I'll do more lifting and I'll lift heavy and I don't need no more of that thing that's just like stupid for four Fighters it doesn't make a whole lot of times I'm not going to bench press somebody off my back you know you don't but the training camp and just to hear the the close to the fight and I don't mind like sharing this because I think guys they make it more complicated than what it should be like I sometimes I see all these crazy s*** on like I just don't understand the whole necessity behind you in that but I know I don't know physical strength conditioning doctor or anything like that but what I've seen that works for me I just try to mimic everything that I feel in a fight and implement it into a workout I figure out which way is I could do that weathers band push ups box John's wool suits wall sits get up with two plates so I'm sitting down on my butt and I do like a technical stand up and I use the walleye push-ups with a lot of leg work a lot of cool wearing and who played with two places f***** up it's sometimes I like I come there and I can do it by myself in the morning I go to the laundromat by myself why am I putting myself through this impact on the body this is what I feel and I feel when I do this I know such a drastic difference from one sparring session to the next But to answer your question like I adjusted I'll do it for my legs are on fire and I feel like they really beat up from sparring I'll do more upper body and then if my fill my other buys more beat up by a switch it off to the lower body and if I feel like I'm fresh like I had a good week I'd make a tennis ball on a Saturday and I come in freshwater Monday I'll hit it hard and do full body everything and I'll give myself five rounds of pushing it by separating two round play the five around so I do every single minute but I'll do about 40 40 depending on how far I am from from the fight if I'm like just on the trachea I don't kill myself I want to ease my way into it so I'll start like anywhere from like 30 35 seconds to like 50 seconds and that 10-second window or that other 30-second window is my time to recover and get to the next station and I'll just wrap whatever I'm doing burnout burnout I'll do the Met Ball between my legs I'll do the foam roll in my house Exquisite assembly the redneck ancho can I do for 2 minutes intervals to piss out of it so you can't do it but you do to failure and you're on guitar you switch to go to the other side and you switch your lazy figure for it you scissor two legs so you give yourself a different type of stimulation to your body to kind of account for everything that you may possibly be in for the fight and you never know was like something I did a lot of grappling but I also did a lot of punch and I thought to myself it might be a chance it might be a possibility that do not get paid to the ground right now I'm just happy I did it for us to take down cuz that would have fatigue me even more as like if it comes it comes but we did I did a lot of output just bring out their own in that muscle endurance coming using that Floyd Mayweather structure of a workout just getting that to have you back out like High Point count in a 5-minute round and I'll do that for a couple rounds in a couple times a week and I think you implement that with the lateral for work that we do in the cage and just staying on your bike and having people like like stalk you and like not going crazy but control do you like books or they throwing a 1/2 and you got to like down side-to-side and get out the way so it's a lot of like at least I think it's practical for what you going to actually see when you get in a fight and I think shore-nuf a lot of things we did pretty much happen in a fight just as long as it's a great idea where you maybe got to got an arm triangle or something like that and it's that close to whether you get it Arias case it's like how long can you keep it down you know when you're caught in something it's like you're almost had to happen to go let's go a little bit longer long squeezes like my friend Scott Epstein he's always been a big fan of slow slow workout the kill do chin-ups like this like super slow I think that's why they call it super slow and it might take into minutes for the entire time you stole that long-term squeeze endurance like bugs and that makes sense if everything is fast and exploding but then you get a rear naked and you have that like continue to compress or a guillotine we could have came to squeeze as different as such a difference is such a different feels kind of it is exactly at my Bryan Caraway Fight 3 work out of that fight before the fight in the back room work by I just want to be so prepared so I knew was a biggest fight of my life I knew if I beat him and finish them I'll probably going to get a tire size for now undefeated coming up through finishes and I knew if I finished him I'm more likely going to get any line me up to because the next week I want to Fox and I was supposed to talk about the Dominick Cruz vs Urijah Faber fight which I went but the fight didn't go my way so it kind of like a Bittersweet taste to it so turn my one morning ShakeOut 15-20 minutes is what I do now just get the food movie to my system so that my body can get like just feel like it's more alive again like he does during training camp I think I think that fight easily done first round or even a second cuz you survive the first I think the second round I think I get them out of there but it's just experience in all learning and become more mature about the game and trusting your training do you think that has anything to do with yourself if you have a legit strength great Mastiff now I just started doing stuff with a p Eye Center in Brandon Davis he 45 or 42 B and he's a busy or something raise your resting heart rate where you burn the most fat and calories or whatever you want to call it and not so big when I was standing next to him I couldn't believe you makes 135 since then I was actually pretty upset I was like what this guy go back up to your weight class get that big what does he say is bananas man he is so gigantic</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah but the thing is is Seagal was a legit Aikido specialist was just at keto like that's what people just because a guy seems kind of silly you forget like he had a real legit history it was a was the first American Table ever teach at a dojo in Japan in Japanese and he's illegitimate Aikido Master like 100% absolute legitimate Aikido Master the thing is Aikido is just not something that perfectly to MMA what is a Seagal best Aikido with Russian national Aikido team is 100% legitimate we see I would have I would like almost discredit everything just based on that one parody thing just a joke that shows a joke yeah but mean break the wrist walk away Segal as an older man who is overweight go to Steven Seagal when he was really young this black and white footage of him teaching at a dojo in Japan there it is he is 100% legit and has not the best martial art for self-defense is just not that it has its applications and its applications he's a master at it much like Jiu-Jitsu has its applications but it's not great for kickboxing right Taekwondo has its applications but it doesn't work but if you learn how to do it those techniques can apply if you know all the other stuff will if you know all the other stop this m*********** has some real s*** it's just whether or not you have to be so good at all the other stuff that you could utilize this obviously he's showing this technique is showing knife defense and stuff like that but this is a 100% legit technique he's good man I mean not good not good he's outstanding he's like keto is outstanding the real question is how effective is Aikido I am still like I can't get past the the joke's on the front keg and this is how I get past that for someone who doesn't have an objective understanding of how people view them just me and George St. Pierre wanted to learn how to throw a attorney sidekick for me by the way I know how to do it and then when I did it he was like holy s*** I was like yeah this is what I used to do so but me showing them that I mean I'm under No Illusion I could kick George St-Pierre is asking me up every day of the week I have this one thing and I can show you that I bet you can't do the way I could do it and I can show you how to do it but I'm not like you know like what Seagal how did them having the confidence confidence to execute that to choose to do that like you're in a situation guys Conforti choose to spin you got to be so rock solid with your understanding that technique you're not going to get that without years and years and years and years and years of drilling it could be a death sentence enough life combat fist fight so time to page on this fight when he came at me and I stepped back and I did like a Hopping spinning back kick like the one you write a whole head bigger mousasi with him like right on the Belt not exactly where I wanted to hit till out to land in the picture my foot slides down looks like a kick him in the balls but it was like right above like the Beltline if I just got a little bit more I would have probably dropped you practiced at like in from the bag oh yeah but then I will have someone holding the shield like 20 minutes control like a stationary Target but also somewhat moving so it's more practical cuz I was just going to stand in front of me but I can't just spinning back kick me to the curb</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so oddly enough I think that part of what makes MMA so exciting is that there is crazy consequences see how the reasons why when you see like Mazda dial knocks out Ben askren with a flying knee part of why I was so exciting like he's hurt bad it's not that he's going to be fine nothing's no damage from this whatsoever real damage like he went out cold instantly and they got punched in the face twice it's terrible but it's part of what makes a sport so exciting is that you realize these guys are so brave to face these potential consequences makes it it makes it is like an added element of danger that makes it exciting this is very true but it's man I feel so bad for him when that when I saw that cuz it kind of brought back memories for myself I was like I know exactly what that feels like I don't remember it yeah I just don't remember that Landing ice I solve like right before it lands and is like you know those movies when it goes it was at this very moment you realize Hospital yeah I heard them say the same thing I was like this is not just me it I guess you just a really bad knockout him shooting forward and Mosby's all jumping in to make a car crash Runnings full clip of the 40-yard – running full clip and perfect placement the knee and you don't get it cleaner knockout and just the way he did it like he was showing a video of him practicing it and say he had like three different scenarios of how they could have went like Mastiffs Viking tactical like there's not a lot of people who are that's a rainbow when it comes to the game I think the way he broke that down was just super impressive and he kind of lost him to sleep like his hands behind his back I loved every second of that cuz you weren't sure what was about to happen I was on the edge of my seat that was my main event fight and he just comes out exercise stuff like this drifts off to the right and a 40-yard – and finally chaos it was for me too because it's so important for the welterweight division yeah where's like Jon Jones vs Thiago Santos Santos was an interesting fight and turned out to be a great fight but it was an interesting five because you like okay how is Jon Jones going to beat this guy and is this guy going to be wild enough to catch Jon Jones but when you looked in a paper John was a prohibitive favorite when you looked at askren Vs monster doll you like man I don't know</div>

I mean that's that's one of the ones I'm like 90% sure yes it's gone gone gone. It's out there in the woods waiting for Bigfoot and zippers it's weird man he's 100% believer now Survivorman bigfoot show Finding Bigfoot was on TV for what how to breathe underwater the shows about breathing underwater can you breathe underwater not yet next season though we're going to try again to breathe underwater f****** them trying to get out looking around and I want to see it like in Destiny like the mushrooms trip where he's like walking and singing with him Pick of Destiny I would want to be there at 1 want to see it with my own eyes out video I be like man I saw a 80 ft tall Donald Trump with a Hillary Clinton head we can't prove to me that videos real I would ship my pants I don't know what I would say though if I was in the woods and I was camping and I saw a f****** 9-foot tall gorilla I don't know what it was that you wouldn't I mean if you came back a living thing that has to be a living population of them don't live that long is a primate that lives any older than humans we're just we're just wind of the ways we know it doesn't exist drones and scanning the forest and stuff parts of Oregon if he was any way he be up there you know it's a thick forest in the Pacific Northwest which is one of the reasons why I think it's so attractive because it's like you think like man he think being here no one knows like you go outside of Philadelphia but there's another one anyway those big-ass mountains filled with soup it's like a box of Q-tips just one after the other bang bang bang bang bang in the forest floor is all pine needles so the nothing would leave a footprint front and then you looked like what if you saw something 30 yards away it could disappear instantly left right you would know where the f*** it is you never find it and it could be it could be out there so I think that also leads to this this delusional idea that it might be alive leave a footprint and then you look alike what if you saw something 30 yards away it could disappear instantly left right you would know where the f*** it is you never find it and it could be it could be out there so I think that also leads to this this delusional idea that it might be alive</div>

I exploded off the defendant when I was doing a world record attempt for Knoxville and training and that I was like I knew it was tore right away but we had the pilot for the TV show where upcoming Nova Scotia Canada this next day and I knew what an opportunity it was so I said f*** it I went took a shower and got on a plane and I flew to Canada and in Canada with with a completely torn knowing that I needed surgery and it hurting like like the worst pain ever we had to flip a boat so like one of those little robots with flip it like a tire then we carried 300 lb water jugs up a hill we didn't like all the stuff with that separated in the entire time I just felt like when was stabbing me with a cattle prod that was Meathead but you were doing more permanent damage so so they have to fly you deeper when they pull it down and torture device it was it wasn't too bad how long is a rehab Truman Rono 3 weeks in a cast and then like he gave me this like an arm brace that would like I'm adjusted every week or so to wear good more more straight and then that was maybe three months before I could use it and at that point it's not like I could go do what I was doing it's at that point you start over and it was Tiny but I was pretty pissed off leaving your on Pioneer arm extended arm yeah that's the guy that for some reason didn't get a lot of the love that each so deserve she was like one of the original technical Strikers is way bigger than him Stan submissions either so he would have probably got him it was like UFC one crazy Sport and the people that have been able to be like pave the way like a guy like Bas Rutten they were in such an important he was such an animal yet amazing Stories though we went into his gym we did I did Marsha Marsh wrestling is like an old Russian style wrestling while you have like a stick and you each hold the end of the stick and try and take it from each other and we actually I did it twice to tournaments and I was The Undefeated American champion after doing it twice but we went to his gym to do the qualifiers to go to the wall shipping in Dubai and he came out there he was judging and stuff and I remember like I basically I was way bigger than most people and I'm like upper body heavy so I just lean back and take it and at the end of it he walked over and he goes he's like the force is strong with you son just lean back and take him and at the end of it he walked over and he goes he's like the force is strong with you son of God</div>

While he's in motion of his vulnerable person to try to be safe so you can hit it at it you know is like fine it's whatever they called UNO baseball who they called file Stalag play touchdown more confusing than Hibbett Sports growing up I just got over it and then now I even call it soccer my podcast is soccer I don't even say football but when I go to England I just or just when I'm around football soccer people I say football okay but it's not a football to people like yourself it's a World Cup how can they call the World Cup soccer to appease the one country that gives the least amount of fox about sport right now weird that's crazy football stadium pronunciation and spelling of it in Australia the other Rebels the rebels they have their own rules they have Australian Rules Football rules for more ruggedness cuz you know what it was over there they were too used to rugby like those New Zealand Savages they have to yeah they're f****** Savage helmet these guys are running around biting each other in the dick in the scrums</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> he's a real concern among some people that were entering a phase of this country where it does a real possibility of having some sort of a civil unrest Civil War when you see something like these Portland events when you see this kind of chaos do you think that's a valid concern not for something that is across the country but perhaps very Regional what do the city at soft and not so much like Civil War but the violence that is done and planned by antifa it's meant to make the wider public not just polarizing hate each other but also began to distrust then to institutions that are in place that I meant to uphold democracy so the police in Portland have come under Fire for example not just from the radical left but a lot of people who are normally very pro-police of finding like what is wrong with the Portland Police like we don't even trust them so does its things just continue I think the balance will continue to escalate leading to Ada or. That's my real concern is my real concern is well and you think this is particularly unique to Portland in the way they're treating addressing it comparable other cities that have had some of these issues so don't sample and San Jose and 2016 Trump supporters when they were leaving a trump rally were brutally assaulted by mobs of people and then there was a lawsuit that was launched against the city for basically putting citizens in the way of danger the way they were funneled outside of this event led them directly in front of these violent protesters who attacked them you know in those that went viral of that year since then policing tactics have changed in San Jose as far as I know and you know involved a lawsuit so like sometimes it takes lawsuits for the local government to start protecting people civil rights so right now as bad as it is it does him confined to Portland we haven't seen Berkeley the type of violence as in 2017 when my Locane you know that hasn't been repeated for year-and-a-half now so but it takes the political will of those in power to enforce the law so you mentioned lawsuits what lawsuits are you pursuing will need it right now what I would like to see the city of Portland carry out a full investigation hold accountable all those who were involved in attacking me or Aiden as well and then as he evidence what evidence leads if this shows that there were was dereliction of Duty from those in power then you know I reserve my judgment in my lawyer is a judgment you know who gets sued listen to arrest people who responsible and charge someone and get convictions as well in closings I know you got to get out of here is there a silver lining to me then I mean do you think that perhaps you are assault and the the fact that the police didn't intervene is actually allowing people understand the real significance of this the real problem of this that it's this is a real issue gigantic one in fact that goes against the court the value of a pre expression and the ability to gather and communicate safely in public as hot as it was for me to see you Silver Lining when I was laying in a hospital with so much pain there is one and that is that everybody paid attention to what happened to me was a big story even the mainstream liberal past cannot ignore it and I'm hoping that from that goes beyond just being a headline but forcing the national discourse to change on how it views and talks about antifa we'll see if that happened I feel encouraged that we're beginning to see some Crocs in the way that has been protected by sympathetic writers and journalists and those of mainstream media I mean the fact that Keith Ellison deleted that photo that he shed a year ago right after I was attacked I think quesadillas even he faces certain pressure that it may not be good for a mainstream politician to so actively promote this movement and I hope it continues to move in that direction if you have a crystal ball and you were looking at the future what do you what do you think you would say well based on the press release a press conference at the med 2 days ago and not sure future what do you what do you think you would say well based on the press release press conference at the mare did two days ago and not sure not having any proposals it seems like more violence has to happen</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I want to stay for the record of the the violence that happened after I was beat up was involving the the men's rights activist group and antifa cowboys was holding they held the separate event in different part of the city as far as I know they did not there was no conflict in this particular no, sorry I'm a comedian named so she's organized this thing event but that should never ever justify the violence cuz I mean what would explain what you mean by being provocateur in the middle of downtown titling it justice for victims of domestic terrorism and then having a picture of antifa like that is you know this time does an element of coming in and seeing lots and rage these lunatics on the far left or whatever but at the same time I want to make sure I say that just because something's up Chrono call provocateurs in the woods with a writing that it's unfortunate that people now find that that's justification for you to react violently watching again it's a small change people that find it this justification and you look at the number of people that were there what is it thousand thousands of people how many people actually engage in violence small number but small number that's the problem it's important to note that they caught moral from the crowd who are cheering them on the cowards the cowards who don't disavow just horrific action they had them on and clapped as I was getting beaten and then the other thing about the people showing up in numbers engage in the violence is taped they are like literally human Shields date just the same so they make it easy for the few violent militants to none that I can watch the cops and keep an eye out on potential Outsiders as well and it's become a game it's become a game has become a gigantic team war is our team versus their team it's like it's literally like playing a child hood game it's really disturbing man and so this has anyone from antifa apologized but what happened to you or disavowal the actions of these few extreme vinyl people of course not on the people who support its movements they don't allow any type of design actually in there like press releases you can call call then they explicitly state that even basically even if you disagree with our talk to you will not publicly it's to create I guess this image of unity right for a corner and saw the organization organized but basically as a movement they had essentially cells across the country that are semi-autonomous you know buy an ideology of Anarchy anarcho communism and their support for violence so it's not so much a group itself it's the people who are part of that movement are drawn from other out to a group they draw from the DSA they draw from various workers unions other Anika's group and Mike other terrorist entities they have processes to lies sympathizers essentially they have their own literature as well and so it's much more organized than people give them credit for they think of them as people showing up to fight on the street at this meaning to that to that violence in his literature to back it up and they have you know they actively recruit people to join the movement so it's like do you think the federal authorities stop telling my my responses I think it's come to the point that they do because with antifa it's not it's beyond what local authorities can do because a lot of these people a lot of them up in Portland from Portland a lot of them come from for example from Eugene from Seattle from neighboring areas that have other antifa people come in to participate in the violence for that day or to help out and then they go back to where they're from so they're coming in and out of jurisdictions makes it hard for one local body of authorities to draw said I think the doj needs to stop then I think it's gotten to that point and with 20/20 coming up soon there could be potential for a lot more political violence if the results don't get the elections results to go as a wish but with it if the doj did step and what do you think they could do so. Well I mean do you believe in the the ability to meet up and express yourself properly and the ability to protest and the ability to just get together and have groups and and you know Express Yourself yes just what antifa. Like I said the violence is a feature of Ben movement so what federal authorities stop the violence is a feature of their movement is there is it that they haven't even written like the tenants of their movement where they say that violence is acceptable there a book called the anti-fascist handbook is written by Mark Bray he's an academic out. He is I would call him when I antifas tri-fighter log so not only does he explain what I'm to photos and in his writings who makes it very clear that the the cologne called self-defense is what justifies the offense of violence he actually argues why so because he's an academic well-spoken he's invited onto mainstream media to explain to basically like I said earlier mainstream antifa what can you explain what he yes I highly recommend that people take a look at his book the Attorney General in Minnesota Keith Ellison was photographed year ago hold it holding up that book of antifa book not coming when he's been criticized for that he deleted that in the shop to my DJ was holding up and support yeah he said this he said something about like this book or antifa strikes fear into the hearts of Donald Trump so government who I sent that I take this professor can explain what he says he outlines and explains essentially why and he says violence is ethical that it's because they're opposing Fascism and fascism is a violent movement this is sort of a pre-emptive move like we have this word fashion yeah it's it is a problem right yes cuz it seems like that's definitely something you should pose but what is the what's the actual definition of fascism fascism as a far-right political ideology from what I understand is the definition Jamie so we can just read what fascism would the actual word fascism means for radical right-wing authoritarian authoritarian ultra-nationalism characterized by dictatorial power forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th century Europe forcible suppression of for the backup forcible suppression of opposition is what they're doing yes strong regimentation of society mean they're literally telling people how to behave and what they will tolerate I know it's not right-wing ideology but it's almost like fascism and I'm sure there's other definitions of fascism the idea of supporting someone who poses fascism sounds wonderful sounds great let's see what stop fascism but are we really experiencing authoritarian ultra-nationalism characterized by dictatorial power in this country and means that people don't like right-wing ideologies running this country I understand that but this not not what's happening yeah they issue like fascism as defined by political theorists who have been researching this for decades it has a particular definition in meaning and that's I think that summarizes it pretty well I'm very concerned that people use it so flippantly to just refer to the right or to even authoritarianism like there's much more to it than just being authoritarian there's all the other and I need it needs its importance of state that antifa is not just supposed to fall right or the right there also against liberal democracy there's a reason why they hate the police so much hate border enforcement and hate the rule of law it's dope against that the concept of the nation-state as we understand it and they're working to dismantle out to delegitimize it so this is what I mean when I say it's a it's a dangerous ideology. do you know enemy of my enemy is your is your friend but at some point if this movement becomes bigger more mainstream and more people sympathetic at some point it's going to come back against the moderate not because these people they want to see the destruction of the nation did wanted to charge the nation-state for what purpose they want Anarchy yes so there Anika social Anarchist State they don't want borders they don't want Nations they don't want police what do they want be I mean what do they expect what's the ultimate goal they seem to believe in a utopian utopian boxes ideas right of the redistribution of wealth where we can be he truly equal in egalitarian when we dismantle everything about the country so not just you know it's institutions World law but the state itself like everything just has to be broken down and start over cuz irredeemable I'm not quite sure I can see if there's any somewhat comparable examples around the world of what it looks like for them to do State Building right so we don't know what it would actually look like but I mean the examples we see from these smaller anecdotas it's it's chaos and Anarchy like absolute chaos and violence suppression of opposing views indiscriminate violence at times I wonder and what I've been asking over and over is how many more people how to be drawn into have to be victims of this violence before something changes and I put in Portland now we've had three years of us and literally no policy changes have happened no even proposals have even been accepted by the mayor the previous mayor was what was his political persuasion or her I don't even know so they themselves are moderate very much you know in the vein of a Hillary Clinton type of thing but does the constituency in Portland. They have to play to four votes which is the radical people who are sympathetic to very very Progressive causes and so there's a reason why to date the mayor has never named antifa one time in any of his press conferences he has no problem blaming proud boys are Patriot prayer of the right for issues Patriot prayer group Patriot prayer as one of the other right-wing movements and in and around Portland that have held Pro Trump events in town that antifa comes to to fight and oppose those turn out they'd evolve into a riots in the police allowed us antifa comes to to fight and oppose those turn out they devolve into a riots in the police allowed this they allow it to the induction</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so was it when people see someone like the proud boys running around attacking people even the proud boys have to realize that they started off as a joke like when Gavin McInnes first came up with the idea of The Proud boys it was it was literally a joke and it became an actual organization at for fun and then people joined it that didn't think it was a joke and then people joined it started taking in a deeper and deeper Direction XI Ali disavow himself in the end of a band of the group you see that I bet you see same thing with antifa I bet the idea initially was hey we see these tiki torch carrying assholes in Charlottesville we see that guy with the car ran over the girl was protester and killed her like this f****** s*** is got to stop so we have to organize we have to do something and then what happens you get people in masks and you get people Justified and then you get people that support those people then you get the extremists and the extremists who are not this about who it were not the there's no one speaking out against them from the lab no one can hear this s*** has got to stop because they want them to do their dirty work for them they want them to push the envelope and put the agenda and get there. Their ideology moving in the right direction even if it's done through methods that they don't agree with and that's where it gets horrible because I see these people that are involved in this and I know for a fact just by watching them move and interact with each other they don't understand violence they don't they're not good at it they don't understand it they did this is like role play Sai cosplay and you're going to call for re you going to get real violence in return in from people actually know how to do it and if you look at violence from the left and bounce for the right by altering the right scares me a whole lot more there a lot more armed that it sits there more dangerous human beings in general and I think that if this just keeps happening and people from the right feel threatened and their lifestyle feels threatened and their ideologies feel threatened you going to get people meeting at these things and it's going to be more than just people throwing me and milkshakes at each other it's going to be people showing up ready for actual combat that's f****** terrifying it's f****** terrifying and this idea that you could just run around hitting people and not have any consequences just like a delay a child looks at violence this is what bothers me so much if you are if you looked at their core tenants of what they want to do and if they wanted to accomplish that through political negotiation and through conversation and Rally's and indents peaches fine that's fine people wearing masks hitting amazing people you've crossed the line into the land of no return and you called out to people who oppose you you challenge them to come and do the same and this is how violence begets greater violence it's f****** dangerous it's really dangerous violence does not exist in a vacuum you can't just have a little bit of ions and then there's no repercussions people react to that there's people that watch those videos watch you get pain and there is no justification for that when you see someone like yourself who's a small personal slight in stature not violent anyway and you're you're not even swinging back you just taking it and try to protect yourself people get infuriated by that and there's people right now I guarantee you saw that video who are thinking what I would do if I was there I'd f****** shoot all of them or I'd beat them all to death with baseball bats or I'd run him over with my car or do you think in the unhinged the right to feel like this is up in opposition of their ideology they're going to show up someday and when that happens people going to die this is a f****** terrible and this is where the mayor and the police and it didn't have not done their job and I believe the police let me say that they've been handicapped and maybe the mayor just didn't have an idea where this was all go but now you do this is the matter has been in office now for three years and he finally did a press conference two days ago 9 days am I talk to dress this controversy right and what was so frustrating is the the the police chief had publicly stated that she thinks the city or the state should adopt a law that makes it illegal to wear enough while committing a crime that should be a no-brainer it's shocking that in Portland I got a better idea. You can't wear a mask in public at these events cuz you can say you can't wear while committing a crime you're wearing a mask how do you who the f*** do you know committed the crime unless you take the mask off that we can't even identify if it's stupid you can't wear a mask yet so this you know it sounds like a baseline somebody policy that you should start advocating for right don't kick babies proposals and he spoke as if like it was his first day in office when this was like this is becoming routine now it's almost banal in Portland in Portland is what is a Harbinger on a warning to what can happen in other cities when you have a government those in the upper echelons of governance turning a blind eye to fall of militancy and just letting these dogs go in the street in Louisa case if they were doing that about about far-right militancy imagined they were far right people who were who were doing this and committing violence and the government was just like well you know I'm not sure if they shouldn't be allowed to wear masks while they commit crimes he will be freaking the f*** out it's the weird justification of the stuff that's that's so disturbing I just don't f****** love Portland so one of my favorite places it's great the city's great I mean it's f****** cool people not all of them that are involved in this is a very small number and the even amongst the small number it's the very small number of them that are radical that are violent when you look at the people that are attacking you not to minimize it but very few you look at that video it's a couple people out of thousands of people that are in that group there's a few people that are attacking his about a dozen was it released would you count throwing milkshakes but actually hitting you how many people you think hate you 34 maybe something like that okay that's the problem the problem is these f****** assholes it's not the people that disagree with you so people think you should be able to throw milkshakes at people and guys like Carlos Mesa we don't think it's a big deal to throw milkshakes at people so f****** big deal it's a big deal cuz he calls her response this is why it's a big deal and people don't understand assault they don't understand violence you can't just do that you live in some comic book world or some f****** Alicia world where you can just throw a milkshake at someone and don't do anything they don't turn around punch you in your f****** face and then what happens what you might fall and hit your head and die cuz that's real that's the real world we live in or you might cause a giant bra cuz people don't want to be hit with milkshakes or there's enough of you where you think you can get away with it so you're an awful bully and you throwing milkshakes at someone cuz you don't like what they stand for in a meeting in a public place and you're disagreeing about something so to write this disagreement your assaulting people for that very reason I'm just never in gauges in like a quote on Co Fair fight one-on-one what they do usually as a group while knocked up one or several then we'll distract a person either by speaking to them perhaps or blinding them with the chemical spray and then they take turns beating so there's even no opportunity to like you know you don't even know how many people hitting you at that point so that's what they do when do and then it's so it's so scary cuz it's so dumb it's not just scary because like you watching what happened to you scary cuz you know I'm watching that old man got hit in the head with a crowbar that's f****** horrific all that stuff is terrific and apparently that guy pulled out some sort of A-Rod and was swing at people before he got hit with a crowbar I do not know but I do know when you start hitting people in the head with crowbars that is the beginning of the end horrible horrible s*** happens in response to that and it hasn't yet this is 10 days ago who knows what's going to happen if there's another one of these rallies and you get people from the far-right who organized this is when the proud boys really radicalized they radicalized to go against antifa they were attacked they attacked them and then it became a f****** s*** show that you're seeing right now happen if there's another one of these rallies and you get people from the far-right organized this is when the proud boys really radicalized they radicalized to go against antifa they were attacked they attacked them and then it became a f****** s*** show that you're seeing right now</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when is the sky mean that there was this thing with voxware Carlos Mesa was minimizing the the impact of antifa and kind of joking around about it and making it seem like it's just no big deal and he got really upset cuz Steven Crowder is making fun of the fact that he's gay and the fact that he talks with a lisp and that Crowder mentioned that along with mocking his stance on antifa and then it became this gigantic saying that Steven Crowder is a gay basher but didn't become a big deal that this guy is minimizing violent fascist and that's what I mean that's how I feel about this when you trying to enforce your own ideology on other people and you have no tolerance for anybody with a differing opinion particularly journalist daddy is fascism it's so ironic to call yourself an anti-fascist when you're literally enforcing your own particular ideology to the point of violence and you wearing masks and you're running around hitting people pretending that you're being inundated with Nazis and white supremacist and that this is all necessary like that old man that was just driving and they're directing traffic and forcing him to obey them and then when he doesn't want they chase after him and assault him it's f****** bananas and the fact that this city has not stepped in and recognize that they have a real problem because this is got momentum behind it and the people that are involved that are non-violent got to speak did God speak up if your person that really believes that there shouldn't be homophobia and there shouldn't be violence in there shouldn't be white supremacy good for you you probably got involved in this for all the right reasons but if you don't recognize that someone like you yourself who is a person of a different ethnicity you're not a white person you're Vietnamese you're a gay man you got assaulted for no reason you didn't do anything that mean it's almost like a test of where do your values true and if you think it's okay for person like you to just get assaulted for no reason you are the problem you're the problem your mindset is the problem it's not whether or not there should be white supremacy of course it should be it's not worth another shouldn't be people be able to freely Express on top of course there should be that is not what the issue is with the issue is is group mob mentality when you get people together and you let him wear masks and you tell them that they're fighting against some and then they feel Justified and hitting a person like you it is really sickening and there's this diffusion of responsibility thing that happens when one person hits you and everybody feels like it's okay to hit you it's a mob mentality thing and it's it is extremely common with human beings that been in mob situations is terrifying because you feel it in the air you feel the chaos in the air when you were in some sort of a large-scale brawl type situation like anything can happen people just run up on it's not like two people alone in it in an end up like an open area where they can talk and work things out know it's chaos and it's some weird animal activity to some weird animal Instinct aspect to it that is very unique to humans and when you see something like this and see a guy like you just getting Pepper with milkshakes and punched in the head and it's f****** disturbing and for these people to dismiss that and not stand out not stand up say hey this is not what we're supposed to be about this not what I signed up for they become a part of the problem I'm sure these people listen to this that are upset at this because maybe you would you support antifa you support their ideology think about what you actually support think about what this is really all about what you shouldn't be supporting these people wearing masks running around f****** hitting people you ain't changing s*** with that all you got to do is call for more people with masks from the other side if people feel like right wing peep being attacked and I don't think you're even right-wing are you me what are Goodwill you just mood if you had a gun to your head or I may see your face what would you say you're a Centrist would you say I think is fair to describe me as center right center which is fine but should be okay mean we should be allowed to have disagreements of ideologies in a political Persuasions political leanings but this is but this is it's twisted and it's twisted the way it's being depicted in the media is very strange how it's being dismissed it's very strange and that there's really people in 2019 debating whether or not it's okay to assault journalists it's f****** Madness</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> why why are they mad at you is it just the Articles he's written because somebody told me that you had been accused of doxxing people is that true absolutely not true so this is such an outrageous to find reclaimed so what happened was on May Day at that right there was one of the empty for women charged in to participate in the fight during the brawl in one of the right-wing person he was wearing enough I didn't know who you was allegedly High hit her on her head near head on her neck somewhere like that she was knocked out I recognize this woman from her activism that day as the person who sabotages sound equipment when James D'Amore came to Portland State in February of last year that was an event that I was involved in organizing the State University wildly misrepresented what he had said and did people claim that he was an awful sexist even the CEO of YouTube said that he enforced harmful gender stereotypes were while he was siding evolutionary psychology and the siding all these different studies on why women gravitate towards particular Fields And even a page-and-a-half encouraging our strategy strategies to encourage more women to get an attack but it was basically in response to things that who had written about dealing with the lack of women and Tack what what is the problem here they're looking for a particular answer which was sexism and he was saying will it actually has more to do with the choices that women sort of naturally tend to gravitate towards and he was saying that there was a way to prop possibly encourage women to get into technology and he devise a strategy to do so but was wildly misrepresented and he if you meet the guy and I've had the podcast he is a soft-spoken sweetheart of a guy is not a not a misogynist not a mean-spirited person he was merely looking at the results of studies and he was looking at real raw data and that this real tendency that certain people have to gravitate towards certain positions in life but Auntie found the Allies just could not take the other try to shut leave them to try to get it canceled out that you got this one woman she damages sound equipment as she was trying to shut it down she pulled all these clothes out and push the soundboard on the ground at broke so I recognized her from the day she was named in the media and then I'll made a recognized or so I named her I said this is the name of the woman who was knocked out I recognized her from the James Des Moines event protest but she had damaged equipment and antifa I'm not around as me doxing her that's not doxxing doxxing is Way You released people's personal details such as where they work where they live their phone numbers with the so that people who identified her I named her before she was so that's basically at other than you riding the story criticizing their behavior what's disturbing to me Beyond disturbing was legitimate journalist that were making excuses for why you got beat up and people saying things like play stupid games Win stupid prizes I saw stuff like that that pick up better hobby or so I got right that you know anti-fascist will rule Portland's not your place I saw all this crazy s*** from people have blue check marks that we're saying that this is what happens when you support Fascism and I was so baffled by this like I read some of your stuff I haven't read all of it admittedly but I've read some you stop none of it came off as you supporting fascism it came off as you maybe at the worst case and are being a contrarian and not wanting to go with this sort of left-wing ideology that is so widespread throughout the Pacific Northwest but I did CNE I mean first of all you're not a white guy we should be explain to people you are Vietnamese and you know you're what they would consider a member of a protected class you're not just a minority you're openly gay your your what what do you consider yourself politically I've been avoiding labels for a while I think it's interesting that the loss of the coverage of what happened to me always qualify Mike who I am as like conservative journalists that it was said you work for far-right newspaper magazine Quizlet which is not the case at all that's not true I think they eat some Toad the dog whistle to the trying to say any of that this person deserve the same people who always talk about believe the victim they were the ones who jumped on play jussie Smollett but I guess I was wrong topic time exactly because even though you are you seem like a very nice person you weren't doing anything violent you you were supporting the wrong thing or not supporting them not supporting not just blindly supporting what antifa is involved with which is what my dad's what fascism is you you can't even question some of the more heinous things that we clearly heinous think they're doing just f****** Mason people in the audience Mason people in the crowd just pointing it at people yelling and screaming hitting each other with things when they are wearing masks getting involved in these brawls it's so f****** stupid it's so stupid to watch it's like this is base human behavior and its worst example and the fact that this dumb ass f****** mayor thinks that this is a good idea to let this play itself out this is how people get shot this is how people die when you allow a certain amount of violence and when you condone or don't do anything with violence that you can't defend like violence against a person like yourself I saw those guys hitting you in the back of the head throwing milkshakes at you or your truck just trying to walk away you weren't doing anything yeah you asked me how did I get to the brain hemorrhage so the video that's gone viral out of the beating I don't know if there's video the first half hopefully there's through CCTV or something but the first no more hits to my face in my head and so when I went to the hospital because of the nature of the contusions on my head they did a CT scan in the in the ER and I confirmed the subarachnoid hemorrhage so what started it what was the why'd you get hit in cup 29th of June so there was that demonstration happening auntyflo was Rowling to oppose the far-right they time of post Bashas I came was excited to use my new GoPro I was a bit nervous speaking going to live and I was nervous cuz I've been talking to just two months earlier right I left my house with the helmet got in my car I saw you were a helmet I did have one for reflection of myself took it off and decided I don't want anybody there to get the impression that I can't cuz they already accused me of being a not seeing fall right and white supremacist I didn't want any of them to then proceed me by the fact that I came as a helmet I can't possibly combatants obnoxious racist or being a Nazi or far right but it's like what part of what makes Auntie supposed to be dangerous is that they feel that they are morally justified in their brutality yes and they get actually a lot of moral from Progressive and left-wing media So after talking about what the taco would like to talk about how militant antifa people is very small those are going out and doing the violence the logic group and those that I find more concerning actually of a non-violent in Sofia and two because they work to mainstream antifas tactics and ideas like now doxxing by antifa is not even is kind of seeing as well these people deserve it like do people not realize like when your docs in you releasing your address of helping to me your family's address out it it puts his constant state of fear in you even when you're in your home like I don't know if they realize that so that the doxxing and then of course you know the punch the Nazi mean was meant to be cute and funny but when they label such a large segment of the population as Nazis it's it's going out there a lot of people who are innocent and log such as myself and they're also calling Jewish people Nazis and insane and then now more recently that the milkshake unless he knows his cute non-violent former political dissent as he's on the video after I was getting beaten I was trying to get away then they were counting all these liquids at my head and in my face and not blinded me I couldn't even see you really which way do to leave so to backtrack a little bit sign I'm jumping all over downtown justify horse attack they were chanting no hate no fear this is irony of it I remember that very clearly the crowd was counting that I was walking towards the front of the demonstration thought I would get a wide-angle shot on my GoPro before I could get there somebody has me really hard in the back of the head and I've never been in a fight the Sorokin so I didn't even realize what had happened to me I was knocked for soon as I caught my foot in the punches kept coming from every direction and all I could see was like people just unblocked with mouse and most of them that were hitting me out on these gloves that have the hardened knuckles I think it's like gloves or tactical close in broad daylight in the downtown steps away from the central police precinct the Sheriff's Office this beating happen no police intervene at any point I don't believe see it I don't know nobody came to my Aid at any point before during or after so this happens out of nowhere you get blind side of the back of the head a bunch of people punch you met how many times you think you got that maybe six or more the fact that people dismiss this is not being a big deal as really horrific to the fact that the people that are in antifa that are non I want folks which I think I'm glad you brought that up cuz I was going to bring that up but it's the extreme of the extremist right it's the people that think that that there's a call for violence in this is a reason to do it in the even someone like yourself that is a non-violent person that just there as a journalist that there is a justification for just for whatever reason you want to go up to that person start hitting them even though they're not a threat even though they're not do anything to harm anybody even though they're not putting anybody in danger there they're just being a journalist that there is justification for just for whatever reason you want to go up to that person start hitting them even though they're not a threat even though they're not do anything to harm anybody even though they're not putting anybody in danger there they're just being a journalist and you feel like you could just by hitting them it's really disgusting</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> man you're all healed up the bruising and swelling is going down as you can see but the most serious injury was to the brain you have a serious injury to Brain Brain Hemorrhage from what the mob beating so how do you know you had brain hemorrhaging and how are you able to just walk around I was taken to I started losing my balance after the beating there was no police made it to the courthouse sat down on the ground ambulance was called I had to walk back to the ambulance because the streets were walk back to the police precinct in the direction of the mall b960 associated with appointment police let me know that they that I needed to walk in that direction I was quite shocking cuz it was I just been a victim of a small beating and then now they tell me to walk back interaction of the central precinct for the beating a top-end do they not know that you have been beaten up set this up for people who are new to this and don't understand what happened I've been aware of you because of you written for cool at night and you had become one of these for whatever reason controversial online journalists and you covered antifa quite a bit covered a lot of the radical left you were in Portland and what was the exact rally that was going on what was it called does it have a name something like protect Portland so is organized by Rose City on too far and its allies and by its allies are referring to the local chapter of the democratic socialists of America came out to support them and numbers and what are they protecting Portland from they allege fascist fascism in general and means like a particular thing they're worried about there were two right-wing events happening that day that they were counter demonstrating against there was a 110 downtown the proud boys were holding a flag waving event that was completely peaceful there was no actually flag waving American flag a lot of Portland has found out provocative and a manifestation of fishes stick violence and in another part of downtown there was a men's rights activist who is holding a rally event so a men's rights activist that was doing an anti-fascist or Aunt antifa cracks what what boy seems like a whole lot to do about nothing flag waving and anti-antifa okay listen to all over the world of the US and I call it a political Monica not just you're more likely to find socialists open socialist there than you would find like a regular Republican or conservative and within the social backhoe chamber of just left us Politics as it's become also a hotbed for fall of militancy so Rose City antifa is you could call it like the local chapter of moon in a venti cuz one of the oldest in the country it's very large important and they what you could call protest but they were there protest that always devolve into riots where they essentially take over parts of downtown and attack people attacked their ideological opponents and do it frequently with impunity and I wasn't the only one to talk that day there were two other people who were bashed on the head very and have very severe lacerations to the face and head you never called the footage from October of last year when there was a a driver who is attacked from the streets yeah they were directing traffic and somehow or another the mayor thought it was a good idea to let this take place is that the case and they told the police that stand down is that true so I need the next part of this journey for me will be the legal aspect of it and it seems like something stinks in Portland they issue is really not with the rank-and-file officers are following orders to not so I have been assaulted and criminally harass earlier before the mob beating people throwing milkshakes at my face and head within eyesight of police who were watching in downtown and both of these were reported in the answer that I heard that day as I've heard many times before when I've been insulted by antifa inside we will not question approach or detain the suspect because this could incite the crowd okay so this is why this has exacerbated this is why this has become such a big deal in Portland because of this attitude because Portland seems to be the hotbed right now for this kind of stuff is that is that fair to say I think it is so is this the mayor and who is who's the one who's giving the orders to the police to tell them to allow the stuff to take place well I'm crowdfunding for the legal phone right now and we are willing we are going to hold accountable whoever is responsible for dereliction of Duty where the evidence leads us so Portland has it on governance system in that the man who is up for re-election by the way is also the police commissioner so wow all the political, the conflicts and in conflicts of interest that that would arise right you know you know shitload how did you get involved in this like what wipers why were they angry you a journalist let magazine and one of my Beats among several is about far-left militancy particular in Portland to me while I was noticing was that the national and local media coverage had a particular blind spot when it came to the coverage on antifa there was all the sensitivity to the Quantum Code for right and white nationalism White extremism but they could not or would not recognize the militancy that was on the left and Portland seem to be one of the places for Ground Zero particularly after 2016 we had very violent biting in downtown that a segment of the population could not accept the election results in November and so they did a million dollars in damage setting fires and destroying properties and businesses that time I was a graduate student working at the student paper and I did a story on that and I came out to witness and it you know this was a major American city but it felt like I was in Afghanistan or Iraq just with all these fires and explosions and people running around with bats while messed up and I was really became familiar with Auntie funny took an interest in it and it's all over and over that the media coverage was basically really the whitewashing then kind of like referring to them as anti-fascist giving them that propaganda Victory and anti-war movement masters of doublespeak and disinformation so it starts with the name antifa is short for anti-fascist but I never refer to them as. Cuz that's feeding the ground to 2 then they when they say that they defending a community self-defense it actually is referring to meet premeditated violence in offense of violence so I started going to covering this more more you know after I left the student paper I started writing for some national International Publications and do internationally there was a readers who interested in what the hell is going on in Portland why continue scenes of street brawls and Anarchy over Nova what are the variables on a causing this and I thought that I could try to shine a light on it and by doing so and became enraged with my work particularly things they hated me since last year but they started really oscillating on the 1st of May May Day so this year was when I was physically assaulted by them for the first time they were very upset that high wrote a story for the New York Post where there was a series of in this is one of the other beats that I work on his hate crime hoaxes Portland earlier this year had this huge panic over serious allegations of LGBT people claiming that there were more running right wing games driving around trying to kill people with bats with hammers trying to kidnap them and these are all rumors that reported on social media cause a huge friends even the mayor had to come out and you know issue statement about how he was concerned there was an emergency town hall with the local career center and so I started looking into all these obligations he was 15 of them and I found that of the 15 only one was reported to police and what was reported to police and documented in the report was entirely different from the GoFundMe we're over $10,000 is raised for this trans activist she had a large that one night walking home transphobic people have beat her with the bat and knocked unconscious please report said that she was extremely intoxicated and likely fell and there was no evidence that anybody had assaulted her so when I can this story came out because I can see if I was really empty fun the Democratic socialists of America in Portland we're really involved in paddling this hate crime sphere in Portland and I just kind of you know through water on the Panic that they have been blaming and so on the 1st of May there was a riot that I was covering and one of them is antifa people went up and sprayed me with I think it was bandmates some type of chemical blinds you Burns you I saw the video so there was no police that that was there that I mean identified that was publicly advertised on Facebook and all that soap over and over like antifa is very transparent about their calls for people to come to the stuff into engage in this physical confrontation. They call self defense in the police either stay away or on purpose or are told to stay away is very confusing cuz when you watch the video they're just amazing people they're amazing people who disagree with them like they're yelling at each other and then someone will come along and makes people and for the police to not step in and do something it's I don't I don't think there's another city in the country that would allow something like that it just doesn't it doesn't seem like it makes any sense at all because you're you're not talking about people that are being physically attacked in the macing someone to protect themselves or even a threat of being physically attacked there just disagree with each and yelling at each other and then someone will come along and start macing people and I've seen it many times and I think is also a real problem people wearing masks you know what whether their ideology make sense or not when you put people in masks and then you have a bunch of people yelling and escalating and then there's teams there's team antifa versus Team you know anybody opposing them they feel is a white supremacist or a Nazi and this is just how they've chosen to frame it to be human and then you see them attack people I'm sure you're aware of the girl who got maced in the face because she had a hat on that said make Bitcoin great again but it was the same color hat as the make America great again hat and she got maced in the face and she got hit with something to write did she get hit in the face with something anyway this kind of s*** is really weird it's really weird and disturbing to see these young people with these ideal idealistic versions of what they're doing I think a lot of the people that are involved in that really think they are fine fascism they really do they really think that Donald Trump in the proud boys and white supremacist from Charlottesville carrying tiki torches at these people represent something horrible that sweeping across the country that young people today need to stand up and fight against it and they're putting on mass and a carrying backpacks at wacken people in the head with crowbars is really f****** weird to see and it's really weird that the city of Portland OR at all cities in fact that haven't made some sort of Allah where you can't walk around in public with a f****** mask on cuz that is one of the things that helps you people it's the same thing that you see on social media when people are Anonymous and they say the most horrible hateful s*** they're saying that because they're not in front of you you can't recognize them they don't have to take responsibility for their saying this is a lot of the same characteristics that a person has when they're wearing a costume you're dressed in all black with gloves on in the face mask and you're getting people to buy clock like what what is that about you're getting away with being anonymous and you're getting support from all these other people around you there's just mob mentality that takes place it's well-documented with humans where will you get a group of people together and there's another group and it's like it's a tribal Warfare type situation and that's what you saying with antifa in the fact that the Portland Police have I don't know what's going on with them whatever they've been told to not handle that but the fact they haven't done anything to mitigate this is f****** it's it's embarrassing it's shame it's it's terrible it really is and it's a trap it's a travesty you asked about the earlier and if he issued and he's found on orders there's a statement that was put out after I was attacked by the federal to know who's the president of the police Union and he said very clearly he calls from the nail to remove the handcuffs handcuffs of law enforcement so they can enforce the law and he gives them out of politicizing the police department popular no he's not he's hated well by moderate because of the things that he allows hop in the city but the far-left hate him as well they view him as not radical enough</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> are you going to continue to do these things go seems like you're obviously at Target now when I was off this in my interviews this week last week that comes to my mom right away is because I'm going to continue I won't be intimidated but with the the brain injury. They it's like I can't continue doing it the same way as I do before and being a naive to think that police would actually uphold the rule of law they gave me a brain injury in like I never had one before but I'm dealing with some cognitive neurological issues memory issues I have issues so I have upcoming Physical Therapy neuro physical therapy as well as speech therapy so like on the surface I have improved a lot since the beating there are some long-term consequences that I'm going to have to work through and you know I have to be honest I have certain fears and anxieties of being important I've continued to receive threats violent threats and there's been reported to police and just people promising to make sure next time that I won't even be able to walk away. They will repeat what happened to me when they see me on the street so like the people that did this to you so it's been 10 days now more than 10 days since my beating there have been no arrests I don't know where the police are out in the investigation they haven't been keeping me informed there was a photograph of someone they released yaso the Portland Police release photos of potential suspects and asking for help in identifying one was 122 them and I've got to say earlier that in addition to the the beat they robbed me of my my camera equipment so that was my my evidence for that day and I tried so hard to hold on to it but I couldn't what about you attending this with security we thought about doing that moving forward once I feel well enough and once I'm cleared by the doctors it may be worth it to cover these events but with Professional Security Gorillaz Big Giant Foods like armor like what would you have how far would you take this I don't know where it was how far do you think I should take it I don't think you should go those things anymore it seems like you've been I mean it is part of your job you're a journalist but it seems like you've been singled out and targeted and seems like they don't have any problem justifying attacking you and assaulting you if I I'd bring the biggest baddest dudes that I can find in a bunch of them now I'm surround you and Evan protect you but I tell you about America 2019 tonight it's this one particular area and this one particular group and not even the group I think it's the most ridiculous people in that group I don't think it's most I think most these people that probably are part of this really don't want fascists and they really don't want some awful ring totalitarian regime running this country and in marginalized people of color gay people and immigrants and all those things that I mean I would be on their side ideologically about a lot of things that the implementation of it that I have the biggest problem with it says the group mentality it's the wearing the masks the salt so not understanding the consequences of violence all these things this is what I have a problem with the way that the mayor allows to take place we handcuffs the police that that is what I have a problem with it's not that they don't want horrible people running the government running the world I understand that that makes sense but you're not for the dismantling of the nation-states right dope no no I'm not or the breakdown and democracy Now pathetic because of the anti-fascist aspect of the empty right-wing they are ignorant of it and I think that's what's important about your work that's what's important about these discussions that's what's important about people getting the word understanding what this really means Not What It Seems on paper it's like where the antique Nazi movement course your anti-nazi good we don't want fascists I think that's what Chris Cuomo was saying I think that's what Don Lemon was saying I think they're too busy I don't think they're really investigating this I don't think they're deep-diving and understanding the ideology at its core the way you're describing it and whoever that Professor was that you were discussing that is somehow or another condoning violence that that is ridiculous anyone who considers themselves and intellectual who condones violence all this punch a Nazi God damn it you don't understand violence you don't know what you're talking about you don't understand The Human Condition cuz if you if you understood violence the last thing you would ever be calling for can I talk about the the next up of what's next for you are so a lot of people listening and are frustrated and have expressed support for asking what can I do I'm just one person in this is the the power and that we live in time with his crowdfunding and you know with all the point earlier it seems to show a lot of evidence to suggest that there's something seriously wrong and up at salons of policing and governing in Portland and that's what the the legal fund is so I'm working with honey Dylan she represented James D'Amore she's taking me on as a first client for the nonprofit that she started called if you go to Publius lacks public lax.com you'll see information for how you can donate anything helps and we're trying Wii U no lawsuits if they happen against the city or mayor or Police Department cost a lot of money and takes a lot of time takes me as a lot of overhead cost in the amount of people you know you have to take into do all invested investigations so there's an opportunity for the public to get involved you know I don't want the story to pass just about Andy got beat up so what let's move on but rather there's systemic issues happening in Portland and their implications for the rest of the country what do you think is going on with media that is supporting this attack on you because I've seen so many journalists dismiss this as being not a big deal why why do you think the nobody would look at something like that or someone's being beaten publicly and not think it's a big deal what do things behind that extreme ideologies a very good at dehumanizing the opposition and that's what antifa does so there's been a lot of disinformation this information put out of about me you know I'm not I'm not they say for example not really generous I'm just far-right provocateur you sympathetic to Nazis inside when you put these ideas out that not only allies but I meant to remove one's Humanity they just become you know like and he's no longer a d and e is Too Faced of far-right ideology and it makes people feel comfortable with violence against that and it was so disheartening to see so many writers come out and say things like you know I don't really support what happened to Andy but he's done far worse or he was provocateur his writings like he came and he he got exactly what he was looking for what happened to me should happen to nobody much less a journalist right like this isn't America in a major American city we're not in Afghanistan or Iraq with the state is because we have a strong State we have police force the law is not being enforced wire citizens having to suffer arrest arrest it's really absurd and it's obscene when's the next one of these thing supposed to take place on the 17th of August is supposed to be the next event I think the proud boys have announced that Dan couraging all of them numbers across the country today to fly into Portland and Portland yeah they're kind of reacting I think to the 29th of June so we'll see what happens I'm concerned Dan couraging all of them numbers across the country today to fly into Portland and Portland yeah they're kind of reacting I think to the 29th of June so we'll see what happens I'm concerned</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I mean I don't know but I know that you have people's like them I think it just looks it's the texture of it but now people like DV Muslim people like vinyl right just people that are just die-hard vinyl fans I like that around yeah I mean you know I like my like anything I'd like to I'd like to make sure that it's the best quality of it or the most natural use case for it you know he knows like when people use to mix when people start listening more to music the car that they could like put a thing that they bought in their car with an 8-track or whatever at least have record players for cars to but you know the way that music sounded they were kind of they also had to consider the mix of car speakers what does it sound like on car speaker so going back to the aura towns in the NS tens and then the standardized car speakers that people test audio in and so you got to figure out how to make some music but generally it's the sound system that has to be adjusted the sound systems have to but you mix Tuesday they kind of meet each other in the middle of a great Hi-Fi systems by actually it's a quick active but when I was in Seattle I knew that I liked HiFi systems but I didn't know why they were so expensive and so I went into this place has guy named Leland who was working there was kind of friends with him cuz I'd come in and I just scope gear all the I'm just looking like I love audio gear it's just really sweet and then one day it was towards the end when they were closing and he turns to me and says hey man do you want to get your brain fried and I was like what and he's like stick ran okay and he closed shop couple of his friends came in close to shop like maybe five of us went to the back room smoke some marijuana went into the showroom the main room where they have all the speakers and all the different types of units and he says Lenox on the couch and he says okay and you're going to listen to a this is a system in total it costs about $150,000 and and then he just goes receipts and goes through and explains all of the stages that you know that the current is going through in with the music is going through as being played on all the cables that are being used all the stuff and I heard all of that crazy speakers like okay cool he lowers the lights and he puts on a Bill Evans Trio record I can't remember which one and he just presses play and we sit down and like within probably 30 seconds people were crying and because it felt holographic it felt like you were in the room with those musicians that were playing right there for you and then I had the realization that it's not the money it's not about the money it's about what does it take to engineer a machine that becomes invisible to the experience and that was Backcountry my mind so whenever you're designing anything it's like you design experience engineering she should get the f*** out of the way what was the medium is it vinyl vinyl description what is different about my know what I mean supposedly if you have a really nice quality piece of violence cut really well you get as close to original Master recording experience that coming out of the studio if you're talking about older tape so whatever that Final Mix is when someone plays at me like it's been mastered here's the stereo to track or plain stereo to track has been mastered excuse me an easy and that's what you hear you hear it in the best possible context on the speakers that it was mixed on its everything is off tomorrow so essentially when a record is pressed if it can mimic set the stereo to Trackmaster which it does then you have something that for at least the first I don't know why do people say how many times but starts to wear down but if you have a fresh press you can run it a bunch of times before it starts to degrade but in that state your hearing it like analogue super analogue so I guess I don't know what it would be maybe 30 40 50 time now is there a digital format that at least comes close oh yeah yeah Flac files it's a file format Flac files are good usually 128/96 kilohertz like that's the standard and that standard is is basically what that is what a record is so that's do you have like sites like hdtracks that I really dig you can get all your favorite at well not all it's not as big of a selection but you can get full resolution from select stereo to Trackmaster from the studio level quality in a digital format that you can buy and then put into a hi-res player so I have a hi-res player a Hi-Fi player and it runs the has really nice circuitry and all that stuff and he's a really great pair of headphones and you got the closest thing to a record repeatable infinite X the headphones the way to go or one of those crazy tower speaker jammies the way to go but depends on your gear used case like if you if you know if you are in the house if you want like a cool living room system or whatever I would always offer speakers and not not Sonos and not that kind of stuff people they dig it but true I mean records are meant to be played off of two speakers with as it's a 2.1 so unless it's specifically engineer which is very rare Atmos or whatever the f*** but usually it's two speakers and a subwoofer so why would I not want to hear the music the way it's supposed to say however I understand the convenience of those speakers so I'm not totally not for me if you're going to get a system for your living room so I can get a 2.1 system to come at you the way it was recorded the experience they fake stereo was on podcast Chris set up in his house he is a gigantic audiophile massive lover of music on my God he collects all these albums and he even runs a radio show you do I love it radio show okay Wilson Alexandria I mean it's disgusting look at those things you have to have their weapons and I like you you have to go back so we can swing a sword. yeah wow look at the input even know what the f*** we have discrete inputs for each of the frequency spectrums the different speakers look at The Fringe on my curtains I am Heinrich that's crazy man that well there you go because the Mark Levin Show yet as a mark Levinson system in the whole thing's engineer for the shape of the inside of the car system in there I've never heard better audio I mean I've heard some dope ass I think I have I think the test that uses levenson stuff I'm not totally sure people have been able to figure out what they should have by now but I remember like 5 years ago trying to figure out who what is the premium audio system like what is it besides a premium on it and I couldn't get an answer to someone figured out what the amp was but they couldn't forget the speakers and it just finally started get kicked in and now it sounds amazing I was like really kind of disappointed for a while yeah it's weird does / mean yeah there's like a burn in what I think there's a burning I'm not sure maybe it's totally maybe go better week maybe I did get better weed I mean what you think of this weed by the fantastic so you're not freaking out I like it alot what's it called again purple what Purple Rain and they're great cuz it's I have as my house kind of mid-century mod and that mean mid-century modern and they're great cuz it's I have at my house kind of mid-century mod and I mean mid-century modern</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> but if the issue interests so like the Google memo the James D'Amore issue right for you to set a great example publicly but my my wife went on Dave Rubin show and this is a woman who brought techniques of gauge field Theory into economics so she's no slouch when it comes to analytic thinking she's an 8 gauge symmetry at gauge Theory she was doing quantum theory but she was taking she her thesis brought techniques of bundle Theory like the hopf fibration that we had and show the economics without any alteration was a mature geometric system in a gauge theoretic getting so we collaborated on Define showing that you can't accommodate changing preferences any kannamma Cooks without gauge Theory so I was kind of pretty amazing was really great great fun the sheet her point was I didn't enjoy the unpleasantness of focusing on these things because they were so abstract and so I wanted you know I was interested in people I was in did in making sure that are models could capture human dynamics better and you know I was just really excited by that the collaboration we were doing which which is you know she and I came from two different worlds and we found this bridge between them. So she went to Dave Rubin it's a look it's not about abilities women are as smart as men its interests we're not interested in the same things necessary and that should be a way but when she set it on registering the date then James D'Amore set it and like the world freaks out because you said it within the environment of the podcast exact thing he wasn't employee of Google and it was on a podcast evening was a popular podcast I don't think it would have created the fact that you can get paid for these these weird sort of spectrum e-skills guilty that's what I care about I really enjoy doing isolated things in the absence of other people that have a very technical nature to them and you know my experience in general is that I cannot had female collaborators in very technical subjects you were women are interested in things that involve isolation and technical things removed from Human interact and so that statement will undoubtedly cause a flurry of activity and if a if a person says it was not suspected of trying to keep women out of something like my point is I want a much more equal world but will have a very different diagnosis as to why the world is unequal as it is and your diagnosis is that it's unequal because people have varied interests and that but also something is dumb is Ken work when the kid work women take care of sick relatives children and the elderly at 11 that most men can't be bothered with you know this is like I don't care so you know you've got all of these guys hyper focused on their career we're doing the equivalent of jumping down a flight of stairs on a skateboard and maybe it's not healthy and then you've got a another group of people or is like saying you know I want to have children I want to stay home with the kid free couple of years because it's really important in terms of their development and bonding all these things I say absolutely how do we create a financial product that gets you money early in your life when you need it and then you know maybe you pay something out when you get like it's just a different diagnosis as to what the problem is it's not all oppression part of it is resources Financial products part of it is interest part of it at the field being set up in a way that is biased but I do believe in structural oppression believe in your level of structural oppression of the remedies for Starks structural oppression like if we don't we're losing many of the best vines that are on female shoulders we just are there's no question about it in my mind and rather than saying what you mean by we're losing them what they exit the system we tweak did they they get through the like let's abs and stem subjects a lot of Mentor PHD programs like let me give us very simple example from the Harvard math department from years ago I think Harvard had this weird thing where it was very often allowed one woman in a year to the PHD program in mathematics and that person usually felt isolated and would often kind of leave the program and then one year a female who is admitted deferred so that meant that there were two women starting the next year and they form to support network and they both got through and then women came in after them so psycho that's interesting we just learned something right if you could you let women in in pairs maybe they're going to do better and then then maybe three will do better for will do better okay I'm totally up for that kind of a remediation up until we can build up enough female experience so that women have Role Models like it it's really helpful to be able to look at a senior female researcher and go to her and say how did you do it you got married and had kids had a very successful career how did you come back you know one of the things I found I used to be interested in this problem and I found it a lot of the women in the 1950s were very successful is stem subjects had a lot of money or their husbands had stable jobs that allowed them to use nannies and housekeeping in order to free themselves from drudgery well that was an unadvertised feature of the system because that's not available to everyone that it's a feature where Financial privilege actually enabled some stay in science so you know the issue isn't question inclusion or exclusion of groups it's a question of how are you so sure that everything is structural oppression that's that's a really weird thing and if you can watch that objection cheaply if you can just say I can take any group and say why is this group have no one in the wheelchair now I've got to spend 30 minutes explaining that I don't want to do it it's not a good enough objection like if we're going to make Prague actually make progress that matters rather than making ourselves feel good why do you think that this social justice movement has reached such hysterical levels over the last decade a couple things one I think that certain positions became like the failing business of traditional media meant that you couldn't actually employ people at the same level that you could employ them do a lot of people who didn't have huge opportunity costs entered journalism that you're very ideological and somebody offers you a $50,000 a year job which allows you to be ideological or you could take $150,000 your job and ideology isn't a large part of the offer only the ideological people are going to give up $100,000 a year for the privilege of activism sewing part when you have a failing business model you start select is a system selective pressures it's going to start selecting for very different people so that's one of the things going on is it that you have very economically frustrated people because the silent generation started a problem the Baby Boomers Amplified the hell out of it Gen X is still waiting to take simplify the hell out of it Gen X is still waiting to take its place in society in the Millennials just don't even see a path through in a standard careers nobody's putting a glass of scotch in their hand in a cigar in their mouth and saying come with me kid let me show you how it's done</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the reason I'm fighting through culture War issues which are not very interesting to me is that we are destroying the thing that has the ability to make sense of the world right it's really did the delete an experiment that failed you know and you say I think it's exceeded I say no it didn't it failed you say well I actually am Cambodian and I think you're discriminating against me because I'm Cambodian like your experiment failed has nothing to do about it and keep that stuff out of my lap and telling people how to behave or that I have all the answers that we need to be objective in our lives and we just won't have sensible discussion it's your coming after core reality in our ability to make sense of the world and so I'm happy to entertain all sorts of things you take one foot step one foot in my lab and I'm calling security and I can't do that I can't maintain a scientific journal or university in which the b******* departments do not invade the department that are actually doing the super important work we're lost and there is a distinction and I mean this distinction needs to be made there there is a distinction between hard science and gender studies if you could pull pull up Jamie let's do the anomalous Magnetic Moment of the electron all you can do can do that like 10 or 11 significant digits we are able to calculations in Quantum electrodynamics. Same Quantum field theory in which we can figure out the Precision of something we can predict it till like 10 or 11 decimal places of accuracy and when I look at the the achievement that was necessary to have Theory agree with experiment to that level and then I listen to some of the discussions about I'll just take these hoax about you know somebody submitted parts of mine comp to a United with Jews re-written as men. Like I was in right now those two subjects are taking place in the same institution one is incredibly rigorous and in demanding and completely unforgiving and the other thing is just like prevalence of nonsense as well. Maybe there's a core of it that makes sense but they're not going to get anywhere close to the achievements of the of the hard Sciences but did the Corvette with another make sense there were the real problem is the motivation for doing in the first place the real motivation maybe activism but Activision activism and scholarship aren't there so many things that I want to be true that just aren't I want beautiful I mean like in our nature you spend time in nature you want to thank you know like nature is a community in the forest is a bunch of different organisms all working together now it's red of tooth and Claw everything that you think about universe that is surely beautiful and aspirational is contradicted by some system in nature and that's why evolutionary theory was the first thing on the chopping block just like well this contradicts everything we want to Claim about organisms off lock I feel like there's a weighted to find this clearly that makes people understand it better and I don't I don't know if I'm the guy to do it but I feel like someone that there's a this is an incredibly complex issue right where you're dealing with emotions and feelings and people who feel like there's Injustice in the world and inequality focus on those things to the point where they're almost participating in Social Engineering By ignoring reality and focusing on what they want to be true and sort of this way of reimagining the world and they're also demanding clients this is a big part of this whole right it's going on here then on the other hand you've got this stuff you got these hard sciences that demand just regular rigorous intellectual debate they demand careful study of the facts they demand deep understanding of complex mathematics in order to achieve these results and to be able to verify down there Unforgiven unforgiving two totally different things when one of them that is this sort of frivolous Airy kind of utopian version of what they like the future to be and that interferes right where they want a certain amount of diverse people on that I'm not even saying that it's not even saying it's not scholarship I'm saying that whatever it is I don't care maybe maybe it's maybe it's some beauty what do you do but then they'll hit you with you don't care because you're a white male and you have white male privilege and I don't know in what I realize is that is important as inclusion is exclusion is equally important in the instant you say that I don't know you the time of day what does that mean by exclusion diversity and inclusion diversity let's look at us we have three white guys in here this Jamie you and me soak speak to yourself I'm 1.6% African I knew I knew I was going to play that card in order to have the objection like there's some little bit of guilt just like why aren't there any people from Cambodian here is that we were really Auntie Cambodia if you carry that guilt you're always worried that you have to be able to prove that your inclusive doesn't matter right okay it is also important to exclude certain voices from the conversation so the voice that plays the card which says what you're only saying that because X I don't have to listen to that voice and I think this is really important that is not a voice that needs to be answered it's not a voice that needs taken seriously or paid attention to unless there's some serious allegation that there has been some kind of discrimination or inclusion the burden of proof is on you for saying why that's interesting in particular conversation the burden is on you to explain why that's interesting print well for them they're trying to engineer a more fair and balanced Society if I was going to take their perspective there would say that the re why there aren't more women in science or trans people in science or you'll feel like I'm also trying to engineer a world where there are more women in science how are you doing that by trying to figure out what is it that selecting against women for example that we need to get women more money as I said on this program earlier in their lives so they can hire help to help raise their children so they can spend more time on their careers and balance a lot of women don't attractive they don't want to do that maybe but I'm trying to but my point is that there are lots of reasons that men and women are different right for example I saw a beautiful video of the guy who jumps down it in Norma's flight of stairs on a skateboard and he just nailed the landing it's just if that's a thing of Art and then it shows you a hundred 50 attempts wear this tonight just abused his body and if failed failed me before the tooth you know blood everywhere you thinking you showed me the success and you didn't show me that this guy was willing to put his brain his life on the line in order to nail that trick and he's actually one of the world's falling Champions right okay well when you start saying well why are you putting this video of this person who's doing this thing you know on the internet because that person place to a privileged class I'm saying well I don't know that guy abused himself and put himself at risk and you know devoted his life in a singular way that no sensible primary would be a I would be appalled my son did that I'd be furious with it there are things that are that are happening that result in imbalances that aren't about some kind of unfairness and I think it's very important to say the unfairness as real and structural problems are real and non structural problems and things that really aren't on I think we both agreed that it's important for people to have the opportunity to pursue what they enjoy pursuing I think there is also an issue where we want people to be more represented we want more of that that kind of person that's interested in something when they might not necessarily naturally gravitate towards it and it might not be that there is some impediments and that there's some boundaries and some some sort of boys the keeps him out and it might be more that they're just not that interested in that with a biologically Bennett that's been proven in studies but I try to make it a different point and cry to me what I'm trying to say is I made a mistake years ago I think of engaging in answering this point which is you know what's it look so take piano competitions why are piano competitions historically disproportionately you know Inogen one by Russians are Chester from those Russians are beasts in the way that they destroy children are on their way to the concert stage they will do things that most American families will not do to produce a concert pianist okay that's not an unfairness for the rest of us and I play the piano I can't get on stage with these guys because they're just amazing it's not not an unfairness that I'm not represented on that stage you know if I told you that my intention is to become the world's greatest Jujitsu expert at age 53 being overweight and not having any history in Combat Sports you know and I know that it's not going to happen with the right amount of drugs and Engineering we can do miraculous things that's true we can make him better than he was yeah we need daily stem cells we're going to we're going to have to do some real to we're going to take a chance on turn all sorts of other diseases brighteye we can we can cheat some things the previous conversation over that you need to develop you need to develop it it needs to be a part of your well here's a thing that I would say about striking Sports probably one of the more interesting that when you start out on an early age your body develops learning how to strike and it's a gigantic advantage over someone who learns once they're their past. when you get someone who's learning how to strike and they're in their twenties it takes a real outlier to become super successful it's very very rare what I remember being in a fist fight and throwing a punch and not connecting and hurting my arm I didn't understand but I remember being in a fistfight in throwing a punch and not connecting and hurting my arm I didn't understand</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and that we just we live our lives in the most ordinary mesoscale phenomena where you know we don't see we don't see the quantum because we were not playing with polarized lenses and ways that show us what light actually is you know we're not playing with superfluid helium or not understanding just how bizarre olfaction is or are you know whether there's some sort of quantum aspect neurology and what you see people doing is that they they they start grasping for everything like I'm not saying that there's nothing to Ancient Aliens or UFOs or whatever but a lot of that is just people want something richer and more more amazing for their lives and I'm not going to pass too much judgment on that but I am going to say if we just restricted the the rest of our days to the provable stuff that we know is out there it could be amazing people need more meeting with all of the rationality with all the mystery we've taken out of the world it's time to put a ton of it back in when you say put put a ton of it back in like I got to put it back in well you know if I were to start talking about the octonian an eighth dimensional number system that no one understands I can do that totally rigorous that you all sorts bizarre stuff involving the octo means what is the octonian that's my point you don't even know that there are four types of numbers whose dance called the real numbers that we know complex numbers that were tortured once with a nice cool maybe during some kind of a trip a friend of you mention the court mention the quaternions to you and then there's this one system of numbers which is like the crazy relative nobody discusses and that's called the octonian and the arcturians are so weird that petitions don't even really understand why they're there that's not telling him that thing my guess is that that's probably back to the root lattice of e83 discussed last time which has a mandala pattern to it but I could show you their multiplication table I can describe the symmetries as a symmetry group called G2 which involved these strange numbers but it's a mystery like it cuz I got to probably know more about the most if I got to the end of all of my knowledge of the octarians I still wouldn't know what to tell you about why they're there and what they mean nobody knows I've promised you that that's a real mystery now we could talk about it like you know my friend said that that event that happened in Siberia in the early you know 20th century was actually an alien visitation maybe yes maybe no I don't know anything about it if I just focused us on like what we know is I there that we don't grasp which is hundred percent rock-solid provide so much mystery and meaning and invitation to Adventure like if you're looking for a hero's journey I also owe you a ton of these things and it's empowering it's just incredibly it's incredibly empowering to know that you're a hair's breadth away from super powers so I want to help people explore that what is that are you saying this is bizarre series of numbers right what is it doing like what how do we interface with it well so for example it's the ticket easier system that we feel a little bit more confident with there's this thing called a quaternions which are based on the number 1 the complex number I if you remember that from some distant math class and then there's something called J&amp;K so I X J equals JJ x k equals i j x is equal to the negative of i x j so negative K there's a multiplication table for these these objects and these objects help with computer vision in a computer simulation 3D projections there used all the time in probably video games they may come up in nature only we know that nature use of complex numbers and most people never find out why they were being cold about complex numbers are imaginary numbers because they never got to the point where you're actually looking at wave functions that describe photons and electrons and all of all of that good stuff that you read about in physics so in essence the octonian Tsar system where I J K keeps going effectively through l m n o p q r e no till you've got eight different objects and they're not even associative which is one of these rules that you learn about you know applications associative what is an associative commutative I can't tell whether you put on your shirt first or your shoes first because it's it's commutative is to which order you did it but if you put on your underwear in a different order than you put on your pants will become immediately obvious which order you did it right okay well there's another thing called associativity and it's almost everything that we deal with in your elementary mathematics is associate is he was like why do I learn about associative and never met octonian Venus ocean a number system that is responsible for most of the platypi of mathematics if you want things that just occur anomalously so that's an example of an invitation out of this planet you know if you start to think about the arcturians and care about them and say it are they a message do they have meaning we can prove that they're their construct them for you but they generate so much pain in some sort of abstract space how are they recognized like how was it how did it come to be too disappointed discuss whether there's a process in fact or two processes where you can build these number systems up from each other so you build the complex from the real build quaternions from the complex you build the exponents from the quaternions and then you can't build anything beyond that because each time you're giving up a magical power to get to the next stage by the time you get to the octo means you're exhausted this way get think I'm a magical power but like for example it's very hard to think about the square root of -1 so like what does it mean for something squared to be negative so that's like the complex numbers gave up that kind of sensibility and then the complex numbers are at least commutative 8 * b equals B * 8 but the quaternions don't have that Prosper property so then you have a further property called associativity so you sort of to eat to build the next system you're giving up properties that sort of makes sense to us by the time you got to the afternoons you giving everything away there's no way you're going to build the next system I but yet it's real yes yet it's real and it's in a very real mathematical sense so does it just highlight our lack of understanding yeah and it and it is a call to Adventure it's like a message from something that isn't human not going to say that it's God I'm not going to say that it's logic tour design but it's a more complex with summoning them of the universe that's right and you have to uncover that these things are there or for example you know Ciela I don't know if you like played with the do you know about the Allegan no CLI do you say Elegance c letter elegance and that'll again Michael again I think it's this worm that was chosen by the sky Sydney Brenner who just died and it's a shame because you would have been a great podcast guess just like one of those brilliant biologists that we didn't focus on and he said you know what we're missing a species that we can completely describe Soup To Nuts his one that's about the simplest thing with a brain it's only got a thousand cells and 300 of those cells make up a very primitive neural system and we're going to track where every goddamn cell like bring up Jamie if I could ask you something to bring up the cell lineage diagram for C elegans says be the first of two images well that is it complete map of how one fertilized egg becomes a tiny microscopic Worm for every possible division why am I looking at I love when you say that that is so wild yeah right now here's the thing everyone in biology knows how cool this thing is and very few people not enough people outside of biology know that we have completely mapped how one cell like if you're 30 trillion cells around this too big to write a diagram it's only possible because they're only a thousand cells and this thing has Locomotion that has sexual reproduction you know he eats so you're looking at the architectural plans for an actual organism and Jamie when we're done with that if I could trouble you for the falkenberg going to pause route for moment for the folks that are falling at home listening just listening not watching what we're looking at Jamie explain what how someone can see this image they want to go who sells the letter c is not that Nazi like the ocean to C elegans amended cell lineage looks like a really long basketball bracket has pushed out forever Miss June man if we could bring up the wiring diagram or adjacency Matrix Galaxy August perfect that is a complete map of the 300 neurons in the C elegans worm how they are wired to each other like that is a map of the mind of the war okay so that's the portal that's another portal here's an organism which is completely mapped and has complex behaviors it hasn't I think about half the number of adult cell types that you and I have to maybe we have like 250 only 250 different kinds of adult cells more or less and want to get to precise about that and yet we are like 10 trillion to 30 trillion copies of those tiny number of different type I think the C elegans has about a hundred twenty-five or something like that different cell types and it only has a thousand cells and it's able to do most of what we're able to do we move around we eat we have sex pretty simple life of a human organism I don't think so but the cool thing is we still don't understand it like we've got this we got a box did it can't you know every single cell would it does we have all the wiring between the neurons we still don't get it right so like imagine that you're 8 years what a genius this guy Sidney printer was for choosing this organism right because this organism is the simplest place to look at complex life this image of the reconstructed biological neural networks we could have a discussion about some weird Peruvian structure and whether we've been visited and I'm be up for that but I know that this is real I'm too good for it but I know that this is real right I don't have any doubt I'm not going to sit around asking what do you believe that aliens talk to this federal government the 40s right that might as well be an alien and it's an invitation to Adventure</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> maybe maybe this is a good Segway I hadn't thought about it this way but so we use this format to announce that I am in fact starting the podcast I've recorded a couple boom episodes already there in the Canon is it is called the portal to portal the portal is refers to listing thing that I thought everyone was aware of but very often people would react to it when I was a kid I read all of these stories that I thought were known to be the same story but different versions of it and I called it the portal story and it was always the same somebody is trapped in a humdrum existence in an Ordinary World until some sort of magical portal accidentally or on purpose their life and either they go through a wardrobe they go through a rabbit hole Looking Glass platform nine and three-quarters or you know Dorothy famously was used to introduce Technicolor Rishi the first part of the film she's in Kansas and it's in grayscale black and white and then she lands at Oz and they open the door and it's Technicolor and there's this transitional scene where you see Technicolor for the first was that the first time ever in a movie believe so and so so the question is where's the portal like why do we tell the same story over and over and over again the different protagonist but it's always the same formula it's somebody is trapped in an Ordinary World there's sort of there were around normies they find the portal in the portal becomes the Call to Adventure and they spend time in the alternate universe and somehow they're able to live very often they return Remember The Phantom Tollbooth Milo gets this present of a car in a toll booth and he goes through the toll booth and he was out from the author and Jules feiffer was did the illustrations which is brilliant book is like the land of letters in the land of numbers with Arts and Sciences and you know like there's a there's a person starts from his head and grows down until his feet reach the ground and there's a numbers mind and guest rescue the princesses of rhyme and reason in order to restore order between the two kingdoms of the are like left and right Hemisphere and some incredibly exciting story and the idea that after he goes and does all of these that there's an island called conclusions and when you make an assumption you leap to conclusions so you suddenly jump my music Audrey clever wordplay insta at the end of the adventure the toll booth disappears because it has to go to the next kid who needs you know and so my question was always why why on Earth would we tell the same story over and over and over and over and over again has the same format it's always a different context and I came to believe that the story is actually the unkept promise for most people that in their adult lives find these portals so for example have you ever been to Barcelona Spain know there is a church in Barcelona Spain which is plenty impressive from the outside when you go inside and look at pictures of it my entire life called La Sagrada Familia it is a psychedelic drug trip and a half like you've never seen that is the most bizarre interior space I've ever seen in my life can you bring up the interior of this thing and on the one hand it induces like a hallucinogenic State on the other hand it's an idea of what the architect Gaudi now he's very famous he did a lot of buildings around Barcelona there is nothing like the inside of this church on this planet and f*** that beautiful if you look up at the roof and like most things you should have prepared for them your whole life and then you see it you think I guess that's cool I've been seeing this thing my whole life and I had no no concept of what a genius is human being was because nothing he did the outside of it a fact he's such a d such a genius that they can't finish it in the style that he started because nobody knows it's like an unfinished Symphony what would you do nobody smart enough to finish the this church and when we when I was on this program before I thought long and hard what is it that I could push out to the planet to let people know how wonderful and beautiful the world that we live in is and we pushed At the Hop vibration and suddenly your car said to people this is the most important object in the universe. The hopf fibration particular but the class called principal bundle which people have no idea it's out there and it is the basis of the constructs in which we live so how is it that your normal human being can make contact with real physics with a real beauty of Baal your you know just understanding order symmetry all of these things that are Beyond normal experience and what I hope to do with the podcast is to have amazing guests and interesting conversation but to thank you for that that guy was really something but that is very similar to psychedelic States well maybe some people have access to them all the time right in park but doesn't actually know stration it sits above our sink out there a guy who has called no thank you is a tumor tumor in his pineal gland and so he he accesses you States all the time so this guy has its 100% DMT inspired artwork I mean if you look at it it's like what you see when you do DMT trips it's like it's a version you know into didn't his style of art but you eat their the signature thank you Sean thanks the artwork it's f****** awesome it's it's in our kitchen I'll take a picture of it later and put it online but that's his stuff like that's super DMT like to me is I mean that's a thing a tryptamine type experience at you like you could say like Alex Grey probably the most representative I would say he's the most representative in terms of artists in the DMT space in terms of like tryptamines and psilocybin things on those lines if you think about psychoactive chemical some of them are stupefying but some of them are portals and this concept of you look at a wall how do you know that the wall doesn't have a door how do you know that there's in the Panic Room behind the bookcase if you just pull out the right book we Are we learn to stop looking for the portal and I think what I what I do differ but I do differently than other people is that I became obsessed with exits that there are other worlds and they're real that this this mythologie if the Looking Glass in the rabbit hole in the Matrix is metaphor for very real things</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> well I was reading the quote today from the song was mocking from Piers Morgan we was talking about the atheist and not knowing what happened before the Big Bang not knowing how no one has any answer for what happened before the Big Bang in about how this made sense to him that this is I think it's the way of saying it was somehow another was evidence or at least in his eyes of us something more Superior know it is I just can never say what was there before the Big Bang they just say nothing and they can explain what nothing actually is no human brain can which is why I believe in something that has Superior powers to the human brain well that makes sense that there's definitely Brian Cox went after his ass would have if you mean the hot big bang then there may be a. Of Rapid expansion known as inflation this theory is able to account for the observed features of the universe and Cooling CMB power spectrum and the flatness in Horizon problems I love it became why the Big Bang happened it's an interesting quote by this guy was talking about forget who was wish I could remember what he was talking about how people have been McKenna have so much faith in science and so little faith in mystical things but yet science revolves on One initial Theory where magic took place where everything came out of nothing that it was smaller than the head of a pencils to everything you see in the observable universe including Planes Trains and Automobiles all of it had to have had an origin in the most spectacular sorcery the world has ever known like it is all depended upon magic so he was you wasn't saying that you know ridiculous ideological ideas of the start and birth and death of the universe RR fact but he was saying that look look the fact according to scientists is that all evidence points to this whole thing coming out of nothing this whole thing is hold the existing out of nowhere and with Piers Morgan us I think it's saying is it that gives birth that they give proof that something superior to the human brain which for short here we are at this is transferred by science to believe the entire universe sprang from nothingness and at a single point and for no discernible reason just notion is the limit case for credulity in other words if you can believe this you can believe anything well I think I send it in a paraphraser go away that's basically the same thing he's Tink I like to think of it is in simulation terms and in in the sense that if thinking of like reality in the way of perceiving the way we move through it is kind of a designed games of sorts and and and sorry for that way like nothing and something nothing in something that's just kind of the the core of our reality right we live in a binary reality everything is a complex assortment of binary that add up into a really complex system anyways what do you think it's moving towards well think about that well that's that's the thing I think that part of the rules or what makes it hard to rationalize like nothingness or or something very very fantastic is just because it because binary we are binary in our thought process so it's hard for us to not think of things in a binary way so we think other was a beginning know there was an ending there was a beginning there's any but really it's infinitely like it's Paradox right it to everything and nothing simultaneously and and the absence of which but but I guess what I'm saying is that the idea that things are infinite that reality is infinite is kind of a good way but kind of can be scary but a good way to think of it because it doesn't make any sense why wouldn't be it seems like we have a limited way of viewing what reality is and I think we're limited by a binary thought processes I guess we want to put any sort of limitations on the universe in that heat cement size isn't crazy enough for us what we know if we know that the Universe has hundreds of billions of galaxies like there's a bunch of competing theories as to what happens with black holes and black hole in the center of every Galaxy and it's exactly that I think one half of 1% of the mass the entire galaxy that is there is a real possibility that going through that black hole you would encounter an entirely different Universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies each Galaxy have a black hole in the center of it that black hole in entirely different Universe each one universe will you have hundreds of billions of galaxies there is hundreds of billions of universes through those black holes and each one of those Galaxy which one of those universes has also hundreds of billions of galaxies and each one of those has a black hole you go through that hundreds of billions of galaxies that the whole thing rectal exactly just like just keeps on happening oh, yeah there's nothing like an instant reaction to resist that notion as if the universe itself isn't already the most incredible thing of magic right what is that mean about us it's like that's the question that's the thing to Explorer because then you have to renegotiate your your your relationship to reality which is pretty sick we have at least we'd like to take comfort in the idea the universe has at least this has certain parameter to it Cox explained to me as well there's a real this real lack of understanding about what goes beyond that because it takes a certain amount of time for light even get to us and that time that the light doesn't move fast enough to reach us from further events so you had something from like 200 billion light years ago but maybe the light win get to us yet yeah there's things of yeah I mean we're leaving at a time machine when you look in the sky and you're seeing a Galaxy or any sort of a star like in the deep deep deep distance of space the f****** light coming from that thing left a million years ago yeah I know star our star in the Seattle Universe when you look up at the night sky where things are the dogs that are on our way. Got a star sometimes things are called starts with X giving a jump kill if you go the speed of light take you for the Hawaii of outer space that like to go there and there's a pit stop there before they come to Earth and Aliens County want to chill tonight I hope so does an average of 4.3 this one's for .22 so it's nice or so 2 or closer than the one on one day. Do they know if there's planets around those Stars so they didn't even know there were other planets for sure other than a hangout in the crazy different distances and you can see better under certain circumstances we can seal at different time so like it's kind of like a big existential party you're like I think I'm making sense of this and then there's always. And then someone catches another angle to like I mean yes a little bit of what you guys are thinking but also there and they just keep adding to it but I don't know if we're going to find now they know that there's black holes out there in the first place and that they have here he's f****** like these these these theories of multiverses and yeah that's my favorite and brains the membranes that there's like yeah.

In the middle of the song with sausages symbols and f*** music it's like oh yeah yeah where it started off great and then for a minute and a half and f*** sounds shape for you baby I want to be your Backdoor Man over 5 million doses within between 65 and 67 it says do they have their own personal guy and he was the one that making the sound so is that guy still alive that's so cool I love that because that's responsible I think that's the responsible thing to do. Just leave your own chemist summer and one of the concerts we did was for Phil Lesh he's the bass player of the Grateful Dead and my job for that day was to walk around the parking lot and they would just yell me and my buddy were denied 19 years old to 6 up 6 up if that were going to arrest everyone and they would try to give us the goo balls which have a bunch of drugs and I'm already too sore to do so we leave everybody alone what's a Google it's like a popcorn ball but from what I was told I've never had one bunch of psychedelics it's like a popcorn ball but from what I was told I've never had one bunch of psychedelics knows what's in it</div>

Just stopped like there's like some national parks stuff and maybe some things pastelillos some Led stuff some Mercury stuff in a common sense really hardcore s*** that should definitely no-brainers those have been then but anything else making sure that that balance is there as the economy Chris just doesn't exist just the way capitalism is right now it's like it doesn't that's not considered a value there's the more in fact that more scarce it becomes the higher in value it is so it's so it's in its own best interest to continue to grow in can grow until it can't grow anymore so that's why I decisions like that are made in my in my mind well decisions that impact the Wilderness and impact in the environment like that movie Gasland no great matter of fracking but it's an amazing documentary and its really good really really good documentary into Roblox personal experience with do you remember the actual Story Jamie it's like personal experience with some pollutants or something like that in the river we got anyway met this amazing documentary and I did watching people dismiss someone stuff documentary was so so so so real oh yeah really lighting their tap water on fire and if you saw that but I did see that yeah and that's crazy people literally were saying you could do that before the fracking that's not it's not because of the fracking how much s*** has to be in your water for it to be on fire okay what's going on here and why are you so sure that this didn't come from fracking and that you could always let your water on fire and now you're telling us videos about this before before there was a fracking thing yes show me a video things people do with it like really interested in the interest of big business and they want to like the gas and regular people who don't even have a financial stake in that business will make up excuses for the business I know it's crazy yeah but it's fear fear of losing jobs like people like losing jobs or losing the thing that keeps their their bills paid Tulsa would like that no-nonsense right-wing mindset is like a no-nonsense right-wing Minds at all these f****** tree huggers God damn. So they want to go with anything that's like good for the economy but bad for the environment exactly crazy but if you decide like hey I'm going to pull copper out of this f****** hole in the ground but it might kill a million salmon like imagine how much a million salmon would be worth your going to kill a whole population of Salmon how much is that worth a year ruin fishing for all the people that want to come to this one Salmon River yeah you kill a million fish like how much is that worth that's that should be worth a billion dollars is a billion dollars if not more it has no value was it uses also with ours like it does not it's just a nut is not a part of the equation for growing economy that's like and I know there's going to be people this thing that I like just know about this s*** hardcore I'm just approaching it from I can over kind of philosophical energetic viewpoint have you ever seen some of the image of the mining that they do the images of the mining they do in Northern Canada Lake Northern Alberta now dude it's like some hellscape s*** it's crazy cuz it's like there's a giant industry of oil mining up there and they all kinds of mining a lot of folks that go up there and they do shifts but unbelievably brutally cold I would really like to live in their living with monsters just outside the gates again f****** Nights Watch type deal with a trying to suck oil out of the ground and it didn't mean there's so much of it up there and it's such a big part of the economy that you have these giant like aerial views of these these places that are just f**** Bill wow man's is one of them the one I saw was much more horrific cuz it involves the lake so what is this a photo Spain photographer Alex McClure oil sands yeah I mean creepy it's I mean but there was nothing there anyway the ideas like hey if it's just flat like that or it's ugly because we have holes in oil coming out of hole who gives a s*** no one's up here right I get it I get that mindset we got jobs everyone has jobs and it's true it's a great job to have they make a lot of money you meet those dudes to come to a lot of shows when you do in Canada named for him what is the nickname that's one that I saw I want to see the water all f***** up it's all filled with oil and s*** on my lords all of the all of the issues that all of the imbalances are completely what it would take to make good decisions that make life really nice for most people on the planet I think about a managing has to be done because it's a lot of stuff that is unintended consequences and moving pieces of fact all the moving pieces around them of course I think that's one of the things that people are really bad at predicting that's why I was saying like how much is it worth to get copper out of a hole in the ground going to poison the river and kill a bunch of fish people have this sense that like you make one decision it only affects that thing but it doesn't facts a lot of things are connected to that thing it also affects the way people feel you do some shity like kill a million fish people get bummed out like that's real if that's the way they interact with other people when you read something really f***** up on the news like God damn it until you leave your house like that you leave your house like God dammit that goddamn it and then they they get upset at each other for something that wouldn't before yeah there's thing in this bunch of pedophiles out there a bunch of monsters in a bunch of murderers and a bunch of people pouring oil into the ocean yeah that changes how we feel about people</div>

Of 2 million years a real human brain size apparently I was listening to a lecture on this once. Too many years is one of the biggest mysteries in the fossil record and his idea was that date mushrooms in that The Chimps over this. Of time with the monkey people whatever the f*** they were ancient hominids had discovered mushrooms after the climate shifted and he backs it up and he did back to the place he's dead now he backed it up with some climate data that we know from core samples and stuff like that experienced climate change where the rainforest had receded in the grasslands and that this gave birth to the types of unusual it's like cows and you know the deer and things like that and they would share these mushrooms grow on their s*** and then they've observed a lot of these monkeys in the wild picking up Cow Patties and looking for grubs and beetles underneath it I think they might have experimented with the mushrooms and then if they experiment with psilocybin mushrooms a lot of things could take place once they realize that it was not just a viable food source but also provided them with a bunch of different benefits one being their vision increasing visual Acuity no Services make some more communal and it'll make some more creative and all those things possibly could have given birth to the tutu language into a lot of other things they also think it's possible that that creativity could have enabled them to start hunting and they started using tools and you and thinking and and and trying to figure out ways around stuff and trying to you know try to figure Jamaica an effective weapon to kill something in the distance of the more they're thinking and becoming creative the more that that's helps enhance him and this this. Of 2 million years is like a pretty profound jump for the human brain size they think some of that also came to do with our desire to kill things with with weapons around so we started hunting and eating meat we got way more protein more bioavailable protein all it was healthier for the animal for the human animal and then we also started to try to figure out other better ways to kill animals which made us even more creative and competitive is all these factors might have taken place that turned us into a person that's pretty amazing 2 million years I think you're right. It was like a weird little mold that's what it is with 5 million years ago in the shadow of the dinosaurs so that rat-like creature apparently survived the earthquake with the asteroid impact its there's another what there's a formal name for it I would I know because I was on a podcast and they were the what are the segments of it they talked about this thing this is the only reason why I'm skeptical 145 my creatures are the earliest known ancestors of humans whales and Truth okay with even more crazy like we used to be a whale or our ancestors we shared a common ancestor I should say yeah we like went into the sea and then yeah on land that thing that f****** rap became a well maybe that's it I know a hundred million years from now rats might be some super Superior human form I think that's very possible that I get why Christians are skeptical now show me your work got me this.</div>

wanted to show out you know so I go out and I pull the car up I do the first rap and I was like it took 90% of everything I had but like a meathead it's for wraps so I go pull the second one about halfway up my my lower back pops and I just let go my both my legs went stiff and then they would numb completely I fall forward into Brian's arms actually at least judging me and my legs were numb like maybe two months straight and then off and on for like 2 years they were just so bad for that first two months I actually ended up in second finish that show ended up in 2nd place qualify for Nationals which is was my gold so I could get my Pro card I went home started training for Nationals with numb legs and had to sleep in my pickup truck cuz I wouldn't I couldn't lay down we had we had a studio at the time no chairs we just had a bad and so I would sleep in my pickup truck get up drive to the gym GO train and I'm looking back like yeah that was stupid it was really stupid but that's one side failed at football once I kind of painting myself in this corner I was like I'm just I'm just not going to lose and you never got an MRI didn't have insurance now you don't want to get a look-see kind of do I mean it feels good now I mean I should take a peek I'm going to go get my achilles checked out cuz it's been really careful about how I am rehab stuff like that but you're right yes I should check out my bag is crazy though that your legs are numb for 2 years off and on for about 2 months straight in the leg asleep. beating up a lot of that point and like my first year was strongest man it was so easy for me to get to the finals I kind of just was like you know f****** is whatever I didn't know I don't have to work for this I am the strongest man without having to work for it and then got in Africa after being beaten up a lot and kind of getting my head push down in the sand for two years in a row and rip that off and I'll just like UPS I'm done like I in my head like I just I thought I was done I remember walking out by the river I'm so mad just feeling like broken just like I didn't know what I was going to do with myself or anything like that and I walked back to the tent and the referees were telling me like you know get your stuff they don't they don't want you that once you get hurt left the flight home right away they don't let you stay and watch the Finish any night shift they believe yeah I think it's a liability thing the judge for the show was like Hey we're doing the What's called the Hercules hold and are you going to do it in the Hercules hold means you reach you reach out with both arms feel like this and you have like a handle like basically like like in the gym you know the row handelsman like that attach to a tower that's falling and hold it as long as you possibly can in my mind so I went over there I was like f*** it like what's this at least leave a mark you know like I had to do something he's taping up or anyting but what are you going to tape up last night I mean like it takes fully extended your arm it's basically just taking weight pulling you and it's so it's not direct like curling hurting but it's it's yanking attendant further in up in your bicep and I felt it creeping up into my shoulder as I was doing it and I did great actually do I crave remember just closing my eyes and being gone and just when I let go it was almost like being baptized man like I felt like all the pain and all the stress everything I felt like build up once I've gotten hurt I just dumped it all and then it took me it took me two more years I finally fought back I thought I was done and then last year I made it back into the finals I was not now again strongest man in the world is it was because of surgery and Rehab surgery and then everything else was so beat up once I've once I finally stepped back I was like a like it there's there's no reason I should have to take an hour or two to be able to walk in the morning yeah and I don't like no reason why my back should hurt from walking from the front door to the car and I like I was so racked and so I just started working on different things trying to take care of myself and I got back two worlds text you actually I got back and I just didn't do well I cuz I hadn't been able to do anything and then came back the following year which was just this last year and I was told was my last time I was getting invited because at this point like you're done it's time for you to find something else I've been working so hard but you never know how strong you are until turn up you never know like what kind of athlete chart until you get tested right so I got a ride up and I'm I got done I just crushed when I'm when I finished a load about the stone and I knew I was in the finals like dude and I did a motion just think a lot of right now like it just felt like somebody just washed all that way member ripping my shirt off strong and pretty shirt and I'll just roaring in Malaysia and like everybody just kind of like stuck up a little bit it was awesome and it's like basically just digging out scar tissue is huge huge like a lot of people and stuff like that I went the cheap route I took a Black &amp; Decker skill saw and I got the stuff attachments work tons of stretching and like basically just digging out scar tissue is huge huge like a lot of people use like a theragun and stuff like that I went the cheap route I took a Black &amp; Decker skill saw and I got the stuff attachments put it all together cost me like 65 bucks</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's like I was I'm actually like a little nervous about telling athletes that they should smoke weed now like that's that's nerve-wracking cuz like your whole dependent you're depending on you on your boss in the place you work in the things you do right so just saying something like that if two people find that offensive and they raised enough hell sure that's a big f****** deal but we're just saying is like it's better than Vicodin it's better than that it's it's it's a very much healthier alternative alternative man is a tool it's like you can abused tools but you could also use them correctly I mean you don't want to f****** Hammer nails with a saw right but but if you use marijuana correctly and you have discipline and you know what you're doing but the problem is that has been illegal for so long people don't understand what the best way to use it for is and what are the side effects what is the what's the paranoia what's this heightened sense of awareness that kind of freaked people like how do you how do you mitigate that how do you how do you get over what's the right dosage all that stuff is dependent upon information and when people are lying to you about it being terrible and you know making you f****** blind and losing your marbles and you're going to kill people and stuff people are so confused about it that it also makes you more paranoid because you're smoking you think I'm going to shouldn't be doing this but what am I doing I'm ruining my life now what about sponsors is it ever an issue with sponsors the Weeping where would be right now the only people I work with other than myself is that nanoceutical Solutions so he's actually working on doing the CBD thing and stuff I don't know if I'll be a part of that cuz I'm trying to it's so available now I just I'd rather just find whoever doesn't the very best and not not Market at cry it's so saturated I just take it for myself actually a lot of people I worked in group homes college fair for kids with autism on for a long time and I was actually this little girl who she had this it's not a disease she had this I'll just call the thing she had this thing when she was falling so so like she completely normal she was autistic and non-verbal didn't speak but imagine all day feeling like you're falling so she learned as a child really little if she would hit herself that people would hold her so you weren't holding her she would little ass watch her break room knows that she was she was 11 years old this sweet little girl like just super nice and smiley but like if you didn't hold her she just whack right now face and we found out that is who I don't remember exactly how it came about but they they gave her THC pills they gave it to you and then she would walk around the house normally like you're still nonverbal it's not like it's fixed but with the whole symptoms of feeling like she was falling which I don't even think had anything to do with autism again I'm not a doctor but the other kids tie their shoes must have been four months later and their friends had gilded them about giving her dog their daughter weed and they stop giving it to her and she went right back to it straight back to it so stupid it's just ignorant people just don't understand what it is that's all it is so much like there's these little rules that you don't understand right and he would just he would feel stressed out and he would sit and the rule was when he did that we weren't allowed that to help them up or move them or anything like that because that was rewarding bad behavior that's how they classified that so he would just sit in the middle of the road and we weren't allowed to get him out of the middle of the road he would he would in then he learned that if he didn't want to do something if he basically would stay in his room all day he would stay in his room all day because he didn't like the only worker he likes me and I think it's just cuz I was begging and jolly and all that but if you didn't like the person who's working with he just sit in his room and on the floor and then they couldn't touch him they couldn't do anything he just sit there he'd go days without eating or going anywhere out of the room or anything like that and it was all because we put these rules and and put these chains on ourselves based off of other people's opinions are wondering what it would look like if we did this you know if if this girls taking the pill what does that look like art by 4 boy off the ground what does that look like in it was it was it was it was like trying to help these children with your hands tied behind your back and I don't know if it's like that anymore it was this was a long time ago but it was just it was heartbreaking everyone is terrified to work with this little boy he was 10 or 11 he's just a sweet little dude he just didn't he got nervous and so I remember coming in and one day I was like you know what I'm taking him to go to a football game so I took him to a college division 1 football game never had an issue never had any problems never sat down nothing sat second row in the endzone and black would get all excited every time anybody came by like the the cannon went off for a touchdown was like the greatest moment of my whole like college career was hanging out with his eleven-year-old at a college football game people were too terrified to even get out of his room I'd like to think that that a lot of people work more in that direction after I left and you know I'm hoping I see you as you can see in his eyes he was a sweet little boy you know I've never met a kid that was evil ever you just need to know how to how to work with him how to talk with him</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> but I think what's interesting is like that kind of stuff is so much less satisfying than to bring it back to like what you do then like something that you have to really work for and it's really difficult and it's a very visceral real feel like the feeling of accomplishment you get when you do something for a tool will never be able to compare the feeling that you do when you do physical visceral thing when she feeling your f****** phone feel it you can do it when I was doing world strongest man in Botswana Africa I tore my bicep and I just was getting beat up over and over again I was just so wracked my body wasn't accepting cuz I went from football to strongman and in football we've never done deadlifts it was all hang cling to power cleans which by the way just quick little tip deadlifts if you're if you're deadlifting to be a better deadlifter fine if you're not doing that for deadlifts sake then don't f****** do it the risk-to-reward ratio is yoke 4 Dead Left 4 Dead left a lot of people aren't going to like that I'm saying that but if you go into any NFL gym in any Division 1 college football gym in any Athletics where people actually getting paid and it matters what they're doing they're not deadlifting their hand cleaning up our cleaning reward ratio like it's so hard to be a great deadlifter into not risk your low back and to be using your upper back properly and you know just there's so many little chances for you to get hurt you're not answering stuff that was that was me my first world strongest man I was the only rookie in the finals China how much weight is that that was 880 lb402 us me and my pink Chucks hello take some of the ways out of it and it's so flimsy when you clean it it's like basically like holding that earthquake bar that you have out there I realize just like that and it's it's f****** brutal so they take weight out of that round thing that's what is in that round thing there's will there's several different attachments to it so maybe some of them weigh different I've never liked them apart of that but like either that or it unscrews at the end they take weights out of it I'm not positive shot at it never never actually got to do it now what what kind of transition like what is the transition to get into strongman went from that to a security guard in Santa Cruz this place called The Catalyst which is why I work for like 6 years it's a really cool bar/concert venue so I was like spoiled I got to hang out with Rob Zombie and Willy's it would be really cool I'm sure he is the best one lemon Kool-Aid Play junior college ball with was just obsessed a strong man and I I never heard of it I never watched it like when I was growing up we were poor like there was 10 of us in a three-bedroom house and for my school on like we didn't have electricity so like we didn't watch TV we would play outside wait a trampoline you didn't have electricity in high school on the weekends my dad works for Caterpillar Cashman Equipment on the weekends he bring home a little generator and you plug that in and we have like three things we could use that was like oh hot water heater would work for the and then like maybe the TV on Saturday night or something like the TGIF but I mean it wasn't a kid it's not that big of a deal you just go play with your brothers outside so but like I never knew what's wrong man was because of that I mean I'd had no idea so he was obsessed with it and he kept trying to get me to do it and then I went home and Google that check it out actually I don't know if it was back then who knows what we had I was excited when tried it out and first day the amateur world record at log press was like 320 lb of the time and I had no idea but the first day I hit 330 lb and put it down and I looked over my buddy and I was like I have micro card two months after that I was in China that that photo at their watch on Hitman I was the only rookie in the finals so is it the lock thing as it did the awkwardness of like holding onto a log and getting it on your hands and and it's it's actually it's a lot healthier for your shoulders instead of being how would you call that with your hands right there instead of so yeah so it's better for you it's much better for your wrist and your shoulders and also like that's what my grip so yeah it's not free I buy all of it then I don't work with him either but they're the best best yet so we went to Worlds and then I totally lost a whole game kilos and that's what is that walking 468 that was this moment Jesus Christ Alex having you show me show off a little bit to I like to do this after I get it up wow so that's the world record American record who's the world record the world record I like to hold it up there and talk to it start something right around there it might have been to 220 how close are they are you that I can I can break it in January I'm going to London London a little introduction to Texas so what are you call Texas Pride in Texas powerlifting amateur record right away broadhurst first attempt out and is that when you felt like f*** I could do this s*** yeah I went home and call Mike my my fiance the time we're living in a studio and we're just broke and I was volunteer coaching and I was for high school which is my passion High School football and then I was working at that club at night so I didn't have a lot of time but I was like I can make this happen with with my personality and this is a platform I can do this and everybody can't tell me there's no money in strongman there isn't any and they really wasn't there wasn't like there was no money in strongman until I made money in store I like really brought it into there were several other people but like what we did was we cultivated a whole new era of strong man was before I can even like pujanauski was a guy who got a lot of attention cuz he looked just shredded yeah Jack but I mean if you ever episode that they did in Poland I thought he was in Ballin Outta control you would think so I know who he is I feel like if I know who you are and you do something on TV you must be rich so much sugar then he would eat chocolate bars competition peanut butter and honey or Snickers bars there's a Russian guy who was the Russian secret service for a while unless you look in his eyes point across and everything but yeah that that guy's done probably scared of s*** I'm sure there's a lot of that cuz we compete with people from all around the world and now and we we tend to forget that everywhere else there's a lotta it's a bit normal almost to be like that in some places right to survive and if you're a giant dude it's probably the best way to make a living exactly take that you see guys do that right before they go lifting stuff the way I grew up in the the the way I did things like I was always taught and it kind of worked with being broke but like a warrior goes to war hungry that's it like in football I would never eat before game ever and then got in the strong man and I did that for a long time and I got up to 440 lb and I would I would do an entire show like the five six hours without eating mutton during that with a little bit but I would never eat a meal Bryant what's the name of the resources and eats up your resources right right for me it felt like anything in my stomach just made me feels like slow to from Katt Williams watch an interview with them. Don't eat before you go on stage and like that makes sense you better off being hungry right now 80 oz I was 440 I lost 80 lbs and when I got hurt in Botswana and I lost all that way and then you can chose to do that but I got up at 4:40 and just walking around was laborious and I felt like f****** horrible do you think that log press that was like like 4:25 ish 4:30 I gained a little bit more after that I just everyone tells you in the sport the bigger you are the strong you are and that kind of holds true to static lifting like kind of it's not necessary all the time but it kind of holds true but we gotta move man like we're talking about pulling a truck and doing those events and all that stuff when when your 440 and your body is not agreeing with that 448 just hold you back on your joints to lower back that's what happened I got hurt and I felt like I was done cuz my low back I'd have to take me like 45 minutes to get out of bed in the morning I was messed up man really bad and made an MRI but there's something like negative connotation with being like someone who smokes weed but I mean I watching guys take Vicodin like it's Skittles I'm watching I've seen guys throw away their lives their families a career over a bunch of pills because they didn't want to smoke and it's it's crazy you know</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> meet you like if someone is summer I love talking trash right that's my thing and then strong man it's not very popular like when I got everything I do know they don't it's very old-school like you're supposed to do your work not act like you're supposed to get paid not act like you're supposed to want any attention not drawing attention towards yourself karate in like 1960s top Echelon without having that respect but it's ridiculous for the for people who've never been at the Elm at on that level to tell other people how they're supposed to behave please like it when people talk some s*** and win or lose sometimes you have to eat that like what's that that kid that Ben askren exactly flatlines that was brutal but that mean he also took that on the chimney put up a post like right after that looking for brussel sprouts and smack in the face yeah he had to give him two extra shots to the face which how do I people give him shifa that's his job yes it is go to the referee stops you especially when there's a heated contest like that we talked so much s*** and he insulted his manhood he talked about it talk all this s*** online about me before the fight but then after I knock him out I'm I'm not supposed to showboat I'm not supposed to celebrate the f*** out if you got a problem with its top winners get to do what they want and it's not over it is Instinct time you saw him like I saw somebody put a video up in practice and then you would be rounded up but I got to the outside and then acted as if it was going to be just a normal stepping then it's two quick steps in the army fastest ever UFC KO at 5 seconds but really he was out cold at 2 or whatever it took for him to run over there it seems like two seconds was like one 1002 I mean it took the rest of few seconds to get that yeah whatever maybe three I guess maybe I mean whatever it took for him to run over there it seems like two seconds was like one 1,000 to Tober</div>

Will Dicker that's all it comes up as all the way down low like that he comes out of prison culture from what I heard I hate it now but I feel like an old man cuz I used to do it as a kid like sag where I grew up in an area it was like it was a very low-income like area I don't know how to say that politically correct like style yeah I ran out of that by the time I was like 12 though only like this is ridiculous like you're done like you you're going to have to retrieve past and they're going to punch you in the face I just said you like asking to be you're like at a handicap you sound exactly like my father right now guys my age I was like what the f*** are you doing now is skinny jeans and sagging which is like the f*** are you doing it's too late now is skinny jeans and sagging which is like a counterproductive</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> idea where my energy comes from let's imagine that you actually believe that males and females are equally intelligent to Sherry and equivalents can I say LOL then what would you be you'd be fascinated as to why you don't have males and females and intellectually to pay any phone numbers ending in a demanding occupation start saying if I already assumed that males and females are equally intelligent I care about different categories how much of this is about fertility how much of this is about Kenworth how much of this the best structural oppression how much of this is about path dependence you do some very careful thing in order to understand your problem and only when you'd finally understood your problem would you say okay now I have an idea how to remediate it we need a financial product that transfers money from late-life to early life because the huge burden that knocks woman out of the stem pipeline might be that they have to take care of elderly parents are young kids Bingo night now you're working in a totally different idiom because you've actually come up with a different idea or for example if you make if you hard coat I could Sean Carroll I think just had a podcast in which he said something to the effect of War on the IDW is kind of into interested in race and IQ I have never been in race and IQ the only time I became interested in race and IQ was when I started hearing there is absolutely no variation between groups and you know in any kind of cognitive endowment certainly there is in terms of height the ability to radiate heat melanin content of the skinny buddy of absorb sunlight it doesn't pass the smell test that you could be able to say that a priori just it's not a scientific type statement it's something you have to investigate in that situation am I interested in some finding that says the one group is smarter and other groups are not as smart as I believe that I Q equal Spartan I don't believe I Q equals smartest do I believe that there's no cultural bias I think there is cultural bias I'm definitely on record as saying their ways in which group there's are said to Fairless well in terms of IQ demonstrate actual intellectual dominant this is some Rich weird area I've never cared about before the only reason that it becomes interesting to me is that suddenly work we're making these incredible proclamations with certainty like you know you can't say this word or this is absolutely true and life doesn't work like that there's no word in the English language George Carlin made this point all the time there are no bad work there's bad intent they're bad people issue being a part of a group ID IDW is too interested in race and IQ I'm not I'm not who is I mean I'm really not I don't discuss that at all who is Sam Harris's discussed it before but he discussed it with someone who's studying I don't think Sam Sam feldt that he had Sam feldt the Charles Murray had been railroaded by him but he Sam Harris and then as Sam came to understand what it is like mob turn on you Sam said maybe I'm wrong about Charles Marin there is recline me this really interesting point in a really unfair Way Again Sam which was basically like hey you don't know what Charles Murray is he's a hybrid he's not just a social scientist he's also got an agenda I have never read Marie's work but I don't know enough to say either but I think the whole idea about being able to recognize the differences in Jetton and race and IQ it's a it's a very contentious subject both be analyzed all I mean I have to admit that I don't score that well on certain tests so I have a built-in total skepticism of IQ test SAT test ACT test any kind of test because he is an unnatural examination intelligence it's a proxy that there are people who think so it's a really good proxy but I'll never met someone has a really high IQ though that I deem to be intellectually inferior yeah but I've met people who don't have very high IQs who just blow me away yes absolutely are capable of producing amazing stuff whether it's literature, DeWitt whatever it is movies they can make things they can do things they have a genius and in their ability and that requires some intelligent what requires some immeasurable to something that you can't put on a scale because it can seat you have to remember that a priori we would always have guessed that I intelligence was different things it was a composite of like lots of different types of intelligence that can seat around IQ is you'd think that was true but guess again there's a essentially one kind of intelligence is 1 scale it's a surprise is one of the things that you call intelligence process yes yes processing very important okay one of my family has ever scored while I mean by processing that has some kind of mechanical process of how quickly and flawlessly you can encode information play with it and get it out you know if you're dyslexic spelling lots of people on Twitter say haha you misspelled here in fact it's hear in the case that you meant is really that shows me something about your intelligence that you can't keep track of spelling okay that's your level of thought you haven't you know how many brilliant people can't can't spell can't write my also you not even thinking you just trying to get the word out and you missed appt yeah but like my mind you know at some point I got sent home I think because I was asked to draw chicken and school and I put two wings and 4 ft Don I'm so non-observant like my my handwriting might like at home yeah something like this I was like I was making fun of the teacher you know the famously mrs. Becky arrow in first grade sent me out of the class because I said the spider wasn't an insect because of that eight legs and that it was she sent you out of class because I was correct in that case I was in the case of a chicken I wasn't but well maybe saw some weird f****** Chernobyl chicken see Adam &amp; Noble chicken chicken kiev my point being that if you don't have a high confidence in normal metrics the race and IQ discussion doesn't land like so they get back to Charles Maria so Charles Murray it is hard to say he wrote the bell curve was either dismissed as being racist or applauded by people who you would call white nationalist who tried out his ideas as proof run as measurable move that sir races are superior and you know we could discuss this money online people who Trot those out all the time and they use it to form these weird groups of people that love to hear that right and that smacks of race at so this is the issue which has you have a situation in which he appeared to have a political orientation which is that he didn't want money spent in certain ways they wanted it spent another's there there and in political interpretation of why he wanted that which was maybe he's a closet racist then there was facts that will tend to empower people who are actually racist right below knee party they're sure but then there's the actual data right now in examining the actual data if you just look at the actual data is is it racist to look at the the real numbers if you say Nigerians in particular who are incredibly industrious and some of the more successful immigrant groups that I'm over to America also happen to be black if you wanted to look at Nigerians right in terms of like if you wanted if you if you fall if you even want to look at them particularly as a group be very difficult to be racist you have to say well this is your Superior a lot of superior intellect come from Nigeria they also tried out the Asian one right that ate like this I'd like to show that they're not racist like look at shows Asians are of a superior IQ i i i puzzle on that one that one's puzzle because I think with certain people with certain emails rats just go with males they look at African-Americans and they see superiority in in certain ways they see superiority athletically artistic musically look at the contributions of African-Americans culturally across-the-board terms of like the real that the Jimi Hendrix does Miles Davis eat of thought and creativity analytic also athletically like the f****** outliers are just so many there so many Michael Jordan's Mike Tyson Sugar Ray Leonard's there's so many African-American outliers who just extraordinary accomplishments right but not that many asian-americans in that regard so it's almost like they'll concede like they're not doing the things that make me jealous they're not they're not creating this insane music although there are few right but overall you're not creating these insane athletic accomplishments that these white Americans can't keep up with run so we'll see. I'll actually so I can't be racist I'm pointing out these Asian to jealous up because they don't do the things that I wish that I could do but then when it comes to the African-American you're there pointing out all the things that the African Americans can do that they can't do but this thing all but they're intellectually inferior by this is proven. I'm not racist I don't want this to be true but it seems to be true of suppressing accomplishment right while like almost mitigating the impact of the did they feel so if you think about for example person that makes sense. I think so first of all I just I hate the top view of it is if you never brought this thing up we would never have had to deal with it and I no longer believe that's true because we have so much inadvertent data right like I don't want the data on chess we have an idea of how many Grandmasters there are in which groups like male female Asian black you know various portions of Europe I don't know what that data means but I can't stop the data because it's going to be generated even if nobody comes up with a standardized test because it's a game and it's scored and it has something to do with intellectual abilities on the other hand I mean I'm a competitive guy and I I am you do comedy I do some some amount of music I can guarantee you that both of us have had her ass kicked at some point by African-Americans would sell them both of these areas and I don't mean you know All God's Children Got Rhythm I mean getting out funk in a competitive situation you know looking over somebody's shoulder on the keyboard and they're thinking so quickly and in so many dimensions I can't even imagine what the hell's going on right so therefore I never had a lot of fear about it because you know I'm in close proximity with somebody who's just kicking my ass and therefore I thought I could leave these topics alone I would never have to deal with it the way in which that they come up but you know in a way that is really unpleasant is this new thing which is that all imbalances are all structural oppression which doesn't allow for trade-offs between groups like fins things are good at some things and not good at others nobody believes in like Auntie finished Prejudice so we don't think about it it's just not it's not a big issue for us to finish humor how many finished comedians are there how many do you run into at The Comedy Store and also you're also dealing with the highest level of the game it's like you know that The Comedy Store essentially like the Harvard research Labs of stand-up comedy or worried that we're prejudiced against Jews or where they were prejudiced against Mexicans against blacks we have a pretty clean idea of what bigotry we really still need to worry about and we feel guilty about it and that's why you say it has this kind of lubricious quality so what are you doing up to over there when why are you looking at that day and my comment is is I don't know how to stop this thing I'm not excited about it I'm not interested in it I definitely think that we have to actually think about the social implications of all these things but if your if your idea that we're going to stop this at the level of data and Analysis I can't afford that but just can't afford that we need to have somebody who's able like for example microcephaly you got people smaller head than the rest of us maybe because of the zika virus what is it is it unethical to study what the cognitive impairment due to microcephaly is I don't know I don't know what to do but I know that I want to have a very thoughtful conversation how can it be how can it be unethical to study the cognitive impairment of someone is it affect affected by a disease and that could possibly help fund research help fund preventive measures and waterloo's correlation with with smaller heads and cam impairment you know and like what is somebody like to take Mosaic Down syndrome Mosaic Down syndrome doesn't have the same profile as regular Down syndrome get much higher functioning people write ultimately we're all souls and we have to figure out dignity and we have to figure out some system by which we can live with this increased level of knowledge but does examining impairment does that really mean that it's a prejudiced like what it would examining impairment from people who've been injured should we avoid doing that because we don't want to be able just to see him saying not quite what we were talking about reality right talk about issues if you're if you're examining someone who contracted the zika virus in it and it led to them developing a smaller head which is one of the horrible side effects of that rent it's is examining that in some way some sort of prejudiced it should be avoid examining is cognitive therapy examining it we might do some damage if we examine it and published findings we might do that do that mean there's other people that are infected or flick if we don't begin with an idea that ultimately the issue is compassion for ourselves and others and that a lot of our genetics in our history history Des predisposes us to bad behavior now that we're living with each other like we have to start I mean is hippy-dippy is astounding start from place of Love indecency I certainly agree but I think that we should avoid reality nothing right now so now I have this other thing which is reality is compassionate in and of itself remember when HIV was an equal-opportunity disease and it just started in the gay community and it's going to jump the Fire Road and it's going to be as much a heterosexual problem is it was homosexual pump that turned out not to be true it was an ideological statement that didn't look at the differences between kinds of epithelium in different sexual practices between gays and straights it was a it was a activist position that started to compete with a epidemiological position or biological position and so historically what we did is we had private expert communication and it's not always clear that you can trust your experts it's not always clear that you should start with the data what if the data says terrible things like maybe the data on microcephaly says something and you have got a person who's going to be judged by the size of their head which is visibly off from the rest of their body in a week we haven't taken up the challenge of our time which is okay we got a lot more information than we wanted to be a lot more ability to analyze it and we know something about ourselves we know that we have got bigotry is part of our our makeup and we know that we're not really good at certain ways of integrating information and you're becoming Triumph list in jerkish about it and taking Victory laps as if it's a competition like my groups better than your dryer so that's where we're stuck now I want to be struggling with other people or saying I don't know what the answers are I don't think you know as I bought it before I don't think East Africans are cheating on the Boston Marathon because they've come to dominate it just because you know suddenly you had a diverse group of people replaced by a very tiny group from Ethiopia we are behaving as you would expect when compassionate people who recognize that they have been bigoted and structurally oppressive encounter data that they can't handle which of the science is giving us more data than we ever wanted on these things and we're not answering the challenge of our time and that's what my issue is social justice is it's not about I don't want to better planet or more inclusive planet like stop crowding out the really difficult interesting open-hearted and hard-headed conversation with this dime-store nonsense about simple answers and simple simple truth because those aren't true and it is not going to work in the long-term and I guess that's maybe the ideas were competing with social justice for the rights to try to come up with a better more Equitable future in the think about it isn't you guys are trying to come up with a better more Equitable future it's what if you're going to make the same mistake when we said well that are sexuals are as much at risk of the homosexual that wasn't true we needed to devote resources to a homosexual community and we did need to get the heterosexual Community interested we had a problem and we needed to think about you know very thoughtfully we've been an epidemic that's killing people sexual very much at risk is the homosexual that wasn't true we needed to devote resources to a homosexual community and we did need to get the heterosexual Community interested we had a problem and we needed to think about you know very thoughtfully we've got an epidemic that's killing people</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I get really nuts yes it's time to leave time to leave what this planet oh boy listen we can leave this plan I got something right here take you to another planet right now he's joking federal agent let me let me give you my argument we started a clock around 1953 which is when we had the explosion bikini and that the first Hydrogen Bomb and when we figured out the double helix and I call this the twin nuclei problem it began in 1953 1953 we started a clock was also the height of the McCarthy era we do not have the wisdom to be able to fuse nucleya weed the wisdom to be able to investigate the cell it's too much power the are wisdom avencri slightly maybe didn't I don't know but our power is now God life so our biological intelligence what our minds are capable of has not it's been surpassed by our intellectual achievements in terms of our technological innovation these things Wale complicated succumb to our intellect right there much simpler than we ever imagined to be able to create something that normally happens in the sun on an island in the Pacific or to be able to rewrite a cell the way Craig Venter did you know synthetic biology we are now Gods but for the wisdom there's a great quote we are now Gods but for the wisdom should be the mean picking you guys are you we are now God before the Latin and the world's most serious human being should be working on the twin nuclei problem what do we do with new Godlike powers given our history of conflict our history of Envy or hist sea of Madness right because we succumb regularly we are you know I was born twenty years after the end of World War I don't know what really happened are I mean we're nuts we're absolutely not capable of this level of responsibility and so the question that we have is do we believe that we have a long-term solution in terms of increasing our wisdom we should definitely try everybody believes that should work on that problem but if you don't think that we have the wisdom to live like this week we don't know how much time we have left it's probably not hundred things probably maybe a few hundred years tops because sooner or later you're going to have Putin like Trump like people I mean I'm sorry I would have a very deep antipathy towards Donald Trump he's not temperamentally fit to have the secrets of theoretical physics at his fingertips you just isn't and it's imperative to me that he not be elected in 2020 in the Democratic party wake up and get rid of it's crazy friend so that we can buy some time and it's nice if Elon things we can go to Mars maybe that will allow a small number of us to diversify in case we do something really dumb to the planet but if human beings are to continue and we are to continue evolving we need to spread out there are three rocks that are inhabitable is the Earth is the Moon in the moon has nothing in their Mars is pretty uninteresting to being blunt I know that it's beautiful that we send back these pictures we've got this one gorgeous planet that we are clearly not smart enough to Stewart we're still having idiotic climate change debate me even if even if climate science is somewhat junk ified we should still be taking climate super seriously because we don't know what we're doing it's such a complicated nonlinear system and we're not even capable of focusing you know two seconds later I'll be watching the Kardashians so what is the answer well in my opinion we got to increase the number of possible places we can go beyond 3 to say nothing of space station cuz that's not realistic but none of these things makes sense so the first place that you have to get to his we're really deeply screwed and not because of apocalyptic cult like reasons just because of science just because of 1953 so the only opportunity break the einsteinian speed limit so far as I know or we can upload into silicon or we can reboot from tardigrade like none of these answers are good so what I've been toying with since I was 19 was what is the theory behind Einstein and that's the thing I've been most uncomfortable talking about although I've been talking about it more I gave these lectures and 2013 and in May of 2013 in Oxford and I was appalled by the way in which the world's physics Community responded very scared I'm not a physicist I don't claim to be but I I felt like I tried to present what I hoped was a path forward given that the field was completely stalled out and this is it physics and biology let us into the valley of death and it time to try to get out and read no please so what is my responsibility in terms of the portal what I'm going to try to do with this podcast is gaining the courage to share whatever ideas I've had about breaking the speed limit in the form of I don't think I have the wisdom to figure out what it means but at least I have a hope of trying to write the fundamental rule to figure out our source code and that was that what that was the plan which is what is this place what is the source code for reality know what was the response to the physics is it would to the from the physicist that you found pulling well there were two articles that appeared in the Guardian newspaper website that talked breathlessly about what I had done or what I might have done to call attention to the lectures that I was giving so these were the special Simoni lectures by Richard Dawkins successor Marcus du sautoy who is a colleague of mine from way back who found me in New York City and thinking 2011-2012 something like that working on the theory that called geometric unity and I was very uncomfortable I hadn't really told anybody that I was working on this theory for all these years because it's a crazy you know the certain stories that you find in theoretical physics which is kind of the precursor to Madness where you know somebody thinks that they've solved some big problem and they're working in secret they are the sort of what happened with Andrew Wiles and 4 plus during which is a really interesting story because his first proof of Fermat's Last Theorem what I think was unfixable so he announced the proof that he had solved like this most famous problem mathematic he didn't have a proof and then bizarrely was under such pressure that he found another proof and actually pulled it off so it's like you know it had talked to him for the crazy story but he was working in secret for seven years and nobody knew what he was doing so sometimes these stories work out he was a professor at Prince and very highly-regarded need sort of husband and seven years worth of work to pretend that he was releasing papers when he was actually secretly doing this thing that would have made him a madman and Sunset and so this is what I was trying to do it I was not able to work on these issues in the string theory Community because of string theory Community was possessed of disbelief that they had found the answer back in the 80s in 1984 they had what they thought was a revolution the math Community doesn't think in these terms is like both of these are very conservative communities historically and very focused on following the leadership of the top people at the most of the Revolution and so I started working on a different idea to unify the two branches of physics that appear to be incompatible that was different than the string theory idea and different than the loop quantum gravity idea and try to figure out a more advanced enough space travel it wasn't space travel it was we need the source code like it's it might be safer to go further once you've unlocked once you unblock nuclear fusion you're pretty much just as screwed as you need to be so then the issue is okay we know that would pretty I'm pretty sure that Einstein's theory is not final because you get these singularities which I don't ultimate equations so the black hole Singularity call the schwarzschild set Singularity where the initial Singularity that we associate with the big bang in like the Freeman Robertson Walker space X are signs to me that these equations are incomplete with the big problem with Einstein is that Einstein's work was so fundamental that it's like you can't get in under the ground floor of Einstein You Begin a physics seminar and you're all immediately in his world is a let X Be A Spacetime manifold boom you're already in relativity so it's almost impossible to figure out a way to get in at a deeper level of physics than Einstein's theory we know that we have to recover Einstein's theory because that's been proven to work in all sorts of situation than the same thing with Quantum field Theory which is why I talked about you know the anomalous Magnetic Moment of the electron so my ID was that only since the 1970s have we known the particle theory was based on Geometry we knew that Einstein's theory I thought use geometry to develop his theory with language relativity called Romani in Geometry but many years later we found out the boers sort of quantum and planks quantumin and Einstein pain as well was based on a different geometry of the sky Charles Aris month was in Alsatian geometer work with car and that geometry was figured out at Stony Brook in New York by Jim Simons who became the world's greatest hit fund manager and see and yang who's arguably number one or number two greatest living theoretical physicists he's on his 90 and they figured out that the secret language of particle theory was also geometry but a different geometry and some geometric communities simply the idea that it's not a fight be Einstein and Bohr it's the two parents Ramon on Whose work Einstein bass relativity and Charles are someone with this gauge theoretic stuff that we did in the time before this which in fact empowers particle theory and so when do those two geometries unify two different geometric theories and found it in general they don't UniFi in a way that you want you don't have the ability to do Einsteinium tensor analysis where you compress something called the Ramon curvature tensor and the gauge stuff where you do this gauge symmetry that we were talking about because gauge symmetry ruin the ability to compress the Einstein tensor never mind what that means but in one or two rare circumstances you can actually combine the two geometries and that's where I think we are so harshly with the park purpose of the portal podcast is is to use you know I'll just tear the mask off a little bit we've been talkin about lots of interesting things about social justice about mathematics about wonder about psychedelics and trying to be decent human beings to each other and to set an example and I think it's been partially successful partially a failure but what I'm trying to do is to gain courage to talk about what these ideas are in the worst comes to worst isn't that I wasted a lot of my life on a crazy theory that turned out not to be true what was the response though and what was so the Articles engendered a an immune reaction what is giving a lecture now how many times have we heard before the next Einstein yada yada yada yada and I totally understand that that's a reasonable reaction like Sean Carroll had this reaction he referred to me as a backyard Einstein and his wife and him twice today yeah he's on my mind and his wife has amazing article and Scientific American called Your Guardian you've been played that she's not a physicist but she has access to Sean's brain and then there was this whole thing with a new scientist said okay this guy claimed to give this lecture in the physics department but he hasn't written the paper and he didn't tell the physicists it was a sneak attack while course that wasn't true they're there was announcement of the talk I stayed in England and I give it talk once more and then a final time a week later by that point all sorts of people from Cambridge and Oxford came this was a worldwide topic of discussion what the hell's going on and I gave it to our talk consider that nobody but for the outside of theoretical physics gives talks on physics visitors visitors from mathematics but in general mathematicians don't take an interest in the real physical world and to be blunt about it I don't think that the string theorists are very focused on the real physical world either they've been playing with toy models for nearly 40 years so a lot of it was playing out in the press in the New Scientist had to retract said know what we wrote wasn't true they did publicize to talk and then there was that an article I sent a reporter to the final talk that I gave And the reporter did not know any physics so I spent the morning with this person teaching him what the Dirac equation was like a very fundamental thing and question came up talk about is your is your model anomaly free and my model is has a property called non chirality chirality which is the difference between left right asymmetric models are called chiral and left right symmetric models are called Nan KIRO so my model is Nan KIRO but the chiral nature of the universe is supposed to emerge from it and I was asked questions that didn't seem to make sense which is have a chiral anomaly in an Ankara model and the person that reporter picked up on this and didn't really get it so there was like a flurry of activity with a big WTF and if you if you ask me by the time I gave the second lecture people weren't laughing it was a serious lecture people heard it was an it was in the he wasn't like somebody come up with their own language and their own you know written in crayon and summer end horrible thing it was written in the normal I would but I hadn't written the paper and papers are very much the stock-in-trade of that community so I would say that the community settle on a rubric which is paper or it didn't happen in other words put-up-or-shut-up give us a paper written something but because my trajectory through this through math and physics was very unusual I have a very low. of the academic Community I support them as you can tell you know I'm extolling the virtues of science but I was subjected to a situation in graduate school where I had I'm probably the only person you've ever met with a PhD who is not allowed to attend his own thesis defense I don't know what was your thesis was on self dual equations not being as picture the dimension for as was client but I had a situation in which the thesis when I when I had entered grad school was something that you would present to the world and by the time I was trying to leave it was a closed-door affair where the department would appoint the person for you and I was in the unusual position of not having a thesis advisor so there's some very fraught Story one thing of wine The Graduate School for some supplies people becomes an extremely fraught experience where the power of a department not to Grant you a degree or not to help you get a job or to expel you becomes very contentious right and that was the situation so I got into a very contentious situation there was no explanation of why was so contentious we can talk about it on another another podcast but I was in a very low trust situation with with Harvard and with the standard community and so when work that I had done that was rejected for my thesis was discovered by others in 1994 in revolutionized topological gauge Theory I became very sort of sullen and angry and withdrawn because my department knew that I had put forward the same equation revolutionary in mathematical gauge their injury visited with them there was a seminar where a guy named David Koch Don admire the person who had been my advisor I want to name names head giving a seminar saying all of gauge theory has been revolutionized old Gates there is dead then there's a new gauge Theory and David caused on what we'll name said I was in the back center row I think I was picking my nose actually and he said didn't have a student who told us to look at these equations and suddenly the whole room turned around and looked at me I think this is in room 507 of the Harvard Science Center and it's just like you know try to imagine you're you're an anonymous person in a lecture and suddenly everyone is stay can your fingers in your nose and that was the moment and I and I think I mumbled something just to get out of it but I was angry I was angry that they'd taken away my agency I would know better better not to give me a PhD better just to say look we're going to go short you screw off you don't get a PhD and then if I end up doing something screw you you know that would have been a better now so instead got a PhD through a very tortuous situation and I came to give up on academics I don't think they're Fair system I don't think that it's open-minded I don't think that they'd welcome all sorts of different belief structures which are capable of producing Innovations so you know where my money I've been very vocal about this Everton articles and edged out of work and I've said theoretical physics is stalled and you've been you're going to ship string string theory and since 1984 where is it and is always you know in years away now what was the premise of Shawn Carol's wife's article that they got played well Jamie can you bring it up I broken the rule the rule you're supposed to submit a paper the paper supposed to be reviewed Bus Repair in the journal you're not supposed to be doing this for mathematics you don't have training as a physicist this is a hoax but it's not goes I don't know let me see if it is a hoax it's on me clearly not a hoax you're not hoaxing anyone not trying to and every week somebody writes you and says I figured I'd put pepper perpetual motion I have a laser transport device right and so everybody is concerned and frightened that they're their time is going to be wasted by lunatics now I both fit the lunatic profile and don't fit The Limited profile on the lunatic side I'm outside of the system I haven't kept up I'm not particularly mathematically minded I mean the fact that most of the B math student for my school so it's kind of a I'm the only person I know with my profile with a PhD in math and on and on lunatic side I mean look you've been listening to my crazy ideas for a while and they're all over the world I have lots of heterodox ideas I don't think that aren't that they're taken is being insane and I don't think this is insane has been looked at by enough people to say we until you actually write it down very cleanly and clearly we can't fully evaluate but it's a it's a gamble in the worst thing that can happen is that I have something that looks like a final theory that turns out not to be are you going to write it out already mostly written that I'm in a different phase I felt that I got rolled in an alley so here's here's the big here's the big reveal a lot harder to roll me self I can screw this thing up just fine by myself but the opportunity to take me to a quiet corner and make something disappear to hand the credit to somebody else has to be a lot harder to do was not going to happen to find it dear Guardian you've been played I love when they use like contemporary slang I don't I don't care I think I mean what level is only like the future of never appealed in privately asking me about the recent Guardian article and accompany op-ed by Oxford mathematician Marcus du sautoy how do you say it so tamarcus DeSoto DeSoto I gushing over supposed supposedly revolutionary new unified theory of physics by a man who officially left Academia 20 years ago or as I've taken to calling it The Eric Weinstein amazing new Theory that solves everything puzzling conundrum in theoretical physics only he hasn't written an actual pit all these are capital letters that's why I'm saying it this way and actual paper yet so physicist can't check all those hard mathematical details but trust us it's going to be awesome I let super bitching at him. First a couple of caveats I've met ones dying he's a nice guy he's wicked smart there's a stupid article you know better it's just the way it's written it's just it's yummy she comes from I think she's approached Protege of Casey Cole the great physics writer from who's not a physicist in her defense do you feel that she felt this honestly and that this was problematic and in her eyes that you were entering into this field that you had not read the paper and you had left Academia 20 years ago and then she was like little league is all nonsense okay I'm going to put a stop this nonsense and I'm going to do it with free language in Den in slang I don't like the bitchiness but it's I understand the motivation I think the bitchiness has to make the article more entertaining and more style as a writer actually met her as she says and I had a very high impression of her she didn't have the easiest time I think you didn't get tenure at Caltech he's kind of a stickler for realities on the one hand talking total nonsense about boltzmann brains and thought experiments which is what I associate with desperation physics on the other hand he's kind of this rigorous rationalist thinker whose in the united prominent atheist so he's a complicated guy is a great explainer he's got his own sort of economic incentives that he's one of the very few people the store eVoice physics to the world and they operate in some sense as a couple and there's a richness to this like you know Mike my point isn't to run them down or boost them up it's just people are playing at their roles and never anyone has a sentence that consists of one word and that one is a ham she's trying to throw me a bone he's wicked smart he's a nice guy but he's delusional delusional and to the extent that I've been delusional before I'm about the only person in the US who is against high-skilled immigration because people think why should we keep out the best in the brightest that's complicated story before the financial crisis I was saying mortgage-backed Securities May blow up the world are you kidding it's the great moderation volatility they know that I can get way out where am I supposed to be an agate way out there yeah okay I think you are months is totally wrong just going to Mars Mars is not going to save us and maybe going to the stars as me the same as maybe Dia I will follow us there yada yada yada but I'm not going to take this lying down where the desperate situation and if you're not trying to hear that the clear thing we know what nuclear weapons look like in the fusion air if we are to get off this planet before people are unleashing Gene drives and you know weaponized Anthrax who knows what the hell people going to get up to as the power of biology and the power of physics keeps going the power of information at least I'm trying I think I'm doing a damn sight better than trying but I fail completely how crazy is it that we're not trying to take Armour answer new sea of troubles it's time to rush the cockpit we got to get Trump out of office we've got to restore sanity doorsense making we need newspapers we need fact-checkers what is particularly problematic about Trump being an office that man has nuclear capabilities and I have zero confidence in the decision-making imagined risk good friend Peter teal was a supporter of trump in the last election I'm taking a huge risk and how much I love this guy Peter t on how much he loves me because I'm putting the employer-employee relationship at risk people say okay you're just a Peter teal to a wall up nobody's going to take that kind of risk unless they have real faith in their friend I work for a friend I mean a real friend person who doesn't cut and run when trouble starts and totally disagree with Peter I have come to understand the Trump I thought people would understand the Trump danger and the Democratic party would re-evaluate their situation but they didn't a triple and quadruple down and that is alarming and so that's something I very much got wrong about Trump is it even Trump wasn't enough of a message to let people know but the trunk cannot have the nuclear codes because he's not a skilled or regular enough he's going to accomplish a lot one of the things I said before the election is he might be the best and worst presents he might get us a nuke North Korea deal because they're going to look at him and say this guy's nuts who knows what it would do but we we the technical community created this problem and we're abdicating our responsibility by worrying about our egos by worrying about a reputations I am advocating I should have turn the stereo over to the theoretical physics community how do you know if they screwed me over I'm too Petty and egotistical to want to give up on it I watch them take credit for things that weren't you know sign Kratts I don't like the way they work the theoretical physics is our most important community in the world and is also a very unpleasant and we need to find them and we need to let them play the dangerous boys for the most part their appointment but in general are very unpleasant man they've been somewhat cowed they're not the same Cowboys that used to be because I've been failing for 40 years I should be sharing stuff I should be writing things down I have not had the courage to do it and if I really have the courage of my convictions I should share this and see what happens but one thing is I don't know if it could be weaponized assume it's right you don't have it this decision tree so what's wrong I got egg on my face. Okay I'll be okay I worry much more about if it's right the two things that I worry much more about if it's right the two things that can go wrong if it's right is one that could be weaponized before it becomes useful into is that there's no solution in it maybe we actually are stuck in this place we never get to go to the Stars we can look at exoplanets and dream but we're stuck here</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I just recently went home to the Bahamas and I'm starting to miss it more and more and more because as I get older I remember long for the things that I did as a little kid I love you in the places I went. I was at a little kid and so my family from this little place called Pharmacy Exuma that's three-quarters of a mile by 7/8 I think I told you that before and it's tiny and I was there this time and just seeing Justice waking up every morning and I just looking out the window and just blue ocean all day I just I want to go back there the people that people the people that live there like you get a boat at like 14 15 years old cuz she's really nothing that you can do on the island other than interact with the family and fish right everything everything everything that you need stabilized you have to go somewhere else and get her has to be brought in so like I have a cousin who is like he's older than me he's like my grandmother generation but he's my cousin has like four years older than me but like this guy he free dies and he will go down and hang out on the water for like 2 or 3 minutes like with this with a spear he doesn't he doesn't like the Scooby doesn't like to take off take a tank with him one time we're we're we're fishing on the back of boat he's off the front and he's like he and then on top of that he's in he's in the water and he really comes out or what he reaches out because Julian bring the boat over here so shocked so get closer but I'm still fishing like that's that's the life you just wants me to get out of shirt goes sideways yeah I'm assuming but I'm like would you think that would be safer to be in the water or on top of the water if there's a shark VR goggles you can see the motherfuker when you want to be in the water and then on top and not knowing where he's coming from I would think so I would think so but then you like not only is it 360 but it's like Universal the view is universal right right but if you don't and you can see at least is like you got your back to the wall can't come from the top that's true so that's true but I don't know you're in the water with an animal whose whose that's his natural habitat like you can't you can't even turn around nearly as fast as he can probably swim around you and come up from the back before you can turn around probably I am so a girlfriend I were there and I was feeding the turtles right so I try to grab a turtle and a little either turtle is this big is no bigger than this and I'm about to pick it up I'm trying to pick it up being like explain if you would probably like trying to pick it up before I can get out of water those are pigs thins arms they have he just he pulls me down into the water like this this little thing probably weighs 4050 lb so powerful in the water like if I would have hang on to that Turtle I would be moving fast and I would move with fins on my house that I want to talk about my weight but I'm a lot bigger than that how much does he live there someday I like ultimately I definitely want to live back there I mean I want to buy want to die there and I mean I don't want to die anytime soon but when you do you want to live the end of your life there and relax life Island life ultimately I'm definitely live back there I mean I want to buy want to die there I know I mean I don't want to die anytime soon but when you do you want to live the end of your life there and relax life Island life</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> but they went to decision I honestly I wouldn't mind Tyson getting into his camp and just even just kind of mentoring him a bit like Mike Tyson I feel like somebody like that would really help a guy like you I mean it's not like he needs a lot of help but like somebody like Mike Tyson being being being around just having him to like call on talk to you sometimes Tyson doesn't really want to do it and maybe maybe not even in the gym maybe just somebody to talk to you once in awhile and surely some strategy maybe even about strategy sometimes you know cuz I feel I don't know that I could get exactly what it was but there was a moment when I was watching Deontay Wilder and there's something I think when Mike was in here something he was talking about that all I was just like had those two should get connected I was I was a long time ago who am I might was my buddy somebody limiting and I was like I'm sleeping in bed and my wife I'm sleeping because I didn't next morning I listen to my voicemail and he's like if you get this call me back Mike Tyson in the club or something I was like Mike Tyson Knows My Name dude I met him at the at the UFC you would go to put you pay to see his fights just to watch him f*** somebody up it wasn't a fight it was an execution you would watch him execute guys he was the man he wasn't mad changed heavyweight boxing people don't realize that heavy weight boxing in the early 80s was dead nobody cared because Larry Holmes after he beat Muhammad Ali everybody was sad it was like a sad thing like those The Changing of the Guard Larry Holmes beat the s*** out of Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes never got his do he never got his due he was so good man Larry was so good he had one of the best jobs of all time he was so good but people are still upset at him because he f***** up Muhammad Ali he came he was the champ after the greatest you know any Muhammad Ali wasn't just a greatest in terms of like the greatest fighter he was like yeah everybody f****** hated the Vietnam War especially people who went to Vietnam had the Vietnam War and they they they got it man and you just cement a lot he meant a lot so when Larry home came around so I can Larry just never got to do got to do that era of boxing I remember going back watching tape and doing that that's one thing I appreciate about Tyson you have that crazy library that he could get all that Jacobs was the guy who curated like he has every old-time fight of all them he would watch Sugar Ray Robinson a Jack Dempsey and he's watching was there a different Sandy Saddler and you know all those guys who watch all those guys yeah that era boxing before him was Terrible's like a chance like pinklon Thomas and Tony Tubbs no one cared about the heavyweight Division and then he came along just started blasting people and then I remember I was I was like seven or eight years old I met Trevor berbick in town the Bahamas 92 heavyweight champion of the thing talking to about like what was that like and it's just there's no way he can manage and no one can manage that you going to go crazy I feel like his career and his life would have been very different if custom died when he did things go to story but it's also like there's so many lessons in that story so far all of us it's like there's a lot to learn you know what happened when he got all the way to Buster Douglas when I was like you thought fella lose and he was in this rare State yeah yeah they like his life like he's he's had so many ups and downs and somebody that's the heavyweight champion will somebody with so many eyes on them you know the Robin Givens all that hope you know I remember they were I forget who is Oprah when they were being interviewed and I met while they were on the show and he just he just kind of look like I feel like Mike Tyson on and that interview was like those tigers are people walk with that they drug yes you know what I mean yeah perfect perfect way to describe it man they're probably medicated him yeah cuz he did he didn't seem like the Mike Tyson who I was a fan of right like I didn't dislike him and I'm on I just like what's wrong with that mean why what who the f*** it had to be her idea same thing Barbra Streisand Bob Walthers to me that life is unmanageable the life that he lived back then was unmanageable he was the f****** king of the world he was in his twenties he was Buckwild just going crazy at Flatline and people everywhere he went he will throw rose petals at his feet and screaming cheering fans so manageable with no love in your life. 1113 tell you 13 and then you coming to all this money because you're the best fighter in the world like there's what could he possibly be afraid of them to nothing he said that he doesn't train because he doesn't want his want to fire his ego up he knows I don't like that part of me I don't want that part of me to come out again and I don't want it wasn't a video of him like I understand he was in training what was in the video of I think last year just before he came in here and spoke to you when he's hitting the heavy bag I think it was a little bit longer than that but yeah I'm doing it for something he still can crack mad are there their they're doing something and he just shows them a combination just punches in the air no warm-up lightning-fast jab hook uppercut right hands are still there and 50 years old still f*** you up and that was that was like he was a heavyweight champion of my child Larry Holmes made me think like damn what would have been like if Larry was in his f****** Prime cuz when they fought like I was like 36 or something like that somewhere around there is already kind of over for him and Mike was Mike mean Mike was black shoes no socks there is right here I have my most deadly you saw it was such an interesting guy to because he was only like 5 he's probably 5 a.m. and 5:11 I think it's like 5 10 and 1/2 something like that but to be a heavyweight and just Show Low and bobbing and weaving and moving in it and everybody's like Jesus right up the middle Francis Francis Francis it's harder harder I think so I think I think Mike Tyson it was a way better boxer yeah but I think if Mike Tyson could hit like Francis does just Francis just has to clip you be just like you just grazed them obviously there different gloves obviously a bigger man Junior you just grazed them obviously there different gloves obviously I just think Francis is a way bigger man you know my cat is Primus like 2092 around then I remember him</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm not going to lie man I would tell you of all the people I've trained with I think overall when you put the entirety of the Mixed Martial Arts thing is together Mazatlan might be the best real like he like his boxing is some of the best in the sport of mixed martial arts he is not a kickboxer but he's confident and comfortable with all the kicks wrestling his wrestling is Way Beyond a guy who never wrestled like you know he's he's like division one level and then did you just do people sleep on his Jiu-Jitsu mat Mazda tall is legit on the ground the first day I went into American talk and we'd fought each other before and I figured last guys horrible on the ground we just go but like I was like I was surprised and this was like 12 years ago 10 years ago but Maserati for the wrestling is he is asking to be able to you know Mall him like he's done to everybody else has got to close that distance has a giant Advantage giant great way of getting ahold of people even Robbie you have to Robbie was blasting his brains into another dimension he still got up and was grabbing Robbie it's like he has a disability crab people and hold on a people like if she watches the Douglas Lima fight or the chorus called fight in Bellator electees christ-like he he ragdolls people with weird that he's hard to get away from very hard I remember when I first met Ben he I watched he went to the store in Houston do tournaments and in college just to get more pins that you have like the pin record so he got the pin record for for Missouri for the University of Missouri but I hear also with other high-level wrestlers he would just like let people take him down gently and let people in on his legs so he can get into the scramble so that funk stuff that he does what makes it even more impressive with Jordan Burroughs to do when Jordan Burroughs and him at the wrestling match like there's levels and he said it afterwards you put on his Grandpa's levels to this and there is cuz he ran him over right through in power doubles and just when you think about that a guy who's at the elite of the elite in wrestling is so much better than the elite of the elite of in wrestling and MMA so much better but would he have still been able to do that the same way if Ben was only wrestling under the grocery it's hard to say because it's hard to say he's just all about closing that distance with This ferocious tattoo crosses that discipline is not even their teleports I was hoping he was still in school so one of my buddies linode and he was reaching out the side back tire is reaching out. So it's a division 1 wrestlers for me to help me with my resume after the Joe Stevenson fight cuz I was like I can't wrestle and Jordan Burroughs is one of the guys I'm going to wrestle he had no interest I don't know where that's Dad's now because the sport is bigger there's more money in it but still having so much success wrestling right and who knows how much time if any he's put into striking yeah but like that IQ of his as far as wrestling that athleticism you know he's a hard worker oh yeah it will apply if he dedicates himself to a but if he hasn't at all he's so far behind the eight-ball like if he jumps in now with that athleticism you know he's a hard worker it will apply if he dedicates himself to a but if he hasn't at all he's so far behind the eight-ball like if he jumps in now with zero striking you know how long would it take before you get to a comfortable level of striking where he can hang in there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> great thing about ESPN including with the UFC is that so many sports fans just have ESPN on automatic like I was at a pool hall on Saturday night I did a show in Baltimore and then we went to a pool hall we got there right when Junior was entering into the Octagon was perfect perfect timing and I was like don't blank is this f****** probably going to make it out of first round Francis wants another shot at the title and you know it's it's I mean I don't know why they wouldn't give him another shot stuff in my my opinion is like what you got now is Steve Bay versus DC that that irons out who's the champ right and thank God they made that fight instead of the Brock Lesnar fight I mean I think the Brock Lesnar fight would have been fun and I want I love DC I wanted to get paid I think he sends Brock Lesnar into another dimension that's what I think happened in that fight and I think he gets a big payday and that's all great but the reality is the real fights T pasty pays the most successful UFC heavyweight champion of all time the only got two ever defend the title four times and the only guy who survived the f****** hurricane that is Francis ngannou the only roll with the punches kick the legs jab move usually wrestling wrestling stop and he's got you know that that was interesting to I was thinking the fight with desty pay with the Francis how much did that take out-of-state back cuz even though he won that fight when DC knock them out with one punch like wow that's crazy you don't see Steve Bay getting knocked out like that I wonder he was still suffering from the ngannou fight which is only like a few months before that I don't know if he was still suffering from that versus perfect punch to that's that's the thing NDC talked about it he talked about we saw this being an option in this fight this being an opportunity to get this to the land this shot this and now I'm he did it you know that that's the thing if Francis anybody probably anybody with any power of course France's land that shots night. Lights out also but he didn't see if he didn't he didn't have the skill-set to provide that opportunity I think I think that's you know he he gets rid of the arm on the left side then boom the right hand comes over you got I got that kind of thing that makes me appreciate like fight IQ of a guy like Cormier I mean because again and got a bigger puncher like but like he just doesn't have the skill-set the DC has and seeing that like you remember him talking about that in the post fight like that was something I saw at 2 to know that that's there and find that opportunity to make that opportunity you know that some that's high-level stuff man the Halloween stuff that's what the best guys do I heard the DC looks fantastic in Camp already look so good but I'm really interesting to see what I'm motivated hungry you know out for Revenge Deepak and do and liking to him he knows to take that away like Steve Hayes also like you said he's the most decorated heavyweight champion he's the most successful that success didn't come from like not only his skill-set but also his mentality who do we have to go back into the gym break that down take that out of his game and I'll make that not a not a thing and also now he knows that it's the titles everything you lose the title people don't even talk about you stop talking about him you know I felt obliged I felt like I had an obligation talking about I call you not talking about the most successful heavyweight champion of all time yeah the guy who I understand him having to have one fight before getting rematch or he could he could have legitimately just got the rematch because of his resume as you know I don't know I I I don't like that part of fighting where you only as good as your last fight I get the business aspect of it I get that but I feel like what a fighter like that you got to give him a rematch have to</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> diesel thick yeah he's broad man I remember when Dustin was making 145 crazy now but look man the difference between him at 45 and 55 is pretty significant so with dusted like and then let you know we talked about Max's like now he now he's the greatest now he's the greatest at 1:45 he may he may be the goat he may be greater than Jose Aldo like that's an argument that people can make right beat him twice right all those beat him later in his career at right shows he's not 50 years old he was in the early 30 yeah everybody else the way Max beat those guys beat say twice and then Dustin's having these tough fights he's he's he's fighting the same guys he's fighting gate she's fighting Eddie he's winning them as convincingly winning them but when he fights Max like Max the fight is Dustin spite of the same fight that he had with gauges the same as far as competitiveness still in there but Dustin twinsies but like I just like this is where my buys kicks and I'm like if that man some credit man like everybody loves people love Dustin appreciate the way you fight so appreciate his style but I'm like man he's he's taken out like Champions taking out Champions Gate she was a champion of the world series but he's a champion Teddy Champion you know Max champion create you know that's that's that's why that's why is nicknamed The Diamond you know what do you think happens when he fights could be yeah it's this is the one that's the fight like that's it mean to be with the guy could be was definitely a guy and talking to him about it so I start a new podcast I just just releasing today thought on Auto on my YouTube we just hanging out everybody's going absolutely understand cuz I want Dustin to win this fight the every round starts on the feet Dustin's got to make smart moves every single time because when khabib takes him down it's it's almost virtually impossible to get back to your feet right and that's where I could be was going to want this fight that happened I'm Dustin is going to have his opportunities but like is he going to be able to stop that wrestling consistently enough to make this fight happen where it's best for him and that's the heart is he's got a good training camp he's got a really good people there with him and got Mike Brown there you know who I want to get with him Gregor Gillespie I want Gregor Gillespie till 2 to get with Dustin and just get on top and for the next two months just filled out high-level wrestling yeah smashing pressure just that pressure pressure pressure and get comfortable working out of it working on their protecting yourself doing that would you be interested in for me he might fight him down the road though it's possible Right Mariners Robbie train together a long time ago yeah I mean that's how you get better yeah it's it's it's one of those things rest like you got to sometimes you got to trade with a potential rival or you know not an enemy but but like iron sharpens iron and sometimes you got it you have to go with somebody that's a possible matchup in the future if you're going to fight a guy who has that same style and you nailed it to cuz Gregor Gillespie is probably when you get past khabib the scariest wrestler in the division yeah I mean he's a guy that gets on top of people just smashes and he's Relentless with his with his resting also he's a guy who's not going to get tired he's going to put that pressure on he's going to come forward and once he gets ahold of you if you don't use perfect technique to escape and get that distance back he's just going to chain wrestling chain wrestled there's no there's no stopping until you're down until he scores is to the takedown still happening he's got some f****** Relentless strength and conditioning sessions so that he puts on his Instagram you watching you go all this is why this guy doesn't retired f*** that guy doesn't get tired cuz he's he's obsessed he he wants he wants half an hour we can do that crazy well that's crazy high-level marathon pace right people do know some of the things about about these guys like like there was a point where training with these guys I was just like</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I mean if you're an elk you don't want to get caught in a valley with some wolves that that s***'s rough that's a rough way to go I was talking to you buddy Jeff earlier about that like you got a choice that you can type of that if you're going to get mauled by a bear or a gorilla or die by wolf or tiger what do you choose but like the premise of the question is going to die because it's heart is going to get your neck and kill you quick that's that's my choice bike no in India it's horrific full clip chase them out of the Jungle and just bails off at the last second that's can't cash it should anorexic like what do you do right when you do when you can do you're so weak not much you can do but then when you think about that like you think about Africa you think about anything about these places where a lion and tigers exist and people have existed since the beginning of time at some point someone had to win that right just numbers see her gym guys are all the reason why does a significant is because in India tigers eat people all the f****** time they eat them all the time like there's tigers at Target human beings there's a place in India called the sunderbans and the sunderbans is its near this river that they did they think that one of the reasons why the tigers are so irritable sat there drinking this river water the river water has a high degree of salt in it high-level salt into the irritated all the time and over the last 200 years tigers have killed more than 300,000 human beings in this one part of India why do you still live there like I've given the more I'm giving them I'm giving that place too you know what a bike seat is like right now and be on a bike seat with like what I'm shiting myself if you have any s*** anybody's going to come out like there's no way you win that no no way you win. I can understand India India I think it's the worst place in the world for tiger and human interactions I don't get that like are the Tigers in India bigger or is it usually with mammals what happens is like this name species when they're in a hotter climate tend to be smaller depends on the animal obviously then they are in the the colder climates it's something it has something to do with preserving body temperature like dear friend since I give you get a whitetail deer from Texas it's much smaller than a whitetail deer from Saskatchewan yeah the same species yea yea though the people to right there a certain place you would people that just called you or more to shoot to kill Target on it people just f****** week it is so soft what if you got the wrong tiger f*** him f*** them all killed whatever anyone that you get a chance to kill that's close enough to kill you tell him that I think I I I can't I can't get that that video of the tiger chasing that bag out of my head fashion going to be like get up and try and get back on the bike it's nothing you can do to stuffing you do is no way you get the bike going in time the tiger be on you so fast me they can run the 40 miles an hour is 400 lb 500 lb of something animal is 400 something pounds and runs at twice the speed of Usain Bolt how is that fair that's why there's not a million deer you know the reason why there's a million deer in that same spot because of those tires that they need them you know I was in Lanai which is the smaller islands in Hawaii hunting Axis deer and axis deer were given to King Kamehameha of Hawaii like in the 80s and when we were over there you know you bow hunt these things and I'm telling you you've never seen a deer move the reason why they're so fast as they evolved to get away from Tigers so when they see you there but they make this noise like that and then they f****** scatter there so fast when you say that like my brain just start doing the math and I'm like of course the ones that got caught by the Tigers of the slower ones I Can Only Imagine so like the fastest ones amazing like yeah I can only imagine it's it's kind of like an Olympic sprinter female Olympic sprinter married and have a kid</div>

It's about a respect that's not it that's not derogatory but didn't know like if you see a girl kick a bag like there's a giant difference between 140 lb girl kicking a bag of 245 got big difference and now is it mostly technique or is it I think it's biomechanics technique I think it's just muscle they just built different this is different muscles like the hips are like this right especially 4 minutes wide hips and kind of go in a little bit or is it got what if that's responsible for the will they call that the mail spread when Dude sit on a sit on a subway make spread the land they may want to sit next to you play doubt you being rude but if a dude has no one next to him that's how they said I don't think women sit like that I don't think I'll take it goes that way I don't like sitting like that that's like that's like sitting and most of my life and I like that's uncomfortable like when you have to sit like that for an extended amount of time gets really uncomfortable do you just feel uncomfortable inside to pass you got them we had to move stuff around you can't even open your legs to do that but with women I think that's a normal way to sit I think their body naturally with their hips in a shape that there are the legs kind of go towards each other they kind of Point towards the knees it's more normal for them to sit with their legs together I think sometimes it makes sense I just I wonder if it has to do with anything that they equipment down there not wanting to be a hoe right I want to feel like this is your legs spread of a dude's is like that that's a confident man but if a girl sitting there with her legs feel like look at this pitch scientific article explaining manspreading and making a p**** angle the femoral neck is more acute these factors could play a role in making a position of sitting with the knees close together less comfortable for men exactly so all you manspreading people that are shaming men for sitting in a natural way how dare you</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> this is a reminder I want to give props to American Airlines for returning my luggage after the whole weekend and they miss that f****** half ounce of weed in my boxing glove 56th at the targets that they can I take the class with everybody else I can do everything else I die go to one boxing cuz Tuesday and Wednesdays Tuesdays and Thursdays boxing spar you know she's she's a tough chick in the whole thing if I go down and just let her beat me up to let me ask you this is someone who is born in another country how do you think that they should handle the immigrations that are here this is a big question a lot of people know people that are I mean probably a lot of people listening know someone who they love that's illegal what are there legal from Canada are there legal from Europe to get over here and stay over here supposed to be some of them turn out to be amazing people so how do you decide how do you decide who gets to stay and do someone come over here trying to make their life better a better thing but just doing it illegally does that automatically just count them from staying here that seems crazy what is a great there's a lot of people come over here because they were super unfortunate and where they were born they do they grew up in a shity place and they wanted to make it better but they didn't know how to do it so they came over to America by hooker by crook they figured out how to get here they got here and now the Kickin asked why why would you want to get rid of them as long as they're not criminals not hurt anybody want to get rid of them and whatever happens Brown sometimes a dream goes to put you know what I did went to New York I spent three weeks in New York can I Uber and I did a little thing in my mind you know I took 20 Ubers in fact I became Uber Platinum because I'm doing it all these rides not one white person pick me up not one time and guess what I asked questions I asked everybody questions in the most inspiring person I met with one not at work though I rapped at 6:30 in the morning there was no way I was getting the van to go home but I just called who I was Ridgewood Brooklyn and this Indian girl pick me up very cute in 06 in the f****** morning it still kind of dark out you know 5:30 whatever was in this little girl that weight 90 lb pick me up. In the car hello we have charger in the back of you want to charge your card this little caramels in the front I said where you find what she told me Indian I know how long have you been a year-and-a-half Spoke perfect English I do why do you why did you become an Uber driver she doesn't make him over driving because I was a waitress in an Indian restaurant and the guy abused me only pay me eight bucks an hour and take half my tips so me and my cousins got together we put away money and we rent the car wheelies the car my the daytime and I drive it at night wow and I drive a why you are scared to go out at night she's like no she's like I loved it because there's no traffic in that you walk with I just ask her creepy questions Play Me banana but what do you think do you think that you could do that do you think if you came from another country came from Guatemala illegally your came over here though it became a Uber driver could you do that do that or do they check your citizenship what do you think Jamie so someone definitely can come over here and start working for Uber or another or similar I'm not company doing that necessarily like for the proper ways that you can if you have a legal friend you can use their lights I'll be there like the Uber thing and they don't know who's behind the car so you definitely have to have a valid driver's license to get a valid driver's license if your illegal or that's the part I guess I'm saying so I know but that doesn't stop popped up a memory that popped in my head about some story like that but they were going to give illegal aliens the right to drive I'm sort of saying like it does happen but not above the board basically cuz States and DC as of 2013 Colorado Connecticut Delaware everywhere there's weed Hawaii Illinois Maryland Nevada New Mexico New York interest indifferent mean when was the last time you saw a white labor you go in the kitchen and at any restaurant that's all you know I mean it so now you and I are you questioning what rights you have is if American you come here you get a job you're working hard you stay out of trouble on my mind your business and are you see them but that was a husband and wife working and the kids will be doing homework at the back table and if you came in the daytime it was a different couple which is telling me that two couples got together they buy a home and they open a business together they work together that's what those immigrant groups do and then from there they bring a cousin and they open the open another got three houses on the Block and now you just had a f****** immigrant family move into your neighborhood. Message play go to bed you know the saying that the nights we don't have them in our neighborhoods sure I remember 70 years ago this was your grandparents so you have to take about your grandparents and how would you want them treated I'm sure your grandfather got a job laying brick weigh before he got his immigration papers and I don't know how they did it right my grandparents weren't rocket scientist when they came over here and there were kids there they're their parents weren't Geniuses you know what's going on with farmers do you know what's going on you know I can't be mad at you for wanting to get the f*** out of that but just other places on Earth right now will this be a f****** hell going on borders don't make it seem like it's just Mexico that's the f****** problem you know we're getting bombarded from everywhere we're getting new people in here everyday from everywhere I ain't mad at it that come ahead and make better lives but don't just keep pointing the f****** border that you don't want to come in for that Mexican border that nobody's talked about Jamie when you get a minute if you'd love to check it just to verify me you don't make Cuban to getting sent back to Cuba on a daily basis really getting back to get a shot but Cubans come to the Y and just join the walk applicants Logan's pack Mexican shelters home in Orange. Going through a couple weeks ago I think 900 cubed to get sent back weekly to get shot more people more people and make it towards the Border since Trump was like Build That Wall Build That Wall getting more people headed towards the border now because it just like it's a popular thing to do it's a part of our culture like the part of the conversation is the boar rightly do you want a border wall or do you not want to Build That Wall make a million feet high bring it right to the top of the Earth or are you one of those people who thinks anybody should be able to come over here and have a better life you know on this stuff those two ideas a f****** clashing left and right some people think that people should be able to try to do better try to better themselves they should have the opportunity and then some people think f*** them you're going somewhere else you don't ever get a chance to come over here go going through proper channels which is almost impossible do something very valuable to us over here see that's the thing like if you are a person who has left some extraordinary skill you know you could probably get American citizenship easier your unusual you contributing to the physics department at Harvard or something like that and you're you know you were born in Germany or wherever you probably could get citizenship a little bit quicker and you're just a guy who like lives in Guatemalan wants to come to America because he thinks he can advance his life you think you can get better where his where he lives there's no that you can't go anywhere you're stuck did the the properties extreme the crimes extreme he wants none of that he wants to do better so makes it over here and lie but can we talk about immigration I got no problem taking your life for a piece of toilet paper but the same month true from other countries get the good and the bad from other country do let's not beat around the bush before Russian come here they got a course to go to the school and take a 12-week horse to come here and get money right off the bat how to go to Social Security check that out Jamie that's a very weird one they get caught out of come here and scam whether you want to call scan them up with nobody done having tons of Russian friends I love him I'm not saying nothing bad but I've heard that's a fact I've heard nothing from them I have a friend who's married and she told me one that that before they come and they take a course to Prepon on how to get money as soon as they land 3 days after they get when they land and get cash and indolent paperwork what to say they culture that's hilarious service that they offer me some so you can understand the system work but if you ask anybody Rush the Armenians come over come over and get citizenship guess what they do they get Social Security and they move back to Army and they get the check sent back to Armenia they have a system on how to do that they got a thousand loopholes now brother and if you learn those loopholes you came to f****** system there's nothing wrong with having group of people that all agree on certain rules right which is of the United States should be but the problem with having a group of people as you don't get to pick in that group so just deciding instead of being admitted by your Merit or how how good a neighbor you are a nice of a person you are they just whether or not you were born on the dirt they did we board on this dirty that you can't stay but if you born on this day even if your a human being you get to hang out you get to ruin other people's lives while you're here as long as you don't do enough that we need to put you in a cage and then if we do we keep it for a couple years let you out and do more when this is we have no problem with that I don't know what what the percentage is and they have a point they all have a point absolutely when you see someone who is talking about illegal gang members they're sneaking across the border and murdering people in absolutely has happened it's 100% of a real things not not fiction questions how much is it happened and how much better is it for those people's lives at make it across is there a way to screen better to make sure the bad people don't come in and all these questions are legitimate you know you don't want a bunch of f****** evil vicious people from another country that's how everybody else you don't want your children your family to be in danger because someone snuck across the border and they have a long history of working for the cartel murdering people that's a real things real possibility to all the people and all the people that are scared he's probably smart to be scary looking in human history people are capable of doing some awful s*** no one saying I'm not I don't think there should be no no wall at all nothing stopping people from coming across definitely don't want pieces of s*** come I only ask you this what time is find out notice that may be watchful yeah probably a Wolf full did you notice that when you go on this homeless people on Ventura f****** Boulevard and Lankershim Boulevard on the bridges everywhere has ever come to your mind that ain't where you go this cars everywhere and the between Uber and Lyft and cabbage now there's traffic and every major f****** city did you notice that maybe it's not that I hate Cubans and Mexicans and Puerto Ricans are german-irish maybe that will f****** full have you ever come to that conclusion yeah we just full right now we have to take five years off work I would accept that I would accept that I would accept a special circumstances like where I like you have family here at this point right now but you don't send them all into my where's the highest population of Mexicans in the country Southern California Puerto Ricans is putting them to the Cleveland Ohio area to work in the f****** Ford plants and all the other plants and that's all those places that down all those people sitting there holding onto that dick when you go to certain parts of Ohio there's a suburb outside of Cleveland 12 in Puerto Rican did the debate camp cost rebuilds awake I'm not complaining it's a great day to get to science camp a make potions and learn about light bulbs electricity my point is I did the same thing for free all I do is walk to my park there's no funds left

go by my office with a podcast in the middle is it a 24-hour daycare and they talked about leaving my office at midnight I see parents picking up the kids if you don't carry them out over their shoulders until I thought you know what the cost a lot to control the American Family there's not a lot of job you see everybody's driving Uber if you take custom why there Uber yesterday I had an engineer engineer lost his job 58 years old got to work Asian fellow very nice I put them extra you offer me to plug the phone I mean you know you have to look at that and go wow that's a lot of people in this country without work there's a lot of f****** homeless people we're running out of money to take care of what we got here very nice I took them extra you offered me to plug the phone I mean you know you have to look at that and go wow that's a lot of people in this country without work there's a lot of f****** homeless people we're running out of money to take care of what we got

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> asteroids crazy in the UFOs he's like one of the main celebrities they've they pull up when people start talking about I do you like UFO real Believers he's done like little Clips where narrates things do UFO shows and s*** who be f****** believes what didn't they just released find a Jim Florentine that what people don't know is that Hudson County New Jersey Northern New Jersey is the number one place in the country where they have the most UFO sighting really look it up I don't know for a fact that in 1976 little one whatever the f*** do I know for a fact that in 1975 and 1976 you could check me out on this a UFO landed in Hudson County Park I was a kid in the next day the feds locked off the part that yellow tape the samples go look it up dog visit you at fault it's a circular building so they did so much coke in there in the eighties they called it the grinder that's what they called it cuz it was shaped like of the Stone Age I have a couple friends that lived at people that lived in that building have seen UFOs for years and if you go to YouTube There's an actual North Hudson Park UFO they dug up they landed a couple Marshalls got out and took samples and got back in the thing and took off that YouTube thing as History Channel special about it and I still remember being a young kid Define who got knocked on the door and subdued did you see anything anything at 11:10 at night and said you know what the what lights flashing outside they contacted Police Department to see if there was any they went full and the FBI came in circle depart Chloe by the Little League field Hudson County but it is Area 51 what he said somebody goes what are you talkin about last week you said you sent to your phone I can say Packers biggest motherfukers I did a gig there a couple times oh yeah they used to be like a boss there's a ball that did something I put you out cuz my friend is threatening me some Bob put me out when we become friends ever since that's awesome I think I follow on Facebook we have a chat from time to time on Facebook BF4 UFO motherfukers looking to Northern New Jersey that's stop f****** motherload of them that's interesting story is always some person in the woods and they get abducted they say UFO and some strange town the middle of nowhere the aliens land of dark people you always think about it being a rural thing but if I was an alien of course I'll go to New York City why wouldn't you want to go see the craziest thing we have you got like 7 million people stuff together on a tiny Island and in comparison to the rest of the planet stop stacked on Avicii other awesome amazing building them always lied to Times Square with all these people mowing around traveling over these Bridges to get this one Hub is one Hive of humanity of course if I was an alien I will check that out going somewhere when they're high I did they just get f***** up the light come on let's go let's go check out the Monkees Just Call of Duty have a good time something that's real schedule memories one of those memories that's like barely active but remember thinking for like a day or two when I was a little kid maybe I saw UFO I think I was trying to convince myself of it and I was bored but I think it was a jet I think was something something fast and unusual shocking thing about AAA teens that's what I think it is I think that's what that is I'm off to in one of those I had a bit about that to hold on hold on your straps if you're past your house I was in the passenger seat how much G-force is going through it's insane Force blood to stay awake I saw one of those in the air over I guess it's Edwards Air Force Base is that what the one is that's is Edwards the one that's out near Palmdale I think that's it cuz we used to film Fear Factor in Palmdale and we saw that thing for my overhead like that tell me that doesn't look like it's from another planet when you're on the ground the f*** is that so I think that's responsible for a bunch of the things that people saw I think military crafts can I ask you a question what type of sidings do you have sitting on the ground you saw that you liked your comment the aliens are coming. Does not look like it's from this world that thing is madness design that thing flying through looks like something on the keyboard you know looks like a symbol on a keyboard and it just flying perfectly through the air that looks like the future I mean that really does look like it's from another world I would imagine little blue dude with black eyes and talking to each other and going through f****** wormholes and s*** and that's what that thing looks like and what's the what's the thing that they're going to have a hundred years from now just imagine that I just want to know what what the logistics is for it to be considered a siding earlier and you see something and then you convinced yourself that what you saw was something extraordinary feeling that you're looking at something from another world cuz it's just some drone or some military vehicle and then you look at it and then you convinced yourself then becomes a bigger and bigger deal in your head that's a problem with people doesn't mean that everybody to see something is seeing that people are kind of full of s*** let's do you see walmartian okay whatever the f*** okay 1 800 marching right. The phone won't stop ringing okay the phone will never bring it will never stop bringing my concern is when do they consider it a credible what does it take for it to be credible for me for it to be credible I got to see the motherfuker land get out my tickets usually military guys when when you have military fighter pilots that sucks human those that's a you know if you can be one of those guys that flies when was B12 B22 for them to trust you with that billion-dollar f****** spaceship dude you got to be an exceptional human there's no room for someone's full of s*** you going to be a top-flight fighter pilot you're going to fly around with gun fights in the sky cuz that's what they do they have gunfights in the f****** Sky those guys are exceptional human beings so when they see some that's what I listen for sure everybody else I'm not. Not that I wouldn't listen but I don't know you know you might be crazy but it might be crazy even if you're in the military might be crazy if you're a fighter pilots 100% of fighter pilots and all those are really credible guys what is it do these guys are talking about these things these are guys with histories of embellishing things I mean they have this whatever that is that radar what are they looking at is that infrared like what it what is that screen that they're looking for does it say what kind of image it is cuz it's like a weird look at haga photograph right it's like a weird computer image because it's it's it's detecting it right with some piece of equipment isn't it like tracking it on radar or something like that I know what you're saying cuz I feel like I've heard that description of it too but this this article just says it's a video of to Ariel and counters so convenient so convenient do they never have a clear picture that drives me f****** crazy it drives me f****** crazy cuz if it is real I am I've loved and wanted to be real honestly I really do but when I look at a goddamn so many people are so crazy some form somewhere out of the nine planets has got to be something but I don't know what has to be at this point you have to believe that is too big just too big to discount cuz I like that's so crazy to say it's so big Amazon his aircraft detected UFOs both times he was unable to capture them on his helmet camera okay so maybe couldn't look at it get it and good Vision or whatever up and down the eastern coast of the US for months. I'm telling you that little f****** I read something about the Hudson River that all those people that live across the Hudson River weather on the Weehawken Edgewater side or the west side of Manhattan those who are the people on that balcony see all that s*** we did have issues with them and we went to the Middle East Lieutenant Graves said I would imagine them following the war if you were there were aliens they came down to follow the war so they see the war going on in Iraq Isis Afghanistan to come down and they're checking it out just a big on a cynical side of this they're not necessarily saying they are an alien ship they're saying it's a UFO so it's something they're not sure of what of course I'm sort of awesome drone that some Middle Eastern company hasn't can just follow s*** or pasta Pastor something sure we know they have advanced yet I mean we know they have incredible drones then I mean the stuff they can do a drone that Green Berets of seals you put razor blades on and they slit you f****** throat when you drive low that's how good the technology is in those drones Jesus Christ I wouldn't be shocked you all kinds of things going to just come down a razor blades on a some s*** when you could totally see someone having a small drone like a small thing of side of a cheeseburger that has poison in it and just slamming into somebody I can see that this is what we're seeing when you're seeing stuff that's flying around the sky most likely is made by a person cuz people make stuff and people know how to make stuff that flies around the sky prize physics are some of the things he's fighter pilot see that's when he got to go wait a minute here you see these extraordinary Feats of traversing distances like they can get from one place to another place so fast looks like they disappear is something they all talk about they all talk about the insane speed at which these things can go they can just change angles they can just go and then take a hard right angle turn they could do stuff that nothing you know how to make can do that's where it gets to be like well like nothing it's not like it's like oh that's like a fighter jet but like really fast and I'm saying it's like an alien car but it's way faster you know it's an alien car but this is not like anything that we make these f****** things they fly this way they say flat like a like a plate hovering over the ground war but when they go to fly when they go to take off they flip up sideways and they have like the bottom of the spaceship is pointing towards where it wants to go and it does something to space and time make some sort of f****** magnetic gravity connection insert big spooky words would have been no they don't know how the f*** it doesn't this thing can go like insane distances and insanely small amounts of time and when they all report the same kind of behavior of these these reports are like that they're talking about this thing that goes insanely fast looks like the saucer looks like you're trying to figure out what the f*** the shape it's moving so goddamn fast but doing stuff that nothing we know how to make him do I don't know if it's from another planet might be from here I wanted to be for another planet but that's what I want like unbiased like my honest but I would I would love it just be completely honest I would love it was aliens but it was people up even more scared because I'm a goddamn people can do that people can do that and no one knew like someone just if you can imagine a person who can make a spaceship that defies all of the rules that we know about travel about air travel they can make something that defies all that s*** and somehow another keep the whole development and production of it as a secret and then have the same take it off and no one knows how the f*** they did it that's almost more impressive than because that's what these things are doing is if these are is Pilots are accurately reading what's happening and they're telling the truth the thing as remarkable as our stories are very consistent there's a lot of very similar stories from different people that their make a living flying super fast warships that they see something they don't know they like what in the f*** is that when they ceased like that that freaks me out that's when it gets me kids ride his bike to school and he looks up and he sees UFO okay maybe it did happen maybe it did happen maybe the kids being 100% honest or maybe was bored maybe he was bored and decided to make up a crazy story and stuck with it and then after while telling it may be believed in himself that happens to people see things they don't know what they're seeing they decide that it's a different thing I've said this before but it's true story when I was in in Albert there's wolves there and I thought I saw a wolf for like a whole second it was a squirrel but I saw gray fur movement wolf squirrel-like if you're dumb or if you're compromised or if you're tired you know maybe just saw something that look really weird because of whatever weather conditions that are affecting some part of the world you live in ball lightning fly through the air you know it's looks like a UFO you'll see that s*** it's like a real natural phenomenon something Mighty something like that and then add a bunch of other s*** to it and that's where you get a lot of these stories they like natural phenomenon and then people adding a bunch of s*** to things but then on top of that you have credible stories and can't throw out any of them like you got it when you would look at all these things you can't decide just cuz there's a bunch of crackpots stories about UFOs the ones by legitimate fighter pilots that those aren't real can't look at it that way crazy looking at that way because it's more likely there's something out there then there isn't something out there there's a witch way more likely what I was the kid that happened Hudson County Park someone that I got high five or six years ago and I saw it and somebody had posted on Facebook or YouTube and I read more into it and I discounted it until I read the accounts of the 28 people in that building the liquor store there was a guy who had just got dropped off a bus from New York the buses drop you off there from New York the bus driver said there was a flash because they do we just so many people with stories that you know I didn't see your f****** guy get out only three people so I'll people get out everybody else discounted the lights and the noise and the other b******* that went with it I would have shipped my f****** pants if I live in that building so pretty little martians get out or it could just be f****** they can think all kinds of things that didn't really happen but it wasn't that I was on acid I thought it was a f****** I put the FBI was out there with dogs and I left the next day it was f****** a fire hydrant down the toilet except then I went over and patted the Hydra you f*** you f*** that is a problem with any story like all these f****** UFO stories is people's memory memory is not that good it's not that good it's too hard to figure out what actually look like after you saw it like you see something crazy like a year ago and then he tries to private it's too hard to describe but you barely remember it your version of it is a rehashed version that you keep repeating to yourself you know if you saw something I saved you were hiking and you saw wolf right if you saw that wolf when you try to describe that that moment you saw that wolf years later like what what are you actually seeing when you're going into your memory how much do you help accurate is it where was lying about how accurate are memory is not that good but if you use you did see a wolf and it which is it ordinary moment right you're the f****** forest or a real wolf looking down on you m*********** in the woods of Canada just looking at you staring at you want to trade it like an extraordinary moment but she try to recount that in your mind 10 years later what you actually see how much do you actually see you see this blurry weird f****** Misty version and you got some words that fall into place that can describe it but how accurate is your f****** memory it's terrible how I remember statistics about fights like and I can tell you what year

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> conversation that I think is a fascinating one that conversation of reparations cuz you can be no doubt that something horrible happened to the black community and they're still suffering from it's been specially in the Deep South when you live these places where the people who lived are the direct descendants of slaves and then these are the same impoverished neighborhoods and no one's ever done anything to try to fix how do you fix it you first have to start with the subconscious Monica blackmont the problem with the black man is defect that the black man starts off with the fetus mentality the day you're born you're taught the white man's out to get you so you start off with a boogeyman and then you're taught that you're asleep so when your subconscious mind believes that the beginnings of your race is a Slave how do you aspire to be more than that so in order to correct the black community you have to teach black history or so-called black history or I would I would say African history in chronological order before we were slaves work so how do you how do you have a whole entire nation of 40 some-odd million black people and majority of them never heard of Queen Angola who never heard of the Songhai Empire the Mali Empire you know none of this stuff right Kmart Samosa how do you how do you how do you raise a people's level of awareness about this stuff when and how do you elevate them to want to do things in life when they think they are slave that's the first thing that you have to do to help black people you have to teach them who they are before they were slaves they were Kings the problem with that is a king as a monarch in the Marcus one person who controls giant groups of people you can of a bunch of Kings is not a lot of Kings can of a nation of Kings correct but that's very different from saying you know that we had four Kings right for right that's better than saying Frederick Douglass C1 Advanced human being that also looks like you that came from the same part of the world where your ancestors came from to recognize that the trajectory that you and your family are on as a direct result of being enslaved someone was enslaved in the past and brought over here against their will that's why there's the negative mindset that's why there's a negative self-image is because there's a great history of Oppression you know when you think you were slave you can't operate outside of that and even if you don't think you're safe you think you're inferior you know what I'd you don't miss Pat is hilarious and she was talking about was when she was younger that when she would see why people she wouldn't look him in the eyes from getting nervous she felt inferior being around them just wanted to get away she didn't feel like she belong right right and that's a product of not knowing who you are not knowing your own personal power you know when you look at the Second Punic Wars at Carthage you have Hannibal went through the Alps which is in your mission impossible and he went all the way to to the doors of room and Rome said you ain't coming outside to fight you Bro Army was they said we don't want to fight they moved they came outside those Gates they would get their ass whooped so how do you how do you have a people that walk around not knowing that Bronco is A well-stocked studied War General today the Pentagon still studies him right so how do you how are you operating in America as a black person not know who Hannibal bargo's most difficult thing for people that were born in America Northern own ancestors from America to even relate like I might families mostly from Italy and Sicily and some of them from Ireland and I don't relate a tall II visit in the summer I don't relate it all right so then the other the other side opposite effect that we would have natives we were not brought here on slave ships that's not economically sound States was only Built 13 colonies a first-rank you think this whole land was empty know that would need is here but today we're taught that natives are some other people no natives are the melanated African being that has come here since the beginning of the Mali Empire was talking about 14 13th century we had already come here from Africa really oh yeah yeah we had already come here call United States so the weight of the ocean current works is it it works from Africa leaves out of West Africa comes to South America and the Caribbean that's just how the currents go you don't need no paddle boat with nothing added to the currency to take you there and then you travel up but we had already been here you all you got to do is look up the story of Sarah Rector Sal righteous are wealthy so-called Native American I think she was Choctaw tribal one of these tribes but she was wealthy and she wanted to be has to go somewhere and they had her classified as a free person why don't we know about the wealthy so-called black people in America why don't we know that there were black slave owners in America why is that not taught those people are us the so-called black man throws natives were us then we have to tell that history and say how we did have territories and we did no carrier Commerce and we weren't slavery were slave owners what the majority of African Americans that lived here were brought over here no no no that's not economically sound let's say you wanted to have you want to sell marijuana right right would you import marijuana would you grow it here if it's already here well it depends on whether or not marijuana grew here what can you do marijuana you can we're just talking about marijuana like we're already here to go all the way to this other continent to bring people on the boat when we know that half stock is going to die you wouldn't do that so how many people do you think were brought over from Africa on slave ships cuz that definitely happened I don't believe it what you mean you don't believe it I don't believe that story you don't believe that Africans were brought over on slave ships correct I believe it may have happened you know maybe people were brought over a slaves but I don't think that the black people in America came from Africa on slave ships I believe the people we're here we're slowly Concord first they got the east coast and then he started spreading out west little-by-little conquering and when you conquer a tribe what do you do you enslave them their pows right okay that's what you do so you after you copy this tried you you make them slaves not how do you conquer the natives here so let's say you got this tribe is warned against his tribe talk to the white man you help me wipe out these people then boom you know I'll help you with whatever whatever they get together and they wipe out this other tribe and I guess what the white man out numbers this tribe so he wipes them out you just kill two birds with one stone you just keep moving like that but I'm still confused is a great history of slave ships being brought over from Africa with Africans that became slaves and work in the South that you'll do you think that's why history is his story right what about my story is my story but if you do 23andMe on someone from these parts of the country you'll find out then they know that's real about Africa that's good question we should find out how big can you buy Europe and turn Us in terms of like what parts of Africa what's a country in without a country or Connors and Dutch you can't classify me based upon a European I understand that but they're saying geographically geographic location you can call whatever name you want right they can tell you where your genetics originated but I've got some weird shitometer 1% Asian I don't know why it's are 1.6% African there's an ancestors ancestors so let's walk down there so either way if you take black people here in America do they DNA sample and it went back to Africa with his ass Ace of black people in America are Africans now the argument is what we brought here or where we already here did we bring ourselves here or the white man bring his head you say when you say a white man brought us here what you doing is your removing our ability to transfer powercell you're saying oh we didn't know anything about boats tell me you trying to tell me that we didn't know that there was a land mass here only the the holy white man knew there was land to the west but when you look at those people go look at you think the Caribbean is right next to America and a warrant in America that's interested that you do have people that have traveled with her it's Polynesians to travel to Hawaii or people mean there's the olmecs who were thousands and thousands of years ago until the America they have purely clearly African faces yes I mean really listen to noses the lips that mean they look African and that was a South American culture that existed and we don't know anything about them other than the fact that they have these gigantic Stone sculptures that have African face it was like a kid again just go to have you done the ocean currents I've seen that he's all about the fact that the idea that human beings were probably living in advanced civilizations far longer than 14,000 years ago and they did travel all over the world and that you do find the remnants of these ancient cultures that we have no explanation for throughout the Amazon and on throughout a different parts of South America and Central America I mean when you go and you look at it will European history you had the magyars would believe that if they took a bath that was bad but they didn't want to change their clothes they thought that dirty with Purity we talked about the Moors going into Spain and into Europe the stories in the history our history says that when we met call Caucasian he was sleeping in the barn with animals we told no you can't sleep in the barn with animals we talked to medicate we taught them running water we bought that technology to Europe now we bought the technology to Europe that saved Europe from the Black Plague you mean to tell me that if we saved the white race that we weren't already in America ready when we brought the technology when one was dependent on Africa for food remember when the Black print black wrong the cause was one of the officials was stealing the green I was coming from Africa so they were spamming it won't if your source of sustenance is from Africa how are you Superior you're not you get your food from me so if you get your food for me who's more likely to travel is globe OmniSource of food and that's the first thing you need to survive on this planet so if your whole civilization was a pain to me to put to plot depending on me to supply food I made it to America first it's just that you would have got to tell the story is that their only source of food and a source of food that room right but is also very close to Africa go to be when you go look at what the Greeks said about Egypt when you going to eat it just like you always like the New York City of that time the ultimate if if you really want to talk about African civilization being Advanced Egypt is the ultimate variety chip to this day still unexplained I want no one really understands how they built those things don't understand how old the culture is that's another thing the Graham Hancock and dr. Robert schoch from Boston University was a geologist he's pointing to water erosion and the double Spanx that leads you to believe that that place might have been as old as 9000 + BC so it might have been indicative of an earlier Kingdom and is also the Nubian structures of some of the days has particularly the Sphinx you know the Sphinx they believed had a lion's face and then when they were conquered by the new Wednesday change the actual structure of the face of the Sphinx and turned it into a kingsnakes what a whale or was that it is Upper and Lower Egypt so Upper Egypt is actually our new South right that's our South the way of talk to me was that was the mind of Egypt and the economic section of Egypt was what we see Giza Pyramids and its economic because if you look at it it's it's between three continents on the Mediterranean Sea just a perfect place to carrier perfect place that's why everybody wants to be there that's why is there war in the Middle East was the perfect place to be believe that some Africans came over here and slave ships or none very minimal I don't remember a lot of my sources or what learned it from but I can give you a couple things what you got to do what you got to look up Shakalaka most you got to look up Dr Kaba kamene Dr Phil Valentine Bobby Hemmitt who else is a good egyptology up from my own common sense it just does not make sense logistically to take people from all the way from over there to bring them here especially when half your stock is going to die when you got people right here you have human resources right here all I got to do is pop them she was a couple of them the rest of them like alright fine and you enslave them and none of them die except the ones I actually killed millions of people right here like why would I go all the crate all the way across the ocean to bring back across the ocean. What's up Jeremy PBS the title was how many slaves landed in the US us right from the Christmas attacks and Philip Wheatley Benjamin Banneker and Richard Allen all the way to Harriet Tubman sojourn truth and Frederick Douglass think of it as an instance we were might think of as African American exceptionalism in other words it is the black experience it's got to be about Black Americans well black Americans will think again the most comprehensive analysis of shipping records over the course of slave trade is a transatlantic slave trade database edited by professors David Altus David Richardson while the editors are careful to say that all the figures are estimates they believed that the best estimate that we have the proverbial gold standard in the field of study of the slave trade between 1525 and 1866 in the entire history the slave trade to the new world according to the transatlantic slave trade database 12.5 million Africans were shipped to the new world 10.7 million survived dreaded middle passage disembarking in America the Caribbean and South America how many of those 10.7 million Africans were shipped directly to North America only about 388,000 that's right a tiny percent so it's a small percentage of all the Africans that were enslaved we're actually shipped North America is probably closer to truth T-Mobile's that's what they're saying I came here they could have been going to Europe I can trade with you right here in America who was it why they got except directly to North America's only the under 400,000 right involved in the shipping and going at all over the world we going anywhere convert 10.7 million Africans enslaved and moved 10.7 survive right where were shipped but didn't say where they were shipped is the new world the new world is very well if you listen to the words of Hancock in the discussion of prehistoric what we would consider prehistoric use of boats and ships probably likely look at ancient Egypt don't you see pictures of boats oh yeah oh yeah so they would bury that maybe if you could do was the what is the big science museum in La that had the the Egypt exhibit really recently incredible it ain't they had depiction of the boats that used boats how can you tell me that a civilization had boats before Europe was literate didn't come to America didn't set up shop but just not, let me know I don't need to read a book to understand that but definitely makes sense if they made it to South America I mean if the olmecs were I mean if you look at a pull up an image of the Olmec heads heavily-disputed John Henrik Clarke is author you should study John Henrik Clarke has a book they come before Columbus I mean look at that weenies Olmec heads they all look like that yeah if you have a large population of people in order to create these things or not evidence of people that were here thousands and thousands of years before they ever thought people were what evidence in the Grand Canyon from Egypt stuffing like right up the road from where The Serpent Mound is there's been a couple artifacts down there like 800 years ago artifact the African race man we been here they got the Mounds archaeological evidence from Egypt in the Grand Canyon it's right there I never heard that before that is interesting archaeological evidence in the Grand Canyon archaeological evidence in the Grand Canyon not part of his story he's got to keep you thinking he got to keep the black people thinking you were slaves and you came from Africa on boats that's what they got to keep you thinking of you but you really think that there's some sort of a grand conspiracy to withhold information</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what's up the thing I found about the Egyptians in Ohio is actually from a paper that was written it's a bit postulating and I guess they took a lot of the evidence that had they been finding and saying this shows that there might have actually been Egyptians there sounds like a Rainbow Shell that was used to make arrowheads and stuff a long long time ago that area was used to make weapons like the first like 12,000 years ago in the first people were Conover North America but that are in Ohio also is known as the stand some capital of the world and I don't know if that's related to the Egyptians that the pyramids are made out of tons of sandstone that is very specific to that region 1980 21 times the amount of sandstone that made the Great Pyramid was shipped out of Ohio to make various buildings all over the world most of them United States August all over the place Lost Civilization Grand Canyon was wait Egyptians at the Smithsonian public and stuff in 1909 I guess that where all this came from there's an article that got written and I don't know how much of it they proved or proven was proven or was this newspaper way back in the day on record rather than appearing to be of Native American origin as one might expect the object had distinct Egyptian or Tibetan design could have been an entire civilization of Egyptians living here if so how did they get here... It's not that hard in the boat man you got cats that leave Africa and try to come to Spain is very distinct African people living there the whole Caribbean all I all that whole area is a lot of African roots to it but that's just a place that was conquered by the Spain you know bye-bye the Cortez's you know those type of people what do it really disturbs me is there's no way to know exactly what happened it's like you're piecing things together based on artifacts and historical record things that people wrote down and journals and logs and is people that have traveled so again I study for so long ago but I remember reading primary source from somebody that travel with Crystal Ball cologne AKA Christopher Columbus and he was saying very specific things about his accounts when he reached these different places you known he was saying things like we got to the land we found Africans and the I remember him fondly saying so no matter where we go we find Africans and he said it as if he was disappointed and then he started talking about like you know this is they start talking about their culture in describing your culture go look at the people that travel with Crystal Ball cologne and there's some first-hand accounts there and they're very honest about it you know dude I'm going to look into that now that's a very interesting about it he's studied North America and South Graham about that to what he knows about it he's studied me especially on his latest book started a lot about did the various cultures that made it to North America and South America okay</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> bun bun hotep Jesus how are you sir I always want to say that you want to call somebody that I need that drops to get a name like hotep Jesus how did that come about it wasn't my do you know I always had just went through my Spiritual Awakening Awakening and you know tweeting on Twitter like I do right and somebody said what do you think you are some kind of hotep Jesus hotep Jesus can you switch it is anybody on hotep Jesus I do you say you have hotep Jesus on Twitter to he's been in a couple of times but I think they'll be there with that weird man they want I mean I think all social media all tech companies want you to tow a line right now and if you're not telling that line you bring on forbidden gaskets and you have people that have controversial ideas you know that Dad that finger on the button getting ready oh they don't know what to do it's just like radio radio people buy things that's what that's what the study say allegedly do marketing studies in advertising study say people are in a good mood 10 to buy things right so the radio is supposed to play happy songs all day long and the radio works for the appetizers kind of like media social media is no different advertisers so if there's people on the platform who are creating disgruntled crowds could be hurting the bottom line yeah but Facebook's algorithm actually favors that the way Facebook has it set up Excel if you if you get into debates of people on abortion or something like very controversial they will start sending that s*** to your feet that will double prop sort of steering your direction because the more you engage the more clicks they get the more money they get the more advertising dollars to get absolutely absolutely Facebook algorithm is quite unique safety in counsel trust and safety when I go and look at the entities that contribute to that board I kind of start saying oh okay I see why certain topics are taboo you know there's there's a board those people in the board are the voice they're the ones that have the opinion you know so if your group isn't represented maybe you need to figure out how to get on that for you. I mean it's not going to happen and you better be left-wing you going to get on their board is I think Jack's more like in the middle probably know whoever else is in the office making the day-to-day decisions. But I think Jack is in the middle of a there's so many people with so many ideas essentially the founding fathers of our country had a great idea when it comes to freedom of expression they felt like it was very important that you have free speech and the only can't be silenced to can't be it can't be undermined by people who disagree with you because it's dangerous it's dangerous when someone can just decide that you can't have a voice anymore no leave their voice can be heard and we're kind of seen that with Twitter we're kind of seeing that with face Google and they're deciding what could be heard and would not come here they think they're doing it for good reasons they think they're doing it to preserve our culture and our civilization and they want to protect people from the election shut down the Donald the the the Donald Trump support Reddit page that's not a good idea right before the and you can't do that I mean it could be just because if you have some people that are saying some s*** that's bad on their get rid of those people get rid of that but you can just shut down a hole Forum like it seems that seems insane is there reason for it tropical Berry I feel like all this stuff is like we're seeing what the first amendment is really all about why it exists we're seeing it play out with all these social media sites I really think it's very easy to create an actor the left can create a right-wing actor online to pretend like it's something about it or it's something else they can go in a Reddit do something vicious to get the whole Reddit band right organ agent provocateur exactly and I never leave that off the table when I look at instances like this the internet everybody's so what is this election meddling if you're killing a whole sub what does it depends I mean that would be really interesting if it turns out that it was someone from the left that was posing as someone from the right in order to shut down a forum and Pretenders death threats or let me look at YouTube and happening with YouTube even just the algorithm you know I'm pretty good with keywords SEO marketing so when I type in certain things I know it's going to come up or what type of content comes up when I type in those keywords it's like ABC NBC ABC Orwell 1984 socialism and communism and fascism in the degradation of society and a lot of control coming down you know people you know in some ways it was the internet created for Freedom or was it created for control right so that is two different Pathways in probably look at that but it seems like in many ways they set us up to be controlled and are doing it through monopolies Google controls search through YouTube and Google and buy what you search you can think it's a truth but what did Kanye say can you say Google lie to you you know so you are crazy shut down about that he does and I like crazy a little crazy a lot of crazy sometimes so I appreciate his crazy side more than his concert well great things come from Wild thoughts right exactly I think the internet was initially created to exchange information and then one that got loose to the general public they realize what a crazy idea that was why I think we're seeing right now with the algorithms is that these Corp influencing his company to say hey when someone's looking for these things how many send them over to ABC send them over to NBC how about you you know like we want to be able to get the first views on these things so someone searching for that I don't know how they do it I don't know what day it whether they have agreements with them I mean there's also a lot of copy written s*** that's on there that could get YouTube in some significant trouble if they have a really decided to pursue it and how many videos are on YouTube the people having the channel that are just straight off of fox NBC news or has a lot of like copyright protected content that YouTube is essentially profiting off of oh yeah we'll send these people to you know this first yeah and that's why I say control comes in the advertisers paying for the platform yeah they're they're monetizing us there monetizing us to users interview was yeah that's where it gets tricky right because as soon as he advertises get on board this it look we we want to give you money but this content is not advertiser-friendly right and they start moving stuff around and demonetizing things and demonetization the real thing that they're doing in a lot of ways was intentional or not is your influencing what people post your kind of sent you your asking them to Center cuz you say hey you guys want to discuss abortion rights or you know what cuz there's there's some things that you start discussing them and they will automatically Dumpty monetize you yeah we'll who is the girl that put out the abortion documentary and I forget what it's called but there was some things about abortion and the documentary the day when I forgot shut down she had to read cute white chicks way that this could have been deceptively advertise or just have to lie edited by kids it seems to me like they're saying that they're going to manipulate search results and they're going to play the way people see things because of the 2016 election they don't want that happening again in 2020 you know doing a keyword search you start saying the power those and then you know Uncle hotep you know his channel was doing great and then the algorithm flipped in the casino like he wasn't making the same money anymore so it's like I don't have to go to some doctor video or whatever video to understand this problem the people around me are being affected by it is a primary source I don't have to look at some onion internet but it's it's in a way I don't like playing victim with the topic right step platform do what you want with it we choose to be there we don't have to be there cuz it's not another game in town though it's not weird right when you think about how big the internet is people that is why people that white people just wipe it out there knocking this opportunity and it's always like what is that the only opportunity can you not create your own opportunity you know what I mean so I never want to take a victim mentality and say oh no let's take Google to court and you know all this stuff is like if you want to do that that's fine that's not how I'm looking at this I'm looking at long-term like hooking up with Andrew 12/8 Gap you know what I mean and building tools so you know we do the climate app.com and creators actually it's based upon approval right now but Creator can go on there and receive Bitcoin as a donation you know so we're circumventing the things that happened like with the deplatforming at patreon right and the other payment platforms for creators so Works reading tools to circumvent these things that's how I look at it I'm like oh Google is doing this great a great opportunity here let me see it and let me build it and be you know the alternative you know I love to see that alternative going to be YouTube and as popular course not it's just not but it's still a viable option you can still communicate with your people the number one communication tool for an influencer with it but their Community is email build your email list right people still subscribe to email list that's not YouTube That's not Google that's your email is that your contact list so it's like me and complain about you to Google but you can build your audience almost anywhere it depends on how powerful you are are you powerful enough to convince people to come to this other platform or to wherever you are a lot of people are powerful enough to pack a room at $2,000 ticket you tell me you can't get somebody to go to another platform for free ticket change your life in Karate kicks you know the kickboxing class and you know we'll chat in the song is the content certainly us and like I get what I got from talking to Jack and vigil was it's almost impossible Demands a site like that the influx of like I used to have a message board on my website one of things I noticed before we shut it down was I was getting thousands and thousands of Russian emails signing up for my website f****** a tens of thousands of Russian email addresses were signing up like similar dresses it was something like the IRA sympathy in their research agency which does that which is responsible for all those fake pages on Facebook and Google and Instagram all that s*** and they were signing up for websites and that had message boards and then they would jump on and pretend that they were whatever the f*** they were right pretend that they were social justice Warrior pretend that there was black lives matter poem fights start arguments yeah and it also happened and then it happened with Facebook and became a big party election you realize like this like concerted effort to use these platforms for you wiggle so when your jack or your whoever runs but you have to look at then go okay how the f*** do we manage that maybe we're in the Free Speech we should just let these people manipulate everybody a big party election you realize like this like concerted effort to use these platforms so when your jack or your whoever runs but you have to look at them and go okay hello f*** do we manage that maybe we're in the Free Speech we should just let these people manipulate everybody right</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is east of aren't hard to obtain like you're getting up horses and hard sorry fellow people depends on how much you make what you do what kind of job you trapped in hard is relative right you know like like I tell my kids hardest basically undiscovered that's all that's right so for example when you first do Algebra it's hard but that's just because it's new so hard equals new that's what hard means it's new because what you do algebra 3 4 5 10 times is not new anymore and therefore it's not hard once you break past the the newness of a thing it's no longer hard like building a business it's not new to me therefore it's not hard it's very easy for me to build a business because I've done it so many times in my life is in size is Cash flowing 4X it was doing when I first joined the company and all I do is make a few tweaks that's only because I'm not new to the text artists paste I've been working with over 20 startups over 20 startups in the end in a matter of two three years as a consultant so this stuff when people are always hard as I do and you're an idiot and you don't know what you're doing it's not hard which is like when I lived in New Brunswick Right By Truckers I wasn't really a 50 Cent fan I enjoyed music by wasn't a fan to buy a poster I bought this poster was him and G-Unit and that is big stash of money I was like yo it's just this poster motivates me you fast forward 10 years and some other things I did to get close to 50 and I actually work with 50 that was technically hard right police and wanted actually happened turn that wasn't actually hard some people know they just not disciplined hard hard is dealing with yourself that's what's hard can you defeat your own mind so it when I wake up every morning the only thing I got a defeated out the only thing I have to defeat once I defeat doubt I live in a limitless World infinite possibilities I can live do anything so some people told me I owe in order to be intact you know you need a million dollars and and that's gotten the third do I got equity in three tech companies 3 tech companies and I'm not rich I didn't you know put up Millions to get into these companies I'm part of these companies because I built me it wasn't hard it really wasn't hard to get into these companies I just had something to offer any saw value with me I want to be the next Elon Musk going to be the next Bill Gates I want to be the guy that Zuckerberg hates you think I'm saying I want to be the guy that that builds the new Silicon Valley on the East Coast you know that like that's those are my aspirations so when people tell me what you can and can't do when it's hard I'm like dude I'm selling Bitcoin how many black dudes you know sell Bitcoin none you get what you want and and I didn't get in the Bitcoin out of dumb luck I manifested that I said I wanted to sell Bitcoin how can I manifested that I let it go in the universe brought me the opportunity and then it happened when I said when I first said I want to be a VC first thing I want to do is start building a portfolio I didn't look for companies they found me it just I just had to ask the universe and it presented opportunities not just had to the universe had to put the intention out there so do you think that literally by thinking about things you can make them happen you can't make the opportunity present itself and then you have to be ready to take advantage so let's we got to walk to the store to 50 Cent thing right so I get invited to his bus launch rank for the company now I'm sitting on the bus they moved me to the back cuz of security reasons sound in back of the bus when the bus start moving in my head feel kicks in and out kicks in and I'm telling myself with the bus stop and I said I should just hop up and start screaming I'm on the bus or 50 Cent I'm like nah I don't do that identifies you out here you got to sit here and that's not right then you know all these things society says is right so I stand up right after they take one of their energy drinks they throw it on me but it's because I started off with the feet in doubt but also listen to my intuition intuition said to hop up and do that right what the opportunity was presented to me I didn't I didn't create opportunity date DM me and said y'all we want you to come I didn't ask inviting me but it's because I kept putting that 50 Cent energy out there 50 Cent I want 10 years I'm inputting information that the energy out there give you listening your holler at me I want to work with you again but I really really love 15 his attitude is really fun to do you know anything about Father's Day can you identify when it hits and in and can you defeat the fear toot toot it to attend do you have all the other bases in your life covered will you have the bandwidth to tackle some correct difficult correct correct but they usually it doesn't cuz if you couldn't handle it you wouldn't be able to recognize it do you say this like the universe presents is to this like a spiritual concept is this likely are you manifesting reality with your thoughts of intent did you really believe that all of that why do you believe that cuz I lived it but you lived it in your successful attitude about things like the secret Law of Attraction you hear that from people that are successful in do I will it into existence yeah a lot of people going I don't look at it in the same way but I look at it in a similar way I think there is something to intention that there's something and it's something also to having that kind of Faith to believe in intention where's I think a lot of people do their reluctant to give into that because it seems to woowoo and yams like some crystals and f****** astrology and horseshit the law of attraction I'll just speaking into existence have a nice not true you have to first educate yourself and we talked about hotep write me to buy hotep you got to bring up the 5% nation you got to bring up Supreme mathematics 0 Cipher 1 knowledge to wisdom 3 understanding what it first started the number one ranked number one is knowledge so the problem is people are trying to manifest but I ain't got no knowledge of anything with no knowledge educate yourselves well and also knowledge is the springboard for imagination so if there's a complicated calculus problem what you don't know what calculus is how can the intuition feed you inside or inspiration to solve this problem you first have to have the knowledge of calculus then you get it you get all this influx of inspiration like Einstein talks about meditation the inspiration comes but the inspiration can only talk to you based upon your understanding is there a saying yes so the problem is people out here not educating themselves you know my day begins and ends with educating myself begins ends and during the day I'm just reading books hopping between books and reading and listening to lectures and people think I'm deep and I'm like I don't know I don't know whatever whatever want me telling you but really My secret is consuming as much information as pause that's my secret ending from that I'm able to say how well you know. And I were you know studying history you know you can you do a lot of things but if you're not educating yourself or or doing you got to do something like the start</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what do you think about all this talk of Elizabeth Warren's talked about it and some other candidates are talked about his mother politicians of talked about breaking up these big companies breaking up Facebook it's too big break up Google break up Twitter what do you think about that I think we have to study what happened to Standard Oil what happened to Standard Oil Standard Oil that you broke it up and it became Exxon Chevron Texaco I think BP don't quote but is anybody a brand loyal to the gas is Emily like dude I'm a Chevron man with those carts well companies right so you see a lot of them on the left right and then they should go what do you say you said consolidation out you do you break up monopolies not really breaking up monopolies what you're doing is recruiting a divide-and-conquer dynamic so it's like okay I'll let my brother control this one my sister control that with my cousin and you actually Corner the market so breaking up monopolies in that case and I think we'll see the same thing with Google if we break up Google or you're going to do is just have little subsidiaries a little satellite things that will just control a certain segment under a different name with her make it harder to track back to its source so I mean it when I say you know break up monopolies I think that the establishment me up baby I right are they trying to get rid of him the board members are like that's what they claim but that robot out of here what's the way drinks water right he does look like a robot so so what I feel is like the powers-that-be are pushing socialism I like we can use this as an excuse to infiltrate Corporation start controlling this Internet space so the Internet space is not communist I'm of the opinion though that if we believe in freedom of speech and you create something that's so big that it's essentially a Town Square which is what I think these platforms are you if you ban people especially if you can people s*** like learn-to-code like things that don't make any sense there's people getting banned for some pretty ridiculous the fundamental ideas this country sound done that's what freedom of speech I think it's incredibly important that if you have someone saying something that you think is wrong or is hurtful there should be an Avenue where people can examine that and talk about it and it in combat it with good speech speech that makes sense when they first got D platform some got D platform with this white nationalist. I'm laying well if this is how these people feel let's listen to let's listen to the gripes what are they mad about right and then people like how could you these people are racist I don't care if they're racist job so they can't be racist to have these these groups that people call Fringe I feel like the people that are Fringe are the test for freedom of speech not the people in the Middle East a fringe groups on the outside if they don't have freedom of speech everybody in the Middle Screw so I still have lots of your let these dudes talk like stop doing that like like you know I don't care you know if they're racist names but then now you see it coming down and we lost know Louis Farrakhan and God D platform only losses verification Gavin McInnes to get rid of a bunch of people that were on Instagram and Facebook that they hadn't deplatformed but it didn't seem like there was anything that happened that caused them to do that it seemed like they just made some sort of a decision that I think was probably based on preparing for the 2020 election absolutely you saw it so what I think what happened was the the Banning of Louis Farrakhan is just a theory but they were like all right if we ban these conservative conservative go ape shitt right but we throw Louis Farrakhan it'll kind of settle things down a little bit cuz it'll look like we're fair I think you're exactly right yeah so I'm like so that's what they did and like dab and there's mines and there's a couple other startups are ya trying to make their way into the Jordan Peterson one and there's nothing that really stands out and once someone starts months ago vagina group of people start using something unless it's like what the most hilarious when they one of them vanish like Myspace how f****** badly do they match my space form is very weird you know still exist but what Twitter is right now and what Facebook is right now and what Instagram is right now it seems like there's no real competitors beside specifically YouTube there's no real confederacy's because when I don't want to adult pylon know mines or gas or anything but the problem is when you build a social networking is why I will not build a social network at least not in the next 10 you have to understand that you can't build a social network that mimics another one have to be different that's why I snap is still here right snap is inside a certain demographic that's my daughter's you know generation what's the what are we going to focus on like with mines U-boats videos you post photos and then out of the photos appear right so when I look at mines mines is my Instagram when you when you look at mines on mobile that the fox really small so I can't read this so I'm just going to use it for photos when I put the photos it pops up right so it's like is mine's going to go that route are they going to go to the video route or they going to go with tweet route you got to pick one and then go from there if you look at Twitter Twitter Napoli's fit your features in the beginning you just had Fred's none of that so you have to start at your core but when you the other problem they do is they try to build these social networks completely robots tonight with all the bells and whistles of the Giants nah bro you got to start small and slim and then let your audience tell you what the next feature is what would it be information information to be free but I hate I hate the idea that people want to create social networks I might exist let's use the ones that exist and let's just figure out how to make them better than those have so much power because they can dictate who's on who's not on so what you do is when you have something like a Twitter use your Twitter to congregate your minds right but then your your your bills World your visit the world have to listen to the community and and then curate their product around with the community needs right and you told her figure out what the dissenter when he found out all the internet is blocking comments he created you know you can comment on anywhere on the internet and then Google from smashed it right cuz I get that out of here is that what you want to do with you want to keep a competitor from using their platform profiting off of it and that's how I looked at it I looked at it from a marketing or business perspective Nighy whereabouts name but if it becomes huge I mean anything can be useful comment on anything you have like a little link and if you use Gap you can comment on anything that comes up they they know they cash reserves Associates that they're not worried about competition at all you know what they're worried about is controlling thought and and that's their primary goal goal thought right for the betterment of the ruling class and that's it to me that's that's the end of it all but you are these these these these people that create Tech products like creekpointe it's a Toro for example might have jeopardized different size do you only do one thing with different eyes the only thing you can do is save a video or GIF or GIF from Twitter gif but our AB does one thing right and people love it when I first came on as a confounded this app did more than that and when it did more than that it didn't do as well as it does now that used to do we had incentives to share the app you could edit GIF gifts you could put text on them problem all types of like add an editor in there does it give it takes editor toss it out we had a keyboard still have the keyboard by was a took some of the functionality and stuff out yeah yeah and this is this thing's about to be super huge we have a gallery coming soon and that's going to be awesome going to be perfectly curated not speaking my partner Simone this morning about that that's one of the fun things about Twitter when someone says something stupid and then you look at all the gifts Underneath It All the memes and gifs of people like rap so whenever there's a new video while you know something funny happens in use the reaction so we on iOS there's no way to save it now you can with her app but I have only does one thing and everybody's really loved it right that's that's the core of the business what's the core of Mines what's the core of Gab what's the core feature does anybody know there is not a core feature as an alternative there is no uniqueness where there is none uniqueness you can't compete not the first create uniqueness or or Philly need their there's no need for me to be on these other platforms the promise when you get on those other platforms and there's no one there can you go holla Twitter real quick when you build a social network before you build a network you have to be before you build the platform you have to build a network what's interesting if you go back to life play with my space was King and then you imagine what the world be like 16 years later no one would have saw this coming no wonder saw all these social media platforms and that it's used as a way of breaking news now I mean specially in places that don't have real objective news so if you're in some country that's some more torn country and some horrible s*** is going down you see the news breaking on Twitter before anywhere oh yeah interesting oh yeah that's why I tell people like to do Facebook and Instagram the news breaks on on Twitter you know by the time you know by the time I'll show my friend of my friend shows me a video like I said on Twitter like 2 weeks ago bro cuz he's on Facebook how do you Market a prodigal Market yourself when you're 2 weeks behind are you following who you interacting with Rye but I get like like a people say to me how you know so much when I cure my followers Hooks and links and stuff like that like they're just sending it to me I'm so when you're in that position but when so the key to marketing is this you know if what you're talkin about is irrelevant nobody's paying attention to you so the only thing that makes some of these platforms is the juxtaposition to the big check Giants you remove the tech Giants are you still relevant what makes you relevant Brian that's where a lot of people that do content with are there podcasts or whatever they probably should be thinking about developing an email list and putting things in the website having something available independently these big platforms you mean you see all these people have gotten deplatformed you and I don't think I'm at the risk of that but if the I didn't think these people were just a few years ago as a climate shift people get more and more radical with this idea of deplatforming I think becomes like a game about shooting ducks people get excited about it like taking people out whether it makes sense or not I don't think I'm at the risk of that but if the I didn't think these people were just a few years ago as a climate shifts and people get more and more radical with this idea of deplatforming becomes like a game about shooting ducks people get excited about it they like taking people out whether it makes sense or not</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you have these people that are working for the Russians or even people that are working on the left or trying it mean if there really is someone that's doing that to the Donald subreddit on Reddit if you're in the Free Speech you supposed to allow that right you could just create a metric or or some sort of mechanism that red flag and account publicly I think this is where it gets slippery right cuz then you're talkin about an algorithm you're talkin about manipulating results not that route what I'm saying is this is where it goes right if you just keep managing the content and looks like someone like like gab they just let the content Flow Free obviously you go there good it is an opportunity to fix something because at some point that problem was going to emerge right it just emerged now so it's like oh wow okay here's his problem the solution to every problem lies within the problem so technically there is no problem so let's just go ahead and solve this problem and move on to the next one you know but I love problems I love solving problems I think it's really fun so when I see your problem I go let's think about this and sometimes it's not a one-person you know it's a whole committee and a whole bunch of mines have to get together so when I look at the conservative Community I think about like you know aren't you have all these mines but are your mind's working to complain or your mind working to solve the problem and it seems like the mines aren't working to solve the problem to work in a complaint so for example during the early 20th century to do with this newspaper super popular New York and he put some Mentor things about a certain family in New York City and all department stores boycott newspaper she has no advertisers so they did that to put them out of business and its gentleman takes the space and give it to the proletariat or the you know small business guys in the area and get some full front paid as right stuff that the department store couldn't buy and then what happened was after they've the newspaper got a circulating like that a department store department store came back and they said yo alright RFI what will pay we will come back and he said no I don't need you anymore you know I have people that can do this I can do this with the people and his newspaper was successful until the day he died so when I look at that example that was able to thrive in 1920s something or 1910 or whatever it was I look at it I'm like at this guy just stood on his Laurels and didn't bow you know then why can't we do it as a nation or as a team you know I think it's very possible to example that we look at Gap right there's new competitor I'm not going to mention the name but it's like whoever was the establishment created this alternative platform to compete with God what makes you think that intuition certain things I can see within a business that the average person can't see and I'm like. It doesn't make sense that doesn't look right that you didn't control so they're creating an alternate platforms they can control they can control there's only one Twitter there's only one instagram there's only one YouTube and those are giant and Facebook is basically the only thing like that right means there's no competitor to Facebook and space has four of them they're all trash oh my goodness this all trash is going on Facebook trash I've been saying that for like the past decade Facebook trash I stopped using Facebook a decade ago all right if I used it was just like forced you know I use it as a publishing Outlet when I put the tour dates or something like that I put it on Facebook Island gauge account just in case is bookmarks to order me to buy I'm going to set up and all that so you know these platforms we don't need them they're not that great if you look at the story on Instagram Instagram was a lucky project of serendipitous it was called Instagram they're working on a whole bunch of other things some popular kids started using the platform that blew up ebony passed on to Facebook from the very Inception I said this is a very trash prod product just horrible Harley curated right it's so horribly curated that Facebook can't even monetize a platform properly right but that's a whole nother story but the platform itself and its functionality stupid it's just popular we know what's weird is like replying to people and reading replies like what in the comment so you can't even keep up with an outing and you can't get all your notifications aren't Caribbean property it's just it's like as if they don't care they don't care. So big so quick and it's stuck in this format you have to kind of reformat the way it's they don't care don't think so they don't care they don't care if you if you want to build a product for your user you can do that if you want to build a product for advertisers you can do that they built the product for advertisers not for users that they bill uses you and I'll be able to have a conversation on there isn't it originally wasn't text America was that the same thing was text America the original one that's the one where I have the picture of the prostitute in the bathroom he like where you would text something to see you send the photo you sent a photo on IG but it wasn't my wood go up to internet website back when there was no applications man cuz I took that from a flip phone to medial that's the difference and then you would have to go to a website to see all your photos so like you have a young Jamie page on text America and all the pictures that you had taken the first photos on Instagram a lot of people were be like s*** as a photographer you'd be kind of like s*** on if you weren't taking with your iPhone only uploading DSLR photos you be like I've been out the filters like some of these girls look like cartoons didn't look like humans so on Facebook and Instagram Instagram Instagram are you going to have the cojones to come and say I'm choosing my Laurels over I'm choosing my morals over the money cuz it's a lot of people out here that are on the Facebook platform just for money I spoke to a conservative influencer and other business and I'm trying to feed my daughter with the stuff he's putting out on Facebook he doesn't believe in so he's just doing it for profits doing it for profit I'm talking about this these are the people that everybody believes these are the ones that have captured a large audience mean talkin about don't type of money you can pull in on on Facebook but you know he literally says you know I'll go on Twitter I make one tweet and then I get like two thousand retweets and then you know you know this blows up like that but it's because he knows that the bus words he knows what to say to get the people whatever you know what I mean if I don't like Facebook I'm not going to use if I don't like Facebook on my phone use Instagram you know I'm just going to be no stick of what I like I like Twitter not told people in 2009 when I go now I'm Twitter marketing so I always say focus on one channel when it comes to social media just one channel unless you have the staff to you and that's all I found out about your videos and watch your videos and if if that didn't exist and the DePauw you put your videos on YouTube what how else would someone get their message out if you if you if you think that these platforms are all trapped if they didn't exist I wouldn't find out about you Twitter is great toward us remember I've liked I've never mentioned Twitter like you said we're out Twitter where I would be sitting here right now I could never got you on Facebook and Instagram that would never happen maybe Instagram some most of it is like hey one of my friends says check out this guy just got school this guy's interesting ride we should talk to this guy that's how it usually happens and then I'll go to your page and I saw a lot of interesting conversation or the thing is Instagram doesn't allow you to see in my heart they don't allow you to see in the soul Twitter I really connect with people how come you can't do that Instagram algorithm because it hides stuff and develop a good following it doesn't look for you but how often can you post on Instagram post I can go from Deep to wear my middle-aged white women that correct I can take you deep and then I can make you laugh yeah I'm going to mean and I can share you know something else I can share my video when you get up photos on Twitter just like you get off on Instagram and go live so it's what is great and how they carry the large future Lanes at the top of your phone on mobile is beautiful like like like they get product I don't feel like Instagram gets product good wanted to I'm go live and inking in salt what is great I had a curate the live feature Elaine's at the top of your phone on mobile right it's beautiful like like that like they get product and I don't feel like Instagram gets product</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what the problem is is the ruling Elite are free to men you know it is a huge soyboy movement coming down just got on the Pike right away everywhere anybody's listening right now everybody that's listening right now soy is bad for you it's not good it is very bad. Process nonsense the only estrogen Blaine system people in the spiritual World endocrine gland system is the physical manifestation of the so-called chakras right now at the heart chakra what we have is called the thymus gland and the thymus gland is the one that controls your sexual maturity and when you have an endocrine gland disruptor your sexual maturity is affected so a man who would ordinarily like women now likes you see you have to have massive quantities of soy for that take place that's that's subjective based upon your biological structure I always think of it is more like a fun thing to say when you go look at it Meats to the whole vegan movement right you go when you go get your oils not good for you and then you know you got these men who are acting like women who can't even do no control their wives you got some men out here that let another man sleep with their girlfriend think it's pushed I think about you is just highly pushed by who I want to see when you look at the degradation of Russian right before the Bolshevik Revolution what they do is they come in first with alcohol right so they purchase your hops and barley and he produced alcohol than what they do is they sell the alcohol to the farmer credit cuz he ain't got no money right cuz he been drunk he hasn't been producing crops like he should he falls into credit he falls into debt me falls into that he's now a slave to the land he wants on now and I can sell whatever I want to population or give this population whatever I want because they are now technically my sleeve but in order to rule a nation of people you have to destroy morality you have to destroy Integrity so you feed them drugs alcohol and sex and interpret the family what do you think that's just a natural progression of people's slovenly instincts or do you think that's some sort of a grand plan displeasure without sacrificing discipline because it's easy if we just lay in jerk-off I don't think anybody has any Sinister government manipulating the strings that makes him watch p*** all day I think they just lie yeah it actually is Instagram's a gateway to p*** Instagram you can't go yoga Community has went from hey check out Maybach Asana to check out my backside right open incognito browsing hip on her now you out of here right now your day is done you just depleted your your energy right and it's coming out my book when I talk about you know why you shouldn't recognize. But did you write that you shouldn't jerk off yeah you never well there's a calculation 8 / 2 times when I forget what it is it's in my book I can't remember it but I got it from the towel right is why I don't have it memorized time is 8 * 2.228 * 2.2 ending to tell you how many dates right to at my age I'm 38 my age it's about seven and a half days between ejaculation to me to maintain who I am really yeah and am so a man strength Bryant's every time you deplete yourself you're not the same man anymore you lose your superpowers now when you lose your superpowers to some you know IG model it's not even worthy your orgasm doesn't feel the same as a natural interaction with a woman true so yeah you're wasting your superpower so you're wasting a percentage of your vital energy your vital energy as well as the proteins and minerals and zinc and magnesium and all that stuff that you know is lost out yeah you know what I think is equivalent to like to New York strip steaks eggs oranges and apples or something like that really is a lot of vitamins because it's a it's a full meal before meal so full of nutrients that a man loses uicideboy my yeah this is where we differ you think there's actual manipulation taking place I think it's just Natural Instincts and then I think that people see it around them and then they cater to those Natural Instincts and then they support those Natural Instincts I think people have a natural instinct to be undisciplined and lazy and just gratuitous and dive into pleasure before sacrifice and commitment excuses I think it's also the softness of the world we live in we live in this incredibly easy to get by and world right you know where the poor people are fat yeah he's never been a time in history were poor people fat yeah yeah put in the least amount of effort you can without getting fired and you can exist that didn't happen in the wild world and people hunters and gatherers of Eden put 100% effort if you didn't really struggle you didn't make it and you weren't a benefit to the tribe and they kicked your ass now and not eating yeah yeah yeah I thought about you worrying and and Sean it and Bennett and say like hey you know we don't want this here you know it's readily available on Twitter watch riding your feet sometimes when scrolling my feet I don't know how accurate is jaculation frequency emitted by the towels the most respected of the dearest son some meow quoted above recommended jaculation no more than once every 20 days for men over 50 and no more than once every hundred days for men over 60 and then there's a level you want to keep before you ejaculate so it allowance jerk off and then you can think clearly I was telling myself a bit about I say jerk off first then think about it like if you jerk off and then you want to call girls cuz you love her and I just trying to f*** you actually like her as a human being you want to be around her you don't just be want to want to be around over sex you actually really love her yeah I think there's a level of discipline right so yeah about to make that that risky text message might want to shoot your load right that's what I'm talking about what the f*** I'm going to watch a documentary man no I'm not going to send this this this thirsty comment I'm going to stay disciplined and who I am because in order to get the woman I have to stay away from the woman you know you're you're at your vitamin energy for me keeps me like on edge like horns like an animal you know because I want a release so what I do is I'll work up that energy and then Channel it into work I'll just immediately put my laptop out bang out but when I get around women with a full sack I'm not the same as what I'm empty you can see the difference and how do you set up different your chest pokes out when you're around other men you were like a little bit more edgy yeah did that Mike Tyson said I always like to come as much as possible for a not distracting you just shoot his load in the beat the f*** out of everybody and Mike had a lot of extra loads I think if you had a gas Ultraman 145.7% of the Baseline is that they didn't observe significant fluctuations from the Baseline on days 2 through 5 the research also showed that the peak levels were a day 7 risks Dow is actually down by the way it's Tao it's the risks of too frequent ejaculation performed with the recommended how frequency it becomes an inexhaustible source of energy like a well that never runs dry however when ejaculation frequency exceeds the capacity of the body to fully replenish the semen man can experience chronic fatigue low resistance loss of sex drive loss of focus and irritability long-term excessive ejaculation can cause chronic conditions which can cause chronic fatigue mental confusion and significant loss of sexual drive what is your with a freak like that girl will Harris was talking about my friend will houses in here the other day and you say to these girls and go over seat it's also considered harmful to ejaculate when ill drunk or go Gorge with food logic physiological therapeutic benefits to having sex frequent sex intercourse maintains a man interest in the acts as well as his capacity to continue indefinitely until his Partners fully satisfied but don't come I can't please you is it me is it. I just wanted you to be happy how you feel feel good good then I go when I hit the laptop and it just turned once a woman can drop your defences she's no longer attracted to you if she can control you she's not attracted to you a woman wants a man shakes in my book I talked about how women of the apex predator they're the ones that chase after sex I mean they can have sex endlessly right once we not it's like we're pretty much done like give me a couple minutes to recharge but they can keep going so there but just because she's on discipline and her Sexual Energy doesn't mean you have to be and if she feels like she has to go outside of the relationship to go get her fixed that's on her that has nothing to do with you you're at raisins as a man are higher than sex a woman's role is to create life and support them in the man's role is to create the the the the forging the future of of humanity you know building things and innovating it is true that a woman is not attracted to God without this Care Mental Health Care of a girl's lazy she's hot well long as your body holds up and get to the gym I used to make girls work to get me man like you know it's a project spreadsheet over I need you to organize it view front but you know what a partner help you know I want her to prove her worth got to be worthy to get me like you know it's easy to get a girl to easily get him good man some would say that that's so sexist generalization I don't care what you can have that conversation we can talk so objective that it's too dangerous for them to engage with me now so cuz I'll be like it sexist yes and so let's let's continue the conversation and an app where they don't want to go then they're going to have to provide reinforcement evidence and it didn't with an educated man in I'm going to come with my evidence and facts so you don't have a problem being sex if that's a problem is because if someone calls you sexist and you go yeah yeah problem being sexist that's what the problem is because if someone calls you sexist and you go yeah yeah I understand nature I understand myself</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what's an interesting thing I see today that this I find really strange is that people that are denying evolutionary biology mean there's a yeah Decades of research being done why people behave the way they behave what women are attracted to what men are attracted to and what the spectrum is to look at it cuz it doesn't support their ideology all this research deny all these really objective Geniuses they've been studying all the stuff and the best Minds in the field come to these conclusions based on insurmountable amount of data stop worrying about the patriarchy cuz if you handled your matriarchy the patriarchy wouldn't be your problem the problem is you don't have to be a woman what do you think is a good piece of advice for women on how to be a woman a good piece of advice that like women women women emotional control and the number one problem let's go here mocha women let their friends they they tell their friends a business yes stopped at stop telling your friends political to don't know man she wants me to quit my job I don't do that to me man that s*** on me yeah you know so I think women also understand that they're they're giving this information to a friend who is also single when a woman gets in a relationship she loses her friend right cuz now you have less time to spend with your bestie so the best he's jealous of the relationship so whenever you go back and tell her she's never going to give you sound advice. She's always going to take your yep so you have to judge your friends and say woof I'm giving this information my friend is being objective friend or she is subjective friend she's going to feed my ego then you can't analyze that on your own then you'll never have peace in relationship cuz the worst thing to do is hear the problems in relationships built on trust so if a man and a woman come together and you tell all my business to your friend where's the trust where's our privacy we have none a relationship you have a relationship with your friend so go be with your friend I don't got time to be something happens in my personal life going to go tell this strange girl what happened in my personal life something I told you that was Private to related to something else I could be happy in my relationship we have different instincts women of the NSYNC the gossip get a hobby healthy want women don't have hobbies their hobbies are all I consumerism women don't have hobbies all of them all of them be know do something cuz there any advertising you know that their Hobbies become consumerism and retail therapy or you know I do makeup for fun now you don't do makeup for fun that's not what you do that's not a hobby makeup's not a happy I'm sorry ladies a hobby is something that develops your individual person something that makes you better so I'm kind of a disappointment some way to express yourself physical thing that you do ya like so like one of my hobbies is chest right that helps me focus when I when I see that my attention span is getting short cuz I spent too much time at social media I go to chess and I'll spend time on chest to bring that back to reality play physical emergy do regular checks online I do speeches 5-minute games that's impressive yeah yeah it's it's it's a little bit I'll be sleeping and and playing chess conversation in office space out and be doing chest problems in my head so that happens sometimes you know a lot especially on days that I play a lot just remember Howard Stern was really getting into Chesney was taking private lessons he's talked about all the time but I think he found the same thing did you remember that I think you found the same thing I think he just got too obsessed with his like I can't do this anymore okay so you have National Master than you have international master and then you have game master or the GM I forget what it's called National Master you have to participate and I believe one of the 20 minutes one of the get the Federation but you have to answer one of these tournaments near to place a certain and I think it's maybe top two or top three at a certain tournament I don't quote me on this stuff but you have to go through the dorms become National master and the national matching Kobe International if if I'm not mistaken and then you know GM do you ever see the video of Eddie Fisher or Bob Fisher when Bobby Fischer was walking down this row of chess games who's playing different games simultaneously yeah the champ now Carlson do something similar will call soon will play several people or help play without a board that always interested me I've seen people do that yeah I knew who went to prison was playing with with his pool holidays play on White Plains executive Billiards and this kid was a Chess Masters a sixteen-year-old master chess genius rent 16 year old kid and he was playing with his doo-doo was like in his forties who have been in prison he learned how to play chess with no board and prison so there was just sitting across from each other talking in the moves and then they were both like recognized for the pieces were on the board yeah really interesting yeah I mean that that level of visualization is where Humanity has to take itself you know that's why I say chest is great because it allows you to visualize and in order to manifest your desires in this world you have to be able to visualize what you want the more you can focus the more you can visualize the better your mind is I believe our life is based upon visual yeah I women need to get back to that to visualize and gold I think women are are very spiritual so in Africa is this man I'm sleeping a long time ago but the man is holding a child and a woman is pointing up to the sky right and it's like the man is like that Earthly thing like we handle things in the physical and the woman's sort of like that into intuitive being women have to get back to being that intuitive being because you've noticed our women always seem to warn us about stuff right there being happy with just being alone with yourself alone with themselves you know they always need like some sort of device are capable of being alone huge turn-on you to have to get back to that to learn how to pick a good man sometimes y'all are picking crap men based upon the money or things that they have $1,000 in debt what's a loser f*** you and go god dammit yeah yeah I'm sorry lyrics you know what we see it from the outside but the feel it as a woman that's got to be very different and there's a lot of women out there that are looking for a man like a successful man that looking for successful man when they want to talk him something that's like that's the goal is not that's not a goal of men so it's it's very difficult for us to understand that our goal for our goal is to be ourselves unless you know who you are and a lot of people are getting relationships without being in relationship with themselves first so when you know in order to have a sound relationship you have to know is socio-economic stance it's sad when you get into a relationship with a conservative and liberal any I start arguing about Donald Trump in a relationship breaks because he's on one side these are the conversations that you need to have a front and if you don't know where you are politically and socially economically for example they say a lot of relationship break up because of money right and you got one person's a bad spender the other ones Thrifty right these are the conversation you not first how do you manage your money you know are you good with your money you know if you guys don't agree with how you want to pull your resource and how you want to pull your money and what you want to do with it in the future you know some people and you might get a relation with girl just like I want to push you don't want to Land Rover and I'm like business I want a VC you know what I mean so you have two people that going separate directions one going is consumer dependent you know producer route so you have to first see are you okay you need to be so you don't need to know what you want out of life first and then find people connect based upon that not the physical looks and all that other stuff Asian people but you have to know what you want out of life first and then find people connect based upon that not the physical looks and all that other stuff because it's very difficult to attain they see these things they got all that's the that's the prize we know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what do without a UFO guy Bob Lazar Schultz me to call the guy who made the documentary on talking to him maybe I move I had no indication that he's full of s*** I mean I was Zero bulshit meter at when you told a story for as many years as many times as he it's it's super hard to be consistent if you just making everything up it's super hard to to have things that you are saying back then that everybody says don't even exist right eventually turn out to be true very difficult to deny that like he's a part of his initial story his initial story had something to do with this thing called Element 115 which most people he didn't even recognize that it actually existed until much later right that's a big feature of it when did he start talking about it once they're talking about the a long time ago record of them and they tried to deny that they tried to erase it that alone tells me just the fact that they tried to say they didn't exist and never went never worked at Los Alamos did you watch her too bad I didn't see it bro oh my God I mean essentially in so many words I can without divulging too much three brothers are born a triplets are born and their separated-at-birth unbeknownst to them they grow completely independently run into each other later in life in the 70s and they meet publicly on Google one of those f****** Big Show's you don't like they bring them all together and they end up finding out later the documentary spoiler alert that the company who is doing this that's doing trial test on baby that are separated and putting it with different families to find out if they end up growing up with similar characteristics is a nature versus nurture hiccups in the bed and the parents almost didn't even though I don't I'm not sure about it and the other one just felt like while they were getting money for it so they were like this is the part of a program that were in it bro how is that much different than aliens abducting people in that. it has never been released and it should be because it's f***** up a library can't be released to the public and it cannot be released they tried hundreds of times and it's got a 2050 release date of whatever the documentary they're not the only ones there they've done this over and over and over and over for sure I'm does it look there's a lot of other stuff that you got to go I don't know how do you how do you prove that how do you explain that while I don't know what do you believe in the big questions are is education background that was a big one know whether or not he actually was educated at a certain place this is a f***** up one but I can't say what he told me essentially without saying it it had to do with project he was working on currently know at the time I can't say any more than that and now the internet explode I don't know if it's true right whatever he said about all these different things only he knows if it's true when you're talking to a guy Smuggler seems like he's very intelligent and then we talkin about all kinds of different things very intelligent so either he's running to greatest 30 year Khan of all time or maybe this really did happen when you talk to him you just guess it you don't know I don't know I don't know is why I don't know what's real life right just gassing but he seems like a guy who seen some s*** and end just know what to do and told some friends about it and then then went to the news and that's what that George Knapp guy who was the investigative journalist has studied this case over all the years like this has never wavered so I can ship stuff with the story over and over like the equipment they had Los Alamos labs that you talked about where it was this thing that measured the distance are the sides rather of the digits in your finger apparently it's like a great like your fingers that inches are specific and so if you put your hand down that thing that Jamie's hand it would give a different measurement like there's different each bone is a different length in the exact length is of like a 1.7 whatever the f*** it is 1.7 in measurement tool that use it was he was calculating the length of your fingers through some kind of buggy system that he said didn't really work that off the people said that science-fiction it doesn't exist and then they finally a photos of these things and people that worked at Los Alamos labs concluded conceited these were real thing or just a long time they were fighting maybe name of the guys run the craziest con game of all time he's just a Super Genius way smarter than me and trick me and he thinks it's hilarious or maybe he saw some s*** what he was explaining that made it more and more interesting was how compartmentalised it was and about how the problem with being so compartmentalised is that Science is based on free exchange of information you have to have guys are testing something's working on together that's the only way he could do so so he's limited to a couple of guys that work in the propulsion system and then there's a couple other guys that are working on the Metallurgy and a couple other guys at work in the navigation system and they chose him because he was kind of a maniac and you put a f****** jet engine in the back of a Honda and it was on the cover of the Los Alamos newspaper find it said in the article about Bob Lazar with his f****** jet-powered Honda that he was a scientist at Los Alamos lab a physicist So This Is the End happy birthday printed this guy was doing this thing where he said he was living at the time and in the area where Los Alamos was it said in the newspaper that he worked at the lap there's a f****** logbook of employees it's got his name in it from that time a guy had it he showed it it took photos of at the show did everybody look we have an employee log book like this or the employee directory rather Robert Lazar right there so he work there he really did work how could all that mean how can you fabricate talk all the people I work with are scared to talk why you think that looks like a fool the FBI raids his house every call some crazy anyone have anything to do with this the only reason why you want to do my podcast who's want you like wanted one more chance just get it out in a former it's just him talking and he felt like he and I we both talked about if you have me and you talk I just let you talk you tell me what happened and I'll let everybody figure out if it's true I don't know what do you think honestly worst parts of me that said maybe I'm just dumb as a nice guy and he's like really manipulative and maybe he just knows how to tell a story and if anyone can came to, but it's a tricky thing then you can get cocky you can get coffee I feel like you don't get cocky and think that you know that someone's not full of s*** f****** people who are and aren't full of s*** that your meter is higher than most mall so nice so when I'm trying to talk to someone I want I want things to work out well the only benefit of the doubt often want them to have a good time when were talking I don't want to confront people I just even if I angrily disagree with every fiber in my being as I've gotten older and better at it better at talking to people I avoid that kind of conflict but I just don't think it's necessary for you to be like right Master stop Phentermine dangerous times we know someone's full of s*** I'm just times we think you know someone in your wrong and then you know it's like if this whole thing of looking in someone's eye and talk to them sometimes Sumerel Tire sounds like a bro I didn't even know you called me like you mother fuc if this whole thing of looking in someone's eye and talking to them sometimes some will tell you something like that bro I didn't even know you called me like you m*********** like you piece of s*** you didn't know I didn't even see it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we forgive Bill Cosby like to take that the idea that you're supposed to forgive Louis which I think yes and then I don't see a path for Bill Cosby to be forgiven so don't see that path when you ruined the lives of how many people 50 + 1 somethings that heinous I just don't think I think I'd like to have you ruin their life you certainly certainly f*** them up like if you wake up and your with Bill Cosby Sergeant take care of you and your pants are dumb you realize you talk to you while you're unconscious and he drugged you yeah that is going to f*** your head up he's going to change what you think about people that's rank is drug you and treat you like meet your unconscious they're doing things to do when you're out cold and what's our laws are forgiveness well how do you forgive that first of all you can't because you never admit never admits it even gets to the door of like of acceptance of forgiveness of of doing his Penance or what if there is a pennant there's anything you ever he doesn't get the door and will there be room for forgiveness I think you would probably open up the door tomorrow more lawsuits sure I think it would ever come storming in like hell you know right I know what you're saying is very smart as saying like we're saying we were supposed to give someone like forgive someone well what is the line of when you don't forgive what's the line with the number with the line with the atrocity like what is it that we go person anymore what's the whistle line of compassion like where do you where detail line of compassion that I could wear that's what it is what is that ultimate where you go now you can no longer From This Moment forward forgive this human being and the problem is the here's work at Slippery if you decide you're going to be the guy who says I'm going to kill this guy someone that but if you were going to decide how we're going to we're going to remove this guy from the population I can't trust with my kids we live in a primitive Society okay we live in some some Village type Society thousands of years ago right that's what we all did what we do when someone was like that when we probably try to figure out a way to get rid of them what are the laws that allow someone to kill somebody because people kill people history whether it's the Mongols the Romans that give me just go throughout history people people f****** kill people cuz they could kill people so when do you what the what is the moral distinction that you have to make where someone is div done irreparable harm but that changed over time right right. And I continually changes that that is like that will never stop changing from from from Google Now will not be deplorable later and I seen so many aspects of our culture is literature movies so what we're saying is is there ever a line is there ever a loan does it ever exist Does that idea of like this is the cutoff does that really good cuz it's constantly moving constantly changing a million times I've never said what we did was okay I think he has his I don't think anybody else but I also think everybody needs to investigate what happened and find out what social psychology what he was going to be but but what I think is happening to is that a lot of women feel like when these guys that are abused as got taken out that it made it so that it was better for women and so that if when these guys that are abusers got taken out that it made it so that it was better for women and so that if they come back then go back to where they work this is a real that's real thought you know he's but we must have conversation conversation then we're f*****</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> go to throw stones always glass house they always do it that the first person to throw something in the first person that's like what's really going on with you play by the way by the way by the way tweeted about it and people went after him he tweeted best moment of my years or something like that you know what someone said to me people lost it send it you know hey f*** you Joe Rogan he sexually assaulted women like man that's why I understand that people are upset about what he did but he did not sexually assault women and to say that the one the one the one group of people that it really f**** his people have been actually sexually assaulted yes when it's not what he does not good when a guy says can I jerk off in front of you and you say yes and he does it is a big this big Tim Sheehan. And sexual assault and contrary to popular opinion and how many people really know the story and again not saying we did was good we did was definitely not good when people said no he didn't do it sound like he made people do it at the lion say yeah right store Lee's not change his story but he says their stories were true but in their stories I don't think he wanted to defend every single aspect of it but as far as I know he didn't know one said no and they did anyway that's what I thought that's all I've ever heard in Sarah Silverman talked about how he would ask her and she would say yes and he would do it sometimes bad as people want to believe yes I think you made mistakes like a human and I don't and I don't think it was good and again I don't think he's happy about it at all and bite everything that's a giant understatement but when does it end like why is he allowed to perform when is he allowed to perform for people who forgive him when when is he allowed to perform I don't know who the conversation comes to a point where it's not like you're endorsing Behavior but you are saying at a certain point in time you got to give someone a way out because if you don't then they start to recognize what you are right can your kind of retirement and your kind of saying you don't believe in forgiveness you don't believe in Improvement you don't believe in anybody ever getting passed up a bad deed they did and I think I guess a human who's a country try to be a kind person could be a fair person you know you got to you got to let people grow and move past mistakes I don't know when it is I don't know why Friday in order to get you to forgive it but the fact that people dwell on it and unless it's someone unless you and him have a personal thing and you want to talk to him about it he should certainly don't know if he has don't know if you've done any of that stuff but I think as a culture we are way too quick not just to condemn but to attack and to continue to attack relentlessly and didn't ever want somebody get up and that's not the sign for compassionate person and May partly to blame for people who don't express themselves and don't give you a full version of who they are and you let people contemplate who you are I think anyone in the public has been guilty that to some extent but this is a significant issue and I think that people immediately start taking sides and they start going girl versus boy right male versus female and I think there's a real danger and I splitting up like that too I think that I get to this place where women feel like they can't trust men and men feel like you can't trust women just universally and then you find rare exceptions it like that before like straight white male is trash unless proven otherwise it's like live I know it must be hard broad you're broadcasting it to your 16000 followers you putting that on your Twitter page entire group of humans ever ever ever good luck I have all daughter jerking off in front of them when I really don't want it sorry about that last summer I didn't mean to do that unfortunately the real problem the real issue is that he was in a position with these girls were admiring him right that's the real in IRS I don't think he's explained it to some people's what they desire you know some people's requirements and I appreciate that and I understand that I really just think what a lot of us are missing is this a real lack of communication and compassion and understanding anytime someone to talk about people are serial killers I'm just talking about people make mistakes you got to treat we're all human beings people making stuff doesn't mean you're a canceled person you got to stop with that I really I really think that right I just think that it's not helping anybody and it's getting people's jollies off cuz I watch someone crashdown they have people love to watch someone f****** burn that was also thinking that also when this kind of stuff happens people don't want to ever reconsider their opinion on a person I'm going to stop at that I really I really think that right as I just think that it's not helping anybody and it's getting people's jollies off cuz I watch someone crashdown they have people love to watch someone f****** burn also thinking that also when this kind of stuff happens people don't want to ever reconsider their opinion on a person</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> weird cuz I thought that he would be a guy that would want Julian Assange out talking out of both sides of his mouth he said how many times during the campaign Trail Wikileaks Wikileaks on Fox and Friends back in the day so scary that I mean it's under that it's beyond the pale because now you're not just Prosecuting whistleblowers with the Espionage Act you actually Prosecuting Publishers that's like a whole level of a direct assault on the First on journalism incomprehensible how much the world has changed and what we are aware of because of WikiLeaks Revolutions in the past 10 years I mean even just the phone that I just made Gaza fights for freedom and I by side of WikiLeaks cable about how Israel wanted Hamas to win and Gaza and they said that they were strategizing for that to happen to them they can regard us as a hostile territory and then just relentlessly bomb them that was because of WikiLeaks I found that out because of that money I can't believe what is going on because people I didn't I don't think that people really knew that Trump would take these powers and becomes so authoritarian with them will is what's disturbing to me is WikiLeaks used to be something that people on the left would cite as evidence that the military was out of control for the military industrial complex Central then because they feel like somehow or another Wikileaks was involved in helping Trump they became a Russian mouthpiece and Anna traitor means it like the left over last few years in particular since the distance 2016 Wikileaks has been sort of read sort of redefined their conflating Julian assange's personal politics and I don't know what those are I know that he had those private dams with Trump jr. which looked bad but what do you say to you know we need your tax returns don't think of us as like a biased organization and it and it would look good and kind of like you know a little too buddy-buddy with Trump jr. but it does not take away from the importance and you know validity of what Wikileaks is as an organization so I'm very kaushal people just really don't like Julian Assange as a person and it doesn't matter how much you hate Julian Assange this is completely Beyond The Pale what's going on to him and it's it's he needs to be defended his rights need to be defended and very few people are defending him that just got unveiled with the Trump Administration they're trying to extradite him to the US of course and he'll just be sitting in a Cell for the rest of his life if he doesn't face the death penalty but the charges have nothing to do with the 2016 election at all with the massacre the collateral was in jail for releasing to him and so they just trumped up all these charges based on I'm publishing war crimes and that's really what this is publishing war crimes and embarrassing the US Empire what is the what are they saying what are they calling it like what is the the actual saying that he helped Chelsea Manning hack into I forget it's like some sort of charge that it's basically concocted they're saying that you helped Chelsea Manning basically release the information to him and that's how he's part of the conspiracy it's total b******* completely concocted he he's a political prisoner and he needs to be free and it's absolutely astounding of the Trump Administration is doing this and that people are going to be people applauding this it's it's weird how people used to defend him and now no longer to do and nothing really has changed in terms of what he's actually done it was a traumatic election and people's reptile brain got activated hardcore and they think everything is Russia and they think Julian Assange is Russia and I think anyone who's talking about what u.s. foreign policy is Towing the Russian line about what u.s. foreign policy is Towing the Russian Line Towing the Kremlin line if not about the people who control this government at the dark evil forces behind your friends and family and the people who are talking about sowing Discord and s*** and that's it's a disturbing time because it's hard to relate and actually had these discussions with people</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> who makes sense to use Bernie makes sense Bernie is my guy bring his my guy through-and-through and I'll tell you why because a we need Medicare for all we need to abolish student debt and not s*** you just tax Wall Street gambling done medicare-for-all cut the military budget done I don't want to live in a country where people are rationing insulin I don't live in a country where half of the GoFundMe campaigns are because people are going to die if they don't get donations for healthcare what is wrong with this country but back to Bernie I mean you the last 30 years of political advocacy this is a guy who's been saying the same thing for 30 straight years no matter if it's veterans rights about Gulf War syndrome about just a political revolution is needed I mean he's been talking about that since he won the senate seat initially and you can't really say the same thing about any other candidate and I do like what Tulsi gabbard is saying and I do like some of the things Elizabeth Warren saying that it seems like she's just making it up on the Fly and adopting kind of burning light policies and I think this is all strategy to siphon all the delegates away from Bernie because we already know this Third Way corporate Wall Street funded organization that's like corporate Democrats have said they want anyone but Bernie Bernie is the biggest threat to the establishment by far what's hilarious amazed is a Pocahontas racist it's a f****** Disney movie How Could Pocahontas be race really really screwed up I have 200 times more African than she is Native American from one point to eat jobs saying she was Native American I mean yeah it it's one thing to say I have Native American blood it's another thing I don't know how much you know ancestry Native American ancestry she has but I do know that she was you know that was unlike her Harvard bio and all the stuff and it's just like what is going on what is going on he thought he was a lot of people thought he was my wife thought she was my wife. She was part native American so she got a DNA done to people would like they wanted to be spiritual they would say they are part native American they want to be extra cool and well my Native American blood it's like some weird thing I remember in high school like when kids wanted to be cool they would say they are part native American pow-wow know the Native American Community came out this does not make you native Native is much more than like whatever percentage of your blood I mean Native is a you know the way of life that it's a culture and it was really kind gross the whole thing was just bizarre was gross's even after the testing she was trying to use that as proof that she was correct and then people analyze the data look are you f****** quitting off small this percentages this is an insanely small percentage she was saying that Trump need to give her a million dollars because of the fact that is it take the test like it was insulting to the native Community it was embarrassing all around and it was also just weird that she even did it at the behest of trump like why did you do that I got you I got you had she had to do it because he kept saying it over and over and over I feel like she's a politician and I say that in the most unflattering of terms I feel like she's one of those people that just says what needs to be said in order to get elected in the Middle East and who's the congresswoman from Hawaii I want to do good I mean I really do think that's what she said she doesn't take any corporate money not who she wants this she wants this job because she thinks she can do a better job than what has been done before in the other people that are running for it I really believe who she makes sense to me what you think about Bernie I like a lot of things Bernie says I mean there's a lot of you know criticisms of people Lobby against him what I like about him socially is that what he is standing for is the downtrodden he's standing for the people that are dead don't catch a good break when he starts talking about things like income inequality on okay I understand what you're doing and why you're saying what is the cause of income inequality what we need to find out we need to find out what the like why why are these poor communities the way they are and what that needs to be helped that needs to be fixed there's so much that can be done that's not being done and right at least he seems to be he seems to be calling out to the people that are ignored that are being served by Wall Street right big problem is and wages stop going up with inflation and then credit subsidized all of the wages and that's why people are just indebted to crap credit card companies were you know up to our ears in debt and that he does talk about that any talks about the solutions to that but you're totally right I mean what other candidate of these 25 people are discussing things that are going to reach like a populist you know how the populist management and a businessman and he's warning everyone he's he's like the f****** Paul Revere of automation he's liking to look artificial honey and we can actually figure out a way to get through this and there's a bridge that we can make it through this Universal income Universal basic income you can develop a bridge where you can give people their basic needs food Water Shelter give them food like make sure that no one starving that we even know people jobs make sure their needs are met so then they can go and find a way through this mess and then figure out a way to contributed make an income and makeup make a living and adjust but to have nothing to have nothing like what what is that like right you can't just have people out of work because of Automation and people go back to the Industrial Age way that happened during this and that and yeah okay but it didn't work out well for all those f****** people that lost those jobs back then we shouldn't have to go to that massive chaotix equation again if there's a way to engineer a better way through it I don't know if Universal basic income works you know I've talked to a lot of people to think like he was on my podcast recently and his perspective is it doesn't give people meaning and it's not a good idea cuz you need a life if you want people to be happy and you want to be able to do something they need to have meaning in their time and what they do just to give people money is not going to make people happy and I think it's a Band-Aid yeah I think it's a Band-Aid with the concept that Yang proposes about Ubi but yeah I think that if we give people like Healthcare in and have their basic needs met than that it's going to give them the ability and then like to maneuver to find their passion and be able to have that space where they can fulfill their lives yes I think there's a way to do both there's a way to find meeting and have your needs kept I mean the ideas that I don't think that people should get free money to the point are they could live a full rich life and go on vacations and and have a nice card and Icehouse never have to work again it doesn't make any sense you should you should contribute right everyone should contribute but if you're in a job it's going to be completely annihilated by Automation and artificial intelligence it makes sense that as a community as a culture we should figure out a way to give people money so they can have a place to live and food and then try to come up with and sort of engineer some sort of a program to help people find new ways of income new ways of making women I don't know what that would be you know when and when I talked to Tulsa about that she didn't know what that would be either this idea of trying to promote new job people say that we're going to we're going to create new jobs I hate that expression like what is that mean if there's not a job still look at it I would have to guard it and that's what Bernie keep saying he's like I'm literally in stating an economic Bill of Rights that FDR did a hundred years ago why am I considered Rattata radical extremist when I'm just trying to give people basic economic rights and trying to propose jobs to rebuild this country I'm literally in stating an economic Bill of Rights that FDR did a hundred years ago why am I considered ratted a radical extremist when I'm

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> if you look at all those high-profile assassinations and that are I think a lot of them are Highly Questionable I mean it it doesn't just stop at JFK we're talking about RFK I don't believe that story at all Martin Luther King you know I mean there's really really sketchy things about all of them and if we were conducting to see I was conducting basically an assassination program around the world to expedite u.s. foreign policy and imperialism why would we not have been doing that here at you know I mean we know that Fred Hampton was killed outright that the leader of the Black Panther Party so all of these things are kind of make more sense when you look back at history and see how kind of out of control the CIA was at that time I mean it only makes sense that they would want to get rid of certain characters that were causing trouble Mike Baker on from who used to worked was a CIA operative and he looked into the JFK Ortiz me the Martin Luther King assassination and he said that one more than a either one of you looked into seems like something was really cool James Earl Ray was like a loser until like the Shifty got and then before the assassination all the sudden he had money all the sudden he would do like he was it look like he was being steered and remember all the details but he was shaking his head about his like that one out of anyone that I looked into had the Fingerprints of manipulation on it government had to have been involved for the circumstances to have happen the way they did and if you look at how Martin Luther King at the time was considered the most dangerous quote-unquote negro in the country that's what the government was saying about him I mean he was hated he was loaded he was trying to basically adamant Like A Poor People's campaign to occupy DC to get poor people economic rights that was a that was a really really threatening I think the establishment at that time also you know it's hard for us when we're thinking back about that era mean we weren't really I mean I was almost born 67 you were born laughter that it wasn't you wouldn't understand that era that's 100 years after slavery doesn't hundred persons like person's life that when you look at it now I mean Juneteenth they have the Congressional hearings they're talking about reparations and you see just the the the different polarized Ides of how people look at it even today whether or not reparations should be given a whether or not there should be any any sort of effort to rectify the obvious if you look at the the economic Strife that's in these Southern cities that are primarily African-American that you're really From Slavery me this is literally the remanence of slavery and it's never been fixed it's almost like any other problem that we DNR infrastructure and other problem that would be in anything with no pollution or anything else that people clearly did or someone getting f***** it up there's efforts made to fix it and I had discussions about this is so much resistance we had nothing to do with this because it was more than a person ago why should we have anything to do with what slavery did and it's beyond that how's your mentioned I mean this is an institutionalized racism that we still see the effects of very shortly within the prison Community within I mean all these things and he said we were still paying out Civil War soldiers families pensions decades after that so like why why do that but not actually try to you know provide some economic Justice to the black community just a weird conversation because it's not just a conversation about whether or not something wrong was done but it's also a racial conversation like I've seen some weird post like you know Chuck Woolery the guy who's from the love connection will right back into into never that guy about reparations for Union Soldiers for their families that died so he was a many more warlike it was like how about these people and then like not say a motherfuking people who like brought over here from Africa machines and their great-grandchildren are alive today in the same communities as the basis of our capitalist Society because it was predicated on the enslavement of Africans don't know if you can fix it by giving people money today but I do think the money should be spent to try to fix those communities think that can be engineered to done and I don't hear anybody talk about it other than Tulsi gabbard talks about it and I think Bernie Sanders inmate has made some indications that something should be done although I don't know if anybody has like a real definitive plan but when you talk to people that have like Michael Wood who is a Baltimore Police Officer told the story before but it's crazy story he when he was a cop in Baltimore they found these papers that show at the exact it was paper from the 1970s the exact same crimes in the exact same areas in the exact same problem areas they were dealing with in the seventies or dealing with in 2008 was like what the fuc like that feeling like you are your police officer right you're putting your life on the line literally and you're out there dealing with the same problems that existed in the same exact areas and no one's ever done anything to fix that feeling like here you are your police officer right you're putting your life on

with the deplatforming it's really scary it's really really scary what happened it is scary to me because the internet in my eyes is this unique place where people can get information and distribute information and then on top of that you have this almost parasitic entity that is allowing you to destroy information and gather information through it but also controlling the flow of information and then controlling the flow and its own ideological Bend like wouldn't it to touch sort of match its own ideas of what should and shouldn't happen I think they feel justified by having a guy like Trump in office having a guy like Trump come into office then what we have to do something about that so what we're going to do Serena silence conservative voices are going to silence cancer pundits are going to silent call people all right and just change our algorithms to make it much more difficult for them to get propagate for them to propagate their ideas I just find that really distressing because I think that in the the marketplace of ideas you you're supposed to be able to combat a bad idea with a better idea and this is how we this is how ideas of all this is how people get to communicate you get to look at what saying look at someone how someone's dissecting with someone saying and then for yourself figure out what you believe what you don't believe and there should be a free exchange of information so that you can figure that out and when you show when someone shown to be a bad actor or a liar or should have deceptive news fake news whatever you want to call it okay now we know and this is a clear example that so now take it with a grain of salt whenever they say anything about anything else when you D plan for them and shove them aside to say see they're trying to sign that's cuz they don't believe us or are they don't they don't want us to be in power because they're trying to prop up whatever left-wing socialist economy that their dictator that they want to put into place and it's this weird sort of situation where you've got people dictating and almost engineering our culture right curating our reality we know what's going on with alphabet the parent company of Google where they are the essential is setting up blocks and they're putting cameras in these places and they're Gathering data and information in the trying to engineer Utopian city yeah I was reading about it yesterday and I was like no terrible ideas so I don't want to be filmed don't want information gathered about them like they're still doing it under the guise of here it is alphabets plan for Toronto depends on huge amount data yeah we need more data collection date of my name their idea is that they're going to make it easier for people to get around and smooth are how we show recognition I love how they always say old people are being sex trafficked and this will help it's like no dude this is like Point zero-zero-zero 1% of all the people that you're no data mining so sidewalk slabs released more detailed plans for Toronto the site of Google sister company's first attempt to bring its techify did digital forward Sensibility full scale development project the sidewalk slab sidewalk Labs projects dates to 2017 when the Canadian city welcome the company to an undeveloped section of its waterfront now after 18 months of speculation work 1524 page master plan for the 1212 acre lot called quayside what weighs more volume plan highlights ambitious and sometimes flashy Innovations from sidewalk Labs which is played Pontius been 1.3 billion on the project if it goes for the compuhost to construct all the buildings with Timber which it says his better for the environment also catches fire and build an underground pneumatic pneumatic tube system for garbage removal he wants residents to lean on public transit walking and biking rather than personal vehicles good luck it's f****** 02 Ronnie assholes and plans to build streets with autonomous vehicles perhaps when sister company waymo listen with Neil waymo is now delivery robot to Mike trundle down it's white sidewalks at your strategic use of large very large umbrella like coverings might make outdoor spaces comfortable all year round no small feat and Lakeshore Canada sidewalks sidewalk wants to designate 20% of its of the apartments to as a fordable and now 20% as middle-income engineering people who are really just openly social justice Warriors I mean these are the people that censored that James D'Amore guy and then fired him for having this memo I will that really kind discussed women intact based on evolutionary biology based on studies and they they said that he was highlighting there harmful gender stereotypes of his is not true not accurate fuel he said we actually rope you had a page-and-a-half dedicated in that memo trying to come up with strategic way to encourage women to get into technology the study that do that the paper that James D'Amore rope has no relation to the way he's been framed in the way people talk about him as a direct result of Google and Graves social justice Warrior sort of ethos like the way they operate as a company pretends to be McShay birthday on Google I think that there a giant Corporation they have billions offshore tax Havens and they are not liberal they they appear to be liberal because that's cap when you're trying to basically add app to where Society is out and you want to pretend like you are socially conscious but when you look at their actual policies their conservative as f*** I mean they actually fund a lot of crazy like Coke brother Alec they fund a lot of right-wing organizations the Federalist Society they've given huge grants to so I think they're kind of playing both sides deregulation industry so I think that all of the perception in the mall Google and YouTube and Nino catering to like the social Consciousness and and you know what you're talking about I think it's honestly just to make more money while sure they're going to make more money in the process of doing this but the idea that they're going to engineer a city to me is terrifying. I just don't I don't like it you know there was a great podcast that Sam Harris did with a guy who's explaining what Google is essentially done and what they've done with data the day is essentially a commodity that we didn't know was a commodity we all gave up all rights this commodity and this commodity turns out is worth billions and billions of dollars and no one had any idea and they just took it and now they have it and they have it and what are they giving you the right to let you search things like what am I giving you for the email build patio chairs to send an email really really creepy or just talk about something and it just said yeah yeah yeah yeah he was talking about trading in his car and he got a f****** text message a text message that said hey I hear you're looking to trade in your car so you know here here's a here's a link as to what you could get for it because I'm not cooking that f****** link like a text message with a link showed up because of something he was talking about Stephen Hawking on the phone that's what I crazy really really scary it's f****** insane I know that's terrifying laptop ads set interactive like not giving up your data is one of the reasons why I still use an iPhone support apple apple goes out of their way to not share your data when you use maps that's why Apple men suck its route Google right so you just automatically use it but Google and Google and all of it going back to this whole like text censorship thing they preemptively change the Albert that's it so scary to me is that there wasn't even a law you know like China we aren't we all know that China censors the internet we've done the same thing here but people just think that we still have no information that we can all access all these things no I mean Google change the algorithms day Backpage doll this Progressive media Independent Media so it wasn't just about what they're saying it's about him in this this was targeted to basically all extreme views everything that they felt like was too radical I mean going back to the dni report which is where this all started from this kind of conclusive report they said the 17 intelligence agencies you know here's here's all the evidence of how Russia colluded in and caused the election for Hillary they cited my show on Breaking Dawn Breaking the Set you did it. They said I was part of the conspiracy of Russian meddling and when you look at what all this is sowing Discord all of these are the Black Box algorithm from Hamilton 68 dashboard like this US government funded Twitter Waller. Just like determines what's Russian propaganda what's fake news and then you have you know Facebook working with the Atlantic Council which is an organization's stacked with literal Spooks cops CIA heads and defense contractors UAE u.s. government that's who's like curating our reality now and it's all about expunging the most radical views on the internet to prop up essentially the system in the establishment and and that's why I know it's not a liberal or conservative thing it's literally just extra thought and radical thought that challenges that the status quo because sowing Discord just means disagreement that's what they said this was about these websites so Discord Joan I mean I thought that was a fundamental thing about American democracy is that you talk about what we disagree on and when you look at what the report says of what Breaking the Set covered DMG cuz I talked about things like inequality in and Occupy Wall Street in Hillary Clinton that was all part of this Grand conspiracy to sow Discord on behalf of the Russian government so it becomes very comical once you you know kind of poke at the underlined narrative driving this way are you aware play talked about things like inequality in and Occupy Wall Street in Hillary Clinton that was all part of this Grand conspiracy to sow Discord on behalf of the Russian government so it becomes very comical once you know kind of poke at the underlined narrative driving this way but are you aware</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> deal with that at RT but what do you think happens when someone is a pundit and they're on a television show and they're talking about something that has Global implications do you think they get talking points do you think they're allowed to express their own personal opinions or are they informed that they're supposed to do a certain line like I think there's a varying levels I think that it would be naive to say okay these people are paid to lie I think that the vast majority of people working in media are lackeys for the Empire they really truly believe that you know they believe that America is the greatest country in the world they believe that where the world's policemen they actually believe that these countries are evil and they need to be taken out too and stay kind of global hegemony I truly believe that they cater to the line of American exceptionalism and that's pretty sad but also pretty dangerous because they're the perfect mouthpieces for US foreign policy I mean that they sent to your stenographers for whatever the government is which is really disturbing because the premise of Journalism is to actually challenge power and challenge the US government especially when you are working in America are an American citizen and there's all this destruction going on from on behalf of your government and you're not challenging that especially when it's War claims especially when you have assholes like John Bolton claiming all these things are happening in these channels and and bodies of water and people are just like okay I mean God damn you should see when f****** Mike Pompeo was Hezbollah was in Venezuela and these people just just printed it there like wall has blossomed Venezuela now it's like what are you talkin about you're literally just printing what the Trump Administration saying without even questioning these claims it's disturbing do you think that the people that are talked about on TV or just saying it because the really don't understand what you're talking about in this just seems to be a way to cover the subject in sort of a way that is acceptable to the network and acceptable to the party and acceptable to this sort of ID out with her left or right with it whatever ideology there they're participating in there is definitely that as well where they know kind of the line that they can't cross or individually believe you know you think that climate change is an existential threat you think that the war in Yemen is a serious thing that you should address I think that you definitely get kind of Knocked Down in the editorial meeting before you're just like okay play I can't do that but what I can't do is just you know talk about whatever that's what's so weird advertisers will agree with in this day and age there's not like a really respected independent source of news right that you've got you some the online stuff which is this some online stuff is very good but some online stuff is so entangled with insults and and and b******* and emotions and distorted perceptions and ego that it's like it's sort of discredits whatever they're trying to promote when it whatever ideas are trying to get across there's no Walter Cronkite there's no there's no one person who or no one organization who you emphatically trust with their perspective on the news everything is either left or right everything is like flavored by an ideology a place that I go to that I know I can get clear unbiased emotion free objective analysis of any International issue democracy now and the only reason a left-wing right-wing leaning but you think this is the problem with capitalism yeah that you need funding and and you need funding from like donors and Grassroots sources because once you get funded by these right-wing billionaires and corporations and states and governments then it becomes very ideologically-driven and then you're kind of just catering toward what those interest want you to present and I that's why the Empire files does what it does it's we're basically based on donations now because Trump sanctions on Venezuela shut down to show a year ago so we did a big donation drive and that's crazy patreon we are on GoFundMe and just PayPal but we're just trying to survive on a very minimal budget because I don't want to take you know I don't want to like Lobby to corporations or states or or go that route because I don't want to I don't want to answer to anyone other than myself but then you just come to the whole host of problems you're not getting your message out there I mean that's why it's Incredibles for you to have me on but that's why the fake news Mantra resonated so much the Trump campaign because people are extremely disillusioned with the corporate media New York Times Washington Post these so-called Beltway Publications that pretend to be like the arbitrators of our objective reality they they are the premier Advocates of fake news when it comes to US foreign policy in American exceptionalism and corporations in like the corporate line they're always the ones Towing the things that basically prop up the system Towing the things that basically prop up the system and so I think people you know became really really just attracted to that whole fake news Mantra that Trump was saying because people have an extreme distrust in the corporate media because of the Iraq War because of all these things that have happened</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Beto not calling better anymore his name is Robert Robert Robert actually has a really great idea Joe he wants to tax non military families to pay for veterans Health Care pay for veterans Yaz not nice so punish the people who don't want to join the military very smart people who make the weapons influence the politician the military industrial complex how much money they're really making and saying hey look at you guys you made x amount of billions of dollars and look at all these guys that you know we have we have two fun we have to rely on Charities and we have to go and things like the Wounded Warrior Project and all these foundations that are taking care of these veterans when you're the one for property and yeah I mean that that's where the money we had that situation where a Dick Cheney who's the CEO of Halliburton was giving Halliburton no-bid contracts to go over and fix places that we bombed that's like what that is like a doctor breaking people's legs so he can fix them and he was openly talking about how we cannot stop that hundred and ten billion dollar weapons deal and then you should see the just the Glee on these people's faces I mean it was just it's just unbelievable how transparent it is that was a weird conversation Steve my friend but it's up but he was interviewing Trump and they were talking about the militant Trump was openly discussing how these people want to go to War II military industrial complex wants to go to war I mean Trump saying that you know he didn't want everything to do with this but that they want to go to war and so I could I get see Trump as a weird guy cuz he's a loose cannon that he says s*** like that that you don't mama would keep it is cards you know what height is cards but Trump hate him or love him he gives you glimpses that you're not going to get as far as like what kind of influence does the military industrial complex really have on policy change and in decision-making and whether or not they take action and he was openly discussing it to remove the mask because he talking out of both sides of his mouth I kind of stuff but on the other hand I mean heyerdahl the most rabid war generals and also just John Bolton I mean come on this is like a maniacal neoconservative who he was born so it's like if you don't want war with Iran graduated when you stop the fire at the last minute before it erupts and takes over the whole planet and that's what would happen if we actually did bomb Iran I think that people don't understand how precarious the situation is that Trump and these cronies have laid out not just is but came so close to being body oil tankers and I'd be the first one to put my body on the line there's a lot of people that were saying this seems like the Gulf of Tonkin to her like I do this at all there so many people that were like really kind of credible people who are openly saying this stinks like it just seems staged it so it seems like some some why would they do that why would I do false flag going on over and over and over again they're just trying so hard because they want to provoke Iran to the point where Iran will be forced to respond in this is after suffocating asphyxiating sanctions that has a better cost in people's lives and what is it for the folks around that I haven't been paying attention to this what is it that makes them want to go to war with Iran so we have to just look at what Iran it is I mean Iran just won its independence less than a hundred years ago and you know an Arab and a wave of anti-colonial struggles and we immediately the MI6 as well as he CIA instigated a coup so we always talk about how we want you democracy they had democracy they had a revolution of people's Revolution that was overthrown we overthrew Mohammad mossadegh and stated a absolute monarchy for decades and at the time it had the highest human rights abuses documented in the world it was pretty unique in that sense and you know you can only imagine why Iran is the way it is today and there was such a suppression of the left and of the Communist Party in Iran that the Islamic revolutionary Revolution happen in the diet who was the leader of that political movement and that's why Iran has the political system it has today but it's about the oil man it's always about the oil and it's always about the foreign domination of the region they hate that Iran is an independent country and doesn't bow down to u.s. imperialism and US capitalism and Iran also is allies with a lot of states that is real in the US and Saudi Arabia do not want it to be allies with you and the Hezbollah Hamas and so that's that's a big problem for the US and it's getting in the way of a lot of kind of goals in the region but it's really fascinating when you look at what actually happened because you know the nuclear deal was amazing it was huge Trump keeps belaboring the fact that Iran should not have nuclear weapons they didn't have nuclear weapons they never did and they were agreeing to never have them that was what the whole Iran nuclear deal but Trump just immediately rescinded that slapped insane sanctions on and now you know what sanctions every month just continuing to constrict their economy and even basically sanctions on threatening sanctions on China and India and other countries that actually do deals with Iran now to which is totally insane so once you do that and then you say you know you're hitting yourself you're hitting yourself why are you doing this it's like no you're doing this to them and on top of that John Bolton keeps saying you know there's all these unique threats coming from Iran we need to surround them with all these warships and they keep sending thousand more troops thousand more troops to your new position now and now the Drone right we're flying a drone into Iranian airspace and expecting that they're not going to shoot that down why the fuk are we flying a drone in Iran Iran food in here I mean it's just unbelievable the chauvinism in arrogance of the US to be doing all this s*** and then be like okay now you guys are belligerent threat we have to do something it's like know you guys are the ones in circling them and closing all of their you know basically just encapsulating their entire territory and threatening them over and over and over again basically hoping for something to happen and if you look back at the Gulf of Tonkin there was a guy who was actually on the USS Maddox the ship that was eventually attacked and got us into the war with Vietnam and he even said my dad was on the ship and he said we had no idea why we were there and one of the generals or captains on the ship just said they want us to be hit they wanted to attack so they can get into that they want to get into and that's exactly what's going on and what's sad is whoever's in the Navy Circle in Iran they're going to be the one to f****** die when you run does launch back they're sacrificing themselves for these generals and defense contractors profits know there's some reason to believe that Iran is not being honest about its nuclear program right I mean that was one of the reasons why it wasn't that what was the virus that the United States sucks at the stuxnet virus that they put on the Iranian nuclear program to kill it we're in the middle of doing whatever they do to uranium centrifuge I mean yeah. That was all so crazy it's cyber-attacks right attacks worth it effective do in stopping the nuclear program that was like a secret nuclear program that they were doing I don't know what exactly they I don't think that there ever was a nuclear program but I know that that was another crazy thing that the US did was basically inspect their thing and destroy all of this technology I mean basically all we need to know is that they agreed to not develop nukes and it was all agreed from the International Community and then from gets in there and just unravels at all and it's so dangerous because Iran would make a rock look like child's play joke and a full-blown War because I wanted to save lives all over the world why didn't you want to congratulate yourself because somehow he's still kind of appealing to this like non-interventionist line which is just fake to me because you don't appoint the most rabid war-hungry people to surround you and to carry out these policies if you don't want that to a certain extent where people were complaining that he didn't do anything people are upset that he was going to take action he didn't there was even though drown yeah about the Drone in about the attacking the oil tankers and that he was ready to launch then he didn't and what wasn't one of the fox guys it was talking about the consequences of taking no actions like Brian Kilmeade or one of those guys media is insane but whenever there's some sort of involvement they always want him to bomb and go to war it's pretty shocking I mean I guess not too shocking talk this Administration from the right whenever there's some sort of military involvement they always want him to bomb and go to war it's pretty shocking I mean I guess not too shocking when you realize the corporate media is literally subsidized by like oil companies and Banks and defense contractors</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now one of things has happened to you that has allowed people to discredit you was there's obviously been some sort of an effort to erase your past some sort of in an effort to erase your education history your employment history at Los Alamos in fact the only way your employment history was proven at Los Alamos if someone got a list a directory of the employees from the past and read into it and you were on that list to approve the workday even though people night and they were trying to use that as a way to discredit your that you never did work at Los Alamos you weren't real what was what was that like to experience men of course we're talking about the 1980s or 1990s when you could get away with something like that obviously there are a lot less allows records on computers at that time it was still file cabinets and folders George Knapp was the first one that uncovered that I mean he saw my birth certificate disappear he disappeared yeah it was no record of you being there was there was no record of that there was a model record his mom tells me about that like it was frightening for her he's got a real family you know he's real person is frightening for her but even the Los Alamos thing really surprised me and that they was so adamant that are the letters on the wall yeah I mean it was ridiculous but fortunately somebody came up with a 1982 phone book directory I mean and also originally I told you you know when I work there I was on the front page of the paper so they were still able to Archive you know brake bring that back from the archives and working here at Los Alamos oh there was at least something there but somehow George came up with the the phone directory didn't Bob took George with cameras into Los Alamos oh yeah we'll go in we'll meet people and George went with me and the Machine that was able to read the the size of your digits now this is back in the 80s and this is back in the eighties where when you discuss this people like this doesn't even exist yeah what was it away before fingerprint scanners and you know it and anything of anything any high-resolution scanner that time so what it was was a device that had a little picture of a hand on a glass plate with pins in it so you could Jam your hand in there and there was a bright light above it and a sensor underneath can you put your hand in there the light would turn on and it would measure the bones in your finger because the light Shone through your bones and apparently the length of the bones in your fingers are extremely unique and easy to measure and they use that when you put your hands on their the light would turn on in your badge would pop out there's a truth that's that's it and I tried to describe this to people and they said that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard I said hey that's my badge came out of that thing I put my hand on it badge popped out and that's how I could open the doors and get into S4 and you know it and everybody discredited that they said it was bullshiting saw his science-fiction and Jeremy you found this I found it through a good friend of mine in Tyler rogoway and he had some good sources inside of Area 52 where they also use these for the stealth program right around that time so now I've got all these people that worked with in who you know said if you're in certain programs would we use this technology is kind of s*** actually didn't keep it for very long beginning of Biometrics so I was able to reveal it in my film I kept my mouth shut until I showed it to Bob you know the movie is first time he saw it was how you seen the documentary that's his genuine reaction see if he's telling the truth that's how I started the people yeah so yeah so to me it has a personally I get emails every day and people are tell me where these are used and how to use and send me photos of a lot of photos by Danny Matteson were used how they were you inviting another country but yeah that technology was used so what's so funny is that this technology even in the area 52 or they use them for Tonopah one of the guy two will go on camera when he will do an interview with me he was a technician for one of these at any hated them cuz they were really bad they always broke down and never and he was a technician form that he won't tell me where if he worked at Area 52 so it's probably Tonopah it's very separated Yvonne base but yeah so there was that there is your education record that was also like what happened with that well that disappeared also you know I've never gone I've never gone anywhere for Education I've never gone I never attend any classes at Caltech I never attended anything at MIT you did at 10 classes in those places I did attend classes in those place do you know anybody that you went to school with that is I do and have they verified that they went to school with you while I gave Jeremy some names but yeah the reason I don't say these names publicly is because every single time I meant name somebody gets in gay don't want to be yours yeah yeah of course but what what is that experience like seeing your birth certificate erased seeing your employment is frightening it's it's absolutely fine it's also the fuel that the Deep bunkers use the so-called are quotes Skeptics I don't like the term Skeptics unless I just probably cuz I really want his privately I think it's a sloppy lazy way to look at things to just be a skeptic objective and I think there's a lot of things you should be skeptical of I think you should you should look at things and look at things from a hard-line science perspective you have easily but the idea of Skeptics a problem with that is you're always looking for things to be bulshit yeah and I think that's dangerous cuz I think something's aren't bulshit confirmation bias on the other end you decided to take a square thing to put in a round hole no matter what and I find a lot of them to be lazy louder than to be lazy thinkers shirt cuz they're always putting it into that box instead of going instead of just separating their ego they're trying to playing a game and the game is calling bowlshit I want to call b******* and I'm going to line up all these reasons why it's b******* and I'm going to ignore anything that might be contrary to that definition yeah I'm going to catch him in something you know all on this process I found dr. krengel he came forward and said I was in security briefings with Bob Lazar the physicist at Los Alamos the record with me now the other people I talk with why won't they go on the record with me cuz still working there so that that's the difference right what is that what can the public have right even if they're not working there that you know they want to live their lives what means obviously people seen what's happened to you Mike Vick pain after 30 years if you look at all the information on you know concerning my accounts that's that's verifiable it can't possibly be able shitstorm anymore it's really way past that point you I mean that was my big thing is I mean how could I possibly know Mike Thigpen was the guy that did the security clearances to go to the big one of the guys that was a guy that you work with he said he did and and George Knapp you know jerk didn't believe him George put him through for polygraph test right he tried to see man this is a big risk it sounds interesting but let's see if he's telling the truth one things was Bob said there's a guy who makes a penny to security clearances for the base and that's a weird name it's a very specific for 30 years George found this kind of weird Department that he didn't even know it was my Thigpen the guy wouldn't talk to me ghost and Holy Ghost for 30 years use Facebook and Google image match through his children I was able to find him after 30 years and I talked him three times on the phone was on the East Coast almost run on camera with me confirm that he did security clearances in 1989 confirm he remembers Bob Lazar and what you don't know is there's a handwritten note that friend of yours has from Mike give it to you later but that is real that is actual so handwritten notices what Dave doing a security clearance for him and even though I'm like the UFO guy they didn't even the FBI come and visit my house and make sure that they talk about my friend and then lift a little card and when I wipe them to get away she didn't know who they were they left a little card is super cute now back then it was a handwritten note in his friend has it for him that you haven't seen in omigod Hudak AIDS so if you're listening car like a like a like a postcard a piece of paper that he left on the door saying when Bob gets back or whatever it says on it so it's just another little funny thing I found the guy he does the security clearances he admitted to me he did it and he admitted to me he was dodging George Knapp because when George said his name on the on the on the news he dropped his Fork into his steak and mashed potatoes or whatever and he's looking at his wife he's in trouble his name's never supposed to be out there like that just a security clearance guy that you don't want national attention associated with n associated with anything Bob has to say but anyway this unique name Bob said for 30 years in a guy ghosted George Knapp George could prove he existed he actually talked to me man he talked to me three times he almost died camera with me it's just crazy what what do you what happens after 30 years you just get more info</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so much like we have different shaped aircrafts in fighter jets and cars they probably have different shapes of these objects that operate under similar principles bright. They all have the same power source also dealing with if you think about the laws of technological progression you know you think of Moore's Law and you think of how things accelerate you've got to think that of this civilization is who knows how many years more advanced than we are if not even years mean we're thinking about in terms of conventional terms right away with the way we look at the world that mean the day meet date might be just Superior in terms of their intellect they've got to be at a steam engine right and go to an internal combustion engine and then our nuclear power and go up the ladder that we you know if the stuff is true about the origin in the binary star system and they have heavier elements that we don't have and this element stable element 115 is a naturally occurring material maybe that's the first thing they started experimenting with and the version of their steam engine their first product was something that operated like this and actually when they came to Earth to look around or you know whatever they were amazed at the stuff doing these guys burn stuff and squirted out the back to go forward so right you know who says they follow any kind of normal progression like that I thought was if you went back to the Fourteenth and then you went from 1400 to 1500 not to see that much of a difference technologically if you go from 2000 to 3000 I assumed is going to be a radical change the death of the rate of change is magnificently higher used to be right so if you think about what they had in 1988 and you think about what they probably have in 2019 just logically seems like they would advance I would think so the only question is like are they living is that a living thing in terms of like a biological thing or are they some sort of an artificially created creation like we are working on right now me where middle of working on artificial reality artificial being sentient beings artificial intelligence Wisconsin this silicon-based life-forms they're essentially trying to create Boston Dynamics was it Boston Dynamics robots yeah synthetic they don't even need to be a machine so I assume these people aren't liar or crazy or whatever right that they'd have no sex organs and that they don't seem to have any muscle that is almost like a frame right and they have enormous heads I mean if you look at Australia pithecus or depictions of you know ancient hominids and then you go to human beings why things is bigger heads and weaker bodies while you see I'm clear progression of evolution to wear or something like that yeah I would lean towards synthetic organisms because it looks like it was made for a specific task there's no reproductive organs so I'm kind of leaves out any kind of physical Evolution emotions fear anxiety all these different things that exist in Force us into making sure we reproduce I mean That's essential there's a human reward systems that aren't necessary once they can figure out a way to make some sort of sentient artificial life some sort of thing that doesn't have his biological limitations that we have by the way these these craft all these different kinds of been reported to those confusing I was Spotify Sasha's what I heard Bob Lazar talk about flying saucer right but if you look back in history people have always reported the weirdest shapes like none of them are alike there are the saucers but you got cigar-shaped you got another top hat shaped you've orbs why maybe they're serving different purposes they're doing different things like weed use different tools and I want to be clear the reason I know that memo is real is cuz I spend a lot of time with dr. Edgar Mitchell 6 man to walk on the Moon last got it filmed before he died right that's how I know I don't want any journalist thinking I got him anywhere else I know because of dr. Mitchell and he said the same thing maybe these things are / 4 different tasks you know and that's why if you if you think about what an alien is in terms of are the sort of iconic image of an alien like they're Steven Spielberg Close Encounters of the Third time that the Third Kind alien they seem like what we'd assume a human being would eventually become right and if these things are tiny human beings are smaller than never been before they're weaker than they've ever been before and there seems to be a trend in that direction and this trend seems to be Amplified by our technological progression lack of Need for muscle strength in our lack of Need for violence and moving in a society to try to get away from all the things that we think are boring about human beings in the terrible behavior that we have if we one day do give birth to some sort of an artificial being like Marshall mcluhan's quote we are the sex organs of the Machine World you know that one yeah and that the quote is always one of my favorites because okay what are we doing when we are constantly technologically innovating we're constantly looking for a faster cars better computer is bigger screens faster more resolution more pixels more this more that higher bandwidth 5G 10g what are we doing we're moving into the stand back and look at what it is we're moving 100% towards technological innovation if you looked at the species from afar and if you weren't a part of it you say what is a species do they make things they make things better every year beehives the same f****** thing that you see 10 years ago you go by see a beehive it's amazing it's cool but they're the same f****** thing they figured out how to do it they make most talked about on my podcast that we are cyborgs you just carried in your pockets a phone that answers any question you want you can talk to it will give you the answers into the answers instantaneously good navigate to it has all your phone numbers in it as all your contacts you can get ahold of people people listening to through it it's connecting us in ways even involuntarily haptics that kind of yeah it's also getting on your wrist how many people have I watches Apple watches about it last night but I have a bit about it but I do about the integration between humans and Technology that's what would you do if you were a hyper intelligence right would you do the work yourself or would you create some cool things called like humans to do it for you would you create things that are cybernetic organisms to come in with machines and do it for you if you are hyper intelligence that has kind of changed like you've described you probably crate workers right now that's a vast conspiracy theory well I mean I don't think it's necessarily that I mean you could look at it that way but that is the way conspiracy theorists would look at it the way I would look it is like there's obviously a progression going on a biological progression there's some sort of an integration with technology there's some sort of imperative this need for technological innovation and inescapable everyone has it which and I think it's attached to materialism in some strange way because so many people work so hard to get new things and let God it's him so illogical preposterous what happened to persons on the rise but nobody seems to be able to stop it like why is that well maybe it's because we are the electronic caterpillars that give birth to the butterfly maybe that's what we're doing our job is to do is to make some sort of a cocoon and we don't even know we're doing it while we're doing it to think a caterpillar as well hey caterpillar what are you doing man just doing my thing is my job to make used to do that and make the jump to some sort of mechanized right that is fishing with a spear primatology wild rag that's impressive very impressive welders these primatologist believed that monkeys and chimps and some of the great apes are moving into the Stone Age that they've currently entered the Stone Age like they're not staying what they were a hundred thousand years ago or five hundred thousand years ago but they're actively using tools and they're experimenting with different different ways to use those tools and they're making tools out of stone and making tools out of sticks and they're they're using them well this might just be what happens this might just be what happens to me why we work so hard mean I was driving to La this morning, I had a doctor's appointment so I was on the 405 at 8 in the morning Jesus Christ like this is so crazy when you're on the 405 in La at 8 in the morning you see literally a million cars and also I'm in a Tesla so I haven't on autopilot so I'm there sitting I'm listening to a podcast I barely have my hand on the wheel I'm not touching s*** is cars driving me along I'm not even doing anything I'm just I'm just hanging out so much less please Bluetooth screen streaming from my phone and I pulled that podcast with came out today out of the f****** sky and I'm listening to it and I'm all comfortable am I nice little car just driving on my way to the doctor's office just irresistible stuff I like to have running from Jaguars this is life guy's life is running from crocodiles has not lived in the f****** suburbicon miserably some that are like that I don't think so I think I think what it when it comes we're going to embrace it where you embrace it the same William Bray cell phones the same we Embrace television just going to be a few holdouts think about sometimes when I get really high that Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard LSD studies has been proven Ted Kaczynski they cooked his f****** brain when he was at Harvard and then when he went over to Berkeley became a professor his goal was to make enough money so that he could implement this program and live in the woods and then write his Manifesto and start killing people that were involved in propagating technology he was expunged from the Harvard logs by the way this is something my friend just called me about so there's this a private library and they used to print people's names whenever they were part of the university and he was one of the handful of people that were expunged from it I want to jump back to the one thing Joe I want to be very careful with that word conspiracy theorist what what I was what I was saying to you is that we terraform on earth right we terraform we change the environment we do all this Innovation what is stopping us from thinking that that's not being done I'm asking is I'm saying what's stopping us from thinking that that's being done on a much bigger level on a cosmic level human like aliens coming down doing that the human I'm telling you that there is something here that's there's a fact you know there's something there craft they're here they're not ours they're here so the question is what is that about and I'm just looking at what we do with what you're describing with technology and I think it's much more likely that the same way we observe chimps and we observe that they are now in the Stone Age that they're observing us and that they're recognized there is a pad there is a there's a steps that happened I mean Carl Sagan talked about the different levels of civilization and let you know that we don't get past certain levels we're never going to reach this height mean we're in type 1 civilization going to stay type-0 Waring polluting pillaging were awesome civilization in Ventura that other people have created right I mean even when you're driving a car and stomp on the gas like you didn't invent the f****** engine you didn't invent tires there's all these things that were in involved in the creation of this thing that is really outside of your grasp of understanding but yet you have the ability to use it like a person with a gun I'm just going to bang bang bang people invented guns with you without the intellect to craft an engineer and it and manifest these creations you just have access to them because you have paper or your big horn are you have whatever the f*** you using using a credit card now you have almost no responsibility you just you could just flippantly use these things which is why we we were very childlike interaction who we we haven't had to earn the responsibility we haven't had to earn these things that we've been able to have and you've only been able to have them because other people have innovated in spent ungodly amount of time and effort and focus in the lab to create these things and then they've all put them together and then what is the what's the reason to put them together profit but what's the reason why you doing that so you can buy more things what it what are we doing what are we doing we're making better things that's what we do that's all that's all we do is make better than chickens and food in the backyard do it when we decide to make that almost impossible I preferred way of living is his stuff everyone into a very small area where no one goes anything other than weed this is what La is la is 20 million people with hard surfaces is as many hard surfaces you can an acre backyard creation that we put on top of the Earth but the goal is that like New York City that's right you just got busy at Central Park and I just got zoom and s*** stacked up no one's growing anything and then constant work everyone up early go go go anime progress make that money so you can buy more things and every year hey Apple where's his f****** new phone as if your phone isn't good around it's all gone know that you know the 10,000 years and the Hoover Dam goes or whatever you do Mount Rushmore disintegrate so it's amazing cuz we have created that and everything trying to spring up through that we keep it maintenance down but we're we're Blankman something hits but we don't think that way what you want what you need right now you know what it's we are in many ways is combination of this weird primitive ape-like thing with the ability to calculate and manipulate our world and our environment that makes us holy unique on top of that with existential angst and end in fears what you do with that with his Watertown antidepressants that keeps him moving worried about the future of the trying to figure out what reality is a goddamn convertible spaceship switch and this life will be born out of innovation and thinking and progress and technology and more than likely it's probably going to be what we're seeing that these things are that you're observing I'm not observing in but yeah I guess I don't think they are us but I think they are what happens when things keep going as not us just like we are not monkeys right all right I'm not a champ there from here is your idea no no no that this is what happened to all over the Union right yeah toast is what happened you know I went to see Brian Cox's he has this amazing live show with Robin ends with a d d have these led screens is huge screens with high-resolution depictions of the cosmos and won the most mind blowing things was he has this large-scale image of the universe and shows all the individual Galaxy the University of just keeps moving through all these galaxies in three dimensions and it's f****** incredible but what's stunning is the relative uniformity of it even if you know it me you're obviously looking at an incredibly small depiction of something that's immensely large like a galaxy of hundreds of going to start you seeing it as his little. But this little. That's flying through space surrounded by other little darts with very similarly space distance is a homogeneous uniformity in that form in terms of like the distance between galaxies so many galaxies is so it's so similar they might vary slightly and that's slightly might be hundreds of millions of light-years right but but but there's so much uniformity why would we not assume that that uniformity exist pretty much everywhere and that all these things that you're saying that are so similar you do see binary star systems you do see single star systems lights why would we not assume that that uniformity exist pretty much everywhere and that all these things that you're saying that are so similar you do see binary star systems you do see single star systems Lexar one time was a binary star system</div>

rest is history of them up there he was going to fight then I found doing a whole Connor Fiasco Al iaquinta then I went to Dad's then I went to Dagestan what's it like intense but it was it was beautiful because people try to scare me when I was supposed to go to Dagestan like I got people in the UFC that was Leo be careful over there I'm thinking like I went during Ramadan last June at the end of Ramadan and did you have to observe while you're there so I could be wanting me to come during like the last tail end of Ramadan right so I went over there by myself Gwen and got my Visa in Miami and went over there just got my ticket and I went over there I remember the first day I got there I was in like Customs for like 2 hours cuz they couldn't speak English if his little Airport Inn in Daggett and Kirby was outside and he wouldn't come in the airport cuz he to famous right and it's in the middle of the night and I remember when I first got there it was just checkpoints everywhere when I got there I would like drive down the street person with some guns I'm like I cooled it we're on our way yet but this is Dagestan and I ended up getting to this this I stayed at his uncle house I thinking it was just a beautiful moment why no one's ever seen them I'm observing Ramadan the whole time I was there I didn't eat I didn't drink I did exactly what could be eating them did because I think a problem with us a lot as Americans this week take our culture somewhere else and I wanted to observe day coaching really see what it's like and I was fascinated I wanted to know why women covered themselves and I asked all those questions all that stuff is in the documentary now when I get all these millions of people watching these videos the most common thing is or where is the women at and I'm like why these people so obsessed with what and I literally went into that like I asked when you when you live in a mare you don't point a camera at these people like I've seen women you just don't point a camera time is rude right and that's like them their culture and their culture to explain this to you a couple people over then it was just like queens and we cover them because in a Kiwanis that you know the man is weak to so they don't want their woman to be looked at by other man I think that's the word I was looking for so you just cover themselves up in our culture do you know that may be weird but I respected like what they told me it made sense it literally made sense where it was just like listen we don't let another man look at my wife right I'm not going to bash on that culture because I feel like that silly a woman can do whatever they want to do that's just how they feel how do you know about ICU women I seen some beautiful women to oz in Dagestan so it wasn't the fact that I didn't feel many women I seen women but they explain to you when you go here when you cannot film The Women film another man's woman like I think I talked to Chris Wyman once when I was at his gym when I was doing a La Quinta he went to chechnya yeah and he told me a story I think to chechnya and he was telling your story of like he accidentally touched a woman's hand and they like literally got on like you don't touch another woman you don't touch a woman's hand over here cuz that's bad on her right Brian and I was like damn that's crazy cuz he said he was just like reaching out shaking people hands and human instinct that's different culture over there a woman can't touch another man's hand so yeah from chechnya the leader of chechnya he's like really into MMA right now bro you know what's crazy is that I don't know anything about the guy or his politics or anything but I know that he obsessed with fighting right I know Tyrone Spong been over there and the other day and they went up they went over there to chechnya him in a Mendes Brothers Jimenez Brothers had like a seminar I did like a preview of Chito Vera and he was talking about in there like a did a Jiu-Jitsu match in front of some Oleg Arc over there like it's crazy right like a teaspoon over there for that yeah I mean sisters fighting been in Dubai how many times what you doing over there speaking things like that I mean when you want it the most famous I think it's like top 15 most famous athletes now but for sure and definitely most famous Muscle Man please yeah yeah so I mean he's the only UFC champion who should be undefeated if it not for that one lesson f*****-up disqualification sorry what you throw at them. I just feel like to see his pedigree where you from it's nothing that's going to break that guy it's not you can't what are you going to do it I just don't think it's nothing you can do after going to Dagestan and seeing how those people live and how that they're they're cold and they're at their values and probably just how strict the faith is over there right and they tie and everything they do to their faith Ali was like I'm not going to lose because of all on things like that and I truly believe that after seeing light just a camaraderie over there the gyms a train in the mountains everything that makes this guy is nothing in an octagon that someone is going to do like there's going to be could be like everything can happen if Luke can happen we see it all the time but I just feel like mentally there's nothing that's going to break a bead like if I feel like it if he ever in a situation where you had to tap he wouldn't like you would he would just have to put them to sleep cuz I just don't think that's possible like to beat him I honestly feel like you can't lose I just don't see nobody beating them I just I've been in locker rooms or Fighters and you got a butterfly feeling and things like that like when he fought Conor and I was in the locker room cubby was FaceTiming his people in Dagestan laughing and Xavier right when Tony Ferguson was fighting Pettis he like hitting mitts with Xavier computer looking up the screen Javier's I don't care man it's a different level he always said that's like his favorite thing that's a different level that's what I love about him and it's like people are obsessed with the fighter I like to be with a person and that's the thing that I get out of this anatomy of a fighter is like just hanging out with this guy but like if you ever watch my shoes I never talk about our God fight coming up like if you ever watch The Nanny fight is not about your opponent it's just about your life because I felt like when I created it I feel like these organizations wasn't promoting Fighters all the way and not yet they going to promote the top fighters and things like that but what about the guys that are two-in-one in the UFC not ranked like they own the UFC like they make a cut out there a couple fight like what do they have left after that and I was just fighting let me cry the series instead of a documentary and just continue to build this and follow these guys lives and that's all I really wanted to do it was no hidden incentive where I was like I'm going to make millions of dollars off this end up on the Joe Rogan podcast it was like I love following these Fighters and telling their stories because it's sort of like similar to my journey you know these guys are what was the guy that just fought Duran win in Greenville Eric spicy or spicey or whatever his name was he tweeted like I had he just got bigger fighting tonight right here like I had 2 - 270 in my bank account I've been here Joe so that's why I get the passion out of doing it cuz I've been there with these Fighters at this point in my life I paid for Fighters flights and hotels because they couldn't get a hotel like these Fighters know that somebody's Fighters know that to where I'm able to help them and I'm spending this all on my own breaking myself so I'm to me I'm just thinking to myself like you doing this for specific passionate about it you want to tell these guys lives and I just really wanted to offer another glimpse into fighter sliced other than fight week if you flew to Phoenix for 3 Days To Do comedy get a hotel and you know how expensive flight likes to imagine me fun in this on my own if I want to go somewhere for 3 days say Daddy put me like above a store and she told me he gave me a key if I brother lock this door at night brother if I don't go outside do they speak English couple people did a couple people ask you questions they ask me question is the Conor McGregor popular cuz it's something like that and they just watch anything could be related you got some crazy fans and how many people live in Pakistan I saw some of the videos of people celebrating when he want his f****** crazy run we had to drive I 2 hours to get there oh really yeah like we had to go on the board as a Chesney I had to get another Visa. Just to get through that checkpoint I never get like we got through the checkpoint and they like we have to all give them our stuff and then Kabhi Kabhi will I get out to do was like get out the army guy with his gun and then I get out and I'll come around the car and could be was like right the hell y'all bout to do I call like a bad case of diarrhea while I was over there cuz I eat nothing but meat I was trying to do keto while I was over there and listen the toilets are just a hole in the ground you have to squat squat and pull the strings like we was driving from his village at the that was like my last night there and I was destroyed I was like eating prey and all that stuff like you know how and I remember like I was suffering and could be like fill me with his phone laughing look at his brother look at his brother he's about to shoot his self and I remember getting back to the place where I was standing Dagestan oh my God I probably lost 8 lb it was crazy music crazy experience man it was a crazy experience in my life 9 days yeah because when you in this type of energy everybody materialistic we all want nice things want to live in nice places want to drive nice cars I do most people do want to live nice and comfortable and I saw just how happy these people was just living their lives like I went to his village I went to his Mountain Village and I was in the city and I saw these people were just happy and maybe on on the outside they was happy and maybe they was dealing with other things that we don't know about but saw family Miss Brotherhood and I had a little bit of respect for their culture like obviously with Islam and things like that is so many different sects that makes it bad just like what Christianity in people in the Catholic Community in the priest and everything and that's my experience with the Islamic community being around could be so that's the only thing I can go off of and obviously everybody see Muhammad Ali and he praises and things like that but I had a new phone for just the simpleness of of that like a babe I thought honestly could be was going to retire after he fought Conor cuz I talked to him a little bit about that and he don't want much but it's the biggest the biggest fight ever so at the last email I don't know what member they took his check right but obviously he got a lot of money for that yeah they gave him a $4000000 check million-dollar check and then obviously they had to pay per view point so feels like if you got anything out of this whole thing what would you want I'd like a camera let's get a new camera so I can shoot some movies or something right that's literally the low expectations I had out of making the series right especially when it was a documentary I was just like man maybe I make this documentary put it on Netflix and Amazon for free about Fighters and now looking back on it the stuff that I have captured on them hard drive I can sell a documentary from millions of dollars I think I got amazing footage amazing footage I got the whole Connor thing that I got like that that tape is like 20 minutes nobody's ever seen it I have it no one's really seen the whole thing like I got kind of when he first ran down the tunnel I could I seen him from a distance</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> tell me some of the stuff that you read that you don't know is true I mean if the stuff is true about the propulsion stuff I mean anyway Heaton what if you rent what it would what you saw two and you know what you talkin about I got to poke the bear they were you know there was talk of weapon systems that they were different project project Galileo project sidekick was supposed to be weapon applications of the craft project Looking Glass had to do with time any effects of time in the craft now I don't think we're not talking about making a time machine like in science fiction but we're talking about you know small distortions intentional distortions of time and how that can be used you know as a not as well it was part of what weapon Pro how are you informed in this just a small briefings that I read but again I don't really like to talk about those because I don't have any information on him and it was just you know small breathing really told Commander favor that what he saw might have been a time dilation and not F-18 approaching at he said that he described it as a ping pong ball in a cup and shaking it back and forth it was moving that fast obviously if there's anything inside there it's going to be battered to hell but you know my point was was that when one of two things either there's a gravitational envelope in there which negates any inertia affects or you are seeing through a gravity Distortion field so you know just like you're looking at a hot highway and you see you know what's an optical Distortion going through their will the same thing happens in gravity and the craft may not actually be moving like that it may just look like it because you're seeing you can only see it through the field so it may be making much more gentle mode I'm not saying that's it but it has to be one of the two and nothing shows up 60 miles away they noticed it on radar 62nd after left Commander favor but it was at his cap point which is the next point he was destined to go to 60 miles away and in 60 seconds on radar the same object ends up there so it's going a mile second no I think the radar just picked it up in 60 Seconds play different lens cleaner race around it random play at the Spy one does it really cool you didn't do the whole Loop anymore though that the crap moved to his next location before he knew where his next location was going to be Jesus and that I mean that's well-documented so that's that's a pretty shocking piece of information that you were discussing this the way this reactive worked and that these things were not really connected no nothing is connected there's no wiring at all that freaks me the f*** out charger iPhone wireless electricity through the sky in Westinghouse electric the f*** out of here with that like when anybody could just pull electricity out of scam eater we probably wouldn't have computers you think yeah I'm pretty positive I mean forget about micro-electronics well this is dumping huge amounts of electromagnetic energy in the air and yeah we be able to wirelessly turn on our light but there'd be no radio communication the interference would be something we could would be overwhelming it would induce electric currents and anything with a small wire on it so integrated circuits transistors would be disintegrated before they were even in home stood for operation so it it would it would have stopped it be great you can turn lighters on and heater is from all over the place with no wires but it would stop modern electronics and if we became dependent on it would almost be like our dependence on fossil fuels although it's destructive it's very difficult for us to get off the nipple it would have changed the course of how we developed which is so interesting when you talk about it a civilization of the star system didn't even start with fossil fuels they had 115 to be on their planet and they're like cool anti-gravity is pretty awesome well the fact that they didn't have important that that actually happened it might have been stopped in its tracks for a reason and it's just I think it's incredibly difficult for us to imagine technological progression under another timeline of the one that we've experienced yeah that's difficult if we imagine what this alien race must have been liking I mean just did to be able to see something like mean obviously we've seen it in different life-forms right like we see the life of certain beetles in comparison to the life of certain fish very very different existence very different life cycles octopus but we don't see it in terms of technological innovation as we're the only one that's intelligent that can innovate do we have intelligent creatures but they're in the ocean the only singer like us are dolphins and orcas and well and they don't have the ability to manipulate their environment and subsequently because he'll have the ability to manipulate their environment we put them in fish tanks and I'm really getting the tank do some tricks right you know the only thing he saw in the crack if we are considering Bob Story the only thing that you he's on the craft that he related to that look like a human could make was this honeycomb hatch and I would love that because you're like obsessed with this thing that you could recognize other I only focus on that because it was the one thing that I understood how it worked and it was it was the access to the level below and it was will you know if you take a six-pack of beer and you take out the cardboard dividers set it on the table you can put a lot of pressure on the top but if you push it from the sides it collapses flat so it was something like that in a honeycomb shape that was essentially some sort metal and you could walk on that an upper layer but if you took the corner stuck your finger in and pushed it collapsed and Mater and entryway. That was a really unique I've never seen that before and it was the only thing in the crap that made absolute sense to me either that we can make that and all that is a hatchway was there any discussion about the materials that were used to make the craft I'm sure there was but that wasn't the Metallurgy division has nothing to do with us about the materials that were used to make the craft I'm sure there was but that wasn't the Metallurgy division has nothing to do with us so you never going to not even though I don't even know if it was a metal or it was ceramic it's I think it is a fine line between the two</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> well I'm not believe it or not I'm not into UFOs I don't follow stories or you know know I'm fascinated with the technology and it really irks me like every night I go to sleep that you know I don't that it was my own doing essentially that that prevented me from continuing on in the in the project I mean it that to be on that Cutting Edge of technology is so boring to me by the same token I don't really care that there's aliens or where they come from I mean the prize is the technology and that's what I'm fascinated by but I don't listen to UFO stories in that sort of thing but George Knapp is I mean he's the guy that has the contacts and tries to thread everything together and what he recently told me is he found I do is either documentation or people that he spoke to its at this the existence of this project the project it's something that they seem to take out every eight or ten years so that's a very specific memo and this is actually this is the first time I'll be very clear with people. It's a big topic of conversation right now it's called The Wilson memo and can look it up Admiral Wilson met with a scientist whose actually was featured in one of my films everybody has been debating whether or not this document of a conversation with it within I brought the time is a real document it's an actual conversation that happen in this document to every wants another world is going crazy right now the UFO World I'll tell you straight up right now I'm in the position to know and it is a real document that it is real so the conversation you read in that that conversation was had I can't attest to Epic Loot you're not being very clear there was a document that is circulating right now that is really big it's going around everywhere we're asking them what is this talking it's called The Wilson memo is what you how you can find it online there were the Wilson leaked the Wilson memorandum of human bondage meets with this scientist and they have this discussion oddly enough that special projects at eg&amp;g and if I remember the document from 2001 I'm telling everybody right now it's real and we'll see my history is pretty good with lights it's really not right so here we go. Here comes out they needed eg&amp;g special projects in 1989 they take stumble into a problem this happens they put the technology away and then they bring it back out and see if Material Science has caught up and if they can make any progress so this document kind of talks about this process the big thing I get permit in a lot of its vindicating to Bob and one of the things that Academy beside the eg&amp;g thing is that Private Industry to disguise an admiral and he says I found out about your sap your special Access program I need to know about it and he's going to a private part of industry and he is denied access and he says I should be running this program and they were able to deny him access so I think the takeaway here is check it out I'm telling you that that is an actual correct that is a leak that everything said in that document on I don't know what to talk about what what documents between a scientist and an admiral that are sitting and they're having a meeting and they're talking about the search for the UFO subject to search to get special Access program access to all of these different things like reverse engineering programs so in this document they talked about it and I believe that that this document that the person that went was employed by Robert Bigelow you know one of the guys has a couple of orbiting satellites and all that stuff Skinwalker Ranch no he's not he was the guy do you even longer that there's a new owner and I interviewed for my other film but there's a new owner and you'll be hearing a lot more about that soon but like it'll just the stuff that you'll be hearing about Skinwalker Ranch in cuz it's in the water and the whole point of insertion here is just that that document kind of validates a lot of this idea Bob just said that they make a little progress then they can't go anywhere they talked it away and then they bring it back out in a 10 years later and start working on it what is the limiting factor I think Bob should speak on this but it's the material science yeah that's really where physics is so I can see them doing that I mean I didn't have any information on that but I think what you know George uncovered is probably accurate it's just bringing weight but the thing away wait for science to catch up and you know what decade later let's take the project out again and see all right now where can we go but it's got to be someone who remains informed right oh yeah I've got your scientists like you and bury you got your people that you compartmentalize got these people work on that there has to be some people that know everything got security and then someone's going to be in the outside saying hey we need people to guard this building don't let anybody in I think a lot of that is Private Industry and I think that's how they keep it yeah I think that's how they littered because the government is just so leaky I think that's kind of what they're doing is what the document kind of proves you just articulated that that it isn't control Private Industry what Private Industry some Aerospace company something I don't know the guy with the Admiral wouldn't name it in the car and the car station so they still have these things supposedly guess I mean I don't have any information on that it never asked anyone that has any inkling of any idea where they got them or how they got them now but something must have been said to me from Barry and but I was just too long ago and I can't quite remember what it said but it it just left the seat in my mind I think at least one of them was part of an archaeological dig so it's old simply one at least one of them is old I don't know if it was the one I work down but I remember something to do with an archaeological dig so that's that means it's not just ancient I have nine of them how could we have not heard about that what about the guys with the brushes How Could You uncover something like that and Jose newspaper at home Des I mean they said it on that first day this is I can tell you how I hoarded this this conversation so this was an employee of at the time Robert Bigelow this is in 2002 right remember when he had that government contract called. The world all knows about now and he hadn't AIDS study the ranch that 22 million everybody is saying it was for a tip Advanced Aerospace threat identification program the 22 million dollars was for all sap that was pushed through Congress three congressmen right and Astronaut it was pushed through and that's what the Clayton million dollars by the way they spend more money on Viagra every year than they do studying UFOs if it was just this program which I think is funny was the mother programs 2 million and really it was to study Skinwalker Ranch oddly enough that 22 all was inspired by the phenomenon they were seen at Skinwalker Ranch because the scientists there scene pickles come through like a space in the sky we went there I went through a bunch of people that seem full of s*** but a couple to do this very very interesting if you look I spent a lot of time in the area I'm not talking about the stores and saying they were scientists hired by the government right through a big load to study the ranch cuz they thought it was important and you know whatever whatever the point is that 22 million was to study that didn't we have a tip which is like an auxiliary program of military science a commander fravor is not sort of thing this document is just one of those things that has now come forward that through the Big Love studies it was government-funded and then it was personally funded and then government-funded it's just one of those things that kind of shakes you because you got this military guy who can't get access because of the Private Industry that's holding these non-terrestrial materials that they can't study it so that's the claim right because you got this military guy who can't get access because of the Private Industry that's holding these non-terrestrial materials that they can't study it so that's the claim right now give it some time let people dig more into this it's fascinating man</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so you working there and while you're working there you're under this crazy schedule and forgive me for explaining your story but you would get these phone calls you would have to go to the to the airport at 11 p.m. and your wife start thinking that you were having an affair yeah apparently so permission to have as part of the security clearance process I gave written permission to have the phones monitored and things of that sort so they weren't doing any covert stuff they Q clearance which is civilian top secret clearance or military top secret clearance they go talk to friends and you know places places you've been make sure you're not connected to foreign countries but do you know modern your phone is nothing unusual however they insisted that you know you don't even talk your loved one to your partner with your wife whatever about what's going on so she was essentially in the dark and didn't know the phone is being monitored well part of the security clearance is that not only do you not have any connections to foreign countries and are in a maniac but you have to have a stable home life too well she started having an affair with a flight instructor now they were monitoring this on the phone and they knew it and I didn't so they stopped me coming in and their attitude at the time was we need to see how this is going to play out and if lazarz going to get a little weird or anything so let's just you know hold them off from coming in and you know see what happens and they explain this to what was happening well after the fact yeah cuz I'm kind of went on and there were guys that were following me around and I started getting a little concerned go on WOW are they booting me out of the project and if so they're not just going to let me hang out at home and go get a new job knowing what I know so as time went on I started getting a little concerned and I took my closest friends and just kind of got together I said hey remember that job I told you about this is what's going on and you don't need to take my word for it Wednesday night we need to Olga I want to show you what's going on so I took everybody and we went out to remember since I had the test flight schedule and went outside the base out into the desert and so everybody could see you know one of the high-performance test and you know it left quite an imprint on everybody so they knew I wasn't in this videos of these tests jumping around but yeah I mean that we did video of it but doesn't know by today's standards it's what is your video specifically available the video that you took it well George Knapp has it I have no idea we are talking 80s Camp what's the most important thing is a human story here everybody that he took up there on three separate occasions they don't all like each other they don't all talk they all agree on one thing they saw something that night at the exact point in time and space to Bob Lazar said remember this is 1715 17 miles south of Area 51 no one even knew really about Area 51 we're talkin Papoose Lake and they all agree they saw something that night they had never seen before and they've never seen sense when he said it so that's one of like the six things were my how did you know you can dismiss him I tried to dismiss it but something's we can't get around and and there's about five or six of them how did he know about the Jimmy want to find a video right now what would you look under father's are UFO S4 Area 51 just kind of like that so it's like the S4 UFO video Bob Lazar and guy doesn't analysis but you're analyzing these 80s videos heat from the very beginning Bob never said I have proof of my store and I'm going to tell the world he said at the very beginning I cannot prove my story that's not why I'm telling this George not convinced him to tell people and he live to it night I didn't believe it either until I talk with George okay so you you filmed these this test flight 1 test line and then you get caught actually it was I think of a third time because it out there the first time everybody thought everybody was amazed cuz I did some radical Maneuvers and you know everybody had a lot just seen the video It Doesn't I don't think there's something we have now. Does that no human-piloted craft but I don't know obviously with a it's impossible nothing can move like that and we didn't start feeling from the very beginning you know we were waiting for something you know to have Minecraft took off and I came flying at a stop do you know turned into right angle flu back and then you know after did some amazing stuff to get the camera and the new we started filming so it doesn't have all of it on there just has some way I described it to my friends and then have a wall around the wall but you know how it moves around the wallet doesn't seem like it has anything to do with inertia or physics or it's not impeded in any way by the atmosphere yeah that's what it looks like essentially separated from reality as crazy as that sounds with being and in case it's an ongoing gravitational envelope inertia is not going to affect it and you know this is this is how some of those recent sightings of Commander David fravor I'm sure you've heard of the UFO I mean he describes exactly that the thing operates exactly the way I was describing that's why he was interested to talk to me but saw this and you know on the way home until I get way we got away with it we should try it again the next test flight day so this became a thing to do and I think it was on the third time that we got caught I mean we started becoming a little careless I think we took a motorhome out there but you know I mean it was like the stupidest thing you could start tailgating he was so we went out there and my friend Jean Huff and I were leaning on the front of a vehicle and just for some reason we just started talking chip like well I hope they realize that I don't remember what we were saying but you know that attacking a base or something along those lines and stealing the craft or something like that and then about 20 feet in front of us we see a little green light fall on the ground and roll to us and unbeknownst to us now it's pitch-black you can't see your hand in front of your face there are a bunch of guards standing right out there and they had a night vision scope where they were like from here to the wall looking at us listening to us and the guy dropped it in the scope rolled over to us and you could see the green screen turn the lights on and all these guys were there so it was play stupid stuff and got caught as we should have cuz so when they catch any bring you in then what happens while I went in for debriefing the following day I went to Indian Springs Air Force Base which is kind of a defunct base that they used to use at the nuclear test site and this is when they brought out the transcript of the phone call with my wife and you know they sat me down and we said you know when we meant to keep the secret we meant you can tell your friends right you know and it just being sarcastic and tryna and then they got real serious but this is where they took the transcript out and we're reading me what my wife and you know her friend were talking about and it was a hard time to what happens from there what do I do with you why don't they arrest you I don't know why I'm not sure they exactly they knew what to do but they did let me go that night and I went home and that this is kind of when the most stressful part started cuz you're realizing you're being modeled after that that I contacted you know what that time only investigative reporter I had heard of and you know told him some of the story cuz I have no idea what the hell was going to happen at that point so George Knapp tries to dissect your story tries to find holes in it tells it puts it online and makes everybody aware of it and that's how I found out about it what happens what happens from there on a contact you and say hey Bob it's probably a good idea if you shut up well try to label use crazy was there there a boy there are a lot of things that happened at you know between that point I'm leaving out a lot of stuff to fill in the story we have to go back to Los Alamos and and well I really don't want to talk about that the top secret weapons stuff that you were working on thinking about the 115 well I don't know I have to think about how I'd what is the problem I don't want to get myself into more trouble by admitting something so I just have to dance around a couple just during the filming of the movie p.m.</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> if you want those people like me who you know I've always loved the idea of UFOs I became extremely weary talking to people who are UFO Believers and UFO Fanatics is there so many of them they're full of s*** and I just full of s*** there childishly Delirious like the way they talk about things that mean there's so many people that are that I'm in contact State they reach me in the night and they explain to me what we're doing to the ocean is wrong and liking like this is one of the reasons I didn't want to do the shower and you know in some ways I can relate to some of these people you know maybe some of them did really have some kind of experience with saw something and all their friends think they're crazy but hey now there's this guy I heard on the radio and let knows I'm not full of s*** so I got to talk to her and so most of their correspondence I get her people trying to get ahold of me going by view you got to listen to me I'm I'm coming to talk to you I'm being around driving from Oklahoma or whatever and and and put some of them were just f****** batshit-crazy they're frightening as a lot of skitzofrenix that are involved in the conspiracy world 6 a lot of people that have real issues would be a disservice to your audience to not say that we have to look at what's going on now and then on the show a bunch of stuff about what's going on now and to not really understand what's going on now you can't see Bob story in the cracked light after 30 years and at some point we should just touch upon that the biggest being that things like the Tic Tac UFO case that that came out I've heard people even on the shows that was a glitch in the radar that's a data poor perspective you just don't know yet what's really going on Commander fravor I was able to get happy with him to talk to him way before it became public I got that from him he sought other Pilots Sade This is a big thing that's going on right now that they had more settings on the East Coast recently cubes with wispy record these are not aerodynamic and these are the people we trusted dependence on 9/11 metaphase protected Los Angeles on 9/11 so we trust them but they're not trained observers radar individual see these things and the big the big one just to throw down so we can store a little differently in more depth with the big one is United States government has admitted that they have been continuously studying the UFO phenomenon that program was called a tip Advance with called ASAP. That's the mother program George Knapp got that outfit did they announce the New York Times on a tip but all these acronyms all stuff that's Aerospace weapon systems application program so they didn't stop sending your photos 1969 with Project Blue Book we don't think it's crazy we're actually want to reverse-engineer the technology that's why I'm your other show is it what does aav think it's like they're making up another UFO name will hold on there's a reason because in the documents that the DIA documents that George Knapp released that everybody said mistake till now they know it's real they call them aavs which is Advanced Aerospace Vehicles people get an acronym shrunk to the reason for the terminology change is we can mimic what we're reading in the DIA document people can look for that now so they changed the names to get people away from UFO or UAP even like Hillary Clinton said on are right so what you talkin about Hillary Clinton informed the public on Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy we don't call them UFOs anymore because I'm uaps unidentified aerial phenomenon right so she kind of is getting their the clintons are very into the UFO topic Senator Reed look for that for the subject to study of it right so she inform the public so they could look for the right term and these terms are important because the DIA in those documents they've been calling them aavs for quite some time now and they change the name to anomalous know at that they know they always mess around with things but it's actually Advanced right below Aerospace threat aat right cuz they want the sense of threat so my point is if people don't know this now and they think the stuff is is fantasy this this part of it that were studying at the we take it seriously we're spending money on it and it were getting great data from from visual Pilots to to radar that's why we know it's Aerospace they dropped from 80000 feet but guess what that's the top scope of the Spy one radar is 80000 ft to the radar system they were using it was coming from above that my point is this if you don't understand that this is happening you're just behind the curb because you don't have the information because of the stigma that you're talkin that I saw you get totally upset with UFO topic I met you first when you go toilet 7004 topic it's the people when when it when you're doing your how is trust me I have been frustrated to hell my Metro Storage nap and he's taught me the pitbull Pitbulls as I went through it my whole point in this ranch right here is just that we have to look at Bob's story but knowing the facts not something it's a bird it's a plane it's a glitch they're not and so if you don't know that you just don't have the information they're not just that knowing the facts as we know them in 2019 not 1988 absolutely it's just that we have to look at Bob's story but knowing the facts not something it's a bird it's a plane it's a glitch they're not and so if you don't know that you just don't have the information and I'll just that knowing the facts as we know them in 2019 not 1988 absolutely</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how long were there I'd say about six months or so and what what progress was made while you were there when we came up with a bunch of reasonably good ideas about how the reactor worked and one of them was the bass the square base of it was essentially like a cyclotron which is a small particle accelerator a circular one particle accelerator is a linear particle accelerators are just you know long tube essentially in the accelerate freckles with high voltage in radio frequencies till they reach high speeds but a cyclotron does that and a small a circular area and there is a very heavy element fuel element 115 something that wasn't on our periodic charts at the time but it is now it is now when did it become on the periodic table now 2004 Adam said lots of TuneIn 20 milliseconds the items it's nothing right and then it later was discovered couple more times I can fabricate it then they gave it they gave it a place then on periodic chart after that called it must go beyond so they told you about this stuff in 1982 9 they told you about the steps this was not like no they didn't they didn't tell me about it that's one of the things that this group came up with the I keep losing my train of thought with this thing so this one this element 115 was the fuel yeah it was the fuel that the world will forgive you for having a migraine on one think there's been on the attack on Bob you know getting to know him the personal effects on his life it's really hard to understand unless you meet his family and his wife I mean this is the last thing he wanted to f****** do with have to talk have this conversation in I said I have to talk to him the document that there's been detractors there's been a bunch of people that called b******* on many of the things that you said but over time many of the things that you talked about even in the 80s have proven to be true things that people said we're not true were proven to be true Element 115 was one of them right right right was stable another word okay it wasn't admitting radioactivity when they synthesize the two or three atoms of the 115 it did Decay and it was not a stable element so they're they're kind of two different things but this is kind of typical element always have are pretty much always have stable isotopes and unstable Isotopes has like 30 unstable Isotopes to it so well hydrogen for example you're familiar with hydrogen gas it's stable not radioactive but there's also two other types of hydrogen deuterium and tritium and deuterium isn't radioactive it's another stable isotope of hydrogen but tritium is radioactive now they're all hydrogen but they just have a different amount of neutrons so it's the same thing with other elements and element 115 depending on the amount of neutrons that has designates the isotope but it's 115 they will continue to take our experiment and try and make 115 at different isotopes and I'm sure eventually they'll come up with the stable version but it's at a stable version that has the properties that were talking about so they somehow or another had acquired a stable version did they say that the stable version that come with this crap out so at the time you having a firm knowledge of the periodic chart and knowing what was real wasn't real what was your reaction to having this stable element 115 that wasn't even supposed to exist everything was impossible I mean down down to the metal I did get a chance to look inside the craft on only one occasion and this was important because we're the reactors sat might have been critical to how it operated since everything operates without any interconnections so the placement of components might be critical they allowed me to go inside and out and look at it again I forgot where the hell I am so you're going into this craft and what do you thinking when you're inside of it like what are you saying at it's a very ominous feeling because it's there are no zephyrus about everything is one color it's like a dark pewter color and there are no right angles anywhere it's as if somebody took a I've said this before somebody took a model out of fashion it out of wax and then heated it just for a short time so everything melted everything looks like it's fused together everything has a radius of curvature where two items meet its it's a really weird looking thing but there was almost nothing other than a small foldable hatchway that everything was really unworldly to pick on it way to describe it so you get inside this thing and it's designed for something is much smaller than a human being you can't really stand up till you get to the very center of and how tall you I'm 5-10 and what do you think this was designed for I'd say something close to half my eye wow so these little three-foot-tall as creatures for something something small but there is no like there's there's nothing else in there there's just seat the reactor and some of the subcomponents there's no there's no control panels there's no bathroom there's no no decorative components or artwork or anything that you would recognize or trim my man it's just a very bare-bones thing you not seeing any screens well there are archways around it at that a part of the superstructure and that one of the archways can become and transparent when I was in there there was another group working on one of the archways and you could call that a scream more or less so through that Archway it would be it would maintain the solidity that the solid whatever metal it was there's no excuse now but when you want something become transparent and you realize it's still there we can now see through it that's not that Liquid Crystal materials that are like that you know they have seen a glass or a ceramic it was cold to the touch so you know I would lean more towards a metal you're not allowed questions know the only way work on the buddy system so I can only exchange ideas and talk to Berry now this really interferes with science because Science is based on free discussion and ideal you get a bunch of guys together exchange ideas work on problems and that's how things move forward but they're so over-the-top concerned about security they split everything off and everybody becomes stagnant it it just destroys any of the progress you can make or at least makes it go so slow they I think they wind up shooting themselves in the foot which is probably why they're arrived is bottleneck that they need to get this madman with a jet powered Honda come in and see what he could do I think that was an act of desperation I think they might have done for more time today is zooming they're still working on this thing and when you see this craft and your inside was there any indication that there was an area that they would use to control it the pilot was there a pilot seat where there's there were three seats they sat around the reactor was in the dead center of it and then equidistant around there were three seats so then that's all there was a large you would there not console is there a large rectangular objects also spaced equidistant around the center there's nothing on them there's no button that there's no lights there and they will trolls in color this everything is the same color different shape right and directly underneath and there's three levels in the craft the main level is it were talking about directly under that those are the gravity amplifiers the big rectangular object underneath them are the gravity of meters that look like for lack of a better word a trash can hanging on a pipe three of those and then the top layer I this is just my personal belief I think that has to do with that a navigation or their version of a computer with some planer panels sensor panels around the craft that we would call portholes but they're not dolls they're just black areas and I think that just determines its position in space but I was I physically the center section and I stuck my torso in the bottom section and hung upside down so I could see how the gravity amplifiers were positioned what is the name of the roughly the size of this thing it's at I think it I don't remember from being there but after all this stuff was over I had to John Andrews a guy from the testors model Corporation and we sat down and tried to figure out from what I saw and known sizes of things who came up with 52 feet in diameter and I think that's a glimpse at the other ones were they how are they different they looked completely different one look like a Jell-O mold and it it look like a classic Jell-O mold with that rippled sides do it when was a very flat disk you know like add or something like that that was sitting up on its Edge and the thin part of it had it looks like a projectile had been fired through the edge of it so I don't know if they were attempting to see if the metal could be penetrated or if something or if that's where the thing came from if it was shot down but that was the only one where I saw there was no actual physical damage to it and that one was roughly the same size they're all kind of too far away to and did there was several teams that were working on the propulsion system scissors different teams or work on these different now are crowns I don't I can only assume now when you're sitting in this thing and you're looking at this otherworldly crapped your your goal to try to figure out how this thing functions your goals try to figure out how this reactor will give you more time to just one day to check them out it wasn't one day right yeah I mean this is Barry was there I think Barry was sleeping there I'm sure they had that that isn't weird I mean up at the Tonopah test range where they work on stealth Fighters you know you go I think 3 weeks on 1 week off and you do stay up there too so it's not weird to stay up at the test site but I did I kind of thought he was going to come out after I did and I think I took so much Flack and it's so much s*** for what went on I think I actually I wound up helping security there and everybody became afraid of doing or saying anything after that so what kind of reports did you have to give like so you're not how much progress right you just trying to figure out what this thing is and it seems impossible but so we didn't personally make them I mean we were always there was never a lot of information that we gained the guy you would call him our supervisor was named was Dennis Mariani and kind of a military looking guy and he would routinely pop-in you know during the day and you know what's going on guys and he would essentially relay entering from anything new we came up with I mean he was our go-between presented him the information then he took it to wherever they were assembling all the data from everybody assume you're working normal day so I can know it was really weird that I would be only called in on certain times and certain days and they would be weird hours to most of the time was later in the evening I mean I can get a call at 11 at night and they'll say you know it's an hour by 11:45 you need to be at McCarran terminal and you know we'll let you know when we have more information what did you do while you were there or if you if you're looking at this object this reactor and you can't figure out what it is or how it works other than the fact that works on this element that we don't even know about nothing was to what you do with anything if you're trying to analyze it all you can do is perform test and all we did is try and come up with every kind of tests we possibly could I mean we tested you know it did violated a lot of what we thought was impossible to violate I mean one of the first laws of thermodynamics I mean essentially any machine any device that operates always makes extra heat nothing works at 100% efficient even the headphones are wearing anything that power some of that ours going to be converted to heat and it's just wasted this didn't I mean we looked at back then we had infrared cameras there different today but back then you had to pour liquid nitrogen into the camera to cool the sensor down and and get these infrared images you've seen but it never got no matter what the load was on the reactor it never got above the ambient temperature what does impossible I mean you're in pulling out huge amounts of power and nothing ever gets warm we tried measuring magnetic fields and there was was nothing there so we started playing around with the emission from the emitters the gravity wave itself and saw what we could do with it and how it was focused so we really spent all our time just trying to see what the stuff can do and what we can control to you were seeing what it could do what you couldn't figure out how he's doing it no not really I mean we really really could only use out or come up with a best guess now I can't say we really that I could absolutely state for certainly a certainty how anything actually worked now how did you know it all how they were piloting it because some they were doing some tests with her having these things fly around in the sky and this is what gets us deeper into your story right I was out there for one test right in fact I was in with Barry in the lab and Dennis came in and said we're about to run a test why don't you guys come out or I think you said Barry why didn't you come out here and bring Bob with you we went out there and the that was already outside the hangar and was just preparing to lift off now they were in communication with somebody in the craft to lose a person in his out there was certainly a person in there now it's not a comfortable place to be in cuz it's small so the guy has to be sitting on the floor in the middle of my best guess this is the same specific crafts that you were the only one it quietly lifted off the ground which was incredibly impressive to see her silently well quietly because it makes a little Corona discharge in the bottom of Corona discharges kind of a high-voltage brush little bluish glow discharge as it was lifting off the ground you can hear a slight hiss sound as soon as it cleared the ground by about 5 or 10 ft maybe even less than that the hissing stop and the blue go disappeared so it lifted off quietly and then it hovered silently if you want to be specific wow so then what kind of Maneuvers was it doing it took for that particular time it took off moved a little round around to the left and right and then sat back down the the craft itself they communicated with it with a wreck because I saw the guy talking and a regular VHF radio to the person in the craft and I even saw the frequency that was on the the frequency counter of the communication the transceiver there but what's weird is he shouldn't be able to communicate with the craft with a radio the radio the radio wave should bend around the craft I mean it it shouldn't be possible every single thing about these the craft in the way they operate it didn't make any sense to us I mean that something we talked about for a while after why should the frequency band around the crown well you really have to look at the way their gravity wave comes out of the Crafters the reactors in the center and there's a waveguide that goes up to the top there's actually a small appendage that sticks out of the top of the craft and it produces a heart-shaped gravitational Distortion around the craft at the craft is sitting in the air and you walk underneath it and you actually cannot see the craft the light bends around it you're bending gravity bends light it bends radio waves it's it it shouldn't be possible to communicate with a craft that has an envelope around it that's distorting all forms of energy but they were apparently in contact with it somehow or another suit through some unexplained way that they bother you so this thing Papa just do some very simple Maneuvers left right left right goes down and did they discuss this with you I mean it said they wanted you to see it now that they just want it now they they didn't discuss anything with me it said it sat down we looked around for a bit and Barry said let's go back we went back in the lab all we got to do is say it fast forward to some months later I did have the test flight schedule of the craft now they had times they have designated high performance test this obviously wasn't one that was a high performance test the high performance test went goes above the mountain range and they do much more radical moves with the thing like this is a prized item and they're not doing anything like taking it out of the atmosphere of flying around other countries or anything like that this they just play with this thing right over the test site but they were doing some radical moves with it and since I had the test flights statistically the amount of traffic in the surrounding areas on the highway was lowest on Wednesdays and that's why Denny Dennis told us that all the test flights occurred only on Wednesdays because it be the least chance of anyone would see what's going on and this was before the government had expanded The Forbidden territory around Area 51 and Papoose Lake and all that stuff right I think that occurred after my story came out then people started going up on the mountain tops and trying to look down into there and they kind of freaked out and then did the land grab and pushed everybody back but yeah that it I think all that occurred long after that I came out after my story came out then people started going up on the mountain tops and trying to look down into there and they kind of freaked out and then did the land grab and pushed everybody back but yeah that it I think all that occurred long after that I came out</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when did things get weird when did you realize that at what point in time did you say hey this is not normal work like this doesn't even seem like it's from this planet that I can't tell you what day that occurred on because so much time has gone by the days of kind of fuse got to 1 and I can't slow burn or was there a moment of recognition the first inkling I had was when I I came in normal there's this facility that is at S4 it's in the side of a mountain and normally we had pulled in with the bus and gone around the front through a normal double door this time that I went in there were Hangar doors open I went into the hangar door and in the hangar door was the disc Flying Saucer that I worked on I saw it sitting there and talk to buy it at a little American Flag stuck on the side and I thought out my God this finally explains all the Flying Saucer story this is just an advanced fighter and it's this is bugging hilarious so I went by I got reprimanded immediately for touching the thing and there was a guy in armed guard that followed as soon as you said keep your eyes forward in your hands at your side and just walk in the door so that was the first time I'd seen anything that was weird it was sometime later that I was introduced to my my lab partner Barry and we had some of the subcomponents of the craft in the lab and Barry was very anxious to get a new lab partner so he was very talkative and couldn't wait to show me different things and it was in the demonstration of the reactor working where it caught my attention to where this is technology that doesn't even exist so I mean that was the first time I knew that this is really something different what was it what was it what was it what was it about this reactor that made you think that it didn't exist technologically this was a small reactor about the size of a hemisphere about the size of a basketball on a metal plate and when it was running it produced a gravitational field a gravitational field of its own now this is something that we can't do we can't produce any Gravity the only way we get gravity is from large quantities of mass but there's no machine we can have that turns on that makes gravity like that you know you can turn on electromagnet and it makes a magnetic field to can't make a anyway this device was producing that and Barry said it's almost like he was bragging go ahead try and try and touch the spirit night I couldn't push my hands away just like two like poles of a magnet so that was wow this is something else what was your thought like when you felt that and you knew that there was nothing that you were aware of that could pretend that connected me to the briefings that I read on the 1st day at asked for was that you know everything that I read was apparently accurate what were you reading it was kind of an overview this project was to back engineer the alley and crafts and specifically it was to try and back engineer and see if we can duplicate the technology with available materials now to do this they split the project into your many different pieces for several reasons they do this on all classified projects so nobody has the complete story but they compartmentalize everything that we had the power and propulsion system so what the briefings they gave me were like a one or two-page overview of the other projects that were going on you know when the craft the only reason they do that is just in case what you're working on is connected intimately in some way that we don't know up to one of the other projects you have to know their existence so everything from Metallurgy to the craft and these were all you know I was just propulsion and it made it very clear that what I read was accurate so when you reading that before you actually saw the reactor what were your thoughts on what they were describing if you knew that something like that didn't exist and they describe me in the briefings what did you think you were going to say I really I didn't know what the time I mean it was read it I thought is this is some kind of test see if you're crazy I'm crazy too you know a lot of times we'll take it real high security jobs I mean Bill intentionally insert nonsense into him whether it's to confuse the fact or if we're someone was to leak it out they would carry that information along and know where it came from so I read through the documents but you know I didn't know if this was in a part of some kind of test or what or was it you potentially realistic I mean I'd really didn't consider it being all that possible as far as being the actual thing that I was going to work on it the time how did they turn it on the reactor small Tower in the middle when you put the hemisphere on the reactor activate the reactor shut it's it's load-sensing so if there's if there's no load on the reactor at all it shuts down when there's a load present on it it starts up again load meaning you can consider it an electrical load so although it doesn't necessarily operate electrically there's no wiring that connects any of the subcomponents together whatsoever they just have to be in the immediate vicinity it's it is the stuff is borderline magic and that's essentially where we left it you know when I left the project so there was no progress made there was some progress I mean we did identify at least we think some processes in and had a rough idea we think of what was going on but I think this is a problem that they've had for a long time and you know that I was replacing somebody that Barry worked with prior to me and I think there was some accident that I didn't have a whole lot of information on but you know Berry alluded to that horrific accident like we're someone died or somebody died because they were trying to tamper with things or figure out how something worked yeah and now they had they had more than one there that was supposedly the nuclear test and that but it was at the time remember they were still do an underground nuclear test at the test site but from what I understand according to Barry there was an attempt made on this must have been a pretty desperate attempt because it's not a very scientific process to cut you know analyze something that way but it looks like they used a plasma cutter or something I got to cut into an operating reactor how many of these things do they have they had nine nine craft altogether I only got Hands-On with one of them so I can say what the hell the others operated by see the other ones ya at one time and only one time the bay doors that between the hangers were all open and I could see all the way through and where the all exactly the same know they were all different different shapes yeah but they were all from somewhere else yeah absolutely did anyone make any attempt to explain or two to tell you where they came no no no one is the least bit interested in letting everybody know all the facts they want to give you the minimum information that's necessary to complete your task so you're not getting the story of where they came from you're not getting the story of what how much progress other people are making you just focus on the small component but they gave you some indication that they've been working on this for a while yeah when do you think they acquired these I really couldn't say I think they've been around for a while so they bring you into this room you see this reactive working you you realize this is nothing that is far as like the scientific community at that current time has the ability to create what is your life like from that moment on is that where everything changes cuz I mean I would imagine the moment you actually make contact with something that's extraterrestrial object or being something where you can actually absolutely be certain it's not from here your whole Paradigm the whole world you live in is now a different place well this is the only time it became exciting you know the rest of the time there it was really an ominous feeling being at work but it at that time it was exciting I mean this was a now I knew we were on the absolute Beyond actually be on The Cutting Edge of Science and I was I was so absolutely excited to be there every single time I was with this was a fantastic opportunity and however in short order it began to concern me we really have no idea what we're talking about and the excitement kind of turned to dread at some point because the amount of power were dealing with is astronomical I mean to affect gravity to reduce the effects like this equipment does takes huge amounts of power and I've given the example before of you know taking a small portable nuclear reactor in and I'm putting it back into Victorian times we don't what the scientists of the time and just dropping it on her room and they come and look at it and see that it's producing power and wonder how it works at least start taking it apart and as soon as they get some of the shielding off the people are going to drop dead cuz of the radiation inside now the people have no idea that he radiation even exist back then but anybody that comes in to check on him will also drop dead and you know there's no reason that that exact scenario couldn't happen with what we're dealing with we have no idea how that physics operate within this thing the power levels are alright like I said Astrid like it's incredibly dangerous to Tinker with something like that and you know in some respects we were guinea pigs just try to find out how to make this tonight so that it had a series as far as you surmised that a series of different scientists try to back engineer this thing try to figure out what this thing was and they would bring a new people in like let's throw Bob at it during the analysis are the reactor itself and you don't know how many have worked on it and no one gave any could have been there for fifty years I could have been there for five years and what are they saying as much information as possible find out if we can duplicate it the newest relays you where it was from the never let you ask questions about where it's from well if the information I read in the briefings was accurate now what I do have to say is the information that pertain directly to the reactor was accurate what I read did I mean did jive with reality How It Was Made how what we saw how it operated them yeah what turned on and what was discovered discovered about it I'm sorry the migraine is really making it hard for me to thank you we talked at before the podcast indicated that this was from reticulum star system now ya know how they obtained that I haven't I haven't the slightest idea but it wasn't just from The Zeta reticuli star system it was what they called zr3 so it was at third planet in that star system so there was no other information about it other than that supposedly where the crab came from now is that true I don't have no way of verifying that but that was printed in the same materials that reference the reactor now I look that stuff up when I went home and Zeta reticuli is a binary star two stars that orbit orbit one another and it's only visible in the Southern Hemisphere and it's about 30 some-odd light-years away so that's literally all the information I have about that I don't know how they found out it came from there and you also probably have some suspicions that they give you some disinformation like you were talking about before or the Ya-Ya to mean if you ever decided to talk Mother's Day out in a bunch of nonsense to make whatever is factual look ridiculous right or be able to trace it down I got to pay this fax came out and you know this is our guy said it came from Zeta reticuli so they knew it was the desert is it Brian's awesome I get as in my twenties totally kicked out before that that was before 2 before before you say hose is where it's at before it doesn't matter the days have fused together it's so hard to separate what happened in each visit to the thought process when you read that it's from Zeta reticuli I thought maybe after this they're just going to give me a test and see what I can remember and crazy information but like I said when I finally went in with Barry and that hands-on experience with what they were talking about it. Kind of completely different meaning so there's a plate is this thing that looks like a half a basketball and when it's on you can't come anywhere near you can't touch it gravity about that the concept of gravity most people is gravity's bringing something towards it right well I guess you would say it Antigravity its gravity shifted 180 degrees it so you know any gravity and did they have any understanding about what could possibly create this effect did they have any areas where they like you to look into know they well I knew there was a fuel source in it and they were proficient at making it work and again my analogy to something like this as you can drop my motorcycle off in the Wagon Train days and just leave it with the keys parked outside you know somebody's Place everybody will come around it and I'll poke and prod and eventually they'll turn the key get it to start and become proficient writing it but they won't be able to understand what the hell is going on they won't be able to make a plastic fender much less anything else and I think that's exactly the state we were at we played around with the parts long enough before I got there where they could make the reactor operate take the fuel out and know that it makes it work how exactly what was going on in the reactor main to mystery at the time I think we made some progress on what was going on inside but I don't think anybody really knew anything what was going on in the reactor name the mystery at the time I think we made some progress on what was going on inside but I don't think anybody really knew anything they could just watch what was going on and make note of it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I first heard your story decades go by I told you last night we went out to dinner I've seen pretty much every interview you've ever given I've followed the story incredibly closely but people don't know story let's give them the bullet points you used to work at Area 51 in Area 51 got you like you worked in what would you how would you describe it I guess within the area 51 compound you can call that a subset of Area 51 and you got that job before that you were working before that I had worked at Los Alamos National Labs in New Mexico and you were involved in what kind of work they do everything there so how did the to say hey Bob want to come on out to the Nevada desert well the way this went down was at that time I was 1982 I I put a jet engine in my my Honda and Los Alamos put it on the front page of the paper so do you know how Los Alamos man does 200 mile an hour Honda Jet Car that I drove to work everyday so I was known in Los Alamos for the guy with the weird car and let you know you could hear it from you know a mile away anyway the day that came out on the front page of the paper was the day Edward Teller the father of the hydrogen bomb was giving a lecture down there at the lab and we didn't have much going on that day in our group and I asked if I could down there and I went down there early and it tell her was outside leaning on a brick wall there and reading the front page of the paper now is a guy at a history so I introduced myself Family Guy you're reading about there and we talked for a little while and it was cool to Las Vegas and Los Alamos yeah I left start other businesses and and that sort of thing so I sent resumes out and one of them went out to Ed teller and referenced our meeting you know back it back in the day and anyway he remembered me and gave me a reference somebody to contact the tg&amp;g and that's pretty much how it started so you get a phone call or a letter like what he get I got what did I get I got a letter initially and went down for an interview probably a couple times and it was down at eg&amp;g special projects which was at McCarran airport at that time in Las Vegas and did they give you any sort of job description what you were applying for they said it was her I can't remember exactly what they did this was a long time ago but I think it was Advanced propulsion or some like that something relatively generic and they said it's in a remote area you know what's going to be some days on some days off and you know it was kind of a it was not exactly a full-time job but you might have to be out there for two weeks at a time and take two weeks off so it was kind of the work schedule be kind of broken up and do the same work at the test site anybody it's familiar with the area up there you know working at the nuclear test site or at the Tonopah test range North of there that's typically how things go so you had known about it from the scientific Community because it is Area 51 at that time was nuclear testing Nevada Nevada that whole area was there's been does giant chunks of Nevada that there's a big piece of Nevada and it's split up into different areas there's a nuclear test site there is Area 51 there's the Tonopah test range North of that there's little subary there's areas where they test chemical weapons and things like that so it's all broken up as a few no gigantic test area so take me back to first day on the job you accept a job they take you out there yeah it's the first day really I didn't really get to see a whole lot the first day was essentially just paperwork that's what I flew into Area 51 proper and I left McCarran airport and flew what they call the Janet flights just you know a passenger plane from Las Vegas to Area 51 and it was really just going through a mountain of paperwork that day from security clearance 51 and it was really just going through a mountain of paperwork that day from security clearances to God there was it was like two or three hours of just solid paperwork in that was that was really an uneventful first day</div>

Conversations like people ask me why I said that that wasn't a question I wasn't supposed to ask you were supposed to ask her family is added that f****** the whole lineage right the whole family thought Terrence it down off the wall like a Native American how many dream catchers were in the garbage that weekend the garbage that weekend holyshit just feather sticking out of heavy bags in the whole family</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> imagine being born the Dalai Lama so from the jump You're Something Special is the chosen one and the One You're The Reincarnation of who was it supposed to be there at oku it's what it's called and the way it would work would be like if you look at the history of tube at it was called The Hermit Kingdom and it was closed off from the rest of the world is very hard to get in there Seven Years in Tibet is about somebody who made it through and became friends of the dolly llama as a kid anyway so within the system there is this idea that beings reincarnate and that if you're awake and enough if you're like really like it the sort of last phase of the sort of what would you call at this cycle you were talking about earlier then you stop losing at least some of the Amnesia that happens when you get processed through the liminal in between. Called the Bardo between this incarnation in the next play children they put in front of them the particular items that belong to the previous Incarnation that they think they are oracles Vision Visionaries bring the monks to a particular Village and then the kid picks it and then that pic kid becomes the next this or that it's called a toq how many kids do they look up okay so like it's similar to like what the f*** is the what is the thing where those kids get one summer to go like the summer of f****** what is that really yeah that's almost that's Rumple Devil's Playground in the smoke and then a lot of them come back feel empty I believe that was one of the ways they study the impact of MDMA wasn't it by like his like these like if you find someone who's taking MDMA but no other drug is pretty rare so you need to find a person is only taking MDMA otherwise he can't like ass ass there's some cognitive damage cuz it could have been the acid it could have been the mushrooms given the time you fell on your ass when you're hammered it who the f*** knows but these kids some of them have only taking MDMA and so I believe that they use them as a sample that like determine if there was any kind of neurological damage caused by the drug itself but so I think it's similar phenomena happens within that system where some kids are like I'm not a drinker musician music and they leave what when did that happen I didn't know that told him I think the dolly llama might hook them up till one of those guys over there told him that he was The Reincarnation of someone super special Jesus God it's a big deal over there they had a ceremony and everything formation A7 this is the long written thing about about it drag dorje Monastery so he's coming back again and again what are you going to be like if you're making money the fucken psychic and you're like well you have basically like a gutter rat you were the only been a rat you weren't even your mucus thing like I'm not sure what you call it a kind of jellyfish that killed babies or a tapeworm I told you it's a statement from the guy I'm recognized my student Steven Seagal as Reincarnation toku of the treasure revealer Chung dragged or uncertainty as to what this means I'm writing to clarify the situation motoki system and the Dalai Lama's even said that and recognizing that cuz what school is it he said you know it's not he's very rational and he said if science proves something in Buddhism is off will change Buddhism to fit the rational mind that's the beauty of Buddhism there's pageantry in it there's ceremony there's ritual in it just like any other religion it's beautiful personally I think that there is a sort of area of experience accessible through their practices that I guess could best be compared to psychedelics or something like that but to me what I love about it is all the pageantry aside and all of it aside it's not faith-based it's a very basic series of ideas that you have to digest you have to think about you have to look into you don't just get to be it it's you don't maybe some forms of it there could be an example of that but in general it's more along the lines of here's the basic fundamental principles behind this not in the in the cording of a human life that we've discovered here's where some suffering is coming from all the suffering in fact and here's how to fix it that's the four noble truths of Buddhism that just hearing it who the f*** you could hear life is suffering the cause of suffering is attachment get rid of attachment suffering in here's the system to get rid of attachment and you know whatever life is suffering with all your f****** mean what is life is even mean what does it even mean by suffering this this first Noble Truth it gets completely mistranslated anyway Duca it means wobbly wheel it's more akin to like if you're riding a bike that's got not enough air in it it's going to be a rough ride but it's going to be even more of a rough ride if you semi trick yourself into thinking there's enough air in the tire so that any time you hit some bumps you like what the f*** is wrong with the world that's it that's it it's like wobbly wheel to things wonky you think you're not going to get disconnected me been on the line with Verizon for an hour if you're going to get disconnected it tends to happen you're going to get cut off in traffic you're going to fail you're going to be disappointed this is reality but somehow you've imagined that it doesn't work and every single time you're mad with the truth you're like oh God this sucks and you know that creates a lot of problems and it creates to some ways to deal with it which is desire an aversion so you're somewhere and you want to be somewhere else basically you know you're you're somewhere and you're like I don't want to be in this place or you do you're imagining that if you get this thing or that thing the pain you're feeling is of the wobbly wheel go away Dune experiment see if it's true see if it's true that's all you can do is like really look at the s*** that you want like I could come home and mow could have pulled up and giving me 7 mode ones right and I'm going to sit and play those f****** mode ones for weeks and weeks if I'm sweaty and smell like f****** just someone shoved a salami under the balls of an ape you know I'm not going to take a shower being into the mug and sneezing into it anyway the point is eventually after I the distraction is gone away I'm going to return to my fundamental self you know it is the fundamental condition of existence is it is regardless and to this is sort of the print some of the principles as I understand it but you're really quite intelligent you know it's really an in what I love about it most of all there's always this invitation which is go see go see it's not because I'm Buddhist believe it it's like go see maybe it's different for you and and what you need to go check like every time you're doing the thing that you've been repeating over and over again is it making you happy for real is it really working is it working and if it's working great but if it's not and you're trying to pretend it is because you've been doing it so long well who's winning this game of self-deception what what there's no winning if the game is tricking you what and what do you do at how do you feel about life if you're always tricking yourself through the world yeah man that's right you will only feel that the everyone is trying to trick you and you'll feel like there's a grand conspiracy and you'll feel like the world is out to get you in there is a grand conspiracy which is that you are running a game on yourself you only feel that the everyone is trying to trick you and you'll feel like there's a grand conspiracy and you'll feel like the world is out to get you in there is a grand conspiracy which is that you are running a game on your self</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> O'jays on Twitter I saw that s*** to see the one guy who made a parody video of his welcome Twitter world made this weird dad video that's so strangely what's the word no disingenuous a little bit from the football injuries there's a struggle I am very sensitive to people that have been hit in the head a lot of time struggling to talk cuz I look for it I seen people I don't want to see you then and it's scary we all talked about it I like people that work for the UFC fighters trainers its people do kickboxing everyone talks about seeing certain folks yeah some folks will start to talk about it about themselves and now they're having a problem that's what I got was listening to that so I could go to the world yeah it was a weird mom at man that's a cool that that that thing that happens to people who have like done shity things where instead of just saying like yeah I f***** up and you can't say you kill somebody right well you can but if you do that you're going to send the interview I think for anybody who's done should he sings the one we just say it you get to be standing again on real grounds like the real terrain is that a like the b******* world even living in but when you decide not to do that then you do have this like it's like The Uncanny Valley like you have this like Android quality to you because you're not reflecting reality reflecting reality after you put lipstick on it and sunglasses and come to tear with some perfume on I got a nose job like someone's been getting plastic surgery for years until you're pretending that that's your existence you seem like people are getting sentenced for killing people and they're like the look on their f****** face is like so confused because they have created this Valley in between that person the person they are and you know it's split in half essentially and they can't deal with I wouldn't there I don't remember it was a dream I didn't know I didn't do it and Gacy I should be I should be sent it to running a funeral home without a license he was saying when he was out of town people were bearing kid dead kid body is under his f****** house you do any minute Guild f****** you strangled f****** kids that you dress like a f****** clown you know an inn like killed kids like it's so unpalatable to deal with that s*** because you're just a crazy lunatic who was out of control so you'd rather make up a story usually it's conspiratorial yeah Jesus Christ I know and then that's the people voice over which I believe you did it now but the problem with that is there was a f****** emoji that he tweeted at this guy he's do not have direct message with this guy and he had like 16 knives and he said he's going to cut them like if that's true if you really did send that if it's not photoshopped if that's not bullshiting you imagine getting a DM from OJ cuz you made it free video I can't guess what he did was he put O'Jays video where he was talking and in the background is someone screaming help call the police help help and so then OJ Simpson has direct message allegedly who knows what really happened who knows but if it did dude I would find a cave somewhere I can get you if you wanted to I bet if he disappears through that video I know the golf course that's behind you so I could figure out where your house is and I wouldn't do that but somebody else might yeah that was hilarious Norm Macdonald so funny broadcast I don't know what he can do though while he's got this is Netflix deal I don't know where it's at I don't know if he has a contract but he should do a podcast so goddamn National travesty that he doesn't have a podcast he's so f****** funny and he said some crazy s*** like if I give you about someone saying something you will you believe that you'd have to be you'd have to have Down syndrome like you thought that would be better than saying you have to be retarded that you have to be you have to have Down syndrome like you thought that would be better than saying you have to be retarded</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Joe I'm sorry too like I want I like I said I thought those questions for him an outfit Kathleen to ask my questions on their show and it's not in the moment like we have to do that I really I know you probably talked about it but I wanted to hear your take on deepfake cuz like that f****** deepfake of you really bothered me like it set off like a whole series of thoughts in my head that like of all the futuristic s*** that free you are so much like me it's easy for them to do it because they basically got a library of all the sounds that we can make with our mouths and so they put it in a database and then they can get you say words you've never said before in order that you've never said them before in a way that you can kind of distinguish for now I kind of can hear that it's fake but it was me talking about sponsoring a hockey team filled all chimpanzees yeah and it's it's closed you don't me they had one a few years ago that they did with Ronald Reagan where they had a fake speech and this was way way before the internet and someone had pieced together a fake collaboration of a bunch of different Ronald Reagan speeches and then use them with sound editing and turned it into a whole statement that he never gave before and then the white house went on television and showed how they did it and show it on the news all the different speeches that they pulled from and the actual sentences where they pulled them they showed it to you so there could be no denying someone I think it was maybe the Russians or the Russians of course someone that done that people don't know I don't know who did it but it was interesting Ronald Reagan is giving speeches you just take listen someone with painstaking detail mark down all the words no speeches put them all in a sort of a multiloop cuz it's hearing you have to go like to Phil spector's house they have the old-school reel-to-reel recorders it up and then release it pretend that Ronald Reagan's trying to start a war with Iran eat out of that the recording I don't I kind of remember it but it's a foggy memory man pretty wild this is like to meet suck the Sun and all the things to worry about this s*** is really intense man what do you know about the hostage the f****** weird hostage iPhone thing people are doing where they're like you get a phone call from the phone number of your wife and you answer it and it's like we've not your wife get ahold of someone freaking out in the background so I can send his money if she's f***** and like they've been right now they've been doing is they've been needed someone if they let me talk to her and they just hand it to some lady have been sending the money you know and like when you consider like what happens when deepfake technology intersects with just the ability to like call people from numbers and it suddenly if someone gets your phone number list they're going to be able to call your friends is you and record conversations for it is a sort of dredge up you know who knows whatever they want maybe they want to Blackmail you maybe want to get money maybe they won't embarrass you that's me is like so spectacularly f****** weird that we're going to end up having to have passwords that we tell each other away from her Alexis which is listen if I call you and I'm seeing strange you know that paid up the password is like go 469 otherwise it's not me you know cuz that's it that's a reality we just look up people are already f****** doing with spoofing numbers that's f***** up man and like that that aspect of it and also just like supply and demand in other words there's one Joe Rogan right right now but if an AI and improving on you and I'm saying you know 5 or 10 years no offense man but maybe in a I can like turn you twice as smart you do make me like whatever who-knows-what and then suddenly you're no longer in demand in the sense that once the Joe Rogan AI package goes on the dark web or makes its way into wherever people are going to be able to download you and have conversations with you and make video entering into is one where you're going to go on YouTube there's going to be a video of you looks like you sounds like you but it's like 50 times funnier than you 50 times cooler than you 50 times smarter than you is it's an AI pulling from the Internet it's just you but better and no one's going to watch you and you takeover obsolete versions of all that's right man and that's not intelligence your Consciousness into a computer like what's the stop you from making multiple copies if you can make one copy what's to stop you from being a tell me some fat guy with a little dick was a real a****** wouldn't hack into the system and infest it with copies of him overwhelms everyone else's day to where he is omnipotent and he is literally the ruler of the realm that he exists in cuz he's figured out how to hack into the grid and take over imagine you think you're going to be in heaven you're going to enter into this virtual reality but look you going to get to fly dragons and have sex with beautiful women and eat fruit and this fat guy with a little dick he hacks the system and everybody's going to suck his dick and Everywhere You Go is a version of him and try to get you suck his dick that's what he created and I mean that's where the computer virus is a f****** everybody right if you think about that that Moses is a lot of viruses I don't know what, what percentage of virus is Jamie you know this or not financially motivated who's got me some viruses that people create just to f*** people right in the old days for sure man I mean I use it against either just like you know shutting your computer down to be a dick or making it's a weird thing so you know real basic the old viruses in the days of AOL remember those men that are cool they were like scary but not like today where they like shut down the power grid until you send somebody a million dollars worth of bitcoin or you have to completely wipe your hard drive completely re-upload your operating system just kills every of the only way you going to kill the operating system clean start from scratch sorry it's all cooked yeah all your work f*** off gone gone now floodplain back to this being like the Weeping Angel program or the CIA can use your TV to listen to your conversations and they are doing that and the recording it what a great name that's f****** weird but like you know the implication that they in your deepfake that they sent out to the world was it already happened you know they're like how do you know this hasn't already happened in other words like how do we know we're not duplicates how do we know we're not one of an infinite number and array of like you know versions of ice that are being populated all over some server somewhere if things keep going the way they are like I was going to bring this up when we're talking about people like looking at cities and looking at the grids and looking at the hive like what is the what are the cities doing well they're spreading and it being productive the making things and then make me better things all the time while they're making better things all the time like what were they interested in other ancient computers and CGI and artificial intelligence and artificial life and and they're all definitely moving in some sort of a a greater techno magical dependency like we're pretty dependent now but going to get greater and greater will get more and more one day they're going to have a reality that isn't tangible in the sense that without this system you wouldn't be able to experience it but it will be a reality once you're in the system once you're in the system you will feel your elbows on the oak. sweat on your palms you'll feel the sunglasses on your nose you'll feel all those things so who's to say that that's not real that can happen one day if they can create an artificial reality cannot discern from the reality of currently experiencing how do you know when I've already happened right you don't you don't you know some super smart people think that we should keep open the possibility that that is what we're operating under or that the stability and virginity of the dimension that we exist in is not nearly as firm and not nearly as permanent as we like to think it is which is one of the reasons why psychedelics is so exciting and so there's they're so there's hope their transformative but they're also their valuable but they're also they illuminate the possibility of others of other things other dimensions other life-forms other levels of consciousness of other ways of interacting with each other especially much Mom. All of them all of them that when you take a transformative dose experience some weird thing we like oh this is possible to like this is like a whole nother way of existing like who's to say that if we rewrite if that's what's causing depression and dopamine and serotonin all these different things that happen when you're sleeping and then the Psychedelic ones like the DMT who's to say that we have to exist with this mixture right who's to say that life with a a thicker mixture isn't also possible and might be going on around us all the time like there might be these porous entryways into these other dimensional that are consistently open and closed in their con around the summertime but when were when were just in straight normal Consciousness that we experience without perturbing it with alcohol or pot or psychedelics we want to think that this is reality this is rigid this is it but maybe it's a reality of them maybe when you make decisions you enter into different ones maybe you're constantly shifting the one that's around you and how you interact with people you mean like your the way you navigate through the Multiverse it's entirely possible right yeah yeah man it is a thing if you if you if you just think about how little we understand about Consciousness about happens when you die what happens when you sleep with how little we know about what what is going on when you're communicating with people what is going on when you're interacting with people what we are these f****** ideas coming from life-forms f****** ideas coming from are these ideas little life forms in a non observe state</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the funniest f****** thing is how much we lie to ourselves that's where it gets amazing it's like you know you were talking about and I've done the exact same thing with screen time when you're presented that humiliating number of hours and you've been telling friends you're busy and you're f****** looking at that just think you like dude I've been like you know looking at b******* but then before you do that you like but it's my job you know I've got to kind of be online like know you're addicted to technology and because you can't stand the fact that you don't have to discipline to stop using it you would rather make up a story involving some absolutely verifiable b******* so that you don't have to deal with the fact that you are in full control of yourself and it's a non rewarding Edition which is really strange it's like when you looking at stories on like the Apple news feed or something you're scrolling looking for something is going to Captivate you start reading this and I can't Huawei can sell laptops near how much of that am I like you were saying earlier how much that is junk thoughts ya thoughts like junk food junk food you just consumed a consuming but a purpose in the sense of like if you apply a little bit of like mine when you're losing your phone how do I feel right now you know I'm talking about like I don't fuk with you you realize you feel a specific way it's it's kind of like numbness there's a quality of like a kind of like sedated numbness to the hypnotic State you've been lulled into by the algorithms and there's some pleasant kind of like I guess you could compare it to some like low-level euphoric painkiller but not very euphoric mostly just mild numbness it's pretty good at turning off anxiety in the set where you could at least this place your own personal anxiety like if I'm scanning through my phone and I find the inevitable bad news whatever form it's in I could pretend that my anxiety is related to that news you know and then that's when you get people who are very anxious and they say I've seen it I'm here in this beautiful place and I can enjoy it because of our president so I don't I'm not sure that's the real reason why you can't enjoy that place I think it might be actually that you haven't dealt with the fact that you're a you're freaking the f*** out right that to me is like this the purpose of a phone it's very good at tricking yourself into thinking that the reason you feel like s*** is because of something happening in the world it's a band with you too and here's what the problem with that is sometimes you have to take these legitimate thoughts and when you have these legitimate thoughts meaning like something you working on something you or your like whether it's an idea or trying to do on stage or something else another project that you're doing these things they require your bandwidth right and when you are always looking at your phone it chips away percentages of your bandwidth 10 he or five there when I'm there at 7 there and you don't think about it I'm still counting on the project project project project project the really no really you're in Two Rivers at the same time you're in this wacky River of nonsense and wondering who got this and how much they're getting in this divorce and who died in Dominican Republic oh my God another person of interest if you want to look at all the bad stuff that happens among seven billion people you have to think of all the interactions that humans all the literally billions of interactions Everyday People consoling occasionally one goes f****** Western one goes sideways and that's the one you see on YouTube Jesus Christ this world going a s*** and then you watch another one and you watch another one you watch infectious diseases and snake bites and what happens when you get nutted necropsy when you're f****** flesh starts falling off the next thing you know you're f****** just num-num to your real life because you're taking in data from you everywhere yeah that's it f*** man and it's like then that gets inside of you and now you're just a turbulent you have a turbulent self that is digested a version of the world that's only half true and so because of that you're going to be half a person because you're not looking into like your own whatever the f*** you are you know what are you what are you like that how much do you even think about what are you yeah how much time have you spent to me it's like the craziest s*** that like your your we were talking about the sex drive being this insane compulsory engine inside every sentient being that way that I notice of course is exceptions but like this is if you're writing a computer write this would be a line of code right it keeps you going keeps you going keeps you going so to me something is f****** astounding we weird is why the fuk can people not sit still and be quiet for periods exceeding 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes literally the least metabolically out of sleeping right you're what you're not really exerting energy when you're sitting still and being quiet your not really doing much and yet if you ask I can ask a person if they wanted to go for a walk The Pusher I'll go for a walk but if you want to sit with me for like 10 minutes quietly it's weird I get it don't like no I don't want to do that what the f*** is that to me that if not that I believe in simulation Theory but if I wanted to prove it or like play around with it that were like non-player characters in some Superman simulator experiment would be like oh sit still why the fuk can't you sit still why is it that some of your mind goes insane why is it suddenly that you got to get out why do you feel bored or crazy or f****** like overheated or anxious or nervous he productive Duncan yeah that's why that's why everybody wants stimulants yeah real reason is like people are carrying a disordered Universe inside of them and when they sit down and there's nothing to look at except what's around them they're forced to deal with the fact that actually a lot of the disturbance in their life is more related to an interior like Maelstrom of thoughts and unexplored feelings and then this is just basically shape entire existence there like in every single moment recreating a universe of disorder and then getting really upset because if you see this order in the world and it keeps reappearing like your friend is like why do I get taken in by these people all the time it's like you can take these people all the time because inside of you is a behavior pattern that is replicating this phenomena and you're pretending that it's not in you to the point where it's a mystery it's like why did you know when I drive somewhere I'm not like one of my car drive me here you know unless on my f****** high out of my mind and shouldn't be driving level hits a certain number how about an ice-cold Coca-Cola Duncan yeah I can hurt you that one cuz you're right I need a cake to go along with it water who wants to go and buy water according to my f****** guts or a nice IPA is bitter yellow liquid that tastes like wheat to play around with it being that when I am reaching for the thing whatever it may be that I know I shouldn't be doing is in the sense of fun while I like watching the rationalization that my mind starts spitting out for it you know like doing this because it's like you know I'm relaxing you know what this celebratory moment I feel a little bummed out and you look at like the instant way your mind tries to come up with a b******* story to write off the fact that you are riding around in a vehicle that you can't control and that is not a very appealing way to be no one wants to hear the pilots a guys taking my hands off the wheel what you see what happens for the next 10 minutes and yet their whole lives are like that he just taking their hands off the wheel but then they're trying to make sense of it you know like how many times do you mean alcoholic who hasn't accepted yet there an alcoholic and they're like telling you all these reasons for you see my childhood man you just got to understand my childhood or my riding I'm a better Rider when I'm drunk or on and on and on and on the reality is you're addicted my childhood man you just got to understand my childhood or helps my riding I didn't I'm a better writer when I'm drunk or on and on and on and on and it's like know the reality is your f****** hooked you're addicted you can't stop your hand from breaking something in your f****** mouth and you can't deal with that because who wants to deal with that s*** man I want to be in control so I'll make up a story I'll make up a story</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I mean it's almost isn't always doesn't always kind of seemed like the most boring possible solution is usually the right one it's like what's the most boring thing most boring thing is not things happening but you're Imagining the dog is somehow a telepathic link to you we're seeing that the you know Navy is releasing these videos of these Tic Tacs zipping around and its Navy Pilots it's not the people we interviewed in that show its Navy pilots who are like yeah I don't know what the f*** this is and I was I have great conversations with Uber drivers and programmers and s*** and then in the type of radar they're using I think it must be a glitch that's the most likely reality do not I don't think so I think we're just picking it up on radar and so he like it maybe it's a glitch or maybe it's like we should find another can you Google if the pilots were picking it up on radar the pilot spotted UFO to see if they've because I know some guys have spotted things with their own eyes I know I know for sure some guys have I just I'm not sure if relevance the conversation people listening going to f*** but I feel like a big issue. radar from 1 to Pilots through piles okay I believe it but I want to see why do I want to see more like what am I and you'll get caught up and it'll it'll chew up hours of your dad because they didn't understand what it happened to them they've gotten caught in this weird Loop of looking for secrets and looking for Mysteries to be solved and looking for hidden conspiracies and they get caught in that in some of that s*** is real which is part of the problem some of it you can come across the Gulf of Tonkin in the Northwoods operation Northwoods you can come across a bunch of them that are real and Ronnie can see how they put that together you like what you can see real crazy conspiring yeah and then you can get lost and think it's everywhere that's right aavs what does that mean typically fly fly initially the Princeton's radar team the radar really hype Rockstar Prince story is what it's called it's like a really high processing radar systems why is it spelled Princeton didn't believe what they're seeing chalking up the anomaly soon equipment malfunction but after they determined that everything was operating as it should they began detecting instances which AAA Visa speed to lower busier they approach the Princeton's Commander about taking action is that I was chomping at the bit I really wanted to intercept these things what we have the f****** crazy people in this country call them aavs, it's not a flying object arrived on the scene the pilot didn't see any flying objects but they did observe with the lead pilot Commander David fravor later referred to as a disturbance in the ocean the water was turning with white waves breaking over what looked like a large object just under the surface about 50 feet above the water pray for the commander of the elite Black Aces Squadron so goddamn Nicolas Cage movie who is a Top Gun program graduate Clifton more than 16 years of flying experience described it as about 40 feet long shaped like a ticket at Handy with no obvious means of propulsion it's white it has no wings it has no rotors I go holyshit what is that dude you know they got whoever the company that makes Tic Tacs you just say Tic Tac enough you remember those old subliminal things he's doing movie theaters when you're watching a movie and it is a hungry popcorn like every like 5100 frame they would stick like a hungry eat popcorn the first thing that pops in your eyes it looks like a mint that's nuts there had to be other ways to describe adults talking to Dutch bro for sure I Google Tic Tac after he said that to her cuz I couldn't remember if there was square or if they were like take units that's what I like the best because that kind of lines up with hollow Earth theory and nothing like that maybe like they're flying down he's in the center of the earth flyover I was just know why you fly over five hours of water just water the Strava heat maps that seem to show people walking under the ocean and stuff walking yeah we haven't you know it's like for you to track your steps and some people apparently weren't some faces in the article in the ocean walking around and it showed up before they can like turn that function off or top secret facilities like the places they blur out on Google Maps who do you think there's like a military base water somewhere with submarines go you know I want to think that but I'm always the movie The Meg yeah I think it's probably a technical error but f*** maybe I mean I don't know it's like the implication of these take tax and all of it if you really want to like the first to me the most obvious one- to Turning water evidence is it it's some kind of equipment malfunction was also that they have an unlimited budget for Black Ops we don't know what that number is that's right we don't get to know all that weird s*** they do in the making stealth bombers and all that area 51 stuff and how much money goes to that like what is the number of it what's Google this how much does the u.s. spend on Black Ops I was going to bring this up in the middle of the advanced Aerospace threat Haitian program what's going on 112 and the sedative doesn't still go on but apparently it does Luis Elizondo was it still operating in that he is part of what they spent $20 to see if the UFOs were a threat a year I would love it if it was</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> say I believe in gravity you would think I was crazy if I said was be a crazy thing to say what you know I believe there's gravity there is gravity it's testable it works but what do you always hear when people are like if you want to succeed what are you do you believe in yourself and it's what wait what do you mean believe in yourself I am a self why do I have to believe in it right so that it's a clunky way of saying self-doubt is crippling self-doubt you know rejection I hate myself I love myself all these things have within its concept of the self and a lot of folks have not spent much time really exploring like what is it what is the self like what is my particular self and I think it kind of reminds me of when we are Sasquatch imagine that their signs up they've never really quite seen the Bigfoot eat but you don't remember the feather in the trail it's a gift it means he likes you taking and leaving gifts taking their gifts and leaving their own gift swapping gifts yeah yeah she's a butt about her whole life and then the family just fell out of it and then they started realizing like they start going into the history of it and they start thinking it was Preposterous it was right around my Book of Mormon was coming out to you know that was hilarious musical this great is really good but the problem is like growing up in that fundamentalist background makes me very susceptible to like healers and like psychics and clairvoyants and b******* Are Spiritual people she's like I get sucked into b******* and she was like almost kind of upset. Almost like she was kind of upset but like perplexed like how do you rewire yourself when you've been trained to believe that a 14 year old boy in 1820 found golden tablets that contain the Lost work of Jesus and all them Native Americans were the Lost tribe of Israel, I mean this is that's the story and she said she's out son and that's sad to man because like if you take you could take some like basic tenants which are true and not based on a kind of magic like you do you hear someone is taking Ayahuasca and he comes to you and he's got a profound message that came down from some mythological creature a dragon butterfly his told him some kind of profound and you realize machine for 1313 whenever we're talking about the mythological creature said something to them long lines if you need to love yourself more you need to give more to your community whatever the messages but if your Uber driver said that to you it wouldn't get through because it wasn't like phosphorescent. Multiple heads so similarly with these religions what happens if you do get some real Transcendent wisdom that's sort of timeless the reject the good stuff inside of it and not to me it's a big tragedy of any kind of fundamentalist litoralis interpretation is being forced on people is because within that is inevitably something great wouldn't be so viral like Christianity wouldn't be here right now if there wasn't a core thread in it that had a beautiful message in it and it makes people nicer people actually have a really big conversation very good friend about it and we're saying like I think it for some people it's an amazing framework than a guide to live your life I really do believe that I have several friends are very devout Christians yeah they are the nicest people I know and Mormons by the way I have friends that are Mormons still to this day I have several friends that are Mormon and there's some of the nicest people yeah and I don't care if they believe something that I don't believe that's okay but I mean the idea that everyone is supposed to buy into stuff without questioning it is the reason why we are fifty-one-year-old 16 year olds dude agree and then there's the deeper symbolic s*** it seems to be encoded in Christianity whether from people projecting their own understanding on a pretty wild symbol set or maybe it was intentional either way there's like a cool like you know the if you take a cube and unfold it it makes a crucifix in like the cube represents pre-big bang condition and the crucifix represents past present and future intersecting with eternity and so if you have a square all I get it so the length the height is twice the width and over and over and over again sorry about that y'all but bubble don't come free you need a new dimension you got to have somebody heard some dude just blow bubbles what are you I blow bubbles on the JRE bro Man Lee wrestler dude f****** Manley wrestler dude do that different people come in and blow bubbles and occasionally time in hey I'm going to be for the week you could start something that became a man yet</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> look at like the history of the great ideas a lot of them did come from like weird moments you know like Tesla like basically had a seizure and felt like it was being contacted by something like you do run into stories of at the very least inspiration but quite often Innovation coming to people via like maybe ideas are living things and these ideas even though they you think of them as something your brains creating and maybe brain is creating it maybe it uses your brain to create it so that it can manifest itself in the real world so when you have ideas whether idea that turn out to be art or music Jimi Hendrix Voodoo Child your you are inspired by that you see it gives you a great feeling you exchange currency to listen to it we just that one song how much money has been generated by Voodoo Child is one of the greatest songs in the history of the known universe is the opening guitar riff I've listened to that a thousand times easy I was do it all the time whenever I'm like I need to pick me up at 1 right where was it before it was in his brain well how does brain cook it up and what is it what are these things they're just floating around that you grabbed have culture and how do you turn them into something that people go crazy for now cuz occasionally a guy will take one of those ideas and make Voodoo Child or you know make someone else's song or make someone else painting or or you know make a f****** building that's inspiring this these things that come into your head that's right and you're at the end they really do is that like the eggs of objects because they they come to your mind you think about them and then you say I'm going to make a f****** clock IU start making the clock that's what I do or what the f*** is a thought figure that out no one knows how it is that where they coming from yourself as you're right like where the f*** did that come from if you're more advanced or no more about it some pregnancy say the words wrong if it's really interesting so it's like there's like eight consciousnesses I think it's 8 and the sixth one is your thought the Continuum of thoughts right so that's like where most people hang out and they think that's who they are as the infinite cycle of repeating thoughts and their head so below that is your senses and then the one right above that is the 7th and that's what is consider yourself churches in the west but so that's where all your memories are that's where all your like just all the s*** you can't remember that happened to you that that did stuck back there that appears in people's Arbor appears in your Neurosis or whatever and then above that is the eighth Consciousness and that's the stored experience of all human beings and it's happening it's like the global reminder it's with the akashic records yeah and into basically that one drips down like like water and a cave drips down into your subconscious which drips down and do your thoughts so when you're having these thoughts according to this model it's not necessarily your thoughts you're getting a kind of distillate it's rolling down through the global mind being flavored by your subconscious you're getting a kind of distillate it's rolling down through the global mind being flavored by your subconscious and then being flavored by your identity or who you think you are and then so by the time it comes out of you it's got you wrapped up inside of it but it's a projection of some like shared mind it's pretty cool that makes that makes actual sense</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> people do have a very weird idea of what animals are and I think that the average person I'm certainly no expert but amongst the average person I have a much better understanding of wildlife because I'm out in the wild several times a year hunting it's a different world it's a different where I'm no expert but my perception of it is as someone who sees wildlife in in the wild is he dead ones that other ones have killed we came across a calf have been ripped apart by Wolves I mean we we see stuff and you realize what that is what that what that f****** for its really is this competing ecosystem of life and it's going on all the time of this big things Jackin smaller things there's bird snatching things off the ground and snatching other birds out of trees and it's happening all the time and it's magic and you have to have it that way because otherwise the the whole population of play the overrun you have to have your sorrow of watching The Bear tear apart the van that has to happen because if it didn't happen you'd have too many fawns they be everywhere you have too many deer and you have to have someone who can take care of the Bands otherwise the Bears of overrun the city with the humans live we need to think about that and people don't want to because they don't want to shoot Yogi didn't want to shoot Yogi and Boo-Boo there are friends is a teddy bear I grew up with a bear you don't know what a bear is I've seen a bear in a while when you see the Bear in awhile you like you don't give a f*** about me you're some weird heartless Beast that is majestic looking who runs around eating moose and deer babies that's what your deal is you eat grass and berries and you like to lay around your f****** cool s*** it's a cool ass and doesn't mean you hate it but you understand what the f*** it is it's not like people don't want people to hunt bears in certain places like particular there their they're trying to regulate the size of the amount of grizzly bears in certain parts of country that we need to keep a handle on this like the couple people get mauled you know people start walking through Yellowstone and get attacked it happens like a little bit more rapidly the numbers get to a certain they like these things have no fear of people like we can actually help the population if they hand out Bear Tag Team start there's a reason why there's no f****** bears in California Duncan only black bears that are f****** state flag has a grizzly bear on it ever noticed yeah the state flags because they eradicated all the grizzly bears eating people there's a town I think it's called it's out near like on the way to Bakersfield it's a town named after play grizzly bear California and to investigate this day exhumed his body and his legs apart like his knee Tony's were snapped in half and s*** and that was the last bear was the last bear attack they did killed all the bear the reason why they killed all the Bears do you f*** your car shut up just shut up Tori man the, New York to okay stop don't be silly we definitely shouldn't kill all the Bears you should definitely kill some steal some wolves to keep everything alive you definitely kill some steal some wolf to read you only have to keep everything alive I'm going to bring back pterodactyls I wouldn't mind that controlled come on</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and all this got by um stuff that we're hearing now like the the study I just read about the study today like they found out that what the gut biome what you're feeding your your baby affect their like they there seems to be a correlation between their gut biome and the way they act when they're like five or something there are two years old or something and the autism link dr. Peter hotez and who's on the podcast and he is is an expert in autism and vaccines and diseases in foreign countries Pacific tropical disease and warm moist climate does he have and he was talking about how they've got it narrowed down to five environmental factors that happened during the womb that they think possibly contribute to autism but they don't think that it comes from something that happened this is current science according to him obviously I don't know what I'm talking about like for sure I'm not a biologist at all like how did the scientists not know that I should barely be able to say those words in order and pretend like I know what they mean but I I listen to expert mother's microbiome collection of microscopic organisms that lives inside of us is a key contributor to the risk of autism some that might be one of the factors so it's and neurodevelopmental disorders in Offspring it would make sense that if your body is not getting the proper nutrition and your body is unhealthy that whatever is going on inside of you is not going to be the best environment for a baby to reach 100% Health just makes sense if you're eating terrible while you're pregnant it's not going to be good for the kids but if you're eating really well and you're relaxing and taking care of yourself it's probably been for the kid I'm just seems like obvious it doesn't seem to make any sense of it that wouldn't be the case I think the weird part of it to me it's this runs into like ideas of free will or like autonomy in the sense that how much is the gut and the neurons in the gut and the neurons in the heart and all the interactions are having with things that have different DNA than is affecting what we do and like there's a lot that's so weird cuz he contributes to depression yeah yeah and it contributes to what else autism what other behavior is essentially being driven around by some kind of strange microscopic Hive of creatures living in our s*** in some way of pretty bad case of like psoriasis nasty really bothered him tried a bunch of stuff couldn't get it fixed when to one Doctor Who's a specialist specialist in gut biome its connection to autoimmune disorders think I fixed him up just changed up his probiotics like what he's taking prebiotics and probiotics gave him some like heavy-duty shitt ever get exactly set but it fixed it and it was basically something going on is gut biome and that could be affected by stress to be effective lack of sleep there's all sorts of stuff that goes on your body like we have to think of ourselves as a super organism like essentially like an ecosystem we have to think of ourselves as like your you think of yourself as you hey it's me it's Joanne. Getting we're talkin we're friends hey what's up buddy but really what we are is the keepers of the realm and then we got a whole realm of things living inside of my body were feeding at twinkies and it's freaking out like you f****** moron feels like one Twinkie doing my face so you're f****** knees hurt all the time at your back is killing you you have all the information problems getting them that's in your 40 years old like what the f*** did you eat in dogshit man you not give anybody can anything good you're The Keeper of the realm and also this is something I've been thinking about is like how much data were eating which is equivalent to Twinkies it's like you eat a bunch of Twinkies on right witcha by the way I'm about me is what I do you know my bouncing around for my drudgereport the Huffington report to Reddit conspiracy to read it what the f*** zit popping how long before you're looking at like a zit popping video and then that takes you down into a place of like move to animal cysts screaming in the middle of the night cuz you dream to call was dragging you into the forest it's like this is to me we seem to have not quite acknowledge that data is as much of is like a food and it's so much of the weirdness that people are showing these like Strange Behaviors it's got too because of the crazy s*** they're sucking it in their optic nerves right is also the ability to affect people but very rapidly or the to get a reaction from someone pause or negative people are so addicted to that I watch people getting these Twitter beefs back and forth and f****** smart people man a smart friend of mine who I respect greatly tried to get me to retweet something mean to do saying to someone else when I get the f*** out of here I like why are you what are you doing one thing that I've done over the last week we did a podcast with and Tom and Ari and we all looked at the amount of screen time we put in our phones are we supposed nose yeah I was like 4 hours for a day I was like what and myself taking care of business. Most of it is going through Google news feed looking for crazy stories of like animal attacks looking at man I watch the video today we got to ride his dirt bike in a bear is chasing them like what in the f*** what is happening equipment I don't want to try to like enable your addiction but honestly I think the internet has come to depend on your wild animal attack videos like you have kind of become like a news outlet for the best wild animal attacks need to know people need to see this s*** man</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what does you know I saw something you know your podcast it's like everywhere now it's like dandelions ever you can't anyway I'm always getting suggested videos from your podcast and I saw one cuz I've been cutting down my meat consumption and but that doesn't mean I don't eat meat I just want to cut it down a little bit and I have been feeling kind of enjoyable from time to time since you know that I don't know if you let yourself do that you probably don't but that feeling of like kind of b******* like I'm a little better now talking about the number of animals that die in a bean field like any Bean field that you see so many animals just ground up and murdered and it was great cuz I realize I foresee I write you the trick I was trying to play on myself is the same as the 13th floor s*** it's like I want the world to look like a Disney film but it's a bit of a cough even saying that is organic gardening so you can organically Garden if you get a plot of land and get some friends together you can all grown up vegetables so you have to take place and what with large-scale agriculture or if you're feeling rather with large-scale agriculture that's the problem the problem was meant to feed and just in La alone the Greater Los Angeles area what is like 20 million something people that's so many goddamn people do we have do it large-scale involves combines and those f****** things are indiscriminate they just chewing up the ground and things get caught up in it and that's why when they clean Fields when they pick whatever they're growing you'll see vultures after they run the combine sieve vultures circling the fields do they know rabbits and rats and all kinds of bugs mean any kind of was like yeah but that's a mosquito mosquito malaria you know you get to like a life-form ethical boundary where you can't relate to a roach hilarious thing when it comes to assigning levels of sentience and then based on that deciding if you should eat something or not you run into like a lot of weird problems which is like number one you're assuming a lot just because they don't have the sort of nervous system you have cuz we project most of everything we are into the world we don't really know what the phenomena is but I saw some like video of a little of an ant taking care of the ants baby and I don't know if you heard about how trees communicate with the most nutrients for real what if there is throughout the entire universe just as sentient field of Consciousness that is interacting with matter in a way that it produces what we call life and that life is feeling Terror love maybe in different ways and we would understand it but it's still there a really under consideration by legitimate scientist conscious of Consciousness sorry I don't remember which I haven't read it yet but I heard them talk about on his podcast and the concept that used to be like super Wu was what if everything has Consciousness with everything had but it just can't express itself can't change its environment it's limited just like we can't fly and we can't swim underwater and breathes water like we are limited in our physical ability whatever limitations we have like this is where it ends the buck stops here thing that doesn't move got to be stupid yeah might not be which is one of the reasons why nobody wants to buy a house after someone's been killed in it like what if that house retains memory that was something that Rupert sheldrake proposed a long time ago you know he's got that was that's very strange Theory where everything is connect morphic resonance I think at home. Morphic resonance and if you like a guy who's not afraid to take some chances and and say some really whoosh it I think you're the one who liked was telling me some of the studies or not so great and it said it wasn't that I said that some other people complain all right up there some studies that apparently people lean on that aren't super legit like the dog know when you're coming home on yeah but you got to replicate that s*** because I might have a loud car how far away is the guy when a dog starts going towards the door or does it dog can hear it way better than you can how far away is the guy when a dog starts going towards the door or does the guy just come home every night in the dog has like an internal clock and he knows hey it's 5 Mike wants be coming home like if you have they replicated this event for 11:30 would have like stars coming home in the Tesla where you can't hear s*** what if he comes over the dog actually know he's coming or is it.

		<div class="paragraph"> khabib vs. Dustin looks like that's what they're setting up that's the next fight in Abu Dhabi I don't know I really don't know so I could say right I would have for sure been like yeah but that's what makes you think about it because you know could be kind of but one 120mm I know he's going to come right after you know he's going to do too but what if Dustin not even necessarily can can out wrestling is just it's way easier to play defense on wrestling in an offense and if you got great footwork like that to to keep your back off the fence might be a long night for could be who knows fight the good fight. play a big factor in it you know it's a little harder to get in on a lot of those shots the real key is can he stopped to take down and can he defend himself on the ground because with so many guys could be gets a hold of them and then they developed a thousand yard stare with like what in the f*** is happening you know it's like when he's special I'm sure you remember early in your career when you would go with a guy which is way bigger than you are way stronger than you need put myself in the situation now I'm lucky just to I'm just counting how many times am I roll with many layers and I'm like I'm just trying my best not to get submitted I'm at the point where you only go submit me or one or two times Shell Shocked you didn't win that pfl thing I was so shocked I thought I was going to win it for sure yeah yeah striking is come so far you know it's one of those let you know if the game is the game the game what can you do if it ever existed you never know even as an athlete like you you can do everything to tip repair right and you feel like all the chips in like everything's in your corner and like I mean I guess it's like life is like you think everything is just it's like life is like you think everything is just right but sometimes it is not what can you do like a madman part of what comes with it it's just chaos</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah you know I got you some things even for doing it before the fight happened I had kind of already had in my mind I'm like okay it's been a year since we last kind of did this was right after the Barboza fight it was like okay imma imma imma get through the fight and then imma do this the result wasn't exactly what I want when I want it and I me and it made me hesitant about doing it but I was like this is the story you know what I mean and in this is as I said kind of like was upset at myself for a few days even I just kind of got over and I'm like you know what I said I was going to do it before I'm not about to be no sore ass loser and like I said I love you whether you win or lose I'm just you know it's it's a giant part of the game the game is losing someone losing go to the next fight in really when you look at it I mean it sucks it really does and I hate it like it's something that balls up inside of me that I go over I replayed a fight a million times in my head and I hate losing and I hate that feeling but it's just the reality and it's like it it's just real life in it just realized nothing you could do it was nothing you do want to throw over world champion fighter went when I was approached with the fighting in kind of start really diving into it and really looking at him like I always like a really big Challenge and that one was definitely one you know he had already had a lot of fights that went five rounds he had fought me he's pretty much everybody in tomorrow's when was the last fight Colby Covington the airport if you have already bought like a lot of top top guys and 4 5-round so I knew what type of challenge it was it's just hold myself at high esteem sounds like you know what I'm just ready to do it you know I mean that the fight is selfless was good but either way imma learned from it in in in grow from an end I still got a whole long long road ahead of me some you do have a long road ahead of you but you know how you were talking about that long road could sneak up on you real quick and before you know it you know you're 37 years old trying to figure out if you still want to fight yeah that's that's how it happens to guys I've seen it happen to guys I feel like if you approach a smart you know what I mean that you can still get done which is what I'm trying to do right I kind of already knew that I needed to make some changes and in and do something different even before this fight and before my last one to but you know I just like okay, just get through this one and then I'll do it then imma get through this one then I'll do it but you know that's kind of a big wake-up call to just like alright it's time to get outside of the comfort zone and in any kind of do something different in I do what I already know I got to do what did you think was going to happen in the fight and what was surprising I didn't think they would be able to keep the the depace for sure but what surprised me was how smart he was in and how he beat me tactically more than anything is you know when I was going he wasn't doing it only need any kind of heat control the pace better than I thought it was going to end I thought once I set that page that he was going to be right there with me but then going I started to realize though he's not really expended much energy he is, just letting me burn out my energy and in and then he took his moment when it when I made the the last mistake and really when it boils down to it I lost one position at the end there where I went for a takedown it and you know nine times out of 10 when I go in the club back the guy hits his knees but he's he just stayed on his feet and stepped out and when I hit my knees or slight loss that positioning in against a guy that's so dangerous a black belt in his eyes is so good I knew one slip-up was going to be all in need and not think he knew that too and he was just kind of waiting finest I'm hoping that I slip up it seem like you expended a lot of energy early on it seems like by the time we got the submission you were fairly tired yeah I mean follows you always used to tell me that you can and tired and can't you know it is a fight it's you're going to be tired but I'd still do think I have my legs underneath me and in and still could it's just I could have played it better technically I could have had had you no more time when I wasn't just going going at like you said especially that first round if I would had a little bit better experience maybe or something I ate you know I don't know I'll figure that out but I could have played it a little smarter like he did do you have a person that's giving you strategy or you I'm sort of making your strategy up on the Fly that's one of the things that that's kind of May thing that it that Robert follis was that guy for me until he passed in and then I kind of just picked up the ball and you know I understand fighting but yeah it's it's mostly me doing the strategy and right now that that's where I'm in the limbo of of trying to find somebody who already has that experience and it's already been there and done it to tell me a little bit of strategy really do and we had this conversation over the phone about it I think that young fighter with a lot of potential like yourself that lives in a reason why fight of the trainers there's a reason why Fighters have head coaches is re it's not because they want to give up all their money because it's it helps and you can delegate those that that thought process to a Master someone who's the master of martial arts who understands positions understand strategy seen Guys Tire teen guys good seeing you in the gym scene you grind understands your skill-set understand how you are when you come perfect understand how you are when you come in tired you know it. That is just Giant and it having someone who understands you psychologically as well and it also having someone that you respect and that you want to impress all those things are huge yeah it's it's it's a big one especially like you said being able to talk to you too and in him being able to understand you I think that's what Rob did really well so good a little bit like I'm just kind of go go and I kind of think hired of myself at it then maybe even I am but that's just how I am so that's all you have, but he was the type to kind of reel me in and any use even tell me like a you don't got to get hit so much and you know I'll I'll stand in front of a guy and just like especially when I was younger he was a little even worse and you know cuz that's just how I be feeling but you know he was kind of the type to to reel me in more than anything it's not like he would tell me one specific techniques or or even about his style or anything like that it was just the way that he was able to Taconic get through to me and kind of make me understand what it is that I'm trying to do a good relationship was devastating for the whole mixed martial arts world but losing him for you had to be a real disadvantage of giant change in your career the hat which fight did he die before he died right after the Tony fight which is a whole another piece of it in Ohio I know he had a whole lot of things going on early in his life especially now with his family and when we went to his memorial and people were trying to explain and you know what it's like growing up in a he grew up a Jehovah Witness there's like explaining what it's like to grow up like that and you know to try and get away from that and having your family Sonia Mann all like that can I understand I understand the importance of family so I can get that but then even I'm like man you know they would tell us if we were more so keeping them alive longer than anything so like mad if I would have won that fight with Tony is like it would he still be here you know I mean those are the type of like like that I do it to myself almost but I already know I'm already at the point where I got over it a little bit and I kind of understand that I'm not going to be able to replace him by any means but I am going to have to get that person who can still speak to me in that saying like you know the only way that I'm going to make it right is to win that title in and do it for him you know he keep kind of saw that for me and he was kind of the one to give me that confidence to say cuz he's already coach multiple UFC champion so when he told me that he could see me being a champ that really like I was like okay like I didn't really like I kind of thought it a little bit but I didn't really know it until like he gave me that kind of confidence so the only thing that's going to make it right it is to go out there and win that title and that's if I got what I got to do I'm not stopping you one hundred percent committed to 170 now yeah I think so I think it's I think it's right I 190 now right yeah just about I'm about 185 186 which is normally what I would be about getting ready for a 55 pound fight to ask you when I stepped into the cage I would lighter going into this fight tonight was for some of my my 55 lb fights</div>

There was no warm up there was no warm up with you put me into a state of fighter flight cuz you know you were compromised 4 days before you do not even just that that you know the day of the fight for me in that state for 4 days before where it made the weight cut shoved horrible like because my body just trying to hold on to everything and trying to you know when I woke up that morning I was about 162 I woke up at 5 a.m. Wednesday at 9 a.m. had to be 155 so I've got seven pounds to to cut it witches okay you know it's not too bad but about Nepal's the day before I'm a little dehydrated a little you know I'm a little already born but as a way cut was going you know we got till about 8 and I can only cut a pound-and-a-half but still 161 and 1/2 something at 8 winds are at 9 to the point where we got to do something so they start to put me in the bathtub just because we we do most of our Cuts in the bathroom know when you when you're in humidity you're going to cut more water weight or you going to sweat more and water is obviously hundred percent humidity is so they start throwing boiling hot water cuz we couldn't get the water hot enough to make me sweat more for us so we just taking kettles of hot water and just pouring it on me and you know what doctors are in and out twin 12 people in and out of the the the hotel room to make sure I'm okay and I'll make sure that I could cut the weight and I was just in such a lycan address the f****** like on 10 I might just get out I'm screaming at everybody I literally I was in the tub I was crying like but to me I was like there's no way I'm not making this weight and 6 lb in about an hour maybe two hours cuz I quit in about 9 or so or I mean about nine-thirty ten or so in 2 hours it was beautiful but I think that just kept me a such a such a 10 on my agenda level I never really understood how to bring it back down you know when did Robert Ryan talk to me and try to tell me like hey calm down like you know take a few deep breaths wouldn't notice I noticed like a hello just a bump like really big or something for Sunday I just kind of you know I didn't think about it wasn't raining that day so it was nothing when I went in on Monday do it was actually the one Dewey Cooper mind my striking coach he was the one that kind of notice and he was like a is is that alright and you know and then robbed when he took a look at it he's like oh yeah that's that's that for sure and you know I just kind of what do you do when that happens if you can't if you're not decided not to take antibiotics yeah yeah so what do you do with it I was like college wrestling those rooms are just so dirty and filthy that I seen other people with it but it didn't look like that in a man you normally look like a you know you have an open wound or something and then that'll get yellow and p**** in Ryan's Gustin but this was underneath my skin so it's not like a open wound or anything when I talked to doctors they said it was just on the delay or muscle I guess her or something instead of sticking out from it at the time I didn't really know what that meant like he said it was staff and I was like okay you know like I still feel good like I can still move around like we hit past that day I still felt good in Arkansas as like I'm showing up the fight you know there's no sew for 6 days you just trained and did everything with that staff and that was kind of like the last thing on my mind portable Fayette when I say imma do something I'm gone I'm going to do it regardless if my leg was halfway falling off like I still got another five more tolls on the other leg so looking back on it now you happy that you made the decision that you made a smart but you know you would have done it again tomorrow what does God is a defense it right yeah yeah so are you not trying to stay on top of it and at least I know flare-up has been happening since you not shower everything I make sure like I'm on top of y'all make sure I bring myself and I showered cuz you don't want that again it's mostly the other fight then go my way or whatever but it was about 3 or 4 weeks after that fight where I was just random and worship terrible people that ignore staff Moana screaming like listen man you could die thus it seems like you just got an infection but that should get systemic it gets in your bloodstream and you can't f****** die one of my friend Brian Collins friend's wife died and he went over the house and she was like you know some people get crazy with holistic stuff I was just going to try and natural healing and he's like ghetto do a f****** doctor gums were bleeding better twice and the first time I had when I got an antibiotic first of all the antibiotics the fact that Luke rockhold won the f****** title against Chris Weidman while he was on antibiotics shows you what a stud that guy is is that s*** kicks your ass he had the Ed staff when he fought Wyman couple years ago and it just wrecked me bad so I knew like going to that files like I rather have the staff in the antibiotics afterwards I think you probably made the right move to not do antibiotics but I don't know I'm not a doctor but I was thinking that that is it just weakens you so much you know it's just you live and learn from these things I think it's just part of the and before I would have liked it where I wanted everything to be perfect grab I wanted everything to kind of be the way I saw it you know especially like starting out the prayer like everybody wants to be Floyd and when you brought me piano and it's just it was like I'm the first one of my family to even ever think about this self you going to bump your head here and there and it just comparison is the thief of joy and you can't you can't do that you got to just think about being the best that you could bring to their path everybody's got a different path people comparing yourself to their path everybody's got a different path everyone's got different genetics right some people just better at certain things some people or some people struggle with certain aspects of the sport when it's everyone got their own individual challenge him it's one of the things that's so interesting about it is watching people adapt and grow</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I think this is the most polarized time I can remember as a 51 year old man looking back at you know my history of paying attention to social issues in the way we communicate with each other and then just partisan attitudes of people seem to have I don't I think it's probably because of trumpets a giant part of it but it's also just a sign of the times of social media I think it's part engineered by the algorithm to Facebook and Twitter and other social media companies utilize and it's also been engineered by bath bad faith participants and people that are actually manipulating it I don't know if you've paid any attention to Sam Harris had a fantastic podcast with and we had one with her as well Renee diresta Renee diresta analyzed all of the various accounts that the IRA created with the internet research agency that was responsible for these fake accounts that people thought were black lives matter accounts or Pro Southern secession accounts or all these different accounts that were very polarizing an are arguing with other people that these were just Russians that were working for this organization that was specifically trying to start chaos the right pacifically trying to start arguments and when when you you see that and then that's a fact X Factor that kind of s*** is a factor and that that is sort of become part of the sport of social media has been arguing at I do I don't do it I don't engage but I do go on Facebook sometimes and someone makes an abortion post and I just watched the chaos like oh my God yeah it's in or anything having any to do a trump or anything having anything to do with the Second Amendment or anything that has anything to do with the wall or immigration so I don't know that people are actually larger disagreements they were previously I think that yes Trump has course in the language and the way in which it's now acceptable to talk about a lot of these things that's number one I think the social media algorithms like you're pointing out reward the most extreme and polarizing comment and reactions in a never-ending feedback loop where the most polarizing initial tweet generates a more more responses than left polarizing tweets and then the sub responses that are most rising and an aggressive do the exact same thing in this never-ending feedback loop I think it's all those things but I don't know that people are having bigger disagreements than in times past I just think that they're public in a different way well there's more disagreements because people have more opportunity to disagree so they have more opportunity to engage in the chicken we talking about people that are addicted to their phones and just coming from a guy uses f****** phone for hours a day I'd like to think that one hour that is productive but I know the three hours of his me staring at butts on Instagram and then how much are you on like a computer and I don't know why didn't I don't have that. Data right but it's not as much and the good thing about it is most my b******* I'm doing on the phone most of my computer work unless I'm laying in bed I just watch embarrassingly enough I watch YouTube videos on pool that's what I watch Real I go to bed calming relaxing and I analyzed positions unless I do the same thing with chess that's what I there's like chess streamers similar but it's nothing crazy and it's also kind of stimulating in an intellectual way or yeah your mom watch your show she does and she watches other shows and my family super political so real that's on the weekend if it's Saturday I'm right in the middle of my break. Because they weren't wearing people more opportunity to argue and in those more opportunities you're seeing more conflict and I think more polarisation and I think again the social media algorithms and all the other nonsense that gets I think there's I really do believe that the feeling that I get but it also might be because a big part of my job is being on the internet so maybe I'm more engaged with it argues are a little bit so in practice the disagreements are equal to what they husband but there's more opportunities to disagree and the algorithm favors more escalated disagreement than rational conversation the effect is that you might meet someone with whom you have 80% in common in terms of your political views but the circumstances in which you engage with that person are going to be on the 20% that you don't so it makes it seem as though you just have very little common ground with anybody because the 80% agreement becomes background and the social me platforms the debates happening on YouTube elsewhere are focused only on but the most divisive fraction of one's entire political views and that's I think what the problem is but it makes sense because most people agree that I don't know gas stations are interested pick something innocuous most people agree that it's good to have a regulatory system that makes sure that when you think you pumped 5 gallons of gas you got in 5 gallons of gas Marshall that nobody's going to talk about it like it makes sense that the focus is going to be on the disagreements where it's damaging is then when you meet people in real life and it's hard to relate or even be in the same room because only those differences are sore like played upper right that's one of those more interest don't know where I see this going that's one of those more interesting things about particular was social media unlike things when it come to this Crowder situation I don't know where this is going cuz I didn't know this was ever going to be a thing I had never really considered that there was going to be some digital Town Square that we're all going to be enjoying whether it's Twitter or YouTube or whatever it is that might even need regulator</div>

It and the rest to tell you they like they like if you stop defending yourself then you know what at what else is there to do I mean yeah they couldn't easier but for us as competitors we we kind of do you know I think you just was more upset that it didn't go as what kind of diminished that respect for me then then you know I'm going to give it to you so I was talking a little bit you know I'm up there I'm having fun is my first big press press conference like I'm having fun at it but the minute that he got up and in ran across the towards me it's like there's this dividing line almost as like as soon as you step over that you in my space now it's two ends is a fight yeah it's a fly I mean that's just the way I grew up you know his anytime anybody somebody is going to you know invade your space like you're not going to wait add whatever you know it's it's even with me and dos anjos have a saying you know that's weighing in at 165 and just kind of shut again he didn't want to do it but I'm like I just want a fair fight out of the deal you know it's whatever you want we can hear what I can to fight it what to wait at 165 just to show that this weight class is a viable weight loss I try to do it yeah he said I don't make agreements with my opponent and I was like this is our problem do it but I'm like I just want a fair fight out of the deal you know it's whatever you want we could you guys want to shake hands to fight it what to wait at 165 just to show that this weight class is a viable way class I try to do it yeah he said I don't make agreements with my opponent and I was like this is our problem in the first place</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the idea of a union I mean I think it's I think it's inevitable you know I'm so yeah I think eventually it's it it's going to happen how would it happen I think it wants the UFC do you see it's going to change a little bit I feel like it's just the same way that I'm kind of looking at the way that Facebook has been doing starving and in all these other companies like these large private companies but they're they're so big and it's it's like you see is a sport organization and I mean but it's is so big now to wear like it's the m e a stand near Sporty's I guess it's damn near public and also I think once that kind of changes in people like when they open up the books and like people really start to pay attention to it then maybe somebody on the outside who is way smarter than anyone of us or you know cuz we're fighting we ain't really worried about the legalities of it and you don't have to sign a contract and I'm really give a f*** but what somebody who's smarter kind of takes a look at it and see what's going on in and how it is then then they're going to start up something I mean that they have to I wonder I think it would take some sort of crazy lawsuit I would imagine but I think the fighters are individuals and then that they they think of themselves and that it's like if you say hey I'm going to join you if you say hey I'm going to join the union you know I'm going to sit out until you guys meet the demands of the union and they got all that Colby Covington take your place now he's going to fight for the title and then you like what the f*** you and then you call Dana hey man I changed my mind f*** that Union I'm with you guys again that's how it goes I mean yeah yeah but it's kind of a a shame on our part almost is like this the same way as is at I said let's meet at 165 it's like we already don't have a lot of Leverage brother who you know I want to cut that extra 5 lb I didn't do it either I'm liking bro I'm already at 170 I'm already taking a loss here I'm like I'm not going to give you too many of you well hold up my end and I'm going to do it and it's afforded me so much to to wear my life is so much different than I thought it would be I like I truly thought that that everything was just look different in on it in and provided a better life for my family like my my mom my dad and my brother is like one brother at least but you know it it's just supporting me so much that any like negatives on it like I can't really it's just like grievances almost yeah I know I understand I understand we have you ever been approached by other organizations before it get into USC and then I mean maybe a little bit here and there but you know. Go over to one FC and Eddie Alvarez and Mighty Mouse Johnson sport in general competition is always good it's really the sport that we looking after so it is funny I mean in a contract with UFC for a long while now but you know if another tripping me out I'm getting the UFC is where it's at and then decide you don't want it to be too many organizations either you know what I mean by WBC WBA with boxing fight is like I want to be a part of keeping it all together to you know I'm not to be selfish and be like all the ones going to pay me way more money so I'm going over there and do that like I'm a huge fan of the sport in general too so I want to see the sport do good in having us all Under One Roof definitely does help being a UFC champion just f****** means more way more that's a different and I would even want to keep that Integrity about it you know and just for myself you know I mean to you know just it just to know that that that's what you did and you said you got to do what I like that's what you did so I think there's a wake-up call. 1 guys are going over and fighting in these other organizations are realizing now or can they are world-class Fighters and that you don't know about over in one FC in particular like Timothy Knotts you can the guy that knocked out Eddie Alvarez in particular Timothy not see you again the guy that knocked out Eddie Alvarez and that motherfukers world-class everybody with the same you know different world yeah it's it's different but it's still like it was a knock you out</div>

there are people whose views are so extreme that you can't really bring them to the table as reasonable negotiating partners for figuring something out like Richard Spencer or or even I mean okay imagine it should be something that politicians have to do all the time if you have a group of people who believe that we need to 25% flat tax and a group of people who want you know like an escalating progressive tax that gets its highest 70% on income over 10000000 whatever right like a little while then all those people are going to be able to have a conversation if someone comes in who says any taxes that the government collects are a form of slavery how do you integrate that into the conversation about how to set. you can't right now so all of the stuff you know there's this new movement now which I think is great about long-form conversations going in-depth figuring out what our disagreements are all of it I'm absolutely for all of it I thought you do it I do it I do it but where I do think that there's like a lack of pragmatic reality to it is some people's ideas are extreme that they can't in any sensible way be incorporated into an actual good faith discussion of how Society should be organized that is the problem with having conversations and scale right and that's the problem with Twitter and with you to that you're dealing with millions and millions and millions of human beings and when you have that broad spectrum of humans you're going to have people on the far ends of both sides and at a certain point there a decision has to be made about who actually gets to participate in the decision-making conversation taxation Twitter but imagine if there was a significant portion of of our elected officials who straight-up thing taxes or slavery I just don't know how that becomes integrated into a decision about tax policy Bryant I think the argument would be that bad ideas should be combated with good ideas not with silencing someone and that when you do silence someone you just sort of create this blockade where the idea builds up behind it and then the opposition to your perspective builds and then people start picking teams and picking sides and and I honestly think that that's something that's going to be going on right now with this whole Crowder Crowder box thing I think people are going to pick sides and they f****** Lovett people love a good conflict get into his lot of people in the cubicles right now that are weighing in and and firing up and his people that want to Doc's him again and his people want to infiltrate his Facebook and Twitter that's what people do have 3.5 8 million something like that I mean I think what you have to also remember is it's not just the reactions that are sort of like tailored to continue the escalation I mean in the end may be Crowder personally in his personal life does refer to people he perceives to be gay or who are gay as queers I don't know where he uses the word bags I have no idea what he didn't use that word the T-shirt the alcalde a or an age of fig oats for figs it's the idea tonight I got it but it's so goofy jokes are my point is I don't know any sensible person who lives in the west and has access to Media like Steven Crowder or whoever knows that the use of that language has a very specific path that and set of reactions that it's going to trigger so that shirt shirt and Gunnery to Carlos Maza as a queer Mexican or whatever whatever the phrase is LBGTQ work what is like here's a good one right National Association for the advancement of colored people NAACP what the acronym with the individual letters or words in that acronym R I think the word queer is not a derogatory word but it is or it cannot be depending on how she do you f****** queer or whatever that's a word that can be used in a way that if someone shows up if Richard Spencer shows one of his followers and goes to a bar mitzvah and talks about this room full of Jews the word is the same word but we're talking about two very different things that's a good point but should he be allowed to say this room full of Jews allowed and not illegal subject to break this stalemate of this subject not stalemate but this was her and this seems to be ridiculously On The Rise and that that's stunning to me that shocked me when I lie because the internet the internet sort of expose anti-Semitism that I didn't necessarily know existed at the levels that existed that I knew there was anti-semite since January of 2017 I don't know that Donald Trump has created anti-semites in fact he probably hasn't his son-in-law's son-in-law's Jewish daughter converted to Judaism but I think that Richard Spencer told me we know that Trump is not literally a white nationalist who is going to talk about let's take control back from the Jews but we see him as the closest thing to what we would like he talks about do people from Mexico he talks about shitholecountries Etc so it's just emboldened the movement it doesn't necessarily create why do people from Mexico and shitholecountries. Doesn't necessarily really equate with Israel whatever I see what you're saying it doesn't want is not directly linked to the other but if you're a group that already has these views and then you see a guy who opened his campaign talking about they're sending rapists and criminals but some I'm sure are good people and I don't want people coming here from shitholecountries what about Norwegians whatever signal and they know exact why it's appealing because they see the signals in the vocabulary and then so I think it's just brought it out into the Forefront I don't know that new anti-Semitism is necessarily been generated although it being in the Forefront probably does start to get some people kind of curious I thought maybe all the problems are because of the truth on it's just I guess they find groups of like-minded folks and they they join along right side the anti-semites and you can stumble into it where you ordinarily wouldn't be around people that are having those discussions that can happen and a lot of the people that I've talked to that got into those beliefs and then out of them said that they got in usually on a community level there was something about the community that was Arlington like gangs sayings or in the case of people that had a bad home situation and they found a group that would accept them are partially they would accept them because they and then they got pulled into the beliefs and eventually they get big should have got out of them it's just so you think the rise of it in 2017 there's more anti-Semitism or you think it's more or for over I believe it's more over because yeah they have the data and there have been increases I know you see it online so many different places me out and I just don't remember seeing it before or not like that not that's what you'd run into it so often are people calling people design is Scheels yeah I mean that's an important thing to talk about any people call me that all the time and you know I feel like that is an issue where I try to speak I mean she'll to me suggests that you're saying one thing but with some other agenda that you're trying to push in some way in other words you are you are speaking in some way deceptive about your actual intentions and what you say so I think when people call me a Zionist shill what they mean is I'm talking about one thing with the secret goal or below the surface go Love Actually promoting some action by the state of Israel I think that's the idea of a shill but you know I mean I am opposed to the current prime minister in Israel I've made clear that isn't in trouble right now I mean he's been in in tentative trouble for a long time his wife is in trouble as well I believe but that I mean the problem is and I know that there are people on the left and right that when I say this will get crushed from what I'm about to say sometimes when someone says Zionist shill it's related to your view on the israeli-palestinian conflict sometimes when someone has signed crushed from what I'm about to say sometimes when someone says Zionist shill it's related to your view on the israeli-palestinian conflict sometimes when someone has sinus chill it is cover for just wanting to insult someone for being Jewish her for anti-Semitism you got to look at every instance one by one</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you think that that bad version of identity politics that I mentioned is a big problem on the left or not a big problem I'm curious I think it's certainly a problem but I think it's a vocal minority problem that's what I think I think if you just regular people that are on the left that are working jobs and having families and doing their hobbies and they just have left wing ideas I don't think the vast majority of hold those positions I think those positions or things that use as Revenue I mean not as Revenue but it's like they think they get points from it you know they could they get points from certain types of behavior that they support certain types of thinking that they support and it did lets you know you got woke social justice points and then we agree I mean I asked because I genuinely didn't know I mean I've heard yes or no I mean I do think that it's disproportionately I think it's a small problem like you're saying I think a lot of the problem exists in the college campus setting but I mean even if Boston College you I had sort of maybe been incorrectly indoctrinated into the idea that this was really a problem everywhere on college campuses and I had an incident the details of which wouldn't be appropriate to talk about but with a student when I taught at Boston College is that because of the circumstances the identities involved I was ready for it to go into this is going to be resolved the wrong way on the basis of the toxic identity politics I'm hearing is existing uncolored walruses and it was not it was the exact opposite so I think the same way that when you look at Yelp reviews people who had a bad experience are way more likely to go and write about it yes these individual stories get way more attention than the percentage of the problem that they represent I believe you're probably could but when you see videos like Nick Nick christakis getting shouted down at Yale by group of students into the support of the students and that kind of s*** you say it will it is real and it does exist it's real it exists I think that sensible people on the left like me call it out but I want to be careful imagine that you had someone from Cato on the show which is sort of like a traditional conservative sample and a lot of the conversation was about getting them to talk about or denounce the alt right for example I'm sure they would do it but how much should a i denounce the alt right when that's like a different thing that is not responding to this very vocal minority yes and those are the people that are most invested in getting these ideas push through and they're there are also people that for better turn the probably mentally ill and I only mean mentally ill in terms of like have like legitimate diseases but in terms of their thought patterns to probably obsessive I mean I've had friends that we're especially friends that were heavily involved in this kind of stuff before and it was very damaging to their mental health this type of stuff being politics being woke left-wing shout out at people attack people politics okay but then he realized somewhere on the wind and then one of them my friend Jamie kilstein they turned on him and then in a devastated his life and he realized along the way like I was Jesus Christ's sake what was I doing like I was checking my Twitter every 5 seconds and insulting people left and right and attacking people just get everybody say yeah go get them and you know what showing everybody how woke I am and how Progressive I am and it becomes a weird sort of a point system like you're trying to score points you're trying to gain favor with your party there's a lot of that I think it's really so there's people on the left and right who get pulled into Political wokeness whether it's I'm now tea party in 2010 people that got sucked into tea party on the right and tifo whatever these are all groups with different sort of following they're not all the same whatever I do think that there is a difference between getting extremely passionate about the idea that everybody should have access to just basic Healthcare then getting extremely passionate about the idea that to go out of our way to shut down every abortion clinic in the country I think it's just there's a difference and so I don't want to participate in a false equivalency between well you got very far left and very far right people and they're the same and you've got center-left in center-right and they're the same it's just two sides of the same coin like obviously I have a perspective that is based on my politics I'm glad to debate any of these issues with anybody who wants to on the merits but I don't want to make the false equivalency I mean listen when you look at Anti-Defamation League numbers for example the vast majority of of hate incidents in the United States are coming from the right we could talk about other ways that the left is active we could talk about what it means or how things should be categorized but that's the reality and so I want to make sure I don't play a false equivalency game my audience would crush me if I did that number one but I think it's just I think it's wrong to do that I don't think Spirit out. I think you're right there and I also think that these false equivalency kind of conversations or their ridiculous because each individual conversation about each individual issue deserves its own discussion and to say what about this or what about that those whataboutism those are the death of any real rational discussion because they go on forever they gone forever there's no I mean it's like scroll that this is why it's scrolling Twitter endlessly is a problem because there's really no end you could always scroll a little more to the end right yeah I mean the the new tweets are coming fast it's the same with a lot of those has ever done that just crawled into their phone died it's just charge it wake up in the morning and just scroll down all day I think you wouldn't because the new content appears fast ride because the algorithm yeah but you still never run out now just keep going endlessly is a problem because there's really no end you could always scroll a little more to the end right yeah I mean the the new tweets are coming fast it's the same with a lot of those has ever done that just crawled into their phone died it's just charge it wake up in the morning and just scroll down all day I think you wouldn't because the new content appears fast ride because the algorithm yeah but you still never run out now just keep going</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> who sings I don't know if this would be interesting to go into but there's a few things that I found have been somewhat successful in conversations with people who really disagree with me and at least like lowering the temperature a little bit and getting people to maybe engage in a good-faith way one of them is how do you think I came to my position so you might be for total free market for-profit Healthcare I am for a system where the government is bald and even if you can't pay you get care before we even start if I say how do you think I arrived at my position that has been pretty useful another example is I think this came from Peter boghossian who I think you had on the defeasibility question which is what evidence if I presented it to you would bring you over to my side I'm not saying I have that evidence or that it exists but give me a framework as to what is keeping you from seeing this my way because sometimes that exist just doesn't know about those are two tools that I have found super useful in trying to make some Headway with people who are hyper-partisan and very escalated with a lot of these issues The Descent into insults and dunking on people is one of the one of the reasons why I at the beginning of the conversation I was saying that I wanted things I enjoy about your your YouTube video says you're a very reasonable rational person and you don't get crazy an animated insulting and I think there's we need more of that cuz I think they even though you're not going to convert some people there's a certain section of the population that disagrees with you that's just going to write but there's a significant number that I had to go hey this David pakman he's reasonable please make nonsense he's intelligent not to all my goal is and I think the sort of working in that we have a lot of trump supporters who are paid subscribers to my show a lot we have some notes maybe they are the boss but my mic hole is my goal is it I mean that that would be an interesting day if I wake up and Trump has responded to one of my videos about him what would you do to be a good day how funny was that one Colbert was on TVs like Donald how did you not know that you shouldn't respond to me right yeah yeah that's rule number one important unless you want to create a storm of a very certain my goal is I don't pretend to be neutral I think neutrality is almost always false because on most issues people are not indifferent mean neutral is another way of saying in different you could be conflicted in neutral objective and transparent and how I arrived at what I believe so you can get disagree with my conclusion you can even come to me and tell me the facts I've used to reach the conclusion or incomplete or wrong but I'm completely genuine and how I arrived there and I think that that is why we have some many others obviously to look at YouTube comments there are right-wingers that watch my show but choosing to support it financially is a different thing and I get emails from conservative to say I don't agree with your conclusions but I do find that you're at least reasoning think that that is why we have some and yet there's obviously if you look at YouTube comments there are right-wingers that watch my show but choosing to support it financially is a different thing and I get emails from conservatives who say I don't agree with your conclusions but I do find that you're at least reasoning through the issues in a way that resonates with me and I want to support the fact that you're doing that that's not standing there really is</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I wonder where this is going I really do I wonder it cuz this is it seems like this newfound ability to broadcast that we have with the other YouTube page where the up Twitter or whatever you're doing its Newfound ability to spread whatever you're trying to say to so many people with very little understanding on the most part from what would be a great thing overall so for example if you know what to tell Italian dictator were to come to power and some was beating up you know had fascist beating up an old women like that would get broadcast out instantly there would be an instant outrage hue-and-cry rally so in that sense it helps bring attention to the plight of anybody but right now we're going to the face with his Newfound power to assemble mops and people don't know how to deal with that so it becomes very easy to set up a mob and have it attack somebody take all the context like even this conversation I'm sure people will take out Snippets to put them on social media and try and get somebody outraged and so you have to learn how to fish. Settings have to get over the idea of outrage like to me like rich people people get easily outraged of the stupidest people on social media does the people I block instantly it's just kind of very low level thinking right near the foot of the foot soldiers in the mob video clips these are just someone who's trying to get outraged over something eventually they'll also be anti-mob tactics for example if if I go to someone's twitter feed and all it is is full of political ranting Raven conspiracy theories do I want to work with this person doing associate with this person don't be friends with this person their mind is cluttered with junk I don't necessarily blame them I think that the human brain is not designed to absorb the world's breaking news 24/7 emergency has injected straight into your skull with clickbait headline news if you pay attention to that stuff even if your well-meaning even if your sound of Mind Body it will eventually drive you insane this is goes back to Clockwork Orange where he's going to have his eyes opened on the sports to watch the news but I think that's what's happening right now because these are addictive right at Twitter Facebook Instagram these are weaponized you have social statisticians and scientists and researchers on people and coach literally best minds of our generation of figuring out how to predict you to the news and if you fall for it if you get addicted your brain will get destroyed and I think this is the modern struggle like the modern struggle to the ancient struggle used to be the tribal struggle you had your tribe of friends and family you had your religion you had your country you had your loyal to you and your nationality at least you had meaning and support now you would struggle against other tribes Modern Life were so free everything's become atomized we stand alone you live in take me to Lodi living in house alone in your parents don't live nearby your friends don't live nearby you don't have any tribal MTG you don't believe in religion anymore you don't believe in the country anymore it's finally got a lot of freedoms fantastic but now when they come to attack you you're alone and you can't resist so how do they attack you so well meaning I don't fault capitalism I love capitalism but look at how it happened social media Dave massage all the mechanisms to addicted like a pigeon rat was just going to click click click click click can't put the phone down the food they've taken sugar in the weaponized it they put it into all these different forms in varieties that you can't resist eating drugs right they've taken Pharmaceuticals and plants and they synthesize them they've grown them in such a way that you can you get addicted you can't put them down p*** right if your young male you want around the internet it'll likes apple your libido and you're not going out in real life side anymore cuz you got this incredible stop coming at you video games another way to Dick people so you have this you have entire large factories of people that are working to addicted to these things and you stand alone so the modern struggle as an individual is learning how to resist these things in the first place throwing your own boundaries and there's no one there to help you that's terrifying guidebook on how to handle this our generation is the transition generation I think our kids will know how to handle it better cuz they'll grow but I hope I hope I hope to use what you're saying some ridiculous behavior from people today that's so common I mean I don't know if you've been paying attention to this but there was a guy who he made it a video of turns out it wasn't even him that made the video at least that's what he said but it was a video where he serve dr. Nancy Pelosi talking and made it look like she was play a bunch of people retweeted it like oh my god look she's drunk and and so one of the online Publications some website tracked him down and Doc's him and turned out he's just a day laborer who was an African-American Trump fan and thought it would be funny to do that and it turns out that he didn't even at least according to him he actually just put it up on his Facebook page what's even more disturbing is Facebook gave up his information to this website right or what cuz we made something funny that made people seem drunk there's a million of those about me and you could find them meme I think Facebook and Twitter and a bunch of other social media platforms are committing slow-motion suicide through these kinds of activities that was a stunning one that would give up this guy who's a labor because he made a parody video or he made someone look foolish with editing while you're not have to pay the media reviews their job to go after individuals they don't like with air quotes in that regard I don't think this is something that the New York Times before the internet and you could have two local newspapers and every town and you can have two local news stations TV stations in every town and then CNN came along and started commoditizing the news 24/7 broadcast and then the internet cable best news you can distribute that immediately they can go on Twitter I can go on Facebook and get the refrigerant Google Music thousand times you know you going to Google News you're like okay what's a piece of news with source and 3000 other articles too many right now media has shifted into pedaling opinions and entertainment variation between like cheerleaders shock troops enforcers you know Talking Heads so these are not tribal Libby's are not propaganda machine only for their tribes of the right-wing one is left-wing one right as the alt-right is a control left and the two of them were just fighting it out using their various media organs in memes so basically when you see one of these news organizations doxxing an individual that's like a tank running over Soldier and so there's no there's no such thing anymore as a neutral media commentator the the illusion of objectivity that journalism had is lost no longer one guy like a Walter Cronkite that everyone's going to listen to now adjust shock troops fighting Wars of each other how does this play out have you thought about it a little bit so what the internet does internet-driven what the internet does is the internet creates one giant aggregator or two for everything one taxi dispatcher one e-commerce door one search engine 101 social media site for friends and family were business excetera the internet is this giant aggregator recreates one big hegemon for everything and it creates an itemized longtail of millions and millions of individuals what it gets rid of is a medium medium sized ones in the middle so for example you might have had like seven Hollywood Studios let's all give me Netflix you had you know like 10 large e-commerce players are Commerce players from Walmart to Costco to you know okay whatever. Just to be Amazon and a ton of small individual Brands so that's the world that we're headed towards one hegemon and millions of individuals so where it ends up long-term is Media will be a few gigantic outlets in a could be the New York Times could be Facebook if you like that and it's going to be just a really long tail of millions of independent people so this idea of who's a journalist and who's not in his ass a hundred journalists are not everyone's a journalist that the world that were headed towards I do extreme power the most powerful people in the world today and this is not well known but the most powerful people in the world today or the people reading the algorithms for Twitter and Facebook and Instagram because they're controlling the spread of information they're little be rewriting people's brains their programming the culture and they're doing it very steadily like Google I believe that you know one of their exact got up in front of Congress and the congressman asked him do you manipulate search results he said no we do not search results really that's your job that is literally all Google does Google has one job which is to manipulate search results to pull them out of noise and rank them properly and the out the precise algorithms of how they do that is very hidden very complex but influences the hearts and minds of everybody including all the voters now if Google Facebook and Twitter have been smart about this they would not have picked sides they would have said where Publishers whatever goes through a pipe go through pipes it's illegal will take it down give us a court order otherwise I don't touch it it's like the phone company if I call you up and I say something horrible to you on the phone the phone company doesn't get in trouble but the moment they started taking stuff down that wasn't illegal because somebody scream they basically lost her right to be viewed as a carrier and now all of a sudden to depict non-liability so they're sliding down to slippery slope mean to ruin sloping to ruin where the left want them to take down the right the right one to take down the left and now they have no more friends they have no traditionally the libertarian-leaning Republicans and Democrats would have stood up in principle for the common carriers but now they won't so my guess is as soon as Congress and this is just a is coming if not already here and might even been here today actually could just saw something related in the news the day is coming when the politicians realize that these social media platforms are picking the next president the next Congressman they're literally picking and they have the power to pick so they will be controlled in in what way how do you think they're going to be controlled the way you think they're going to have to adhere to strict principles of freedom of speech and now I know there's like it's headed the opposite direction right now I wish it was freedom of speech much more likely they going to be in the short to medium-term they can be holding for hearings going to be pressured maithili do this don't do that my concern about that is completely incompetent will do what they want and what are they wanted me to do they wanted to basically suppress the other side so if your right-wing you want to suppress the left-wing for left when you want to suppress the right wing and if you just see where these companies are headquartered in Silicon Valley all the sensors and that's really what they are there sensors working inside these companies are just called to call by different names obviously right doublespeak he called the department defense department of War Department of Safety silicon Valley's is going to reflect Silicon Valley politics which is extremely Progressive left ring and if you're not that you really have no place there's any knife try being a conservative and open conservative at Google good luck. You got lynched think that there was ever a thing like that that was so influential and so politically ideologically one-sided yeah there's a there's a little thing of the internet call Conquest law that any organization does not explicitly left the right-wing eventually becomes left-wing and I don't know why that's true but it does seem to me to be true and the organism metastasizes towards other means if you're unlucky goes towards violence if you're lucky they find other outlets I think will happen is we will start creating decentralized media that's not owned by any single entity that can't be suppressor shutdown that will then start spreading these various things that will take the place of Twitter or Facebook going where you think is going his own principles which he believes that it's a fundamental right and he believes that freedom of speech is something that we all should have and that these platforms should essentially be like like utilities like the electric company that gives correct and he has the right Vision it's just he's in an organization where the other individuals in the organization feel differently very differently ization itself can get hijacked that these platforms should essentially be like like utilities like the electric company that gives correct and he has the right Vision it's just he's in an organization where the other individuals in the organization feel differently very differently ization itself can get hijacked</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> something right it's like are you responsible for the people who also comment on your post and that this is this is where we're getting to this like Vox thing that's happening with Steven Crowder right now right are you responsible for the reaction to what you post cuz if you looking with Steven Crowder said that we don't people don't know the story Steven Crowder got into it with this guy who is a writer for Vox who is he's gay his Twitter handle is gay wonk or that he's hiding that he's gay talks about it all the time I'm kind of effeminate and Steven Crowder mock that any mock that in these videos where he was criticizing Carlos his position on antifa it specifically what I saw and in in doing that he called him this queer Mexican this he's doing it in a ribbing way doing it a joking way and then Carlos Maza post all these horrible tweets that came his way and apparently got doc so people got his phone and they were saying debate Steven Crowder was getting all these text messages in and all this hateful stuff that was coming his way so the question is who is responsible for that hateful stuff if Steven Crowder calls from queer is what is queer okay LBGTQ what do we do there what do we do if the cue is in izze is it okay to call somebody who identifies as gay because of the gay little Mexican is that is that bad like what is a how bad is that like what is that thing but Sophia if you look at the policy the terms of service of YouTube there's average article from yesterday before few days ago earlier this week before YouTube it made the decision to demonetized Steven Crowder and then today as I got in here Jamie informed me that they made a decision to Damonte that's right so in the article where they made the decision not to act they actually put what YouTube's terms of service are with regard to pulling in harassment my reading of it and we could go through them if we could pull them up we could go through it line by line if we wanted my reading was that that definitely did break the terms and conditions that was my view as I looked at what it was that was done by Steven Crowder and what the terms of service are just matching it up not looking at the comments what where was it specifically it was specifically targeting an individual on the basis of sexual orientation but it wasn't targeting on the basis of it he was sing that with his bad ideas he was targeting his bad ideas in regards to antifa a lot of videos missing antifa but if you look at Crowders video I can't believe I spent so much time doing this flower on this two days ago he was talking about how Carlos just dismisses and teeth is being not that big a deal and if there's bias in the media whenever there's anything negative that happens but if you look at the overall picture and then Crowder goes on to talk about all the assault all the murders that they were sexy thought it was raped it was all these things that happened with antifa he was talking about all these different people that got maced in the face all these people that got hurt and and he's highlighting all like this is not something too easily dismissed Stranded the FBI had labeled antifa terrorist organization so far it's just politics it's just what it what is he think what do I think so far it's just that part of it and along the way he's like yeah but the queer little Latino says this and when he does that that's where okay what is he doing he's kind of mocking them right and he's mocking them by saying he's queer but he says he's queer or he says he's gay yeah but that's like saying I mean listen just because the n-word is in rap songs doesn't mean that at any of that that it's Define to go and I put the N word is not in like it's not like the lbgt N you know I'm saying it's not like a part of their their organs I think the principal though is you're suggesting that because a certain word is sometimes used self-referential by members of a group that any use of it from the outside is by definition not problematic and I'm just saying it's more complicated and you got Steven Crowder also wearing a shirt that said fagg's with the a with an asterisks wink-wink-nudge-nudge it said socialism is for figs okay while he's calling a gay guy is a fig instead of an eye as long a gay guy yes certainly an argument that but I don't necessarily think the t-shirt is for Carlos Mesa I think that's a teacher that he just has cuz he thinks it's funny and because Che Guevara who's on the shirt is that is one of the weirdest things people worship that guy he was a human being a mass murderer or a terrible sociopath psychopath and because it looks good the Cuban Revolution in outfits with a beret on he became for a long time and he's kind of died off but he became like though the woke poster boy I'm from Argentina I know content in total and we don't think it violates our terms and conditions I disagreed with them I thought it very clearly violated their terms and conditions where I am thinking about it now is the application of those terms and conditions violations because a similar thing happened with Alex Jones as well which was there's lots of ways smaller players that are violating the same terms and conditions but nobody knows about them YouTube doesn't know about them they don't get any attention because they have no so I think there's the question of the application of these terms and conditions conditions in a way that's so fair and is not ultimately going by the public blowback or reactions to situations because that that's how I pocalypse 1.0 I think it was a Coke ad appeared on an obviously racist video on a Channel with like eight hundred or a thousand subscribers The Wall Street Journal I think it was did an article saying look at the screenshot of these advertisers on these crazy racist videos that led to blow back because you didn't want to lose money and ultimately that's what this is about I know that there are people who say YouTube has an inherently left-wing bias other said YouTube has a right-wing whatever YouTube bias is towards corporatism in profit what it is and I don't know that in what sense well in the that the woman is a CEO of YouTube but talked about a pretty openly like to the fact that she doesn't what was it that she had gotten into but she will first of all the James D'Amore thing and if she's talking about the Google memo and she was talking about how it was incredibly damaging the damaging damaging stereotypes against women which it just wasn't it is not accurate is Home Depot a right-wing company because the CEO supports Trump that's the question I'm basing it on the they're part of Facebook and Facebook is pretty clearly left-wing the Google Google Google Google is a very very left-wing group and it's all Silicone Valley which is almost entirely left-wing bias so I think we have to distinguish between the personal political biases of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and the broader place that Google has in the sort of corporate sphere Google is part of the group of huge multinational corporations that lobbies for particular tax policy to avoid paying taxes legally that is not a particularly left-wing thing to do Google is part of the large tech companies that in order to avoid serious regulation of their businesses have come up with this idea of regulating themselves which topic self-regulation that's come up before on your programming in a variety of ways so those are not left-wing things and if you want to make the case that as a company it has a left-wing politics in the outward-facing world you have to have something more than just a lot of their Engineers live in Palo Alto and are hipsters who go to coffee shop do you think I think that in terms of the place that it occupies within the economic system we have they are not very different from all of the large corporations that are pushing against regulation pushing for ways to avoid taxes. Economic decisions the personal politics of the employees translate to policy we can do that but we need to be able to make some specific claims about how it does what I'm saying is we know the way in which structure that Google is a part of needs to it advocating for things that are centre-right corporatist capitalist the status quo of tax shelters Havens and not paying taxes regulating ourselves etc etc allow him to have his freedom to post videos on there but the punitive aspect of it is they're going to reduce his ability or eliminate his ability to make money from it David Dukes right because he could couldn't be put videos put adds up in his video yeah I know you can do like we want one thing that I do is we we kind of split off the ad sales for my show into an ad agency and we're doing ad sales not just for my show but for other shows as well and those include ad placements that are not like the pre-roll ads on YouTube it's the host is actually talking about a product or whatever right to re-enable I've read sort of thing unbox therapy that's where I first saw those he does some pretty extensive ones okay so of course you can do that yeah. There's nothing he can do that but he can't just collect Revenue like I'm I assume he's been doing before he has a significant number of followers I think is his YouTube subscribers or more than three and a half million so I could so it's very hot more than me and Dave just eliminated as income comes out of YouTube and this is their decision based on his his way of talking about Carlos Mesa that's that's what happened what are the concerns to me it's not that he didn't violate terms and conditions like I said I think you pretty clearly did the concerns to me are is YouTube only going to even look into these circumstances or instances when there is a public outcry answer is probably yes because why would they look into stuff nobody's paying attention to change their decision based on public outcry based on Carlos mazas reaction to the initial decision was the wrong one but I have a sort of broader concern here which is about the fairness of the application and also the distinguishing between content that is promoting whatever falls under any of our definitions of hateful or whatever content and those who are fighting so is it because he mentioned his sexual orientation and that he called him a lispy little queer or whatever he called him or queer Mexican and if he just called him a f****** idiot and he received the exact same amount of hate would you still think that that was a good move no I mean I think that it would not fall under what they are now claiming is the justification for the demonetization it would be different the only difference would be they wouldn't be attacking your sexual orientation specifically because of crowd that's the only difference policing speech you know it really is Cher's so who gets to decide if not the private businesses what the rules are that's where the real question comes up right Tulsi gabbard believes that the First Amendment issue and she believes that everyone should have the freedom of expression and then as long as you're not doing anything illegal you're not putting anyone to Danger my weather address or doxxing them or something along those lines or oat making over at physical threats right that you should be allowed to do that because I doubt that the freedom of speech is all about and freedom of speech when you eliminate social media in this country is your freedom is basically is yelling yelling out in public me out your urine wearing this weird place it's a weird culture other culture it's unprecedented really terms of the waters were navigating right now there's a couple different things to so I like the principal like my principal is we do almost no moderation on any of our platforms that my program is on my only thing that I tell my team is if you see something that really seems to be illegal it's calling for violence it it whatever these are we have a very very high bar before we will remove anything and quite frankly we're just too busy and what you mean by that I'm not your videos who's videos if we find out that our videos someone is posting endless comments on here, then, my personal view is if it's not illegal I just just let it all be there in a great principal to have when we don't touch them accused of it but the question is YouTube at one point in time had thrown out there that they're going to make people responsible for the things that were in their comments I agree remember that pay didn't ultimately had it backed out of it very quickly when they realized average video gets how many thousands of comments allowed in many of them anti-semitic and how would you how would you even be able to look at all those and you would have to be 24/7 monitoring I'm glad you've also got people there watching your videos from overseas at all times of the night yet so I think that the principal of only only illegal content will be removed is great that's that's my BSNL principle however I think that there is no serious case to be made that a private company can't say these are our terms of service and if you want to I mean sort of almost a conservative principle right the idea that unless illegal things are going on but we are not going to tell a business how it is that that it should be run and that's where I think a lot of right-wingers start to stumble on this issue because they're calling for a very invasive form of government regulation they're calling for the government to step in and even break up these organizations have gotten too large me be your hearing left as well well I think there's a different there's a difference though between Elizabeth Warren saying we should separate the social platform Facebook from the ad sales revenue generating piece of it that's one thing that falls under antitrust that's different than saying the government should come in and it should tell anybody who runs the social network that you can't even you can't do anything unless the content is illegal because there are Financial considerations right I mean there's a lot that would not be illegal but it would make a platform a video platform like YouTube not financially viable because advertisers would see it and it so we're not going through that so I have a very hard time taking what is a very authoritarian perspective that the government should come in and say this is how social networks should be run now if you want to change the law here's the way it could be done if you want to change the law and argue that these platforms have gotten so big that they represent more of a Town Square then okay maybe you could pass a law that changes how they would be regulated but that's typically the type of stuff the right is against because it is more regulation and is more regulation but it's regulation to keep a private company from regulating against free speech to see what I'm saying it's it's a sneaky kind of Regulation it's a regulation that's enforcing the First Amendment and the people's ability to freely Express themselves if we're admitting or if we're agreeing we are entering into this new world yes where this is. That's my position as it is a town square and I feel like everybody should be able to communicate really unfortunate unsavory aspect of it is when someone gets harassed like Carlos Mesa was because of this poor people are sending him all these homophobic tweets and other than he's getting text messages and all the s*** that's that's the unsavory and unfortunate aspect of it and how do you stop that you stop it but I think it would be useful for me one thing is when does a platform get big enough in your mind that it would qualify for this like Townsquare designation for sure YouTube let's talk about that one cuz that's where I'm a goddamn huge so happens that you think should be regulated in the same way out if that's not really clear so I'll give an example if you start regularly sending people via UPS similar things to some of the content that exists on YouTube and UPS says we're getting reports that you're sending people harassing stuff we don't want you as a customer difference between someone sending something to a physical address and someone sending something just would say to you when your social media apps are on the third page of your phone and have to swipe all the way over to get him an open up and you have to read them if you want to fight well don't necessarily have to read them there's a difference in a practical sense but I guess the question is would we want the government would you similarly want the government to enforce for telephone companies if you are harassed getting harassing texts and you report it and report it and the phone is ringing I think that's another step it's another step towards invasive it's a big gray area message read that text right now I feel you I guess it depends where I hesitate and again it speaking to someone from the left who believes regulation of businesses is an important thing I would want to be really sure about how it exactly it is that the government would step in and mandate essentially that their view has to be listened to over the terms of service that a private company would wish to have I feel like when you give bagani start looking for targets and that that is a very common thing if you give people the ability to censor and if you get people to build a sensor based on their political ideology or based on what they feel is offensive other people don't it's a slippery slope and I think that that can that can lead to also look that woman was the name again the one who ain't right that is what I'm talking about is their very action that very same type of thinking that she tried to impose on you that's what I'm worried about wealth and I worried about people that are really strictly trying to promote their ideologies and what they think is okay and not okay and it's very slippery cuz there's a lot of weird people out there that believe a lot of weird things and want other people to conform those weird things and we sort of have to decide like that's why I'm bringing up this crowded thing like do I think he said was good no it's not nice to call someone be queer it's not nice it's it's kind of mean you know and especially like I wasn't even engaging with him but he's making fun of him he's a comedy show he's mocking them so the question becomes like when when is that mocking considered homophobic and when is it just ribbing right that's his position his position is that it's just ribbing this is the problem with a discussion that is only about the principles so like a lot of our conversation for the last 15 minutes has been what is arp call about what types of business regulation is okay for the government to do and is not okay or when we talk about Free Speech what should do we have a principal of anything short of illegal content versus something that is more strict the reality is that it's there's a more gray area yeah we're trying to sort of regular the way people communicate with each other so it's not as if someone said that to someone in a bar a cop would not arrest them like you little queer you know that would be like I like I was an a****** but the bar would be perfectly within their legal right to say we don't we don't want you in here you're making our customers uncomfortable and nobody would say that it would be against the law for the bar to say you got to go that's a good point if they were doing it to their face but what if you was in a corner talking about this guy that wasn't there and he was saying yeah so he's talking about antifa queer if you came along and decided to kick the guy out of the bar then I mean listen cars if you go into the corner and you yell about a wispy Mexican queer they're going to ask you to leave and it's still would not be legal and the bar would still not be doing anything right but that's a bar right that's a private business for people are physically there yes isn't there a difference between that and something like you too but you can Falls more in line with like a Town Square maybe that's what we need to revisit his so much human communication is now happening across these platforms I was imagine most of it or most of it we need to maybe stop drying this arbitrary distinction that in person is a completely different thing over the internet I mean maybe it's not increasingly maybe it's more of the same you know some torn here right on one side I say well it seems like they still allow him to have his freedom of expression because he's still on YouTube he still is able to upload his show on YouTube he will have to find other ways to make money so one part of me looks at it that way and has a right to monetize on YouTube right so in a sense they haven't violated his first amendment rights because he's still able to express himself but then you go as a company they've made a punitive decision to eliminate his ability or is radically reduce his ability to make an income off of their platform that seems like and I'm not supporting that they did it but that seems more reasonable as a decision right to say we're going to monetize you that seems more reasonable but the problem is there's no Alternatives there's nothing remotely like YouTube to your alternative to YouTube for him to regain that same level of monetization yes or four people that share his Viewpoint and share his ideology and share his positions and has no right wing YouTube's my point in this challenge the idea that YouTube enforcing its policies house up I mean they had us this just this particular issue left-wing how is this a left-wing enforcement I mean they having it is because Carlos mazas Progressive and because the the argument that he was making his very left-wing Progressive argument and this is with Crowder was going after he was going after the argument in the process of going after the argument he mocked his sexuality in his appearance I can assure you if it was focused merely on how much of a problem antifa is this what happened I mean I think we both know it's all about the mocking the guys sexual orientation and looks that's where it Carlos Maza where I gave Republican and the exact same thing happened do you think the outcome would have been different yes why I just don't think people be interested but my real concern with this is YouTube only getting involved in even publicly saying what they're doing about a channel when it I'm very public and it starts to have the possibility of impacting their bottom line and brand saying yes it's just too hot and we're getting out well in that sense would Carlos did once it was revealed that YouTube was not going to take action was very effective absolutely and he started tweeting like crazy and people jumped on board and connected it to the lbgt movement then and then it became this thing well in that sense would Carlos did once it was revealed that YouTube is not going to take action was very effective absolutely and he started tweeting like crazy and people jumped on board and connected it to the lbgt movement and then it became this thing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> new about you before this happened the but then I really kind of got on board with you when someone was trying to get you fired from Boston University and I remember it and I was like what what is this this is so it's a woman named Amy siskind who I don't know other than that incident where had a disagreement about something it wasn't it wasn't toxic wasn't hostile said I didn't explain what you said and what she said that you disagree with so we may be able to even find the Tweet but she tweeted something at the gist being that she would not be supporting any candidate in 2020 who's wider mail I think that that was a joke of it and I responded I'm going from memory here that just was something like isn't that the definition of racism you're sort of preemptively excluding someone from consideration on the basis of race and in that case gender if it was white and various right there in the candidates in the Dem primary unless you slept through midterms women were most successful candidate biggest Den vote-getters in History Obama 08 Hillary 16 white male is not where our party is at and it is our least safe option in 2020 right so I said isn't there something not Progressive about preemptively dismissing a candidate based on their race and gender I feel like there's a word to describe that as a progressive jumping on board yeah so it's racist you said there's a word to describe that and that's a very polite way of disagreeing with someone I thought it was polite and she tried to get you fired yet she contacted as far as I know it's okay I don't I'm going by what she said she said she contacted Boston College and told them not to allow me to teach there that's insane and Boston College since I've just an adjunct I'm not on staff when I'm not teaching like during the three months of the semester I'm employed there and the other nine months I'm not so I think Boston College said he's not currently employed here and I died second but that's basically as far as it went but I did talk to some other faculty there who were aware of the thing that was going on crazy thing to do just to think so it's a nasty mean thing to do to like someone can't disagree with you and it's a very good point I think she probably got upset because you made of good point and tweet started coming her way and a lot of people they read those f****** comments and people get toxic in those comments random strange people that you don't know and then you're forced to you know look at their opinions and their criticisms endurance insults that incident started me down the path of drastically limiting my social media use good for you yeah I mean that that was the beginning and then it became I mean you know this way more than I do because I think on all platforms you have roughly 10 times the following that I do no matter what you do post or whatever if you look at what the feedback is it extraordinary toxic and horrible negative stuff that is only a distraction to what I'm trying to do and most of it probably isn't button Neva on yesterday in the Mall Broward and one of the things that he brought up with so so huge it's so true is that you can have 10 positive things but that one negative will outweigh the 10 positive senior and you're absolutely especially if you're a person who's self-critical or as self objective you're analyzing your behavior was that good was that bad right now you read that one bad, are they right you don't read all the people that sell your great-aunt loved it but the comments were almost all this is awesome great left-wing voice talking to Joe Rogan go get him David this is such can't wait to watch you faceplant like man are they right like the amount that one thing I am doing though because my show is in part as successful as it is because of social media so I can't ignore that and I also can just say I will check our networks in the morning then I'll spend the whole day I'll do my show I'll do it to do and then before I sign off for the evening I'll check it and that's it we'll know it'll be like 5 p.m. to look at phone usage and I use my phone for hours a day I'm going to phone for hours then that's a lot what app did you use to measure it's something on your iPhone 4 hours of screen time like that's not good you guys are making for the phone just says Burke's argument arguments and I couldn't that's ridiculous one thing I did that actually as useful as I used to have my social apps on the home screen and Cal Newport and some others have said you got you got to get rid of those he actually Advocates getting rid of the apps all together so that you have to go on a computer and choose to go to facebook.com or Twitter I haven't gotten there yet but even just removing them from the home screen makes me significantly less likely even pull them up its two clicks up and scroll over to the app even just getting them off the home screen keeps me off of them significantly. Smart that makes sense I need a certain amount of access to those things with my business so I scheduling shows and things along those lines but yeah it's not good for you is that people don't really miss you that much they don't hear from you for a couple days that's one of the things were the idea of needing constant engagement comes from sort of like a slightly narcissistic point of view or like people are going to notice if I don't tweet for from Thursday night until Monday morning or do anything on you that are kind of crazy and that want to hear from you all day long down but they'll get used to it. Get used to you they want Vanishing and I don't Cal Newport has have you had him he wrote deep work and then more recently he wrote digital minimalism and he goes into detail about just the effect of sacrilegious we need more uninterrupted. Of concentration deep work and then digital minimalism and they're both I interviewed him recently really just at all at very solid stuff awesome but we just about to get into oh so we're going to the woman Amy siskind what is so sensitive what is Twitter for it is it just to fall in line is it just to agree with everything someone says with no question whatsoever what's extra interesting about it is she blocked me on Twitter but then I treat my Facebook profile basically as public so I post stuff on there it's the same whether you're friends with me or not and I had posted something totally innocuous about I was at a restaurant or drinking and I don't even know what it was she showed up there and commented that she had called Boston College and told them not to eat or not to hire me or to fire me or whatever I'm supposed about you having an espresso she determined that the exchange was worthy of blocking me on Twitter but then she came to my personal Facebook page and said I've been calling Boston College and telling them to fire you there's a word for a big one is a four-letter one I just don't understand why someone would want to do that to someone that you pointed out a glaring problem with what you were saying I don't even necessarily that she's a bad person that she has some emotional thing going on she could have had a terrible day as far as I know someone near and dear to her died that day I am to me. I wouldn't necessarily be on Twitter or Facebook or post about you drinking espresso people I try to get you fired but my Approach is I just I really do assume most people are pretty good people and even when we have disagreements I tend to give the benefit of the doubt that if we could only talk the way we're doing yet we can figure out 90 percent of the disagreement maybe not all of it so I wouldn't behave but who knows what she had going on it so it's not that bad but if it did that would have been horrible it would have been a different situation would have been probably good publicity if you do get fired it's the best possible thing that'll happen right it it would just be fantastic and it didn't cuz I wasn't actually employed there at the time that's the irony of it will this is the thing the falling in line did the no room for deviation from the ideology sure this is the this is a giant issue that I have with both both parties and I think it is one of the reasons why people in these parties to begin with I don't necessarily think that people have clearly thought-out every single aspect of whatever part of a line with they fall in line and they adopt predetermined pattern of behavior that seems to be attractive at the time and then they fall in line with whatever that party sank has a giant percentage of people when someone deviate from that like you did someone who is also clearly a progressive and clearly a left-wing person and you're criticizing something very very politely and the did she just goes Haywire over that that party saying that is a giant percentage of people when someone deviate from that like you did someone who is also clearly a progressive and clearly a left-wing person and you're criticizing something very very politely and that did she just goes Haywire over that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you think Andy Ruiz being heavyweight champion to bring Mexicans and the rest of America closer together I think so or what Muhammad Ali Parker who's a legit world-class fighter one decision people get confused because the way he looks that m*********** throws hands and the way he punches is superfluid so the fights the fight is ham versus that bronze bomber got on well I would imagine the fight is the rematch in England in the f****** Wembley Arena or some s*** front of a million people that's probably have to be the rematch and if he f**** in my bug am like shy man I don't know what happened in that fight Mike Tyson Fury oh yeah for sure and you can fight Deontay Wilder but the big money I think it's in the rematch that's probably the big money is and then, that is man all of a sudden that heavyweight division looks good but the most exciting is Deontay he's built like a giant Tommy Hearns almost like you know when he just he just got crazy Powerman his power makes me just put my hand on my head and what the f*** you think Francis ngannou could box box and I love with what the top the top level know he could with training but he's a little older to you know Francis is how old is Francis for he started fairly late in life learning how to fight him. But he's so big and so powerful 3232 Lester Young he's he in my opinion is the most dangerous one punch guy I've ever seen hit If he if you make any mistake with that guy flying across the room and it's a big difference fights people would see it just like people want to see Floyd Mayweather versus Conor McGregor yeah but it's kind of the same in the same way that you do you know Conor McGregor knocks people dead in the UFC and you know Floyd Mayweather's the greatest boxer of all time of all time I mean he's probably the most skillful defensive artist we've ever seen and you know so I can hit a couple of times this thing about Francis ngannou is even with big gloves UK I'm hit you like that if you gets if it like a Floyd the way through I got hit with a Topper Cup by Connor Connor just kind of placed it there he popped him it was a good shot before didn't get wobbled you didn't get dropped if Frances hit somebody like that I don't give a fuk of who you are if he hits you with that Alistair Overeem left hook that he hit Alison with get the f*** out of here no one surviving that he just seems like that little short seems like he didn't even know that I think he had some stupid hard like crazy ridiculous off-the-charts hard I think when his people to just like what in the hell the only guys been able to survive that s*** is steeping course Derrick Lewis but they just didn't do much to each other and that's why everybody else he touches you with that s*** and you just go flying he had so goddamn hard that he just went into boxing strength and said at UFC the f*** knows man he could be the f****** heavyweight champion of the world like legit UFC Fox News man he could be the f****** heavyweight champion the world like legitimately you stop and think about how quickly Deontay Wilder went from boxing to earning a bronze medal in the Olympics was a year-and-a-half Wilder's exceptionally talented exceptionally powerful unbelievable one punch knockout power but so is Francis Francis has chosen to go that path.</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> did the education and Healthcare those are the two things that I think we can both agree we need invest money on and we need to figure out some way to make that more accessible and I don't understand people that don't think that and if that's what that is the strict father mentality that the only thing that makes sense to me is that you don't want people who are kind of half-ass in college just heard it did they can just get in I think that that comes up a lot and you hear about so-called to sleep College we're saying we're paying for it through taxation really important point that out it's it's just not for everybody but that's okay I mean I think that that that sometimes gets lost and yes there are more and more jobs that require college degrees even though you can make the case maybe the college degrees not actually necessary but it's a way to sort of thin the herd of applicants in order to just make hiring you no more practical but I do think that it's okay to say that college isn't for everybody but the ideas that apply to so-called free college meaning college paid for through education could apply to trade school they can apply to retraining programs there's a whole bunch of other ways that it could be done enough for everyone thing is more true now than ever before particular with certain technology studies you're learning things during your four years at University that are just going to be completely outdated by the time you graduate and what kind of program for example of Jamie what he did with audio engineering went to school for audio engineering by the time she got out it was all useless but that was kind of 4-year bachelor's program right it is now when I went there wasn't available for that but since then they have made that available and that's also in a time that YouTube has made basic education free for a lot of people so that when you consider the cost relative do the earnings potential as you pointed out when you known about $68,000 a year or you know I would never have guessed taught at Boston College and I think it was like $64,000 or something like that depending on what field you're going into it's almost impossible to pay that off ever so some at some point something needs to change and this kind of gets us into the technological automate Automation and unemployment stuff of what happens as computers and Technology start to replace and that's where I think there's a pretty clear line between a free-market capitalist a Social Democrat like myself and actual socialism like what should happen with the games that come from those technological advancements but as far as the education pieces concerned it's completely unsustainable the way it is now and that's where I think there's a pretty clear line between a free-market capitalist a Social Democrat like myself and actual socialism like what should happen with the games that come from those technological advancements but as far as the education pieces concerned it's completely unsustainable the way it is now</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Beyond anti-seizure want to limit speech or whatever I mean that's a pretty big issue a more serious issue is if you look at the progressive accomplishments of the early 20th century for example like 1905 to 1925 and the New Deal accomplishments that the left had in the time of FDR what was different I think then then the left now is that you didn't have to be completely in line with a specific set of policies or ideas and I worry that now there's a little bit of the left may be having this idea that if you're not in line on all of these issues whatever the checklist is so to speak you're not really the of being a participant in what is clearly a left remove and insert of the average Americans political orientation I don't want to see that prevent progress that's the hard tribalism right that's that's worth the line gets drawn you're with us or against us there's one way to think there is there is a lot of that I mean I saw it with Healthcare recently with Healthcare I don't think that you can make any serious case from the left that Healthcare spine and the for-profit Sawyer connected system that we have is working Progressive case to be made for that where people will differ is what about Medicare for all versus some other system system that looks more like Canada's or the UK or Germany or whatever and I've already started to see like when I say on my show I'm kind of agnostic on this like the system we have is a disaster we need a system that will get coverage to everybody the numbers can be made to work any number different ways we looked at it 80% of people on Medicare I believe it is have some additional coverage they either are still working part-time or full-time and get coverage that way or they're poor enough to be on Medicaid the point is Medicare for all doesn't solve every issue it's way better than what we have but he was like a dozen other possibility is looking at other countries there is a portion of the left that doesn't like that because I'm saying I'm against medicare-for-all I'm not saying that what I'm saying is there are number different ways to improve upon the system we have all of which this relationship between usually your employer and these for profit insurance companies I really don't understand private citizens that don't want easy access to Quality Healthcare for everybody that confuses the s*** out of me like have you ever been hurt have you ever been sick have you ever been broke right do you want to be broke and have no access to healthcare no one does no one want anybody to care about to not have access to health care of all the things concentrate on this country there's two things that drive me f****** crazy that people just dismiss education and Healthcare the idea that you have to like my buddy Greg Greg Fitzsimmons he sending his kid off to school how much do you say that it was $65,000 a year for both of his kids for each of his kid so you know he's got two kids. That's that hurts my head even think about spending $130,000 a year just on if you were you're a regular person with a regular job by the f*** do you do that impossible it's impossible with you so much f****** money and then that's not even paying for housing and food and transportation and books and everything else you're going to need to and to make it more difficult for young people to succeed is one of the worst ways to make a stronger country if you want a strong country you want educated people they get to pursue their dreams and the idea that we are willing to spend so much money on these costly regime-change Wars and flying troops overseas these places that they don't want to go no one no one wants it to happen and it's trillions of dollars and people fine with that but you talk to them about some silver socialized education system and people freak out and think you want to turn it into communist well I think what is really important to understand is that the facts you just laid out don't matter to people run I see this as an issue of what do people deserve what do they deserve if you say to a fiscal conservative you know if you consider the amount that the employer pays for premiums plus the employer plus your co-pays a plus coinsurance put it all together into some amount and you explain to them there's a lots of great analyses that have been done which tell us that with roughly the same amount of money maybe a small payroll tax in addition with roughly that same amount it all could be done with a single-payer system that everybody it's the same you're taking all of these individual risk pools where you have different for-profit insurers and then you have systems for people that don't have enough money Medicaid you have systems for people that are over 65 Medicare you put it all together you spread the risk far wider the employer no longer has to pay their part of the premium the employee no longer pays part of their premium to the for-profit insurance company the numbers work we're still not going to say you know what that that sounds great it's actually pretty fiscally conservative let's do it at some point there is a portion of the right that just doesn't think people have earned Healthcare they just haven't earned it they have an education or education and it's a very hard to change people's minds when that's their view I think it's might be George lakoff who I believe calls it strict father morality like how would a really strict father treat a child who comes to them and says hey you know what I figured out a way that we can all have Healthcare the strict father even if the numbers make sense would say I'm going to teach you a lesson you haven't learned that health care either because you don't work or you don't make enough money or your on disability whatever the case maybe how do you convince someone to change their mind when that's their worldview how do you when it's an ideologically based decision and that you're on team are or team L and what which which group of ideas do you adopt right can you talk to people that get Healthcare over the UK it sucks but at least have system it's just not the same Quality Healthcare that you get in America saving my friends in Canada I have friends in Canada that have come down here to get surgery cuz they find better doctors over here because he was going to Canada the UK system and the Canadian system neither one is that good for those two systems are different so it's I feel like socialized medicine they are both well yes in some sense I mean the Canadian system is administered at the Province level so the province is sort of like the market in there having all these submarkets attached to individual for-profit insurers at the provincial level that's how it's organized the UK has the National Health Service where they're actually didn't actually run the healthcare facilities but they are the ones who are Contracting them so it's sort of like the Care Facility still isn't own entity it's not that you're going and the government is the employer of the doctor so to speak but their Contracting with the healthcare facilities but the point I want to make is that there are criticisms of all of these systems but they're different ones so when we say the British and Canadian systems aren't that good right let's figure out in what ways each is not that good because they're different ways whether you're talking about health outcomes early detection cost per treatment whatever you really have to drill down and figure out in what way are we saying it's not that's good yeah what I'm saying is that there's no perfect system there's no perfect soul Simmons are right but I believe that most of the best doctors in terms of like North America at least are in the United States I'm sure there's probably some very good doctors in Canada the two specialized medicine but I think really good doctors are incentivised by Prophet I really do I think there is some motive end portal if you spend so much money for medical school and you bust your ass you want to make a lot of money and some of the best doctors are in a really good living and I think I think limiting their their ability to earn that money won't incentivize people to be excellent so couple different things I mean number one to be clear work now starting to get into a little bit of broader economic philosophy like on the capitalists for social democracy which is a mixed system that the capitalist system that says we're going to invest tax revenue in a particular way to make sure that no one Falls below a certain level so mi just to contextualize that my point of view is not from one of becoming a socialist country a lot of doctors will say that even though on on paper in a socialized medicine system they might make less for a particular procedure for example or something like that a lot of them are still in FaZe those systems because it would drastically reduce their overhead so they're all of this apparatus that includes medical billing and coding both on the insurer end and at the healthcare provider end the hospital and the insurance company both are battling over what is it that was done what are the codes that are that apply here and how would our reimbursement rates there's fraud when it comes to that and that requires an apparatus for investigating educating that that adds more and more cost so I don't think it's as easy I don't like is it obvious that under those systems at the end of the day a doctor that owns a PCP group for example or an orthopedic clinic or whatever the case maybe I don't know that it's that clear that they end up taking home less money wonder if in practice that would play out that way knee surgeries for athletes and things along those lines would be outside of whatever Insurance apparatus were talking about anyway a lot of those folks are often being paid out of pocket anyway so it's less in Belize some at least I'm sooner the average person's experience I think it's less relevant liability insurance expense it is it is necessary business liability insurance which is extremely expensive that's a giant issue with with doctors it's a huge expense it is yeah I mean I think it is necessary there's a question as to whether it's organized in the best way I know less about that component than some of the other ones</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think there's so much of this the YouTube political world that YouTube commentary world where people are so f****** toxic you know there's there's so much negativity there's so much that they called dunking on people so much dunking he's a little Duncan so that's warranted but I don't know if it's beneficial to the people doing the dunking yes or even to the cause I think it is temporarily but sometimes it's good because it showed Mox positions and it makes me really sad that is a ridiculous position so if you're on the fence if you're not really quite sure how you feel about things and you see someone get mocked for ridiculous position that maybe you'd even shared for a little bit maybe maybe have explored it deeply and you see someone that have exploded deeply to expose all the flaws in this line of thinking it's good but might thing what I'm in a lot of people in the left and I just hate all this conflict I think the unnecessary conflict I think is when you when you watch television today and you see antifa fighting with Trump supporters and all this all this weird conflict I don't I don't necessarily think that most of it is is necessary necessary I think the devil's in the details if you want to bring together I don't people who are not opposite sides of the climate debate for example could load I'm sure right well why is part part of that you could argue is if one side just does not accept science how can you really bring those people together doesn't mean you need physical conflict to resolve in fact I completely agree with you the physical conflict is totally counterproductive but at a certain point on some issues I understand why there's like an intractability to the debate where it seems completely impossible forward because whichever side you're on I would argue that I'm on the right side of these issues and others would disagree when you're far apart in a way that you can't even agrees to like what the starting point facts are about the conversation how do you even see how do you start I have some ideas as to how I try to do it but it's very tough it is very tough dunking on people always like constantly shiting on people is necessarily the way to do it and I think it's important to distinguish just straight-up ad hominems where someone is wrong and bad because I think they're a bad person or they're an idiot or whatever to recognizing when somebody is a participant in bad faith in a conversation you know when someone has maybe Fallen prey to audience capture or whatever else might be kind of influencing what what and how they're doing I think that those criticisms are legitimate but you got to stay away from just yes yes I think that it's so, today it's it's it's it's also extremely attractive these the YouTube algorithm you know it's far as comments Go I mean it actually kind of encourages it and so does Facebook's but so does you know any time does the social media platform that is a dependent one of the best ways to get people to engage is to have something they disagree with so they can get angry yes until it becomes no longer brand-safe Accord whoever's running the platform right I mean you go back to April 2017 where I woke up and saw that my YouTube channel made $0.19 the previous day and I text Kyle kulinski and I say I think there's like a glitch is it like it says I made $0.19 and he says $0.35 or something like that something's going on and it was the beginning of like a apocalypse 1.0 and that was a rough three week. And so so it's you know Courage the debate and the Battle of ideas so to speak and all of the stuff until advertisers get worried and they say you know our ads are showing up on stuff that's little bit touch-and-go for us that's a weird one to me because I YouTube has always been a secondary thought for me there the first thought was the audio version the podcast and in fact when we were uploading it to YouTube the first wizard why we've been doing this why not some people probably want to watch it and then somewhere along the find it became at least close to as big as the audio version of it and then maybe even more significant because one of things that the YouTube version has is the comment section which is often the f****** dumpster fire but it is at least there is some sort of like a community engagement aspect of it doesn't really exist in iTunes so I can in iTunes it sort of it's in a vacuum right sure but when the adpocalypse thing happened what is going on here like wasn't it wasn't my primary focus so it wasn't terrifying but people that only did YouTube and people that relied on that for their living maybe it's a huge blow it was huge and at the time I'm trying to think back I think maybe like around 30% of my entire shows Revenue was coming from YouTube at the time so it was not everything but it was still a significant right I mean I've staff and overhead and all that stuff so just overnight 30% going away is he and that's why I've tried to move to the model of telling my audience you can skip all of this stuff you know even some of these other unisuper chats and all this other stuff like we run a membership program on my website I control 100% of it she was going to patreon deal on patreon but it's not big for us the way I think about it is as long as I mean listen yeah there's marijuana companies that are having trouble even processing payments but assuming like stripe and PayPal don't say you can accept payments anymore David pakman run I control the entire process on my website so when people pay their six bucks all but 2.9% gets to me and when I apocalypse happened I saw it as a maybe blessing in disguise and that I can now explain to the audience he was the problem with these algorithms here's the problem when it goes from I am fighting white supremacist content to an algorithm can't distinguish between that and white supremacist, that's bad for me interview Richard Spencer I obviously don't agree with Richard Spencer but can an algorithm figure out that there's a difference between an interview I do with Richard Spencer and white nationalist propaganda I don't know but we can kind of get around all that if you just go directly to me and that's why my focus has been growing that those direct number call that was updating society that the weather there was a woman who made a bunch of connections like it Joe Rogan knows David Pac-Man out and Joe Rogan also knows Alex Jones Alex Jones must be friends with David pakman once like on the part of a grand conspiracy to help each other out and push right ideology even though you know a lot of people that were labeled as right or aren't right like I'm not right at all your politics are pretty left on most stuff although I don't I mean I don't know you personally Beyond just seeing your shows but maybe the critique is based on cuz I think that those Maps were based on what is the YouTube algorithm suggesting and so that may not be in line with your personal politics. It's just maybe what were talking about like if you're interested in conflict and she's trying to get engagement that that's the way to do it like in a few to Out YouTube algorithm is constantly suggesting people like Ben Shapiro or Gavin McInnes or whatever in those video come up over and over again sure and I mean so a lot of those people's channels do really well on YouTube so if you interview someone who has a channel themselves there's a very good chance set the algorithm if they're watching your interview with that person will say what's yours a lot of their stuff and then once you click their the algorithm very quickly starts to build a picture of every individual user if you watch your interview with Ben Shapiro and then it takes you to a daily wire video then it takes Ride Like the daily wire second-stringer guy and then you're off who-knows-where machine learning that thing that they do what they suggest the next videos which didn't used to be a thing that used to be you would go to YouTube you'd watch a video right and then you would go find another video right they didn't suggest anything and then somewhere along the line I don't remember what year it was but this started happening and then it's her daughter playing the next video autoplay yeah I think there was some kind of recommendation thing very early on but initially it might have been restricted to just other videos from the same channel you're watching and at a certain point it started to recommend other things and I don't know if you look at your analytics and see what percentage of your views are coming from that recommendations feed from other stuff but it's significant for a lot of YouTube channels the the tagging your videos and getting the right metadata on them in order to bring an audience is an important thing so it's a double-edged sword in some sense it sounds sounds like but to get back to what you were saying about so pay-per-view always Richard I was going to say they labeled you was right but you're not right get what he wants is disingenuous I mean I've said it over and over and over again I've never voted for a republican in my life I voted independent for Gary Johnson just because you did my podcast how can I wasn't happy with Clinton and I wasn't happy with Trump looks like this is gross I'm just going to vote for Gary Johnson I mean I didn't think he was going to win almost no chance we didn't know where was scream and I like play some New Hampshire California also but people conveniently we'll just as or they'll say that like you're a trojan horse they are like you're a pretend left-wing person who's really just pushing right-wing ideologies like which one which which right-wing ideology is it gay marriage is it what what is it I got put on the left on everything except maybe a second amendment right I think the criticism that could be levied if one wanted to make it into a criticism would be if you engage with right-wing ideas and that you don't agree with right like I take you at your face you not face value that you don't agree with a lot of the stuff that you're right wing guest say one could make the argument that by not challenging those ideas it's implicitly lending them more credibility than maybe you think they should have that's interesting because what I try to do with people unless something saying someone saying something egregious I I try to let them talk I want to know how they feel I want to know what their thought process is and so instead of just challenging a minute on everything I want them to elaborate right and I feel like by doing that I get a sense of how they've come to that conclusion whether it's logical right whether it's whether they've actually use their thoughts and they really calculated and thought what is the position I taken this is why and a lot of people don't know there's a lot of a lot of time to be challenged people in their positions you find out like they don't really know what the f*** they're talking about and that the best way to find that out as well let them talk like Candace Owens on climate change right that was the Socratic method of questioning which is why do you think that then how do you know that that's true etc etc answer to some other questions that that come from it which I do as well I mean I think I don't know what to add to Thai the Richard Spencer interview that I did some of the criticism I received after was from people on the left on the right most of the criticism was more from the right from people who disagreed with Richard Spencer like what things did they agree with that it is inevitable that people with different ethnic or religious background simply will not be able to co-exist together peacefully and we're better off trying to figure out how can we separate a People based on their membership in an ethnic or religious groups that's sad thought that you just can't get along with people that do other things that that are into interested in other things that come from other places that have different religions that have different points of view why the oh well a series of your Decades of what they call scholarship supporting their view but for the context of my interview I made it abundantly clear that I didn't agree with that stuff right and my view isn't everybody can have a different view about how they do interviews my view is if I just allow the what I consider to be disgusting views to be spread out right you know like a spray bottle to spray them everywhere not do anything else I can't say that I'm doing something that I think is valuable Felix valuable somiah my Approach is are the ideas known enough to be worth refuting that's number one if it's some weird conspiracy theory that has not even any following whatsoever I'm probably not going to choose to even entertain it because it's irrelevant and instead of always so my first question is is was Richard Spencer relevant at the time all right was Rising this guy was considered by many of the sort of creator of the alt right he was growing up glowing in the context of the Trump candidacy at the time or maybe Administration I don't remember when he was I realized it was it was I don't remember when I first heard his name yeah how did he become how did he come to prominence I don't know the sequence but I think he had a wet an ALT right website that had articles of some kind and then he that website became more known and f****** term soap alt right you know alt left the Centrist again he's different labels or so but if I had felt that I wouldn't be prepared to make it abundantly clear that I don't agree with the guy and I think his ideas were terrible I wouldn't have done the interview from the left of me doing that some who said the last thing we need to be doing is giving this guy a voice that's how often do they say door platform my response was this guy's getting interviewed and lots of other places that aren't even challenging him I'm at least making an attempt here to get something in the record that there are arguments against these ideas these are bad ideas and I don't want to be part of the diffusion of just the ideas themselves back when you did do that like what was his response was they were unique or new arguments that I was making but there was no argument to be made that I was letting him just parrot white nationalist talking points on a post which I wouldn't I just wouldn't feel good about that it's not how I do interviews and then the left was upset that you're giving him are quotes a platform very small portion of the left I want to be super clear very left almost everybody understood what I was doing 10 years ago I was interviewing the Westboro Baptist Church most people third what I was doing they were more prominent at the time but there was this sliver of the left that just didn't want the conversation to take place and I always struggle with this because as you can see I have no problem criticizing that sliver of the left my concern is getting like overly wrapped up two criticisms of the left that are only held by these like Niche slices yes and that's why I try to avoid going further than necessary in those criticisms sliver of the left my concern is getting like overly wrapped up two criticisms of the left that are only held by these like Niche slices yes and that's why I try to avoid going further than necessary in those criticisms</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah and I was really fascinated by another thing that you were bringing up about working for yourself that you feel it in the future with Route 50 or a hundred years from now virtually everyone is going to be working for themselves and I believe the way you put it is that the information age is going to reverse the Industrial Age yeah if you go back to hunter gatherer X how we evolved we basically work for ourselves we communicate and cooperate it within tribes but each hunter-gatherer stood on the road and then find the resources to the family unit but there was no boss hierarchy hardy hardy middle manager down into farming age we became a little bit more hierarchical as we had to run Farms but even those were still mostly Family Farm its industrial work with factories for that sort of created this model of thousands of people working together on one thing and having bosses and schedules and times to show up the reality is if you have to go I don't care how rich you are I don't care whether you're like it Wall Street Banker if you have to go if somebody has tell you that somebody can tell you when to be at work and what to wear and how to behave you're not free person you're not actually rich so we're in this model now where we think it's all about employment and jobs and intrinsic in that is that I have to work for somebody else but the information age is breaking that down so Ronald coase is an economist who has this coase theorem very famous theorem but a business talks about why is a company besides that why the company one person instead of ten people that 170,000 and it has to do with the internal transaction costs versus the external transaction costs let's say I want to do something that's in building a house and I need someone to come in and provide the lumber with developer right do I want that to be part of my company or do I want that to an external provider a lot of it depends on how hard it is to do that transaction with someone externally vs. internally if it's too hard to keep doing the contract everytime externally album in-house if it's easy to do externally and the one-off kind of thing I'd rather keep it out of the house well information technology is making it easier and easier to do these transactions externally it's becoming much easier to communicate with people gig economy I can send you small amounts of money I can hire you through an app I can write you afterwards so we are seeing atomization of the firm received the optimal size the front of a shrinking it's most obvious in Silicon Valley tons and tons of startup costly coming up and Shay turn off little pieces of businesses from large companies and turning them is a huge markets so what look like the small little vacation rental market on Craigslist is now suddenly blowing up into Air B&amp;B one example that's what it is but what I think we're going to see is whether it's 10:20 1500 years from now high quality work will be available when it's on when I'm driving an Uber or talking about super high-quality work will be available in a gig fashion where you wake up in the morning your phone will buzz and you five different jobs for people who work with in the past or been referred to as coming out Hollywood already Works little bit with how to organize for a project you decide where to take the project or not the contract is right there on the spot you get paid a certain amount you get rid of everyday or every week you get the money delivered and then when you're done working you turn it off and you go to Tahiti or wherever you want to spend the next three months and I think the smart people have already started figuring out that the internet enables this and they're starting to work more and more remotely on their own schedule on the wrong time and wrong place with their own friends in their own way and that's actually how we are the most productive so the information revolution by making it easier to communicate connecting cooperate is allowing us to go back to working for ourselves and that is my Ultimate Dream even when I run a company and I've employees I always tell those people having to help you start your company when you're ready because I think that's the highest calling maybe not everybody will get there but it would be fine if we were even working at 10% or 20% way better than working in a thousand person coming 10000 person company whose idea that we're all Factory like cogs in a machine who are specialized and have to do things by rote memorization or instruction is going to go and we're going to go back to being small groups of creative bands of individual setting out to do missions and when those missions are done we collect our money we get rated and then we rest and reassess until they're ready for the next print a study done on happiness and as it regards to this as it regards the size of companies not that I'm aware but to me it's obvious it's obvious this more of the company that happy to be the more human your relations are the rules to operate under the more flexible than more creative and the more you betray like a human just as you are able to do multiple things</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> super weird Progressive argument and it it as it pertains to race is always a weird one right because white privilege to me it although you could look at what they're saying on paper like yes yeah I'm sure there is more black people that are harassed by the police I'm sure there is more black people who are treated suspiciously by shop owners and in the length but the problem isn't the people who aren't treated poorly the problem is the people who treat the people poorly the problem is racism the problem is not people that didn't ask to be born white or whatever they are and they don't get harassed that sold this idea of white privilege or male privilege or whatever it is that's not the problem you're you're just looking at someone who's not a victim of this particular problem that you're highlighting but you're not looking at the perpetrators of the problem you're making people perpetrators by simply existing and having low melanin in their skin or having their ancestors come from that she's racism by another it's another way you racist yeah and then they say you can't be racist if it's not racist cuz you're white news it's white on white violence virtue signaling yeah it's wet and wild Violet mostly going on is it's elitist White's Blue State white college-educated White's beating up on high school educated whites blue color is a white collar vs Blue Collar War that's going on and the rest of us are just kind of watching like us kind of interesting these huge statements that people put out when you were you read them was like how much time did you put in this what the f*** do you put that much time of your kids do you put in the saying virtually nothing but the humans are being creative yeah well that's true it is create creative in a very odd way right cuz it's creative and that they're trying to elicit a response from people in the trying to raise their there is social value a raise their their position in the social totem pole signaling and it easy signaling because the kind of thing that everybody has to agree with you on that wants to be seen as a horrible person yeah and it's a very hard to make the nuanced arguments against then this is kind of go along I know one guy who poses as a woman on on Twitter but he does it to fly obviously what is this the name Tatiana McGrath yeah yeah yeah previous version and connection shows how it's okay it's like if he just said or her that it's not okay to be white because it will if you if you replace in half of these things that you replace the word white with black or Asian yeah it's it's a strange time in that respect that if you want to see who rules over you see who you're not allowed to criticize yeah that's so true right yeah that's so true</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that brings us back to the idea of meaning and Universal basic income I think the idea of giving someone $15,000 a year it doesn't necessarily cause whatever whatever one would worry about his people being on the Dole you would have a bunch of listless people out there with no meaning in life but the ideas that $15,000 a year and I'm not necessarily sure I agree with this I'm not and I'm not even at your sickness but that $15,000 you would just provide you with a necessity goodbye in life it would give you food it would give you shelter let's make a stop at 15 because the moment people that I can get a 15 like what do you say to the people that don't believe there is such a thing of ethical as ethical or compassionate capitalism then there's many people today that are espousing Marxism and they're espousing so I'm sort of a socialist society where they believe that capitalism is screw people over and eliminated the middle class and they're absolutely problems of capitalism I think monopolies are problem I think that crony capitalism is a problem with the government in bed with them and force I think the bankers have really you know rape society and the rest of us are suffering literally taking huge risks where they privatize the games in the socialize a losses so when it failed it miserably get billed out in bankrupt everybody else so capitalism gotten a really bad name is free exchange premarkets free-market free exchange intrinsic to humans from when the first person start a fire and somebody came along with the deer and said hey if I cook my dear and file share some of it with you right so we specialization of Labor we trade that's built into the human species basic math comes from accounting keeping track of debts and credits and so on we need to be able to engage in free trade the correct criticism of capitalism is when it does not provide equal opportunity and so we should always strive to provide equal opportunity but people confuse that with equal outcome when you have equal outcome that can only be enforced through violence because different people free people make different and when they make different choices they have different outcomes if you don't let them suffer the consequences of bad choices or reap the rewards for good choices then you are forcibly redistributing through violence it's interesting that there is there are no socialist working social examples that exist without violence you been we need someone to show with a gun and say okay you're not allowed to do that you handed over to that person so one of the reasons why do this podcast is because I believe everybody can be wealthy everybody is not a zero-sum game the positive-sum game you create something brand-new you exchange with me for something brand-new I've treated there's how are you today for both of us the sum of the value created is positive if not like status where it's like you're higher up I'm Lord on your presidents are must be vice president your plus-one on the -1 and have to cancel is Earl we should be all for playing positive some ethical game the problem is because of these looters will ruin capitalism's name that then you get social is coming in and saying burn the whole you burn the whole system down wind up like Venezuela or the former Soviet Union you don't want to be a failed socialist states with Mac routine hunting cats in the streets to eat right that's literally what happened to some of these places so I think it's very important not to destroy the engine of progress that brought us here at work yet that it needs to just need to do it right we do it right we can let you have you heard the world and in every single time with her and implemented if you ever had a conversation with someone who's a socialist to wear when you anytime so am I better better friends are socially really really get in today and what is there a man does anyone have a compelling prospective at all I think really socialism comes from the heart right you all we all want to be socialist the capitalism comes from the head because they're always cheaters May system system so when you're young if you're if you're not a socialist you have no hard when you're older if you're not a capitalist you have no head right you haven't thought it through so I understand where it comes from I always like Nassim taleb Framingham this what he said with my family I'm a communist with my close friends I'm a socialist you know at my state-level politics I'm a Democrat you know higher levels on a republican in at the federal level in a Libertarian right so basically the larger the group of people you have mass together to have different interests West trust there is the more cheating there is the better the incentives have to be aligned the better the system has to work the more you go towards capitalism the smaller the group you're in your Nativity Junior, you're in your house you and your tribe Wyoming's be a socialist with my aunts with my brother with my cousins and my uncles and my mom but yeah family I'm a socialist that's the right way to live a loving happy integrated life but when you're dealing with strangers I mean you want to be a real socialist great open all your doors and windows tomorrow everybody come take what you want see how that works out this idea of income inequality that always strikes me as a very it's a deceptive term income inequality while it's flipping around it comes from outcome and equality and the outcome inequalities there because you made different choices now game going back if it was because you know the same opportunities that's a problem Society should always try to give people equal opportunities so for example instead of income what if we had a retraining program built into our basic social fabric which said that every four years or every 6 years or whatever it is maybe it's every 10 you can take one year out and will pay for you to go retrain completely and you can go into any profession you like that has some earning power and output at hopefully a creative long-term profession and you can re educate yourself that would be much better for Society on all levels than basically just saying that you can be the door yeah I just used up to lead that horse to water and then make him drink it requires people to put in some effort you know we can all just sit around it's just not my perspective on income inequality there's always effort inequality in the end and thought inequality just some people that are obsessed and if those people become successful it doesn't mean they stole from you it just means that they put in the amount of energy and effort that was required to reach where they're at and there's a lot of which is likely that goes I know what people say was cuz reach where they're at and there's a lot of virtue signaling that goes on now people say Wallace cuz you're privileged his privileges your life 85% of humanity is dead so how privileged are you then you're living in the first world and you know you have four limbs Etc that you can take that argument all the way it's kind of nonsense discussion</div>

I was raised by my I was raised by single mom in New York and she use the local library the daycare center because it was a very tough neighborhood and so she would basically say when you get back from school go straight to the library and don't come out until I pick you good night so I used to basically live in the library and I read everything I read every magazine I read every pictograph Larry Booker every map is Rena stuff to read as read everything so I got over this idea of that reading a large number of books or reading a book to completion as a vanity metric cuz really when people are putting up photos on Twitter Instagram of look at my pile of books that I'm reading Lord them arrived and read all the books Ryan. Cuz your brain has wanted information and if I had space You Get Enough advice at all cancelled 2022 lot of nonsense and books out there too so I don't read any more to complete books I read to satisfy my genuine intellectual curiosity and I can be anything it could be nonsense it could be history could be fiction it could be signs of a Sci-Fi these days is mostly sci-fi philosophy sign cuz that's just what I'm interested in but I will read for understanding so a really good book I will flip through I won't actually read it consecutive in order and I won't even this even finish it I'm looking for ideas things that I don't understand and when I find something really interesting I'll reflect on it I'll research it and then when I'm bored of it I'll drop it or I'll flip to another book thanks to electronic books of got 50-70 Books open at a time on my Kindle or iBooks and I'm just bouncing around between them it's also a little bit of a mechanism to how in modern society we get too much information too quickly and so attention spans are very low so you get Twitter you get Instagram to get Facebook you just used to being bombarded with information so you can take that to you keeping of you doesn't negative energy like I have no attention span or you could be there's a positive I multitask really well and I can dig really fast I can if I find a thread that's interesting I can follow through 5 Social Network through the web through the library through the books and I can really get bottom of this thing very quickly it's like the Library of Alexandria that I can research at my disposal so I I no longer track books read or even care about books read it's about understanding concepts to awesome points first of all the social media aspect of books and basically anything like it's such a weird way to display your life cuz you know you displaying that the best aspects of your life and some sort of a glass case you know just it's a nun holistic version of your life that you cultivate and you curate and I'm I'm as guilty of that if anybody everybody thinks I'm guilty of it to with my dog every time I run looking at yourself you looking at how other people look at you one remove mental image and it's kind of a disease and celebrities in the world image that gets built up it gets built up by compliments every time somebody pays you and me a compliment and we're like oh well thank you right then that goes up an image of who we are and then one idiot comes along one out of ten one out of a hundred and they can easily tear it down because it doesn't take many insults to cancel out a lot of compliments and now you're carrying around this big wavy self-image and she's very easy to be attacked and because you're you're famous or well-known people want to attack you so being a celebrity is no good it's actually a problem like one of my tweets that is that these all reminders to myself as you want to be rich and Anonymous not pouring famous there's benefits to it of course but it has unusual problems that you don't get trained for and you really will not understand once you experience it he's all reminders to myself as you want to be rich an anonymous not pouring famous there's benefits to it of course but it has unusual problems that you don't get trained for and you really will not understand once you experience it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you do that one you do that one very small podcast we just have small with three or four minute Clips yeah so what it was I did a tweetstorm called how to get rich without getting lucky and it got pretty popular on Twitter and it's really about wealth creation I just use the quick baby title and its trying to basically layout Timeless principles of wealth creation that if you absorb them you become the kind of person who can create well create business make money and my theory behind that is like there are three things everybody wants the selection wasn't really supposed to start with three with three Basics everybody wants to be wealthy everybody wants to be happy and everybody wants to be fit and I know there's a lot of virtue signal that goes on like we don't want money and you know I don't care about being happy and happiness is for stupid people but let's face it like you want to be rich and happy and healthy of course you also internally calm State of Mind you want to love those three I think they can actually be taught right in a fitness I'm not going to teach there a lot of people who you've had on here including yourself who know a heck of a lot more about fitness and health and I do but I was born poor and miserable and I'm now pretty well-off and very happy and I worked at those and so I've learned a few things there some principles and so I try to lay them out but in a Timeless matter where you can kind of figure it out yourself cuz at the end of a I can't wait teach anything I can only inspire you and maybe give you a few hook so you can remember things when they happen or put it put a name to them so this podcast actually ended up explaining this tweetstorm so the tweetstorm was like 36-38 tweets got very famous got translate dozens of languages and these are principles that I came up with for myself when I was really young but I'm 13 14 and I've been carrying them in my head for 30 years and I've been through a living them and overtime I just realized like sadly or fortunately thing that I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of Maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that and doing a very long-term kind of weight not not the you know Banker crash the economy Bridal. Kind of way but you know Bill businesses and help people and I provide value kind of way especially when applied to modern technology and leverage in this age of infinite leverage that we live in so the podcast is explaining each tweet so he's a little 3 for 5 minutes I don't like to see the same thing twice I don't like to explain in detail I just I feel like if you have something original interesting to say should say it otherwise it's probably been said better so that podcast tries to be information dense it tries to be very concise and tries to be high-impact and try to be timeless and it has all the information I think you need to principals at a few of Dorothy's and you work hard over 10 years you get what you want so I've got the one on walk creation I'm going to attempt to do one on happiness is a big word but you know happiness and inner peace and calm and all that because what you want is you don't want to be the guy who succeed in life while being high strung high stress and unhappy and leaving a trail of emotional wreckage with you and your loved ones which is more common than not because you got to focus and yeah it's very hard to be great at everything you want to be the guy or the gal who get there calmly you know quietly without straw you want to be the guy or the gal who get there calmly you know quietly without struggle you want to be the person who's the when there's a crisis going on you and me too, cool as cucumber in the room who still also figures out the correct answer</div>
