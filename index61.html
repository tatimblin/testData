		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this is such a circular metal metal Contraption with teeth on the inside or just yeah it's basically similar to what we like the one in the screen it has like they were trying while they're trying to get people to stop masturbating boys with a fast with with masturbation he thought that a lot of his patients were suffering from all kinds of mental ailments and physical ailments because they were masturbating too much and he thought that a diet Blandon Blandon high in fiber would kind of kill the fire in the belly and so he invented what became Kellogg's Corn Flakes became the commercial version with the delicious sugar added in so that was the brother's idea from a claim about it stop stop all contemptible onanism what is onanism 18th century what kind of time to think about it it's a Victorian Obsession cuz it becomes more and more accepted idea in medical terms but is another one is really hot yeah there they came in all shapes and sizes and that's like a Thai steel cup the show afterwards but they would be good news is Ron is a hilarious comedian so we're all good we might have to redo the entire show just with Ron and Justin Rainer the end of it I knew I thought you know what I was going to show I'm like what can I bring Joe Rogan that's going to stimulate the conversation and anti-masturbation device they thought that it was causing all these ailments they thought it was causing all these different problems tasteless biscuit you know crumbling them into their little did he know that someone is that s'mores and awesome Kellogg Corn Flakes all this kind of stuff that has sort of a medical background and wasn't there a medical background in the term hysterical that hysterical was related to I would like incense and all kinds of things too kind of like Get It Like Hoops it back into place I can't imagine the people going to start following me after this where women would go to the doctor to get stimulated as well right is that true or is that I believe and I could be wrong on this that there was a Victorian idea that a woman had to orgasm in order to become pregnant so that was that was an important part of it wasn't just a Victorian thing I'm pretty sure they taught me that in high school weird what there was there was this might of completely remember this incorrectly again so I was 5:15 at the time I remember when I think that was really recently that it does sound like I'd now I picture you went like a really Big Toria really nice cool you know you look at that sort of buttoned-up Victorian mentality dresses over the legs of pianos and chairs and stuff like that they did marble shirt that I remember but I really do remember something on it with that because of what I just did it right it says it's not real good but it is something I remember where he talked about during one of his speeches that it's right we did we did fact check</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and it's smallpox a lot of people I don't know if I did I send you a picture of smallpox Jamie why people think so it's it's like chickenpox like it's a really awful disease and it's the only disease that we have eradicated ever in human history very common it was it was very feared as well because it was so disfiguring and so if you were for instance a wealthy woman and you got smallpox and you were scarred your family might worry that they couldn't marry you off so you know it was one of those diseases that left its mark on you literally and it also has a high mortality rate as well but it wasn't like chicken pox thankful the people figured out how to get rid of something and smallpox vaccine was invented in eighteenth-century most people don't know it's it's that old dr. Edward Jenner invented it and actually the biggest anti-vaxxer movement or protest happened in the 19th century hundred thousand people turned out to March and Britain against Jenner people thought that their children would turn into cows because he use cowpox the virus cowpox to bastogne Unity on two people and so there was this huge fear that you know dirty to kind of insert this animal virus into people and there's a big protest a hundred thousand people to protest the fact that sticks parents have been jailed for not vaccinating their children and so the stories is much older than we think and the fear is that we have about vaccines or not that dissimilar to what people worried about in the past as well which incredible figure that is incredible today with the internet that mean you can find out I mean I had dr. Peter hotez on recently to talk about back pain and the misconceptions of people have and he explained that they isolated a bunch of different environmental factors that end genes that contribute to autism but that are all takes place in the womb I want to hear that the real danger that is actually harder to get that message out but a lot of you know you get famous start of cartoons of of people through turning the cows the cartoonist my new husband is cartoon isn't so it's like it's this way of the powerful way of kind of contain images and spheres and stuff and so yeah people people had that fear of vaccines for a long time but Edward Jenner coming up with his vaccine undoubtedly saved millions of people's lives but yeah it's just so it's so amazing that that's the problem is still around today you even with all the information that we have available do you know it is that idea of what you can't see it's hard to convince people and with Lister you know what you think about it hears this young guy and he's coming along he's saying the reasons Isabel little creatures and their killing your patience and trust me I have this really weird instrument called a microscope and I can see them and it was a leap of faith he was also accusing the older surgeons of inadvertently killing their patients because if they weren't washing their hands and higher mortality rates the younger generation and he changes their minds and so it's a slow burn it's not like you know the movie moment unfortunately where it just happens all at once and it takes quite a long time and it's it's weird that takes so long because if you think about him coming in 1876 to America's after the Civil War people were dying soldiers were dying of high infection rate they were packing wounds with mud comes to Philadelphia to convince the medical community and speaker after speaker just denounced him on the first day and then he gets up and he he does his demonstrations and he starts to slowly change people's minds but it takes a long time but the cover of the of the American book is on the American version I should say is a famous painting by and see that by Samuel gross call the Gross Clinic in the middle I think he's so didn't believe in Lister that he would walk into the room he slammed the door and he stayed there Mr lister's germs can't get in anymore and you can see in this that he's stick he's wearing his street clothes he's sticking his Dirty Fingers into this wound and there's a woman in the background and she's covering her face and she's the mother of the patient and she's wearing black because she expects her son to die so it's so this is the u.s. cover and for the UK cover I think I sent that to Jamie it's I sent you a picture book cover side-by-side it's another painting by eakins and it was done within 10 years and it's called the Agnew clinic and it's totally different because the doctors are wearing white</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> tossed about that these people that have this ancient well they have his memory of childbirth right so all of a sudden you're being born is bright lights above you is a man or a woman who's the surgeon with a mask that covers their face all you see is their eyes and everything looks bright and it's terrifying and clinical and you're on the stable and everything's cold most of these alien abduction experiences that people recount they take place in some sort of a medical facility and everything is bright and strange and cold and they think that what this is is there they're saying that we had this idea that children don't have memories that babies don't have memories and why wouldn't their memories of every second that they were born in it's probably one most profound and disturbing memories because before that everything is incredibly peaceful inside the mother's womb pulled out and then there's his bright light above you never experience any life so every and your visual perception your field of view is all distorted right the first time using your eyes that's why people have the same adduction so well does because people don't really go anywhere just think about the abduction thing is they put like cameras in people's rooms and and they say they have these alien abduction experiences but they don't go anywhere so what they're doing is a dream which is they tend to be medical very Medical in nature right you're being examined and then there's also going back to childbirth is also a lot of people that have these experiences that they are being told that either they're taking their baby away from them or their studying their baby that they had a baby inside of them to know about and if the aliens have put it there and they're taking it out write me to call Tom very weird but this this memory that people have from childhood is most likely you know I'll probably a pretty intense powerful memory that's always there kind of like moving back to you know it's Men start to get involved in childbirth around the 17th century 18th century women who would spread the word in the village that someone was going into labor they were called the gossips so there a man might be brought in if the mother was dying or the child was dying and then in that case instruments were brought into the birth the birthing chamber so the doctor might come in and he might take the server for sets and put the baby apart and take the baby out video die could handle that on the cesarean section people think that it comes from the term that the idea that Julius Caesar with ripped from the womb of his mother but it's unlikely that that story is true because his mother lives into old age so that only the Latin term meaning to cut and the first sort of record we have of this happening I think is in the 16th century and it's a farmer and he takes the we have of this happening I think is in the 16th century and it's a farmer and he takes the instrument that he uses to castrate his pigs to cut this baby out of his wife and we don't have any records of this probably didn't work again</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> century and of course later you have cocaine you have opium which is it will actually cocaine comes along and is presented as sort of a cure to the opiate the morphine addiction so like so they weren't they were using it for all kinds of things we're becoming addicted themselves these drugs then heroin comes along their infants heroin heroin is given to your children and it's putting all kinds of things again it's it's positioned as you know break your cocaine addiction now with Heroin so it was crazy. ancient Egypt that tested positive for cocaine but they think that it might be a false positive because apparently there's something else that they would consume back then that would make you test positive for cocaine but it was some Evan I think what they were trying to connect us to now I remember they were trying to connect this to the idea that people from Egypt had the ability to travel to the Americas and that someone from here goes American drugs in ancient Egyptian mummies to make a little larger please it says it seems safe to say that Bubba Bubba buck in 1992 a new study of nine mummies from ancient Egypt created quite a stir when is NASA discovered traces of nicotine and cocaine in their hair both of these chemicals came from plants found only in South America in this research has since been touted as evidence of pre-columbian contact between American Africa something thought to be impossible based on the rest of the Ark record to what's going on with start by looking at the evidence Bubba Bubba Bubba to the performed by balabanova into that's a serious woman and two of her colleagues at The Institute for anthropology and while this is in Munich they're using German words for anthropology probably in Humanities of University in Munich test for carried out by 9 mummies online Memories music museum dating from 1072 395 BC to study focus on hair samples with your offering used to assess drug concentrations in the body do the results was tested positive for cocaine and hashish which makes sense the results cause an immediate start with a how to take the traces of drugs and nine mummies means what is it what is a conclusion cut-to-the-chase Seahawks Backup backup stop cocaine most early civilizations the Andean region of South America that you and the coca leaves exactly instead the cocaine and possibly the nicotine to were actually being introduced to the mummies as part of an embalming process well more like Liam Payne cocaine from America okay I don't know I give up there's no way it will have to read this rare or exotic materials almost certainly used and it is far less of a stretch to suggest this included imports from the Middle East and potentially as far afield as Indio I don't know I think they there this very skeptical about the idea that people from Egypt were able to travel all the way to the Americas where cocaine was but I think I think part of the conclusion was that there were some other things that would make that you test positive for cocaine like poppy seeds make you test positive for heroin Jordan era was there and some people come look and then it says corpses off the recently deceased as ancient mummies was a thriving tourist game and Egypt during the Victorian era like I could have what is one of those mommy said they want to eat them as I say did you say lose weight in those late-night infomercials right now there's an IMAX exhibit in Los Angeles at one of the Museum's I saw it about a year ago but they have a King Tut exhibit and then on top of that they have this gigantic IMAX theater which is fantastic and they show the all these different tombs that they had discovered and how they discovered omen but it makes you really when they discovered King Tut's tomb we have no idea how many similar Tunes there were that were looted over the genome what gets me is what was the motive like where was the theory like when the theory come from like when you want to take a mummy and make it into powder it would feel used since if I stabbed you with a sword gets very violent you could be healed if I put the sort of special sympathetic powder on the sword it would feel you so it was sort of this song healing by distance so all kinds of strange ideas existed but and that's why it's important</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> as we know it when did it first start like what is the first historical recounting of an actual doctor they would have been you know sometimes what they call the Wise Women, kind women and barber surgeons do what am I I know it's one of my favorite stories and amend the ball at the top represented the bowl that would catch the blood and the stick would have been the stick that you held the kind of get your veins to stick out and people were bloodlight for all kinds of reasons like you would do it like a purge or diet or or you would do it because you were ill the idea being that you had produce too much blood and you needed the blood to be latitude kind of restore balance in your body like your sick we need to remove some of your blood you have too much blood in your system Lindsey play or the patient with play with like musical therapy Demon Barber Sweeney Todd one of these stories that pops up and they think that it might be that medical practitioners were trying to undermine the legitimacy of The Barbers or troubles no charge listen to your troubles 50 Cent semi had that on there Barber thing when they're cutting bullets out of you with his bullets removed two bucks a t i don't know they're all drunk Pomade mustache wax I don't know what's something that someone found baby and they're selling that as a peacemaker My Cry probably yeah blue and white barber poles now so what happened was the barber surgeons and the surgeons split off professionally at some point in history and so the surgeon start to use blue and white poles in the barbers use red and white pole that you could come in and get your bloodletting cuz those those bloody Rags would have been out there on the pole before they had the pole they would advertise by putting just bowls of congealed blood in the window and then in London they decided I think it was the fourteenth Century they said no more of that so the barber started to throw the blood into the river witch but nobody could really do much for you in that. According to our own server 21st to understand that you don't understand but I always say to go back to your question about you know how would it feel to hear something so dumb what do you think today that you know what a hundred years were going to look back at and there's there's definitely going to be stuff right there know that totally works you know that that trend of copying now that you see so that was also it's 17th century so they would cut they would have these heated cops and they would create this blister and then they would cut it open with this really sharp instrument and that's how they would bleed you but kind of this weird thing that's coming back but for slightly different reasons I don't think there's any evidence of cupping is real appearance so to speak but people do all kinds of weird things now to like they eat the placenta and I like to talk about which is corpse medicine so people used to actually eat dead bodies for medicinal purposes apart so if you had Apple FC in the early modern. So we're like talking like 16th 17th 18th centuries people would drink the blood of an executed criminals Patrick going to lose his hat in these people are like holding cops out to catch the blood and it didn't work and epilepsy was so awful because it was so misunderstood and you can imagine you know when someone goes into a seizure it's it's it's scary and if you don't understand what's happening you could think that it's witchcraft or is it all kinds of things that people thought about that disease so these people were quite that's what they're drinking the blood of executed criminals and they would make it into pills I always point this out we eat the placenta today it's kind of like you know a form of ingesting the bodily yes I always point this out we eat the placenta today it's kind of like you know a form of ingesting bodily yes</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Twitter page and you first of all how do you are a doctor circular saw and there would have been a crank that you wounded with and then you would release it and it would Spin Sword of automatically the reason why I love the sauce so much is that it was a massive failure and I don't think we talked about failure enough and science and medicine you know there's a lot of things that don't work and so this guy who invented the saw when he tried it out it was spinning so fast that he took off his assistants fingers I never got a prototype phase so I had to recreate it for my my YouTube channel when you in those old days when they didn't have antibiotics and antiseptic and when they saw someone's leg off for some point that many times those people live Worcester who applies germ theory developed Santa stops at sojourn fighting techniques and most people don't know who he is but they know the product Listerine so Whispering was named after him but I always tell people that so basically Worcester was a British surgeon and came to America in 1876 to convince the medical community of germs and there was a guy in the audience and he decided to create this product but it wasn't even a mouthwash in the 19th century are you a medical historian oh God how much does it cost how much it would cost for that we're talking about before anesthesia so you're fully awake and one of my favorite surgeons is guiding Robert Liston he's 6-2 is really tall for the 19th century and he could hold you down with his left arm and you could take your leg off in about 30 seconds I wonder how many people would be at the end of this bike has like five people would be still out there listening so it's so he was incredibly fast and he was walking to the showman so you walk in and he'd say tiny gentleman and you can just hear the Ripple pocket watches also used which is why those rumors are that Jack the Ripper may have been a medical practitioner but thought delete all one of my favorite stories is he would go so fast as he was switching instruments he hold his way into his mouth just like Peter died of fright it's forever in the butchering art is back I got it and he's fears words that mean that the floor of the operating theater was crowded as well so they have to actually clear the floor sometimes you can imagine you know you're strapped to this and the leg wasn't the worst thing so one of the tweets that you shared of mine which your platform seemed to enjoy and sold me a lot of books by the way I think you was this story about this guy who was suffering from a bladder stone and it got stuck in his room and so out of dust and he stuck a nail down his penis and he hammered it to break it up Circle each other on YouTube clearly a penis things get removed from Instagram it's really kind of seems to be depended upon how many people complain that we should tell these stories open late because they happened in medicine and science crew the results of it but but they're not easy subjects to discuss with an audience especially when you have so many characters in Twitter and you're you're trying to get out of complex idea but also like you're not just there's a lot of educating people about the history and always say it's my audience so I've been going around the world sort of demolishing romantic Notions about people white high think about what it's like to live in the past cuz it was pretty pretty bad and I have visuals as well and I've had four men Saints so far it's always been so I'm not going to eat and then their blood sugar plum is so it's not really prepared you know in the real theaters where they used to cut my Stones heard of a like a theatrical scene of a young Lister attending an operation in that feeder and it's on my YouTube channel, under the knife and I really want to get this made into a movie I'm trying to come into Hollywood and convince Hollywood that this Quakers hurting from the Victorian. operations and I've gone through several of them we owe those people a massive that you don't have to be awake Hyman and I know we have images and I'm sure you two won't take those. He comes to Robert Liston the fastest knife in the West End in the eighth and 1828 and has a huge facial tumor growing I mean it's been growing for about eight years it's taking off his whole face he can't breathe now and Liston looks at him and says I can't do this operation which is tantamount to death sentence but he goes up to Scotland he goes there is yeah it's it's incredible when you see painting on Superman goes up to Scotland and he sees a guy named James sign and sign agrees to do this operation and payment is set for 24 minutes in a chair restrained while this thing is cut out of his face and drop in a bucket is definitely Slimmer but he doesn't look so it is incredible you can't there's a woman who has in 1840 without any anesthetic know this time you would have if you were wealthy or if you're middle class you have this operation in your home with all kinds of infection so hospitals were places for the poor and to give you an idea of how gross it was the bug catcher who would rid on the beds of lice he was paid more than the doctors and surgeons and this time I mean that's pretty important I'm not going to tell you the day which would make me more anxious he thought it was going to help her not focus on it but all you would be thinking about right as when is skywind breasts and she she does survive and she talks about how it's so vascular that the blood blind him at one point it's so like just when you think it can't get worse you can't see and he's under she is under his hand for an hour and a half away and she survived a long and somewhat happy are more able to adapt to pain and we are but none the less there would have been some pretty heavy was wondering what year was we know when cancer became common or was it always common humans round and so with breast cancer you know probably by the time I got to the stage mastectomy it probably would have spread you think about like you know it being visible to the naked eye survived she did survive in so then you have to question whether she had breast cancer or maybe it was some kind of and so Joseph Lister when he comes up with his antiseptic techniques he actually performs a mastectomy on his sister on his dining room table entertaining I have no cold I'm not a part of that world but this guy with the face where they cut that tumor out of his face so for 24 minutes that's all it took to cut that thing out of his face and it was incredibly painful to be stuck a ride down the penis and they cut through the scrotum and remove the stone and of course there was no pain medication and it was just awful but I heard that prove me wrong maybe there's like a weird example but I've never come across that you and the surgeon and with the lithotomy it takes about a good surgeon took about 5 minutes will there's a guy named Stephen Pollard in 1828 goes in to have this done now it's incredibly embarrassing it's your you know you're naked from the waist down its operation is painful and the surgeon ends up taking over an hour because he's so naps and the patient is screaming you please just stop to stop and I'm done and the surgeon yelled back at him for having abnormal Anatomy which how would you like that you're sitting around the table and you're being blamed for this going wrong and he pulls to the operation but he does Diet post-op infection blaming the guy I did you have lunch before this hosted Fear Factor version of Fear Factor when it came back for brief.

So your Queen for a Day they call it again letter Queen for a Day letter and the hopes we called the Queen for a Day and so I do the same and so Alex was free to just speak and you can too priefert a meeting is to prove to not run by and not get in trouble for any crimes that you admit there about the investigation so that was the allegations that he actually Liza like listen I'm a documentarian people lie to me for a living I'm fine with that especially cuz they spelled my name right and page six and that s*** was involved I don't have the juice to make that happen I suspected he wasn't telling us the whole truth I thought he made some interesting pointed Alpha to Alfred had with a picture in High School North Miami Beach Senior High Go chargers and Alfred actually pitched against Alex Rodriguez's like one of his old me more stories from his baseball years in high school right is that Alex was a senior Outlet on Frazier baseball camp and they do the summer league game and Alfred is my eyes are glazed over telling me a story but like Albert's pictures against a ride and who's already a senior already beat everybody knew this guy was going to was going to go in the draft and be shoot everybody knew about that he had been the talk of the high school baseball community in Miami forever and so against him and he held a rod to a triple we have like a funny personal anecdote like we can find some common ground here right you're talking to someone who might be a potential interview subject you know and so I might actually Alex you and Alfred his neck before after rolls his eyes like you've been embarrassed me until the dumb s*** story so I cannot like isn't this funny like you guys went and looked at me like you're looking at me right now he's just amused and maybe look even a little or ended the greatest baseball one of the greatest baseball players of all time the highest paid baseball player in history and here I'm just telling this cute story for like 20 years earlier whenever and he seemed like I tell me to a triple like how could you be upset about that you one of the greatest of all time like this super winners but it's like I was curious about him I was excited about the prospect of interviewing him and then they don't have as we go see this out yet January 2014 that's when they lowered they reduced the suspension I started hitting up every month start hitting up the publicist Joe following up on that meeting love to get one but we haven't gotten a book proposal from a ride he really did have the meeting with us but like everything was just we're just kind of Pawns in his game which is whatever I'm a bill respond to this documentary not exactly but I want 6 or 7 months strategies to shut the f****** and just like like you said like the president being retarded big S conduit and then maybe if we just tomorrow within the 24-hour news cycle in this f****** in this world of just being us being hammered with bad news on 240 characters every second of every day just s*** just passes and they just they they played it just so so beautiful</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> why these people are f****** sketchy folks and you're exposing how stupid their activity were does that does that ever creep you out if you get nervous like cuz you're making these documentaries mocking these people and rightly so but it's not Cocaine Cowboys really mocking is more exposing but this one is like openly mocking this one's really good man really funny and it comes out March 29th and April 5th this is like a fresh wound from Netflix on your cable box and then I mean Miami Orlando cities and then depending on how well it does being put up by Greenwich entertainment who just won the Oscar for free solo documentary that guy I like what I just imagine if you got one of those guys in your life and he's just stuck in your life like s*** how do I get this f****** guy out of my life and the fact that he borrowed money from this guy and then did loading money will loan money to stay at Porter loaned it to Tony in Miami like just hiring private investigators running people down Rodriguez actually this isn't in the documentary but when these convicted felons stole the stolen documents from Porter Fischer who had stolen the documents from Tony Bosch they set him up in this hole an orange goes to go try it on and while he's in the f****** spray-tan machine they open his car and steal these documents which I have these Client List of all these famous baseball players including the highest paid baseball player in the world A-Rod and so they steal it and then they turn around and sell the stolen documents to Major League Baseball for cash MLB has this ragtag band of Misfits these internal FBI own internal investigations division that they created after the Balco steroids Scandal they're running amok they are seducing nurses former nurses from Tony Bosch's clinics they are literally in diners with convicted felons handing over bags of cash from some MLB slush fund I don't imagine they were going to 1099 the guy and I know who this cash came from 125 Grand and what they did was that the felony had a buddy a neighboring table at this diner with a cell phone recording video recording this transaction and then he turned around and went to a-rod's camp and said I'll sell you a video of me selling known stolen documents everybody knew these documents were stolen stolen records stolen evidence in the State of Florida Department of Health investigation for cash from a felon he gets like freak out and nervous and he deletes this video off the hard drive he wanted selling a rod a blank hard drive for six figures okay and A-Rod sends his hard drive your eyes people been this hard drive around the world like data recovery services payment because that was that was the first pictures were against the recovery of the Dead dropping money on private investigators were like having car chases to South Miami it was just totally crazy and end like I was he like you come down to the swamp and roll around here to get some mud on you so when MLB came down to to Miami when the guy Jerome Hill the the former Baltimore cop turned Florida Department of Health investigator he he said unequivocally that Major League Baseball's investigators broke the law on this Florida and should have been prosecuted for and held accountable for it and never and never were on it's good to be a multi-billion-dollar monopoly how old was A-Rod when the Scandal broke the other you know the Barry Bonds waste of microdosing your microdosing HGH and testosterone and a lot of these guys I mean listen to their livelihoods are contingent upon your physical performance and so you got to play like 162 games and 180 days it's the most physically grueling schedule of any of the other professional sports and guys have always been looking for the Yankees tonight Boswell a disproportionate number of baseball players compared to the general population on Adderall they have to make a 1 p.m. game maybe even a double-header are looking to maintain Peak Performance for a longer. Than their bodies might have otherwise allowed is it that big of a deal I don't know it's not and it's it's a weird deal it's a weird thing we have an issue with like look if they did the same sort of stringent testing with NFL players you would find out that everyone's on stilts that's just the fact you don't get people that big and they do catch him every now and then but I feel like it's like one of those things you know the drug cartels they'll let some drug drug shipments get busted so that the other ones will get through I almost feel like that's what they do with with NFL players get caught like all look like Bloom where were testing we got somebody that's what this was with a rod your bud selig is the steroid commissioner. That's the bottom line his tenure was marked by the famous you know he knowingly I believe exploited and profited from that Era baseball that really saved them at the 94 players strike any baseball going to look at the size of those guys when they started I mean so many of them that stuff and some people did not Jose Canseco never recovered and never recovered in the public eye how to distract or diffuse but it look like it's the public nature of Canseco's book it's like I don't know I'm just guessing his book was like his book turn out to be like the with a Canseco's book about the Steele dossier of baseball and everybody thinks is pissed and thanks a bunch of bulshit and then over time it's the only proven true run at the end there's a pee tape yes I think that for</div>

needed to update or upgrade his G4 to a G6 so gross because they go after people that are so poor and destitute that they can't pay their bills they tell them if you just send me money God will pay you back tenfold and I know he's saying you don't have any money but you do you do you take that money you send it to Jesus and Jesus will bring prosperity in your life and then they have all these folks that are giving testimonials about how I was down on my luck I didn't have money for rent I didn't have money for food but I knew that Jesus needed this money sent Jesus the money and Jesus paid me back tenfold and now my life is filled with joy and prosperity am I being hateful when I say that that is what religion prays on the right when I was younger I think there's some benefit to like having community and having this environment where everybody goes to be humbled and never everybody goes to agree that they're going to be good people that follow the ethics of Jesus and he put a little money in the dish and yeah they have to keep the operation running and there's a lot I think there's a lot of churches that do a lot of good but I think for everyone or two that do a lot of good there's these m************ that are just stealing money and driving Rolls-Royce cigarettes giant f****** castles you know that Joel whatever his name what's that guy's name who owns a huge Arena he think they do the show near and in he caught a rash it when he didn't let all the hurricane victims stay in his place she he was holed up in his 10 million dollar mansion a lot of good were they they provide people with comfort you know it doesn't necessarily have to make any sense it doesn't make any sense but it provides them with Comfort appreciate like I respect people of faith I think it must feel wonderful I don't know how it feels but it must be wonderful to believe in something like that so devoutly without any evidence without any indication or proof whatsoever that what you so firmly believe in is true but it's apocracy of it that I just buybuy baby's Prosperity guys who used to have a claim to have some kind of holier-than-thou moral code but now things like the pimp president school I get it but like your whole thing was like the Bill Clinton was the biggest scumbag in the world and he needs to be impeached and because trouble is that is not a knock on him but he was a lifelong Democrat when he only really became a republic and we thought about running for president as an independent for a minute that he was a democratic-republican glass has been cleaned and squeegeed and you could see right through it works on evangelicals yeah and I don't want to be mean about this but I think it's accurate that there's there's a level of intellect that just subscribes to that kind of stuff that like I had a friend she was in the Mormon church for a long time and she left the church but she was really honest about it she said I have a problem that I'm susceptible to b******* but she's susceptible cuz she grew up a fundamentalist and so she's susceptible to you know to like you Thai people like crystals in the Delights feel like she's susceptible all that s*** and she would recognize her susceptibility but she was being really honest about it you know that she's like I have a real problem I grew up believing something that doesn't make any sense and I believe that wholeheartedly and she goes in that sort of formulated a big part of how I ascertain what is accurate in the world so she's left with these like childlike skill of of being able to discern what's b******* and what's a hustle she's like a little kid I have a great amount of respect for people who grew up in a cult and who can make their way out of it I mean can you imagine when you're a child most impressionable and and you're steeped in that you know like you don't know that there is an alternate perspective and and you're able to grow up and say oh wait there's a whole big world there maybe I'm not being told the truth that's incredibly powerful it's really hard I think break with the only thinking that you've ever known in your life I think it's amazing it's one of the other horseshit like the Mormon one is so crazy to the results are great the people are so nice all time but then you go back and look at the actual framework of the religion of South Equipment when he was 14 like hold on Joseph Smith was 14 and 18 20 when he found golden tablets that contain the Lost work of Jesus and only he could read them cuz he had a magic Rock but like that's Judaism and Catholicism will we know it's a lie failed a failed sign if you want to make real money start a religion I mean it is even after all those documentaries even have to Leah Remini show all these things just they go out of the world until everybody is horseshit and then a brand new Scientology Center opens in Miami I'm like seriously who is no open now that's what it is it's like you're going to do if you want to put in the money some people have $100 some people have $5 and this is like intellectually some people have a lot of room to work with some people don't they just did their brain doesn't work as good just like some people have poor genetics when it comes to their ability to run fast some people have really shity brain development genetics Khan person how much sympathy do you have for the gleefully with a willfully ignorant meaning like information is there it's available before I give Scientology my money I could just I don't know Google it how much sympathy do you have for willfully ignorant and he has a quote that I was like to use you got to let a hoe be a hoe and I think in that sounds like you got to let dummies get fleeced it's just part of it part of it is there for us to see part of it is there for you to go what they gave away all their money off s*** like there's something to that benefit up like I'm not a fan of these videos where kids try to skateboard off the side of a building and they slip and fall and land on their head and everybody but but those video serve a purpose and that purpose is not but those video serve a purpose and that purpose is not everybody gets to do the handstand on the side of the building and survive some people fall in the laminar f****** head and never the same again and then they left with like a third graders IQ for the rest of their life that's real man so it's George Carlin's bit about the kid who swallowed the most marbles doesn't get to grow up and have kids of his own that's how it's supposed to work</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I mean I've talked about Cocaine Cowboys probably a hundred times this podcast is one of my all-time favorite part. But this is a story that almost wiped itself it's so Bonkers and the fact that it all could have been avoided if one guy just paid another guy or just didn't try to rip them off like for Grant yeah and the guy Bizarro personality who was who just tan everyday and hang out at the doctor's office in the waiting room telling everybody how great it was like the whole thing is so strange like that's ever remembers it is like the A Rod or a roid Scandal Alex Rodriguez was collateral damage of the highest paid baseball player effectively ended over a $4,000 debt between this cocaine-addicted fake doctor and his fake tan addicted steroid patient and it's like it's just like it's pure 100% Florida it's like kind of flea to Miami from like all over the country and all over the world usually leaving some kind of criminality in their weight and you know come here and kind of there themselves you know like it's just and then you have all of these criminals there we've been kind of baking in the sun you know when this kind of Multicultural f****** paella you know that we have and then I'm happy just like and then they start putting their minds together and brainstorming and they hatch just the most inane schemes and scams like that's our primary export from Miami is just schemes and scams was so amazing that still cocaine culture 2 after all these years it's still has a giant Coke engine pumping out all this chaos we don't have any indigenous industry Factory where everybody goes to work and then 30 years later get to watch with no business there it's called licenses in Florida is oranges and machine guns we don't make anything that we sell the dream we saw the sunshine that came true basically this point of money a real estate hustle and a money-laundering capital so it's really no different than it ever was everybody likes to tell me what's changed its growing am I just guess you built a bunch of s*** doesn't mean we've grown Miami is just like Nye any one of the youngest cities in the country and in your parlance would be about one person old or one-and-a-half people of Ghana you know right from wrong because I've said this before but isn't there more Banks per capita in Miami than anywhere else would have knew he was before the heat up the the Great Recession when a lot of them started shutting down but most of them have rebounded one of the clever things some of the real estate developers did was they open their own bank literally their own bag databank work the entire Board of the bank all real estate developer and over 90% of the loans the bank made was in Haider loans of course they went belly-up in the Great Recession and what happened we bailed him out all the money that is Roundup being backed ultimately By Us by the taxpayer that's a Miami story and when the Great Recession happen the FDIC had to open an office in Florida cuz we have more Bank closures than any other state in the Union to Someone Like You could go down there and you could buy a f****** mortgage for your dog at a drive-thru in Miami in the unlikely the late 90s early aughts and remember interviewing a guy we're doing it working on a project laponsie State about the State of Florida as like a a case study in the Great Recession we never finished it unfortunately but we're interviewing this guy and he says this is pre like big short like this before anybody should have knew a lot about this and he said we were down here in Miami setting fires and Wall Street was trying to read our smoke signals that's why I say like the Miami of today is the America of tomorrow but I love it I really do love it's a crazy place to do stand-up you know I did this job because I was doing a Netflix special and I was doing it a couple months after I did this gig in Miami and so I was using those Yonder bags know what those are white people have to put their cell phone into this magnetic bag you keep the phone but you hold the phone in the bush you want to use it you have to step outside they open up the bag and they give your phone and every other City it made for a better show because people just sat down and watch the show in Miami made for literally 40% of crowd at any given time was getting up and going to the back and using their phone and coming back in there were just constantly moving around and presume that was to use their phone it might have been powdering their nose they might have been the problem but a Miami just everybody needed to use their phones they just kept getting up and coming back and it was just chaos Castle Shannon really ends and so like I always say the reflection everything that we do in the way that would behave shortly in the way that we drive like lunar not like people are so much more chill and calm here in traffic in La I swear to God and he was famous for like road rage Ellie like created invented road range but like and it's a shared experience traffic sucks for all of us just chill out and use your turn signal for crying out loud and just but that's why I said that's why they call it Miami me and stay out of my f****** a me it's just Damien and I eat for a while I was I was pretty determined to like leave behind a better Florida than the one I was fail in Miami so he did his residency in emergency rooms in Miami and he was there in the 80s during like the height to be during when Cocaine Cowboys takes place and he saw everything to keep me he had all these pictures of bullet holes and skull fragments and people with lightbulb stuffed up their asses and just he said it every day was just f****** chaos and we do Miami idea ever else the light bulb goes off over head in Miami we in one of those ones just got stuck a light bulb is out on a broken his ass at least he was concerned about the environment that's like one of those environmentally like sound like good environmentally sound like my sticker glass on his ass better Boat Lift started which I think everybody kind of Pop Culture frame of reference for the Mariel boatlift is Scarface Tony Montana was a marielito that's the beginning of the movie when you know Castro was ranting and raving that is flushing the toilet of Cuba on to the United States specifically to Miami and so he was working at the the trauma center Jackson Memorial Emergency Room at in Miami and he said he got a Mario Refugee these guys would stand the beach they would it look like Havana in South Beach like there's that like oral Seawall and it's like it had a really bad Vibe so they would go it would chill mostly these flop houses south of 5th Street in Miami Beach we are like the cops would literally just they would be leaving after a stabbing at one of these places and maybe three blocks away to get a call to go back cuz now there was a shooting or something else it would be going there like around the clock and so and they would just get in gunfights and they would just let it go so he has Mario Refugee who comes in to the emergency room with a gunshot wound and you Spanish you bilingual you said the guy said you're really lucky cuz if this bullet had hit you know a few centimeters or whatever this way you would have died immediately would have let out right there on the scene died instantly and guy splits a few days later another Mario Refugee comes in with a gunshot wound in exactly the same spot where he had told the other guy she got hit there he would have died could never prove it never was able to trace it back but he was pretty well convinced that it was a Revenge shooting the other

kind of like Dan Rather the guy threatening at what the Sentinel Dan what's a signal when I had the globalist 15 years ago 20 years ago try to buy me often the year you know whatever is true but this

are humans the way they get around it is a midi death but you say I believe they are but you say so many different things without stopping it's hard to keep running stores aliens are real they're creating human-animal hybrids that are a new creature never here on Earth Eats alien so the aliens are already here is alien Alien aliens are already here show insecurities by the I think it's

of us are going to make it there's a post human error coming the Breakaway civilization the deal's been made it's not it's not the third dimension they've made freaking deals with inter-dimensional aliens you got a total schizophrenic and thinks the sun is following around town and thinks their dog is watching them and work for the aliens over here someone over here to believe everything they see on Fox News yes okay yes so they have to differentiate and create a model that allows them to put it in boxes so they can make it make sense cuz they can't handle it the way it is not what I was going to show they're not going to cover this to me this is not my real research that I have heard that I have talked to Army generals commanding generals Major General General General CIA everybody and their all 100% thought it was a sign up before and I research and I talked to hundreds of people that are not on there that make a film on this to take an Ayahuasca and DMT I'm not taking it and obvious reasons and and it's unbelievable because I'm a hundred percent of San Francisco is the main project site literally have an alien base and they are literally communicating and they got like an astronaut level people super hardcore level to Broad and going into meetings with these things and making Intergalactic deals and that again that's what the government says they're doing me getting into this show is just because some people you understand that I know about this for a long time and I just don't think people are ready for it but a lot of folks who have low oxygen and a 9-volt brains well well who have sleep apnea bubbly Big Macs they had tons of you and me to 62% oxygen that's another time that the brain releases DMT show my whole life since I was about my first memories were every night was a DMT trip so I basically I don't want to sound arrogant it's not I've seen everything or will you do research programs on babies where we tell poor women that your baby died while we were born will keep the baby alive and some of them something Harvest that's why they good morning chilling right well I didn't see that I am very very concerned with late-term abortion before God and Country to Jamie's I will give $1000000 to your charity of choice if you can prove that I'm making up at the governor said we keep babies alive after they're born we keep him comfortable and then turns out he's an organ harvesting thing and that's what they're doing you don't know. putting it right on the Infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable infant would be resuscitated if if that's what they bothering their family desired and then a discussion wouldn't so between the Physicians and the mother so babies alive when I can put the van and drive away what's going on today show the babies worth $500,000 but but if you kill him right on the spot for like why are we wasting this seven pounds of meat if we catch where they go oh we consider the baby dead the mother decided it didn't live if she decides we resuscitated lives but it didn't resuscitate its flesh it's illegal into a special Ward with doctors that make a few million a year

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> next to Richard Spencer as being a far-right influential right in the neighborhood spend more you f****** Apartments and here's the thing they're terrified of someone coming after them yeah they try to embrace the more Preposterous the better like you're having a real hard time now with this woman the congressman you know who said a bunch of anti-Semitic yet being not anti-israeli but having problems with their policy us and Jews are critical of Israel example where was it was somewhere in Europe where these this Muslim group was shouting down this lbgt demonstration and the like everybody's Agarwal Jesus what do we do here we have two protected classes going to war with each other and one of them is shouting down the other one's saying that you know homosexuality is forbidden by God but then we're supposed to be protective of lbgt people open minded in Progressive and allowing that but then you have these people who are saying that it's their religion that they think that this is this is wrong and this is also protected class you don't want to be islamophobic so what does everyone do when everyone stands back and this is one of the weird moments our people are standing back while lbgt people getting absolutely crucified in the street yelled at with bull horns told her being there Sinners and blasphemers Free Speech rights are organized and express yourself as long as you don't incite someone to violence as long as you don't say hey you guys go kill those gay people over there bro I'm not talking about constitutional I agree it is but what I'm saying is there's no outrage there's no commensurate outrage like there would be if they like white nationalist were screaming at these people so here's my issue with the far left on the left or even ever forget the right for a second I have my own issues with that but what might with the progressive argument I always noticed that the narrative is very binary The Narrative is always so for example of racism is the argument right so we need to get rid of racism I happen to think we could be as identical as penguins and would still find reasons to break into US versus them was the ultimate problem then use the Middle East that would be fairly would be a final days and she is the eagle in the Europa and I can keep going with it with it all kinds of do people look at that Dinka and the newer of the sedan sworn enemies they look exactly like human beings don't need to have different colored skin Surefire echo-chamber that's a big problem and and then you surround yourself with people who think and and see the world exactly like yourself and I think we get smarter when we listen to the other side of me if you don't agree with them because your ideas aren't working and their ideas are working but put your ideas together and maybe somebody gets pregnant with a new idea the ideas that there's some way that you could stop all division between human beings longest people allowed to express themselves they live unique and individual lives that's never going to happen you're going to have people that come from different parts of the world where different things are more important you're going to have people to come from different economic situations is going to be different mean when when I say that I'm almost a socialist what I mean is like look there's certain things we just accept that we need like here's one you need a well-funded fire department right whose whose money everybody would pool our money into that right we agree with that we agree there's well funded public education you have to have that right well we barely do that right now but we do have that induces teachers getting f***** left and right there getting minimal pay kid children's are going to school and hazardous conditions but it's at least there's some money being public police officers we Grape Street fixing the streets we agree we agree on a lot of things but then it gets a certain things we go okay well that's where we draw the line why do we draw the line there why do we draw the line when it comes to a community of people like fixing communities why do we mean infrastructure why don't we have like it when we if we really a team or the United States really team why don't we look at it as a team in terms of equal allocation of resources to solve conflicts and problems including crime we don't write the problem is isolating the source of the problem on what the actual problem is I can give you examples when we talk about illegal immigration what to actually do about it people are all over the board with it and I'll challenge your solution in court and there's all kinds of Steel mace would probably is a good thing so things don't get two-day don't swing too far and I got erection Universal basic income universal healthcare gun control data actually fairly complicated issues you know I don't want spree Shooters you know but when you get down to it and and you hear people are really educated on the subject of guns get you twisted up in an argument if you start talking about gun control because you realize this is a complicated issue and maybe it's a mental health issue maybe it's a thousand issue browser there's no other way you have to be mentally ill nor to do that now I want you to think about the factors more guns there are people so in this country alone there's 300-plus million people does more than 300 million guns relatively speaking the number of mass shootings is incredibly small in comparison to the amount of guns and the amount of sick people and how many people are sick who don't become a shooter right the big number this the things I'm a lot of gun violence that the left talks about a lot of those are suicide snow a lot of it a lot of other suicides a lot of it is cop shooting bad guys thought of his people defending themselves and then after that you have gang violence but when people argue they make these things very simplistic and they're not equation because this is all power right it's all talking into milliliters no but I know I'm not but this tyrannical hierarchy and white males and took all of them out of the equation wouldn't be a new hierarchy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> or situations mark that they're just too many things to worry about I could also I don't have to worry about f****** pics and things that I can't see like flesh eating bacteria and murder worry about 1500 years ago that coincides with the end of the Ice Age that this is one of the things that he and Randall Carlson have been saying Ad nauseam and it now Brian Robert schoch rather is a professor of Boston University did you hear about the explosion the atomic bomb that exploded in Hiroshima and exploding around fear but now there's this impact that they think happened it will there's two concepts Robert schoch thinks that it might have coincided these impact might have coincided with he believes there is a great deal of evidence for a mass coronal ejection that there was some sort of a solar flare massive solar storm that happened with Ken periodically and every few thousand every few hundred years something can happen and when that does happen it just wipes out everything and he said there was thunderstorms so if there's any thunderstorms or lightning storms that were like like the hell that was coming outside with him tonight yeah but that but like lightning so this is the impact created they found in Greenland across which is yeah somewhere around fifteen Miles insanely huge but do you think as you think about your impending doom which is going to happen right I just worry about the Civilization V we're so dependent upon electricity and any small catastrophe all this is they have an impact video of where it hit wow so it's all all this like where there is glaciers right now with his massive impact they got Hitman the people that lived 12,500 years ago got hit they got there's more than one crater too by the way this is one of the many craters that they found during the time. Of 12,500 BC or 12,500 years ago rather to 10,000 years ago in that time. That 2,000 your time. Listen to his multiple impacts on the Earth well we're lucky we just been through a really lucky stage but what he's saying essentially is that this is what wiped out the Egyptian civilization the first Egyptian civilization this is what wiped out the civilization that built Gobekli Tepe this is what wiped out the civilization that preceded Sumer and ancient Babylon and Mesopotamia that all those were a rebuild of a I can't wait for him to come back on again he's coming back on again Hancock is coming back on again I think that other guy you had on the podcast was great was Michael Shermer was a friend of mine why like he's he's a skeptic and there's an issue with Skeptics that the issue is not that's not good to be skeptical it's very good to be skeptical the problem is when you approach things as a skeptic you're not approaching them as a scientist and I'm not saying that Michael does this but that I think you did in that debate I think it was a mistake people they approached these things debunk them rather than objectively assessing all the possible evidence and so because of that you miss out on big thing like this is evidence this is not like Bigfoot tracks or some s*** like that this is f****** real evidence of a crater that they have dated back to 12,500 years ago people have a hard time believing and doomsday scenarios cuz it kind of like and you have evidence for it look at global warming and stuff like that so there is a I really believe that people have with whether it's late or not a religious notion that we are ultimately sacred and that God would never do something that terrible to us on Moss and I really I really believe that like Humanity itself to go away no because that would make no sense where we're moving in a certain direction we're making progress there there's this sort of neural net is becoming easier to understand what it is to be each other you know that that's kind of what virtual reality and being able to download other people's brains will eventually do that probably brings us into one I guess Universal Consciousness me you can go on and on to the idea that that would be all but obliterated before it happens before the singularity too much to bear it would make no sense for us because we have this narrative virtual reality and being able to download other people's brains will eventually do that probably brings us into one I guess Universal Consciousness me you can go on and on to the idea that that would be all but obliterated before it happens before the singularity Fortinet what happens is too much to bear it would make no sense for us because we have this narrative that we all kind of adhere to it's very easy to do that</div>

This place is just right down the block from the from the club and when I go to a when I'm playing at a club out I hang out at the club lot and one of the girls that work there look at me and she goes don't read it and I might fly because I don't read it right it's not true it isn't true and it's a batch of job and like it's a plant a hatchet job so I might now give it to me district 6 million people this pic if it was the article was this big was a quarter of a pack and it said in big black Print even when a white snot blue he's not funny and I dropped a newspaper on the floor I couldn't hold up a 1-ounce newspaper because life isn't just sucked out of me and I also agree with them and felt like I had just been found out as a phony and I wasn't phony and didn't belong here at all and and I picked it up and read it and and it said watching why it's 41 minutes show so they were nice enough to point out I didn't I just had to get to 41 and something comical or interesting happening only occasionally here's why I'm I can quote that all these 29 years later I went across the street to the liquor store and bought a bottle of tequila and a pack of razor blades true story and go back up to my Marriott Suites on the bay and set their this big desk and I've just drinking this tequila reading it over and over and over and over and I got a big bag I'm smoking pot and I've convinced myself that they're going to cancel the truck because who would come to a show right with a review like that and ended up thinking will they probably have to pay me for the shows I didn't even you know even though I wasn't able to finish the week right so I assume I'm fire I genuinely believe that in my heart on fire so I will I wake up from this stupor and I got to drool stain on this f****** article and a half a joint and a bottle of the Dismal s*** right it's dark dark time and I walk down there the show sold out both of Mars 1990 they do give a s*** and I did I went on stage because I was still a wreck so I'm drunk I just woke up I'm not very good anyway I have no confidence whatsoever I totally agree that I suck and I'm not worth a goddamn thing and I go up there and have the worst set of ever had a sold-out house and it was just sucked I just sucked it was a horrible and and then the guy that booked me at the club so it goes yakety read the f****** article that goes that's got to be a gut-punch I mean it was a long there was other s*** in it too and then it was good and so then that they get me on the phone with him and then because I asked them they said we just want to see if he's okay love you I want to be together forever and she's like kind of standoffish look like like she could tell I had a bad review so that that kind of scared me away from La for a while and I realized then that they were right and I should have been slapped in the face that I wasn't good enough to be on that stage I was not and that guy actually apologized to me one time cuz I was showing later in life and you were totally right no business there and possibly could have also included a couple bad but every big leap I've made of the comics after I bombed every big leap for real like that you know someone telling me they had a bad time I showered felt like you were off my f*** that feeling makes me so hungry to figure out how to do it right that's where the where comes from makes you know you realize the urgency to this thing and then over the years part of the fear of bombing is what makes you work so hard on New shitt Start of the fears what makes me do so many sets I'll do to podcast tonight then I'll do 4 shows right I'll go to the store other two at the show a store I'll do one or two at the Improv I might even go to the Ice House of the haha fuk around all these are all the reasons I'm not as good as Joe Rogan I get scared I get scared that one time in the back room you like I'm older than you guys and we like what we don't give a f*** that doesn't mean anything this is this is things about comedy it doesn't matter if you are lesbian if you are trans if you're from Philadelphia or the Philippines no one gives a f*** are you funny and if you're funny that's all we care about we don't care if you're 90 or 19 I mean I'm real good over one funny if you're funny that's all we care about we don't care if you're 90 or 19 I mean I'm real Gilmore one I love that girl</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and then we can throw all that garbage into a meta-analysis and the one thing I'm pretty confident they did a poor job because the one study I looked up the one with the biggest effect they mistook kilojoules to kilocalories so they reported the 400 kilocalorie decrease in energy expenditure on the low-fat diet when was a 400 kilojoule witches of these numbers these were Jim Hill studies we've talked about you and how the biggest study switch ML and the way we approached the not-for-profit say you've got understand what the question is and you've got to design an experiment to get the right answer so when Steven dismiss this Harford three names from now hi Gary. I know I Joe Stephen ultimately rejected the study that's about a 12 million-dollar studied at Harvard based on Kevin Hall so these are two names that three people out there who are convinced that everything people like me are saying is wrong and not everything but most of it and they keep coming up over and over again and they tow Kevin Hall clay but he has refuted the carbohydrate insulin model in his studies who want to study comes out supporting at The Works to find out why the sun is wrong we all did the same thing I did the same thing right here with the Kunis study explaining why I don't find it meaningful but anyway that's always to do the right study cuz live Sarah overwhelming the healthcare system and the argument I made it said for the past fifty years basically people thought a lot like Stephen is thinking now doctor DNA and that there appears to be another story that could be true what we have to do is find out if it is true cuz people are dying out there so okay the first thing I want to say is that this alternative explanation that Gary is talking about has already been in navigated intensively including studies that were funded by his own organization new see two out of the three studies that have been published on that we're clear reputation about hypothesis and undermining your beliefs and you making those studies are garbage and we should talk about Jim Hill and his studies a little bit because you know to me just saying this guy has a conflict of interest and then insinuating and that makes the study bad and you can actually find a problem with the study itself or very rigorous studies if you cannot play now how you a problem with that study then you can't just dismiss it by making these insinuations that the person had a conflict of interest okay now into the problem okay that's great Gary now I didn't respond now the kuna I think we should really get back to this issue this non-industrial culture because the primary basis for Gary's book the case against sugar the primary observation that underlies gears belief on this is this observational correlational thing that cultures when sugar gets into these cultures they become fat and not as the common thread and in obesity and so what I'm doing is I'm pointing out a culture where sugar came in and it did not make them fat and that's one of the three cultures I haven't even looked at hard OK or just three culture I came across is probably a bunch more that are eating high levels of sugar. Enter novel coming to our hoagies and Joe explanation is right on point is a lot of other things going on in these cultures and it's more complicated than just sugar that's exactly my point now I want to talk about the Cuban economic crisis this is reference number 22 from 1989 through 1995 the Cuban economy collapse and price of food went way up the price of gasoline went way up and so people started focusing on these really cheap Foods Cuba was Major sugar producer at the time I don't know if they still are and so the intake of sugar went way up intake of refined carbohydrate went way up the diet became 77% carbohydrate primarily white rice and sugar 28% sugar of their total that's like double what Americans eat now their calorie intake went down and because of the lack of gasoline people got really physically active because they had to walk everywhere so now again this is this is a situation where we can test your hypothesis if Gary is right and calories don't matter only refined carbohydrate and sugar matter obesity should have gone through the roof in this population over that period of time what you actually is that the prevalence of obesity declined by half so there was a 50% decline it went from 14% to 7% over the period of this increase in sugar intake increase and refined carbohydrate intake and you might think well these people are just starving like crazy and that's why obesity rate went down but we actually have evidence on the rate of underweight as well and so we can check on that the rate of underweight increase slightly went from 8% to 10% and so we know these people weren't just totally starving and what happened then was as the diet rebounded as the economy Rebound in the diet rebounded and their diet shifted away from these refined carbohydrates and sugar and back to the normal diet that was higher in fat and lower in carbohydrate lowering sugar the obesity rate went right back up as soon as they went back to their normal diet and so I finally took exercise and also just their diet became richer again I mean if you're eating a diet that's a very poor diet eating like white rice and sugar I mean it's not like if that's most of what if you're sitting there on your plate has white rice and sugar you're not going to be eating a ton of that and getting fat as opposed to eating a rich or die it with more varied foods and so this is a case where you have an entire country testing Garry's hypothesis and five basically the opposite of what is hypothesis predicts when he was refuting the studies and you weren't supposed to level up this course I didn't really want to get into it because I'm going to have to read it to try and figure out what the problem is I remember looking at that study and thinking there wasn't the kind of day to your siding maybe there's multiple studies put together but the one study I looked at the kind of day to your siding wasn't in there that this is again promises are on my website so have at it no I will but smoking off the air by then the beginning of his when he start talkin referencing some studies and you had a problem with that it's a game people play I try not to get into the he-said-she-said studies cuz you never know how well they did I think we both agree that there's a reproducibility crisis in science and some huge proportion of the studies are just whether their experiments or observations people sometimes aren't very good at what they do until anyone in either business you have to shave and likes to say I have no evidence but simultaneously it was too long to read that is clearly evident in his head he speaks so he knows what this Authority until again I would like to just wait a little bit from your book Because as I was prepping for this I was for you do that though he was referencing study of a situation I don't know what the reality is that he was saying will you saying that deal with the organization that supports him actually refused hello. can you see studies yeah we're talking about the news the first two of which and we can get it we can get into detail on this on how does refuted Gary's beliefs and I would say Gary is about the only person who thinks they did not refuse beliefs of the community is pretty unanimous you can't respond but but but could you please say what was what would the study state depends what you look at to depend whether or not refuted your believe today to take can you have to understand this world to there are researchers will it one thing Kevin Hart and I ate tends to believe it'll be citizen energy balance problem and you people get back cuz they too much I hope I'm doing Kevin Justice on and then there's David Ludwig and his colleagues at Harvard who tend to believe what I believe and refunded them both to do studies and Kevin Hall study if you believe with Kevin if you believe Kevin interpreted correctly was not supportive of this model that carbohydrates are ultimately driving insulin and insulin is driving up that accumulation and then the David Ludwig study reported the opposite and then David has criticized Kevin study and Kevin has criticized David studying this is the nature of science this is what you do inside to do an experiment people critique it ideal you do another one Kevin has decided while Kevin is doing another one I think he's asking the wrong questions but I just saw the other day that he's doing another experiment on the middle study was a free-living diet study we're done by Christopher Gardner Stanford University and the idea was original people randomize to either a very low carbohydrate diet low fat diet and then we funded in part because we hoped that Christopher would be able to get people to almost a ketogenic diet on the low-carb side and Dean ornish who promotes a low-fat diet always complaining the low fat diet wasn't bad enough so hopefully they be able to separate out these two at the end of the trial they got pretty lousy adherence low-carb was about 25 to 28 car which is by no means a low mein accredited are pretty typical in free-living studies in the love that was about equal what they did which it's funny we've analyzed this on one side but not the other on they told the low carb group not to eat sugars and refined grains which are by my hypothesis the most fattening carbohydrates and they also told the low-fat group did not eat refined sugars and refined Gray so they basically remove the most fattening part of the diet from both arms of the study it's funny we knew that we're going to do with the low carb group if you have to and my colleagues actually knew they were going to do with the low-fat group I didn't know that when I found out I was stunned because now you're testing to diets neither one of them have sugar or white bread so now you see similar weight loss with relatively poor compliant why would they do that that doesn't make any sense with the Hillcrest fell out of his argument he was afraid there were two things on he wanted to die to be healthy so healthy diet in 2015 has become a diet that doesn't have sugar in white bread in it so he wasn't going to promote sugar and white bread to one diet another on I take how long is the. Of time with her settings we thought they were on their way they're supposed to die for you undersea colleagues in 2015 I could read it when I found out about the slow fat thing saying this is insane he's removed both groups are carbohydrate restricted so you could think of it as a low-fat carb high fat carbohydrate Amish without getting into unpublish research but so people see this the New York Times for instance it to stories on it one of them said it's not about calories it's about the quality of sugar in their fine-grained because both groups restricted sugar and refined grains and lost weight the other than that was written by a reporter who tends to believe what we believe and the other article said it's all about the calories because both groups ended up on average eating 500 calories each at the ends up from a scientific perspective think poorly done studying even though we funded a time not b****** that didn't answer the question you said $500 each 500 calories very strict with their cowardice actually self-reported so it's not as I know they were both not eating as much refined carbohydrate there were still two full differences or greater over the. Of that study in total carbohydrate into if you believe now frequency questionnaire definitely don't agree with that now now it won't we will agree on agree with you on this is that refined carbohydrates and sugar are the most fattening type of carbohydrate that we can agree on hydrate increases insulin levels relative to that okay and so if that is true in these groups and that matters for fat loss these groups had two full differences and carbohydrate intake even though it was predominantly healthy carbs you would assume something you shouldn't have seen the exact same amount of weight loss in these two groups right right but they're not high in sugar in your argument is always one of the problems with Danny and I make an end and stuff it's completely right on defending my hypothesis okay I see a study that then he does the same thing he did it here we we all do what you see a study that disagrees with you you find the reason why they're not believe it in every study ever done has plenty of reasons not to do and not to believe that's why independent replication is something you always wanted another group to do to study idealia third group people come in they criticize the studying and you do it again yes and again and again and so I'm getting what I was trying but when we even when we started the nutrition science initiative the choice that was a nonprofit the choice of the word initiative was to get nutrition researchers doing effect using these garbage poorly designed studies to come to conclusions because they like or dislike the interpretation but try to get them to think the way harder scientist would and developing Studies have asked precisely the right question and then pilot study that was interpreted as not supporting this hypothesis and again you could argue that for an hour and nobody's going to care that study was not randomized so non-random I study you can't infer causality it's that's why it was a pilot study one of the many reasons it was a pilot study the people who think this carbohydrate model so then we talked about the carbohydrate insulin model means carbohydrates are fattening bread pasta potato and sugar maybe the thing that's necessary to add to the diet to make all these carbs fattening as sugar as it we talked about this year and a half a cup of fructose molecule is metabolized in the liver it's linked to Fat accumulation the liver which is linked to insulin off the way you're squeezing your stomach that we were talking about this Japanese experiments be done right there they have to be tested right if you can't use for poorly designed experiment to poorly you know I never experiment ever done and so what we've tried to do is keep working towards better experiment on new version of them Ludwig experiments being done at the Arnold Foundation is Laura and John Arnold funded to the tune of I think 13 million dollars and whatever that study finds I will probably find a reason looking and find a reason to question and ideally they would be working together so that you come up with the criticisms before you've spent 13 million dollars but this is how science Works my job was to tell a good story is Stephen wood saying that I believe people who read the books and judge whether at their it's a good am I convincing and arguing that John wants to come along in 20 whatever it is 19 to make these are let me ask you this because this is something that you admitted to something you said rather why are sugary carbohydrates the most fattening but if this hypothesis is correct I think you would say that they hormonal milieu in the body that that over response to insulin and Insulin what we haven't said is if you look in a textbook for fat metabolism and fatty I didn't what causes fat storage insulin is a hormone that primarily regulates fat stored in your fat cells have half of it being fructose metabolized May indeed cause insulin resistance and if it does you over respondents until one is a peripheral explanation not that people don't love it and they don't want to you know over consume at whatever that means and the other is essential explanation so I mean sugar is a factory that makes us want to eat Foods right I mean this is one of the many food properties I would love to talk about this more that cause dopamine release in the brain and dopamine is the chemical that sets are motivation levels to do certain behaviors so the reason we become addicted to drugs is that they go in the brain and they stimulate dopamine release and that reinforces drug-seeking behaviors causing you to consume more correct amount of carbohydrates calories yeah correct and we have randomized controlled trials demonstrating that so if you look at the randomized by the way we're not we're not operating in an Evidence vacuum there's tons of randomized control trials on sugar put it this way you know if you believe that insulin is the cause the effect of insulin on fat cells happens almost immediately so insulin I'm not aware of any mechanism of insulin on fat cells that takes more than a few hours to occur and so if you believe that insulin causes obesity that should be happening immediately you shouldn't have to wait months and months for this to occur carbohydrate when you're in some has elevated you're storing fat right it depends on what you mean by that that's not see you do a little bit of bait and switch here until just answer the question if it's not protein lipase and it inhibits hormone sensitive buy insulin and there's another graph that is stimulation of fat mobilization graduations to all you people that are listening to them on enzymes and fat cells what we disagree about is the implications of that and about extra has nowhere in that textbook does it say that insulin regulates the total size of body fat suit interrupting me please okay now let me explain insulin essentially does have effects on enzymes that cause fat cells to take out more fat and to release less that so that's a part that you're right about that's what that text book talks about right now that does not mean that does not imply that insulin causes fat storage as in the accumulation of fat from day-to-day and let me explain why that is which one is basically a traffic cop that allows your body to burn the fuel that you just consumed so when you eat a diet that is high in carbohydrate and low in fat your insulin goes up your body restricts the fat from going out of fat cells to turn that down not off but down it causes less fat to come out of your fat cells and then your body is burning carbs that's what you just ate right now if you eat a diet that I'm fat and lowering carbohydrate used to create insulin dose effects don't occur on your fat cells and that allows your body to burn is that that you just ate but at the end of the day the amount of fat that you have in your body is the amount that you eight minus the amount that you burned that's what determines the amount just arithmetic right now that you ate my Nasim out to burned and if you eat a low-fat diet you're not eating much and you're not boring much you're in the same place as if you're eating a diet where you eating a lot of fat body is the amount that you ate mine is steam out that you burned that's what determines the amount just arithmetic right now that you ate mine seem out to burned and if you eat a low-fat diet you're not eating much and you're not burning much you're in the same place as if you're eating a diet where you eating a lot of fat and burning a lot of fat in the way we know that's true is because varying amount of carbohydrate and fat in the diet makes no difference to</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that we keep getting away from that I haven't had an opportunity to move on and Stephen knows this as well as I do fer gaining say 4lb you're a fat or let's say between 20 and 40 of put on for the extra pounds so now you're obese you're nicely and healthy young guy in 20 like many of us were and by the time you're forty you've got 40 lb of excess fat that's the equivalent of putting in about 10 calories is head storing 10 calories a day into your fat tissue that you don't burn to metabolize so you eat say 2700 calories a day have carbs you know 35% fat 15% protein and 10 calories a day for trapped in your fat tissue less than a bites worth of food less than a sips worth of beer so the question I actually trying to ask his or answer in this is against my Approach is a curious journalists the Science Background is how do we explain those 10 calories cuz when we talk about those obese women with Starving Children all those obese women were doing was storing 10 or 20 calories a day depending on how quickly they became obese in those populations that tends to happen quickly in their twenties so we're asking this question how do we got a situation where we have to end up a 10lb stuck in the fat cells everyday that's a 20 30 40 billion that sounds so it's divided up very small and is the brain somehow regulating that Organics her dysregulation in the body involving pick your hormones pick your enzymes when they won that somehow traps fat in the fat cells or prevents the fat from being used for fuel when it's released from the fat cells and took you think about it that way like you let yourself go to seeds today. I can't decide I'm done I'm going to do nothing but drink beer and you might start drinking 5 beers a day and over the course of 10 years you get 20 lbs and it's all here that 20 lb of the course of 10 years is still only about 20 calories you might have added 800 calories of beer to your diet and stored 20 calories as fat how does that happen and why does it go here and not elsewhere honest Stephen said this is insulin dependent fat so does that that's when we're talking about this like this question could somebody get fat during a famine or can they stay fat during a fam and all they have to do is hold on 210 calories a day extra if they're only eating 1210 gets stuck in their fat cells 1190 is excreted or expended it's not that hard to imagine and there's nothing in the laws of physics that says it to what could be dysregulated about their fat cells even during a relative family not a complete them but a relative found that might be any animal experiments of which there are probably hundreds by now different animal models you can disassociate obesity from hyper from eating too much in the animal if you're taking in these calories in the form of sugar your body is going to take a certain percentage them even if you're getting enough food and stored as fat whereas if you were taking in just protein and vegetables and things when those wants your body would not do that gets to the mechanism chicken and fish and vegetables and the other one is on 2000 calories of milkshakes and we no sugary drinks and pasta and b******* that that person is going to gain a certain amount of calories and just put them to fat right regardless that's yeah that's done a bad job of testing it and we will both tend to reject the studies that we don't like when we Define don't like by whether or not they got the answer we think it's who's around your perspective this is not the case your perspective is that like you were saying in the study with a closely monitored these people died at the add additional fat and additional carbohydrates that they both gained the same additional amount of what it's right I mean if you have to see different levels of fat Gary short-term study that it was two and three weeks it is very short-term but still he says that insulin is the thing that gets fat in fat cells and that I mean you would see some kind of difference of insulin made any difference you should have seen some kind of effect right I'm kind of difference in fat game I promised I wasn't going to say oh boy boy boy on the show but it's my thanks to my brooklyn-born mother it's my program then and they the same is true a lot of these overfeeding experiments do the same thing to talk about overfeeding they they they literally overfeed so they kind do a reasonable way of figuring out which reading is measured calculator I needed to stand energy imbalance and again right there that's a problem because one of the hypotheses says that the energy balance is dependent on the macronutrient content to the food so you're going to get a different different level depending on what the macronutrient content is and then the different level of what what's necessary for energy balance very controversial where they got their subjects as David Ludwig and Kara I belong in there their colleagues said that that Harvard Boston Children's Hospital needed to study in Framingham and they they basically got the subjects to lose 10 or 12% of their body weight and then they randomize them to three different diets of three different macronutrient compositions and they basically calculator energy expenditure on the three different diets which is kind of exactly what we're talking about cuz if you want to be in energy balance who know you feed people exactly what they're expanding and in that study which was published a year ago and they saw different levels of energy expenditure depending on the carbohydrate content of the diet so the higher level of carbohydrates this is trying to keep them in energy balance the higher the carbohydrate the lower the air expenditure the lower the carbohydrate the higher the energy expenditure so again it's just whether or not they did the study right who knows science is a compilation of a lot of studies and we're trying to you know what dress exactly this point but merely building that into the experiment we know what their energy expenditure should be and then the point is when you increase in Oregon part of the trick of doing scientists to say that we have competing hypotheses multiple hypothesis and it's vitally important that you always keep the multiple hypotheses in mind when you're interpreting the study so one hypothesis it's how much they did another hypothesis says it's what they eat and that what they eat is is moderated primarily through insulin and when you do the experiment experiment that that Stephen greatly confused if you overfeed them you start out with a 50% carb diet now you overfeed them if there's a threshold effect on insulin which turns out there is and you just moving on and when you look at insulin Dynamics when it's when it's below a very low point the fat cells will mobilize fat and the lean tissue will burn it for fuel and above that point you get pretty much flat so if you start people who are eating 1500 calories for carbs and you add them pump them up to 2,500 calories from carbs are still in the plateau side of the inside you wouldn't necessarily expect to see any difference the only way you expect to see a difference in this why it helps to really interrogate both hypotheses so that you know when you're doing the experiment whether or not you're actually testing something you one hypothesis you want to set up the experiment to the hypothesis predicts the two hypotheses predict something entirely different this experiment arguably the two hypotheses predict the same thing you'll get fat game because insulin is elevated regardless and when insulin is elevated you're going to get fat gain the question comes back to it this again always going to keep this in mind we want to what could possibly cause at 10 or 20 calorie access that causes fat stored I have a friend that was for 400lb when he was Eighteen with a tall kid about six-foot-five on a 200 lb overweight 20 pounds overweight is roughly a hundred excess calories over 18 years stored in your fat cells that's you know even if you assume that you have to consume 300 calories that I have 100 XS store in your fat cells that's you know one to Coca-Cola's a day that he was drinking or 1/2 1/4 pounder a day that he was eating that is laying friends weren't in the question would be why can't he just stop doing that second step in, takes his brain won't let him and I would say because his insulin as Elevate doesn't matter whether he stops it or not. All right so again it's easy to tell stories it's not easy to tell stories that are supported by scientific evidence now I want to bring people's attention to reference number 11 on my side there 29 studies now that have measured differences and energy expenditure metabolic panel study there been 29 studies to date that I've measured calorie expenditure metabolic rate on diets differing in carbohydrate and fat content when you put all those studies together when you are at least the first 28 together and you look at what the overall literature says it makes almost no difference to metabolic rate weather eating carbohydrate or fat and in fact this very small difference that it does make actually favors High carbohydrate diets so you get a slightly higher metabolic rate when the diet is predominantly carbohydrate now this study that Gary cited is the one study out of these 29 that has reported a larger effect than any others of carbohydrate restriction on energy Spencer so this study reported in effect bigger than any of these other 28 and thank you and an interesting life you actually look at the data and use that data have been rear analyzed by researcher named Kevin Hall and if you look at the data you find that some of the participants some of the data that represent some of these participants are literally physically impossible they break the first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy Gary knows about she has a physics background and they literally don't add up and when you start subtracting the the clearly erroneous data from the pool of subjects this pig effect size starts to shrink and shrink and shrink and Shrink until after you've gotten rid of all of it to study does Nola no longer reports a higher energy expenditure on a very low carbohydrate diet and it's consistent with the previous 28 studies that were done so that's my perspective on that but I want to go back to the other a long time and I'm going to talk for as long as I want now I want to I want to talk about human energy metabolism in this idea of the 10 extra calories a day Gary I I really continue to get the feeling that you do not understand human energetics because that's not how it works have to eat I'm not done okay no but you're insulting me are you got to stop doing that dude acting like you think I'm an idiot you done now are you done can we be clear that we're talking about you done now can I just finish this know you can read your channel I am done without. You have any time to respond respond now what you see there's basically two things you need to pay attention to here in terms of energetics one is the imbalance between intake and expenditure and that is very small so it only takes a little bit of extra calories to cause somebody to start gaining fat however as they gain fat their bodies get bigger the game fat and lean mass people's obesity have more fat more lean mass and their calorie needs go up and up and up and up under their bodies yet and so even though the imbalance between energy and taking expenditure is small their calorie needs end up being quite a bit higher so you're saying that someone just gaining calories eating their body gains lean mass as well that's okay is there carrying around this extra weight and so the extra calories and then on top of that caring around the extra weight forces our body to grow larger presumably I'm actually not sure what the mechanism inside it doesn't have anything to do with the brain it's not a coincidence I don't know what is because that's what I'm saying Gary okay now so so but the point is by the time the person has obesity they are consuming 20 to 35% more calories than they were when they were lean so that's not just one or two cokes a day that is allowing them to remain obese they're consuming 20 to 35% more calories that is with the most accurate studies are saying and so it's not just 10 extra calories or maybe just one or two cokes we're talking about a substantial amount of extra calories in a sense of generalization because we don't know what me what's the ratio how much fat people get them out how much weight people are gaining everybody gains a different amount of weight like me saying they're eating 20 to 30% more calories like who is like how many people how much are they gaining our people get fat to get 20 lb overweight people get fat to get a hundred pounds overweight let me arrange because what you see is that people who are overweight so they're in the overweight Ranch you just have some extra fat they eat about 10% extra calories people who have a little bit of obesity eat about 20 an extra calories people who have who are very have very very great obesity eat more like 35% so it cracks with the amount sorry is it possible what he was saying that if you do consume 10 extra calories over long periods of time that will accumulate now it's not $10 calories what you need then yes or your body surgery body stores yeah I will say that that's correct your body is storing 10% tent 10 extra calories over top of what you need but the thing is that as you get bigger what you need goes up and up and up because you carry around more correct and so it's 10% and 10 * 9% is 10 extra calories on top of the elevated amount that you're already eating so you end up with these big differences in calories that's correct your body is storing 10% tent 10 extra calories over top of what you need but the thing is that as you get bigger what you need goes up and up and up because you can't even more correct and so it's 10% at 10 sorry not percent is 10 extra calories on top of the elevated amount that you're already eating so you end up with these big differences and calories take so that's how that's how it really work</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> leptin is produced yeah let's talk about left in a little bits produced in fat cells and is produced in proportion to the size of fat tissue so the amount of body fat you have the more fat you have the more left and you have in the circulation and basically what this is It's what's called a negative feedback loop which is a really simple engineering term that works like a thermostat so with your thermostat you if you set your thermostat to 70 if it starts getting a little Potter your AC turns on to bring it back down to starts getting lower AC comes on over the heat comes on to bring up that's called the negative feedback system that maintains the stability of the temperature of your house we have many negative feedback loops in the human body to regulate body temperature to regulate blood pressure to regulate all sorts of things one of the negative feedback loops we have regulates body fatness and the hormone so your thermostat measures temp by using a thermostat sorry a thermometer your brain measures body fatness using this hormone leptin that's in the circulation and then particularly when your body fat level drops your leptin levels drop and your brain hears that and it kicks in a starvation response basically this is the main reason why weight loss is so difficult because your brain is like no I don't want to be losing fat and it makes you hungrier and increases your cravings level of body fat is it so here's it's just when you're losing body fat in general like even if you are a large person that's over weight racks when you're losing body fat and general your body exacerbate yeah your hunger and this is this is a thing that's really important to understand about obesity is that people with obesity have a higher set point so it's like turning a thermostat from 70 to 80 and then your thermostat regulating around 80 people with obesity they're not regulating around 170 anymore they're regulating around 50 and so when you cause a lean person to lose weight you see the same thing as when you cause a person with obesity to lose weight you see this reaction in their brain circuits that regulate body fatness that drives and increase their cravings and their hunger metabolic rate drops would be an evolutionary mechanism to force you to seek food correct and not just the Four Seasons secret that's the main thing but it also slows your metabolic rate does everything it can to get more energy in your I didn't have less leaving and it keeps doing that until the fat comes back so when you're eating a sugary died at a high high calorie diet you will produce more fat your body will get fatter right. It depends on how many calories are you if you're overeating yeah sugar a lot of carbohydrates your body will get fatter correct your body will produce more leptin correct so it comes from the diet and directly leptin is produced not just in response to the size of the fat tub and response actually glucose mediated uptake into the fat tell which is mediating park by insulin so you come back to insulin even with the leptin you raise blood sugar nuts carbs Eureka carbs you raise blood sugar you raise insulin you raise fat storage the glucose and then you get more leptin again one of the things you have to understand about this is everything that's said has two interpretations depending Paragon you're looking at and he's a fundamentally different paradigms so in Stefan's world and again correct me if I'm wrong and I left in a signaling few all availability in the fat cells the way I would think of it and in my very small world left in is responding to fuel availability in the rest of the cells so it's basically a molecule that can tell other cells that there's fat available and you could burn that fat for fuel and then you you got to eat or it can tell that there isn't fuel available and it's depending on how much left in there is two cells and then that will respond by a signal to eat or not to disinhibit eating Behavior everything would talk about Stefan and I first tooth fell out years ago at ancestral Health Symposium when I acted improperly inappropriately one of the problems I took away I think you should think about this you have a hypothesis that Indus the fundamental thing is it obesity caused by overeating cuz we know if your getting fatter your story more calories than you expend that's just like the room is getting more crowded more people are entering them leaving that is a simplest but doesn't tell you why the rooms getting crowded it doesn't tell you why you're getting fatter and again what I've been arguing is the wire fatter part has been left out and people decided that overeating was somehow an explanation and then they went to the brain to look at white people might overeat so what I wanted the questions I asked upon 8 years ago and it keeps coming up as if we're going to blame obesity on the modern food environment epidemics of obesity you know simple question to ask without this modern food environment and that's the sort of science who won right and it turns out that the world is falling the first one I found in the literature was in 1902 in a population of the Pima Native American tribes PMI living in Arizona and observer saying these people are poor they're malnourished they're suffering through famines they've been suffering through a famine for 40 years and famines it's hard to overheat during the famine and yet the women of the tribe who do virtually all the work they were treated as pack animals an effect where obese so now we can disassociate obesity from the modern food environment and we could disassociated from this ultra-processed Foods we didn't start to ask a question what is it about can we find what might have driven obesity in that population despite the existence of famine so it's from very simple observation once we get into these kinds of studies I actually really do that my books because you can find studies that will say anything and you'll see in the studies on people misinterpreting them what was the cause of the population of women to be obese what's a 1/2 thing that happened during the beginning in the 1860s lard for the most part and sugary beverages probably so that's a reasonable hypothesis and you can find the same thing in the Sioux Native American Sioux population living in a reservation in 1928 where you had both obese men and women living with malnourished stunted children who clearly weren't getting enough. They want a reservation they were getting Western Foods so ultimately in science determined to answer you get so the question I was asking is we have this observation that any population that transitions to Western diet or Western dieting lifestyle cats will be sad diabetic they they develop with metabolic syndrome which is insulin resistance and all these issues and we know that's true all over the world from the Inuit to the Pima to South Pacific island important question is what's triggering it in the environment and against Stephen would say well there's too much food available and it's too palatable and we can't say no and I had a lot of problems with that we can say no part cuz if we're laying it means they can't say no and they being the people with obesity and I don't believe that's true and then or is it some specific item or some specific group in this space food travel with Western populations and so they exist the ability and today if you look up Jewel burden of obesity in Mount nutrition I have a Dropbox folder I could share with you is probably 50 studies all over the world you see the same observation incredibly poor populations malnourished children are stunted which means are protein deficient in their calorie deficient and often the mothers are the ants or obese obesity tends to run in the female would suggest it has a female sex hormone related the fact that I don't believe works in the brain cuz we're dealing with populations that could not have overeaten if they could have overeaten why are the kids starving that's sort of the question and then this was the first thing that I think we fought about Batman and it's still if you can find populations with obesity epidemics but without the modern food system without snap Lay's potato chips on and if you know that they're going through a famine or you know that the kids at least aren't getting enough food how do you say nobody sitting in the mother's without assuming that the mothers are overheated with Stephen is there a population of people that are obese that are not eating a western diet or not eating sugary foods that are obese in that are not eat sugary Foods probably not because generally once you have an industrialized food system that's going to include sugar but there are populations that eat a lot of sugar and are not obese and we should talk about some of these actually let me tell the story the version of the story that appears in the scientific literature now originally they were agriculturalists they were eating traditionally a very high carbohydrate diet based on unrefined carbohydrates originally it was corn beans and squash primarily they were fishing and eating Mesquite pods primarily agricultural and they are very clear on that Gary so they are we have data I can't say things like that so I remember you saying that in your books Kashmir agriculturalists and what what happened basically is you had all these Farmers moving into their area Settlers of European descent and they diverted the water from the river The Gila or Gila River if your life not feel it and so they were no longer able to grow their crops their agricultural crops that they were primarily dependent on and therefore the government started providing them with foods to eat and these were calorie-dense refined Foods they were like Gary said flour lard and sugar and then they became very obese went out there was a population of Pima right across the border from them in Mexico also very similar culturally and all that to maintain their traditional high-carbohydrate lifestyle and agricultural lifestyle and there been studies comparing those two populations and the ones across the border with their traditional lifestyle or a lot leaner and healthier not surprisingly than the one large flour and sugar okay but Gary you seem to believe that people can gain what you kept referring to famines and things you seem to believe that people can gain weight even if they are eating very few calories and you don't refer to this many times in your writing and you know these are very casual observations that you're making kind of diseases casual correlations and storytelling but if you actually look at the data on this what you see is that if you just measure calorie intake and people have obesity it is 20 to 35% higher than people who are lean after correcting for height physical activity level and that I've got one group lives these sugary Foods in the western diet the ones that live in America are the ones that live in America are becoming obese the ones that live in Mexico or not is that correct correct yeah and so now if you have someone with obesity like I said the most accurate measures that we have suggest that they habitually consume and expend more calories and now Gary's model says that that is Downstream of the fattening affect its not causing the fattening effect it is a results of the fattening effect where is my model says that that is actually required for the fattening effect to occur is Upstream so now what happened those what happens carry what happens if you reduce your calorie intake by that same amount 22 35% doesn't matter if you do it by restricting carbs or fat these experiments have been done they lose weight when you restrict their calorie intake down two. amount of calories but high amounts of sugar does it doesn't make sense you can get obese that way right now we have to explain how those women were usually my diabetes researchers it was shutting diabetes in these populations in the men had high levels of diabetes in the women head tie levels of obesity to give you an example where that measurement was done in Trinidad in the 1960s and he got all I'm doing this is the wrong I played as I don't have a lot of food okay you could say that the obese expend a lot of energy made a lot of calories of questions can they get obese without a lot of food and so can we find population size can you find a population that gets herpes without sugar is exactly the question to ask so in Trinidad in the 1960s amount nutrition crisis the US government sent a team of researchers down to study this and the researchers come back and tell you there's malnutrition their stunting is deficiency diseases and 2/3 to the other women are obese and this is a medical problem in the next year and a mighty nutritionist goes down to do exactly what Stephen asked for and to actually measure the diets in obese with and lean women and to study it and it's the population with it sound like a very poor Trinidad and population and reports that they I think it was 1800 calories a day with the obese women reading was actually a little less and what the lean people seem to be eating and that it was lower than what the food and agriculture organization considered for healthy diet soda in this is to point out when you have populations like that I don't see how the overeating hypothesis tells brain is in control of how much they tells me anything about why the women World base especially when their kids are starving this is the Paradox of the stillborn an obese mother with a starving child if they'll be some other has to eat Superfluous calories to get fat why isn't you giving those calories to her kids because you don't need them triggered by the macro nutrient content of the diet then you can explain I mean are plenty of animal models Hood famous quote I use in my books from Sean my ears like that same leading Harbor nutritionist who studied an OB strain of animals in the 50s he said my animals will get fat even when half-starved they will make fat out of their food even when half-starved is are generally animals with mutations in the leptin whatever Janet is it time for the question is if like I can make that out of my food at levels of caloric levels at Princeton to lean person can't then I'm going to get fat eating the same amount and that fat accumulation is going to be you know means I'm taking more calories and I spend but the point of time for some metabolic hormonal reason I'm taking the pill I8 and turning it into fat and storing in the face what is responses so my responses that if you want the best answers you have to use the best methods to answer to answer the questions okay you want a question answered properly you have to use accurate methods to answer that question now as you know Gary it's very difficult to measure food intake and free-living individuals particularly you're traveling to a country you've never been to before it's very difficult to get accurate measures so just because some guy went to Trinidad unclaimed woman action okay fine just because some woman went to Trinidad and claimed that people were eating 1800 calories and becoming obese does not mean that that's what actually happened now we have studies where researchers used accurate measures to measure calorie intake in people who had obesity many of these people were saying we're only eating 1200 calories a day when they we measured their calorie intake what they found was that they were consistently eating more calories than lean people so this this phenomenon that Gary describes is something that is only observed when inferior methods are used to measure calories the existence of The Starving Children strongly suggests that there's not a lot of food available and we have to explain obesity in the mother you know I would like you to respond okay fine I will respond to that now it look I haven't looked at these studies in particular I brought them up eight years ago we got in a fight about it we are not loud could be malnourished in a non-industrial situation in this is I do a lot of work related to this what you see and non-industrial situations you see a lot of infectious disease you see a lot of malnutrition so people not getting enough essential minerals and vitamins not getting enough protein and you see a lot of children who were just barely hanging on because of this collection of really bad stuff that's happening in their lives and so yeah yeah parasites Mariah I don't know if there's mullerian Trinidad or not but I mean all the diarrhea pneumonia these are the things that we all had before we had modern medicine and great sanitation in a country like the United States 30% of kids didn't even make it past childhood and so there's a lot of things that could have caused that carry it's not necessarily because you know it's not necessarily the reason that you attributed to now I'm not the tribute I don't have an explanation but I'm throwing out possibilities that are alternative to the one that your employment quite possible okay so now so again when you use accurate measures of calorie intake you find that these people with magical metabolisms who have obesity and don't eat very much seem to not exist anymore and furthermore to another type of study that's really going to differentiate between this effect driven by insulin and the effect of calories so we have a lot of studies that compared diet sandwich calories were the same but carbohydrate and fat intake differed and the ones that I really want to focus on right now that I think are key here are the studies were they increase calorie intake so they fed people that they won studying particular and see I want to give you a number here see if I can give you the number here sorry why you look at that can we bring up another issue cuz we were talking about the ultimate ways why people get fat okay I don't I don't want to divert here I'm in the middle of something so now if we want to understand why people get fat we can look at studies that overfed people on fat or carbohydrate exclusively so this one study the first one that I want to talk about first they figured out people's Baseline calorie intake figure out what how many calories they needed just to maintain and then they increased that by 50% by exclusively giving them that or exclusively giving them carbohydrate okay this is Horton okay give me a number 16 so now if Gary's hypothesis is correct these people should have gained body fat on the car behind overfeeding but not the fat overfeeding because that increases your insulin has his effects on your fat cells Etc okay now these were very rigorous studies I want to emphasize that yes and then they just bump it up with that with carbohydrate all right you're welcome now but it was not the Sims overfeeding study that was done in prison that's what I know okay okay yeah it's on my website you can go to my website Stephen dna.com and it's reference number 16 and they're both are okay so this was what's called a metabolic word study where these people are in a research facility where the researchers could Monitor and control every morsel of food so there was no cheating no in accuracy and they were measuring changes in body fatness using a gold standard method called underwater weighing okay and so what they found was that at the end of a two-week period of overfeeding the carbon the fat groups gained the exact same amount of body fat exact same amount of body fat there was another second study that did the same thing and found the same result independent lab group very similar experiment three-week-long instead of two they found the exact same thing same not of that game different insulin response has different amounts of carbohydrates that exact same amount of fat gain so this demonstrates that insolence and cars are not what controls what gets fat in the fat tissue calorie intake is what controls that so let me explain again remember I talked about everything to Paradigm you working determines a question to ask and this experiment is a classic example cuz I assume that people get that so then they say if we over feed them we're just doing what happens naturally everything about the experiment is based on the assumption that they're supposed to be testing which is can people get that by overfeeding until they from the berry conception of the experiment they built in the Paradigm that we want to test the hypothesis on top of it if it's a typical Sims experiment actually wasn't familiar with this one it wasn't James Hill JC Peter James Hill was funded for the from about 1998 to about 2008 by Procter &amp; Gamble cuz he was in olestra Shell I hate to say that Jim I apologize but I think it's a fair assessment and then when you stop being hunted by Procter &amp; Gamble he was funded by the sugar Industries and JC Peters was the head of the Procter &amp; Gamble olestra Lester Woods yeah Lester was a fat substitute in the problem was like run out like that but the whole idea of olestra was to replace fat in the diet so every study Helen Peters did implicated dietary fat as a cause of obesity I don't think we could ever use I hate to say it influences study to make that point that we things to buy study that was in everything he'll everything Helen Peters did and everyone knows I mean I talked about this and good calories bad calories when they reported their results actually I did for you on James Hill cuz he works for the University of Colorado so you can actually ganna got all those documents back and forth between him and olestra I'd be happy to share them with you if you'd like their Rebel it timing him and Procter &amp; Gamble but he basically held Procter &amp; Gamble for ransom you would get a $500,000 on restricted gift and would do a study and then he would ask a conclude that fat is bad and carbs are good there for Lester isn't viable product and it would ask for Procter &amp; Gamble for more money before he then Publix Sunday so it took particularly egregious example of someone who's I'd I suspect was just as belief system he believed and carbs are good and therefore olestra is a viable product any would ask for Procter &amp; Gamble for more money before he then Publix study so it took particularly egregious example of someone who side I suspect was just as belief system he believed dietary fats bad today was a good thing he did confirm that</div>

But I never ever thought it would you know go where it went you know if people ask me if I do that I didn't know him young you would have been a month figure it out it would have he would have been he like 21 or two now and he wasn't even in the heat for this term Abraham ancer is his name and born in Reynosa Mexico way they actually born across the border cuz there's no wall right there to do that but he's great he's great and I dig it because you know what I see where he came from exactly you know where my son made a hole-in-one what was 8 years old was on the compensatory golf course in Reynosa Mexico is how many holes in one does a guy get in his career I've had one had one equivalent in other sports yeah there's no equivalent in any other game right there was it was a double eagle what's that mean that's where you make a 2 On a par 5 so that means you suck a hole from 262 262 yards how do you made it on the second shot Payless Payless red because the whole 11 because that part 3 could be much is 125 yard so you know and then most of them are made on those longer 185 but yeah you're right you guys like me are hitting the part 3 from univ 235 which is works out perfect maybe a walk-off Grand Slam how many people try it you know you don't get many chances at that grand slam but you one must be off-the-charts must be like a thousand 100001 or something crazy like that most people make maybe never what do you think the numbers would be what are the odds part 3 from the regular women sees with the US kids club driver that I still have wow and and it just straight at the hall Hidden Creek golf swing the kids if you treat them his golf coach was good even though they spoke a different language understood golf swing and so he was good at it ml to Cup and I got at this point I've been playing golf for 30 years and I've never done it so it was a big deal and he got his name in a couple of newspapers and they mention him on the Golf Channel he was the youngest kid that made a hole-in-one that year that was registered and then like two weeks later a six-year-old that's a hard thing to learn right that swing know it is a really difficult thing to do and it's it's just a it's a thing that you learn how to aim it is like a bow and arrow you know even though that's a little easier to teach somebody how to do but to do it exceptionally well you know it's it it's it's not easy to do and and or a slingshot how to get the power at the right spot or or even flag is not power everywhere it power in the right spot of the wrist yeah and it is hard to do but it's fun to do once you once you once you learn how to hit a good solid golf shot and the ball comes off the way it's supposed to Dallas cars down his neck down his back where they were trying to Harbor they were they were shooting it was already should have had a death sentence out loud and we were at my place in Montecito and we had thrown everything at this cancer but the kitchen sink and we were looking for the f****** sing and and it is Steve goes like Golf Course man. Sometimes he was always good Dolphin Tours little kids we've known each other since we were six and and so when I got my clubs out his clothes were in there too so he reached into his pill bag and take another pill pain pill and it wasn't very good and and and he just Winston but every once in awhile he put the ball down 217 College Park 367 yards long and he hits his driveway with his driver and and and it pays off a little bit the rabbit caught it and so it was up kind of by the green but the pain was kind of on the other side and I was like great and so he gets a Chip Shot which is easier to do and he's always real about 7 feet and I'm like oh my God for a par and he makes it and this dying man gets the biggest Grand I've ever seen in my life and with crooked cuz his muscles have been cut but it just brought him pure f****** joy and then I got to see the last party everything so and I can make you feel better if you do it right with that difficult game like that with a lot of games but there's something about golf to this very physical and you doing it outside it's one of the only things you have to do outside and other than I guess you could do tennis inside like really bright</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and we're not all right so just set this up when Gary was on last Gary taubes Stefan how do I say your last name Stephen DNA when you are on last Stephen had some opposition to some of the things you were saying we talked about getting him on and you together we finally pulled it off took there's a lot of wrangling with lot of back-and-forth and cat wrangling but we got it we're here give me your position on this is all for proposed listening this is all about obesity and the the mechanism for obesity is unfair to say yeah yeah so the main points that we want to talk about today already and what causes insulin resistance which is behind a lot of are chronic diseases that are common in society and please give us your background yeah so I have a BS in Biochemistry PhD in Neuroscience after getting my PhD in neuroscience and went on to study the Neuroscience of obesity at the University Washington and particularly the brain circuits that regulate body fatness hopefully we'll get a chance to talk about this today and then I will one arm to become a science consultant science communicator and write a book called The Hungry brain that is my attempt to explain for a non-specialist audience what what causes obesity and my background know what is your disagreement with Carriage position because of you say I'm going to be long-winded here is that okay so first a little bit of housekeeping having to be citing a lot of evidence today and so I wanted to bring this up to you and so I put many of the references that I'm going to be sighting on deciding on my website Stephen Curry and cam or if you don't feel like spelling my name you can go to Whole Health Source. Org and I have a numbered list of topics there and I'm to be calling out numbers just scroll down to the number that I referred to in the references are all their second thing I want to say that I want to be really clear about today is that I'm not here to be the anti low carb guy I think low-carb diets are valid rule for controlling body fatness and controlling blood sugar I'm not here to talk anybody out of here on a low-carb diet what I am here to try to talk people out of this some of the mythology that has accumulated around a low-carb diet okay so I want to get started with an analogy to help people understand why the brain is important in obesity so imagine you're an alien coming down from outer space and you want to understand what's going on on Earth and you notice Highway some cars are traveling faster than others some cars go faster some cars with slower and you want to figure out why and so you go and you start studying the tires of the cars because obviously the amount of force that is exerted by the tire onto the asphalt is the thing that determines the speed of the car we know this is just physics and so you study the tires and you study the tires and study them and you never figure out why some cars go faster than others now. is that the reason is that you're studying the wrong part of the system you want to understand the why some cars go faster than others you have to understand the part of the system that regulates speed and that is the person behind the wheel and so in this analogy the tires are fat cells in the person behind the wheel is the brain there has been tons of research on fat cell biology on what factors put fat in fat cells what take it out tons and tons of research on that intuitively obvious that we should be studying not to understand obesity right but in fact all of that research has yielded very little insight into why some people are fatter than others that's because it's the wrong part of system study fat cells do not regulate the size of fat cells anymore than the tires on a car regulate the speed of the car the thing that regulates the size of fat cells is the brain so let's talk about first I'll give you a little framework for thinking about this the brain evolved over about 600 million years to promote the survival and reproduction of our ancestors and over the course of that time we evolved all these different brain circuits that have specialized functions to generate our hunger and are cravings and our fullness feelings that generator eating Behavior what and how much we eat and they actively regulate the amount of fat on our bodies and that's one of things I want to talk about and all circuits involved and either non-conscious by the way so you don't decide you want to be hungry you don't decide that you want to have a craving these are things that Bubble Up from non-conscious parts of your brain that you don't control so these circuits are calibrated to an environment of our ancestors not the environment where we're living in right now so it's all evolve to function optimally in the environment of our ancestors promote the survival and reproduction ancestors so what happens when you put these brain circuits in the modern environment where you have abundant calorie-dense tasty foods rich in carbohydrate and fat is the same brain circuits push us to over-consume they push our bodies to accumulate and hold onto fat and then what you see as a result is the three Hallmarks of obesity first of all the obvious you see elevated body fat Mass second of all you see elevated calorie take people with obesity consume more calories than people who do not have obesity after correcting for height and sex and physical activity level and third you see that people with obesity defend their higher level of body fatness against changes and so there's actually a regulatory change that happens it's not conscious defense you know they're not trying to remain obese it's these body-fat regulatory circus and this is where I guess it right is that people with obesity are not just lean people who eat more calories is actually a change in the regulatory activity that regulates body fat in the body and we can get back to how that happens but I'll just leave it there for now so up until this point I've basically just been telling a plausible story right I mean I haven't actually cited any evidence yet to support that my story is correct and so let's get into that let's talk about what some of the evidence is that of course this idea that I've just laid out so I want to start with the genetics of obesity I didn't offer to it okay so now the genetics of obesity offers us a lot of insight into the biological mechanisms that drive differences and body fatness in the general population so you get these studies like the most interesting studies are the genome-wide association studies they get hundreds of thousands of people together and they sequence are they they measure all these markers in their genomes and they figure out what parts of the Gino make some that another so if you have version a in this particular location you end up a little fatter than if you have version B and when you look at all the places where this is happening you can see the jeans worth happening in and that tells you if you look at what those jeans are doing that tells you what the mechanisms are that underlie everyday differences in body fatness in the general population and so to kind of warm ourselves up let's start Top by talking about height genes so height has a strong genetic component soda doctors and researchers has figured out a lot of the genes that underlie differences in height between people and when you look at what those jeans do they tend to be involved in the growth and development of the skeleton and the connective tissue which is what you expect right cuz growth of the skeleton determines your height so genes that determine diabetes risk type 2 diabetes are all about insulin sensitivity all about insulin secretion and a function of the insulin secreting pancreas which is what you expect because diabetes is a disease that is all about insulin so he said he's a really good at getting at the underlying biological mechanisms that are driving these phenomena so what do these Studies have to say about obesity if Gary's model is correct we should see a bunch of jeans popping up related to fat cells and Insulin if my model is correct we should see a bunch of jeans popping up related to the brain back that's exactly what we see the genetics of obesity are overwhelmingly related to differences in brain activity between individuals and okay so that's one piece of evidence another piece of evidence they're five FDA-approved weight-loss drugs for those act in the brain one of them reduces dietary fat absorption in the digestive tract there no effective fat loss drugs and I'm aware of the Target in fat cells third piece of evidence if you look at some people get really unlucky in life in the end up with these horrible genetic mutations that you know knock out some biological Pathways some of these people end up with extreme obesity people and also animal who see this in mice and rats just occasionally get on Rocky and get really really fat and researchers have been cataloguing what are these mutations would we find people who are genetically really obese what are these stations that are making them fat what is the biological mechanism it's getting screwed up that's making them fat and what they found is that all of these mutations that they've identified to date a number of them are occurring in the leptin signaling pathway and this is the lectin is the primary fat regulating hormone in the body Gary avoids this never talks about this in his writing but left in is a primary fat regulating hormone in the body and use mutations either knockout left in The Knockout leptin receptors or they knock out the left and response pathway in the brain and so that's the third piece of evidence okay so now we haven't really gotten around to talking about what it is exactly about the bad interaction that happens between our ancient brains in the modern food environment that causes us to become fat we've established that the brain is obesity but we haven't really established what it is exactly about the interaction why does our modern food why does our modern environment promote obesity right so basically there are three different ways that I'm going to look at this from but first I want to say that the probably the best way to answer this question is to start with the question what is the most fattening diet in the world what is diet that is more fattening than any other than the answer to that is its human junk food in a variety of non-human species and humans it's human junk food that is more fattening than any others and I'm just skip over some of the research here demonstrates this by the way I haven't been calling out numbers here okay let me call out the numbers reference number two on my website is those genetic studies reference number one is the Obesity drugs reference number 6 is a spontaneously occurring genetic mutations and now I'm talking about reference number 52 so gloss over some of the individual research cuz I'm being long-winded here but essentially what you find is that this stuff is really fattening and animals many different species it's super fattening humans calorie-dense it when you put create environment with abundant easy calorie-dense tasty foods rich in carbs and fat you see this traumatic overconsumption in fat game across many species including humans and what you find in the research is that the sugar and the carbohydrate cannot explain that are part of the effect yes explain part of it but you cannot replicate that effect by only feeding sugar and carbohydrate you can't replicated in animals you can't replicate you can't replicate that you mean you can't replicate obesity what do you mean yeah that's right you cannot you cannot cause the same degree of fat gain the same extent of fat gain the same extent of overconsumption using only sugar and carbohydrate that you can cause with a variety of calorie-dense palatable human foods you can't fully replicate it with sugar and carbs you cannot fully replicated with fat alone either if you put we can get deeper in this if you want I'm confused so you're saying that the the diet that causes the most obesity is what we think right this sudden human junk food diet brand sugar simple carbs b******* b******* what you're saying that you can't replicate that with just you can actually replicated what I mean is that if you just feed if you just increase sugar intake run animal boring humans you do get weight gain but it is modest compared to what you get when you put people around variety of calorie-dense palatable foods rich in carbohydrate and fat similarly if you very confusing house that because this calorie-rich sugar diet of junk food you will make them wait but not as much weight as what so what I'm saying is that if you if you give people or animals the the actual human junk food with all the carbs and fat and everything they gained a lot more weight and a lot faster than if you just give them a diet that's high in sugar and high in refined carbohydrates and what that shows is that the sugar in their find carbohydrate cannot fully explain the effect explain why does who's fattening you're saying if you give people the diet of American junk food you you get not as much of an effect if you give them just a sugar in the carbohydrate right we're saying what are you giving them when you giving them the the diet of junk would you give me an example in animals now it's different cuz if you think about human junk Foods generally those foods contain fat and hydrate and salt and all kinds of other things so it's more it's more than just the Palazzo card right no more detail so you can do this you can add sugar just sugar table sugar to the feet of animals that's one way to do it or you can add it to their drinking water sometimes it's a little bit fattening sometimes it's not not that fattening animals and humans you can ask them to drink sugar-sweetened beverages. just sugar and you can see what happens and people will gain weight or you can tell them to stop drinking sugar-sweetened Beverages and you could see what happens okay I will gain weight they will lose weight suggesting that it that is part of the explanation but it's a much smaller effect and you see with me this full pallet of these foods that contain carbs and fat and all this other stuff. suggesting that it that is part of the explanation but it's a much smaller fact then you see with it this full pallet of these foods that contain carbs and fat and all this other stuff.</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> reservations cuz Gary you like to talk about you know what's going on in different dietary Trends in different cultures and I find that pretty interesting to I want to talk about the fact that sugar intake in the United States has been declining for the last 20 years so it peaked in 1999 and it is currently depending on which source of evidence you believe 15 to 23% lower than it was in 1999 this has been corroborated by number sources of evidence this number 17 on my blog and of course we know that obesity has increased diabetes has increased substantially over the last 20 years in the rest of the population rock around burst percentage and UK sugar intake has been declining for 50 years and number 17 on my blog there about 22% lower and this is what we see across a number different industrialized countries you see a stagnation or decline and sugar intake in recent decades as obesity rates are continuing to increase and of course that 50 year. That covers the decline in the UK covers the entire UK obesity and diabetes epidemics but there's another one I want to talk about that counter argument you want to give it ya sure absolutely I mean are you sure you want to let me give it though I'm I correct it okay alright so your counter argument is that the amount of sugar that we consumed 20 years ago or even maybe 50 years ago maybe continuing to fatten us today and it's about the sugar that we used to eat 20 or 50 years ago and not necessarily about the sugar we eat today it's not exactly right okay I guess so the argument I made was cuz he brought this up and we'd have to do a written debate on the Kato Foundation website and it's inside if you think about used backhoes and example so tobacco smoking per capita smoking in America Pete in 1965 right after the surgeon general's report and it took 30 years before lung cancer rates turned over okay I think we both agree that cigarettes so what we have is a system in which if there are any is the assumption that Stephen is making when he closed his kind of data is that the relationship between it's sugar and obesity is linear so it's sugar goes up obesity and diabetes goes up and sugar turns over they don't so here's the thought experiment by using Cato which is 1965 or smoking per capita about 20 cigarettes a day as it starts to come down imagine we only cut that 217 rats are 16 cigarettes a 20% reduction and smoking would you expect to see a reduction in the lung cancer rates again this is the point I made about what you would expect to see Revenue thing simplistic metaphors so the question is would you like Joe we go from 2216 you expect to see the lung cancer rates turn over no no and in sugar tiny bit still use it's a weird comparison because one of them is Poison the other ones food right the food that question is how toxic is the food so in Sugar we have a variety in Sugar what happened is the equivalent of going from 20 cigarettes 216 beginning in 1999 and Stephanie saying I would expect to see an immediate change in obese and in fact if you actually look at the rates the rate of increase in prevalence of. at around 6 or 7 years later who knows whether that's relevant but to get a small decrease in Sugar 25 even if it's 20% that's 2216 cigarettes and I'm sending the other factor that I talk about my book and Stephen knows this is very clearly have maternal transmission of the propensity to obesity and diabetes affect on the same Piedmont the same Native American tribe or each generation if gets more and more susceptible to whatever it is in the diet that's triggering and obesity and diabetes hope that's been happening in the United States and around the world you've got a generational effect that could last far longer might even keep going indefinitely even if their sugar levels drop so you have the Sugar Creek kicking off the Obesity epidemic and yes that's about to say this is a story but it's clearly the case that mothers who are obese during pregnancy or diabetic or gestational diabetic they become diabetic during pregnancy or they have metabolic syndrome there just insulin resistant or they gained a lot of weight in pregnancy will give birth to children who are at higher risk of becoming obese and diabetic when they get older and at younger ages in those children will pass it on so again we have you know I would be nice I would love it if sugar I came down and with it the Obesity and diabetes plummeted but it's not that and anyway reputation of this hypothesis which I just want to State what it is cuz people get confused about him we never got to it that Sugar hypothesis is a little different and what we've been talking about and it's pretty simple we have obesity and diabetes epidemics worldwide you add something about a western diet populations Western diet and lifestyle you get these explosions that epidemic of obesity and diabetes and what I'm hypothesizing in this book is that sugar is a something that has to be added maybe it's sugary beverages for all I know maybe they were could be you know any more complex hypothesis a single possible one as you add sugar to any populations diet insufficient weather at Southeast Asians living on rice or the John reindeer whatever were the Native Americans of the Great Plains or you know Caucasians living in the Upper East Side Manhattan add enough sugar and eventually do the metabolic effects of the sugar and the generational effects you will get explosions of obesity and diabetes and metabolic 71 sure I mean you called it man it's always possible to tell a story hypothesis would that doesn't necessarily make the story correct I mean I can come up with a story that cosmic rays cause obesity by hitting my fat cells and making them fat you can't disprove that nobody here can disprove that but there's no evidence in experiment to protect you from okay. We don't have right now you don't have data supporting your hypothesis Kevin home later so what do you think about what he saying about sugar and increased rates of diabetes and that this is the cross I mean so let me put it this way we don't have any evidence supporting what he just said so that is a story that is not supported by evidence now does it does that mean that is definitely incorrect now I cannot say that that's definitely incorrect same way I can't say it's definitely incorrect that cosmic rays cause obesity but you know music Christopher Hitchens quote hear that which is asserted without evidence does not require evidence to refute and that's the way I feel about this particular story but you know there are cultures that consume large amounts of sugar and do not develop a piece of paper with reference number 21 on my blog about three different cultures one of which we have not talked about Gary the first one is the hodza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania this is a really interesting non-industrial culture they as part of their hunter-gatherer diet eat a lot of honey honey is a very common food among hunter-gatherers living similarly to how our ancestors used to live and if you measure there year-round honey intake it's about 15% of their calories so this is a major calories worth of them sugar is as the average American eats and eat fruit sugar on top of this they eat a lot of fruit on top of that and so they're even quite a bit of sugar and the hodza men have about 12% body fat women have about 18 so they correspond pretty closely to our Western ideals no not really I mean that's harder than me set electricity about this machine will you hold onto these things you stand on this platform and no heads over and Physician's office of okay so done with calipers the most okay so all the methods you measure that you mentioned or Not Gold Standard methods so the gold standard methods are underwater weighing and underwater weighing these people on this island actually I'm not sure correct but okay look I can tell you that you can look up photos I I don't remember how they how they measure their body fat but you can look I am 12% as measured by dexa so I'll just tell you that so you can get a sense of what 12% is by dexa which is a gold standard method so you can look at photos of these people they're very fit they're laying there not like ripped you know they're not Arnold Schwarzenegger in Peak form but they are seem to have a higher percentage of body fat than the average hunter-gatherer look at a lot of that average hunter-gatherers like a friend of mine has a lot of work with the pygmies in the Congo and they're very lean okay so you see Danny's packs and that's the second culture I was going to type that you do kind of honey do they do the same ones in the Congo they eat up to 80% of calories can come from honey during the rainy season so they also eat a lot of Interlink not just the year correct yeah it's part of the year the Hogs that you didn't more consistently and the hodza have low levels of body fat their cardiovascular risk markers are excellent they don't have diabetes same but this is absolutely not like a controlled study in the absolutely agree with you that's exactly the point I'm trying to make is that when you have a culture that is eating a lot of sugar but everything else play so doing everything else write the sugar is not enough to make them fat it's not single-handedly enough I'm not saying it doesn't contribute I think sugar does contribute just to be very clear I think sugar does contribute to obesity and diabetes and cardiovascular disease but it's not single-handedly responsible as Gary has argued so the third culture is pretty interesting the kuna of Panama and the reason they're interesting is that they actually aren't eating honey they're hatched eating white sugar so they are cultured that they live primarily and non-industrial lifestyle their farmers and hunter-gatherers and they but they do a little bit of trade and one of the things they trade for sugar and they eat sugar sweetened food as well so like donuts and pastries in the drink soda and Kool-Aid what what is their lifestyle in terms of natural lifestyle they are hunter-gatherers and farmer said they are you know living a Physically Active natural lifestyle who has the problem in comparison with any Western Civilization that you you burn off so many more cowards 100% agree with you and I think that is exactly the point I'm trying to make is that it's more complicated than just sugar it is more complicated than just sugar but with a normal lifestyle it may not be is also the the the glucose Samantha glycogen demands in the muscle you're you're you're not just existing like the web why the problems with Western lifestyle is it many people are just existing they're sitting in a chair they're walking to a desk there sitting in their car they're not doing anything to burn any of this s*** off so you can if you have like if you get a baseline of a minimum amount of hours that you require for the day I think would Gary's getting at is that if you if you have this lifestyle the lifestyle that many of us have and then with that lifestyle consume sugar that you're going to get fat I don't think you can compare that to athletes and in that respect I don't think you can compare that to hunter-gatherers because you requiring it is a much more significant load on your body like when I sober October fitness challenge with my friends during October and we I was working out 4 hours a day and I was f****** eating anything that moved I was drinking soda I never drink soda I was eating cookies I didn't gain any weight other than muscle I didn't get any fat at all and I was eating a terrible f******. But I was going crazy when you're trying to stay alive and you're running around plowing and growing foods and hunting and Gathering and fishing your burning off insane amount of calories as a hiking that's required the amount of exercises require it's off the charts in theaters and Western lifestyle we are on the same wavelength here I mean I completely agree with you that it is more complicated than just sugar and but if you read what Gary's right name and please correct me if I'm wrong here Gary argues that sugar is a primary cause of obesity and that physical activity does not matter calorie intake does not matter you think the physical activity doesn't matter thinking makes a lot of difference for fatty Cramer talked about the cause of obesity I don't believe what these people get obese because they're setting the really tough put it this way so it if you take someone who's an elite athlete and they start consuming a lot of sugar but they they ramped up their exercise accordingly they say if someone does what I did during the sober October they're working out 3-4 hours a day everyday do you don't think that they'd have higher sugar demands that their body would just burn that off a picture of real benefit exercise it's burning off carbohydrates you consume then then do you need less insulin to do it can I respond to the kuna get back to them for second every one of the issues I have with Stephen is he writes off my stories the stories which they are all science begins his stories on hypotheses and then what you do is go look for the evidence and then he quotes studies and bring it up instant me and then we had this discussion a year-and-a-half ago and you didn't disagree with me at the time and it had no influence I'm just going to read from the email I wrote this okay Allie Gandhi in compared to the population in Veracruz where they they had emigrated and I say but they're added sugar intake a nonagon day According To Figure 1 is 25 teaspoons per week plus the equivalent of 24 oz of sodas it's 78 grams if it's Coke 32 oz of Kool-Aid that's 96 grams said I'm leaving out the cup of the sugarcane because I don't know what that is menthol or how they assess it one way or the other it's not processed sugar tits 4 grams of sugar per week or about 32 lbs per year now that alone is very low intake Winona oil changed over the years we have no idea if it's increasing recently I've been low for years so you just use the cooling as an example of a population needs a lot of sugar and stated it dogmatically but that lot of sugar is 32 pounds a year and then I said my tell Don I thought you did that's what I heard if we believe the study the Conan Veracruz are roughly the same amount but I'm not tribe the study when it comes to the Veracruz population do you really think these are open eyes Coon are consuming only 3/8 Oz sodas per week so the implication was his population of Caribbean Islanders and migrates to Veracruz they move into the City and they consume more sugar back where they used to live because they trade for them when they get into the city so five glasses of Kool-Aid no candy no ice cream nothing I'd like to know more about the urban kuna before I accept such an analysis is ballet top of this is they say the analysis is done mostly of women because quote the women were available to study cuz they were at home during the day on quote so what were the men consuming and what were the children consuming when they weren't at home and with her something magical about this freak food frequency questionnaire and these researchers that they captured it accurately so this is what science is you have studies you have evidence in the question always is you've got competing hypotheses this evidence really speak to the hypothesis and I'm one of my issues with Stephen provoked on our initial Discord is that he's constantly siding studies that don't actually either they only speak to one hypothesis like the overfeeding study or they're poorly constructed and poorly done to even this has the example with the honey is something we discussed an email very kind then we went back and forth I said I don't actually think it's a reputation as a hypothesis I'm defending hear the case against sugar is you add sugar to any Galatians native diet and you get epidemic of obesity and diabetes so here's a population that's been eating honey for maybe thousands of years in fact when they immigrated to this area they may I've added honey to their diet and had obesity and diabetes and obesity and diabetes and death sentence for the child and for the mother who gives birth so you're going to be very quickly weed out anyone so again actually does a set of refutation the hypothesis that I found a hunter-gatherer population that eats a lot of money and isn't fat and answers I don't think so Steven thinks it does you could flip a coin all of this can be settled with experiments one of the experiments we did it no say-so one of the metabolic problems that goes along with obesity and diabetes maybe 20 years ago if you had alcoholic fatty if you have fatty liver disease the doctor would and you told the doctor you didn't smoke that would assume you were lying now it's so common so common in children and particularly common in Hispanic children that it's clear it's not caused by alcohol in the question is what causes it cuz if you could create a fatty liver with a macronutrient you could probably create insulin resistance as well and then this whole slew of disorders including obesity and diabetes Minot for-profit funded a pilot study where we just took 40 kid by the researchers at the UC San Diego and Emory University in Atlanta top 40 kids who had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the entire family all the food they need it so they could operate their hearts extent but no added sugar is in their diet no sugary Beverages and the study was published in Jama for money get rid of the sugar in the diet the fatty liver disease resolves you know it was pretty simple I put there tells you nothing about mechanism the kids lost a little bit of weight maybe it was a weight loss that conventional wisdom would be they just ate less which I wouldn't be at all surprised cuz they probably didn't like the food as much without sugar in it but these are the kinds of ways you could test these hypotheses and problems I have with like the meta-analysis getting back Kevin Hall there's two ways you could do science you could say let's look at all the junk that was done for 30 40 50 years let's find everything we cannot even vaguely speaks to the experiment and ignore any quality of the study so that maybe ask it ask this question like we want to know what happens when people switch their you know of bad intake around fat and carb intake around and then we can throw all that guy listen to a meta-analysis and the one thing I'm pretty confident that they did a poor job because the one study I looked up the one with the biggest effect they mistook kilojoules to kilocalories so they reported that 400 kilocalorie decrease in energy expenditure on the low-fat diet when was a 400 kilojoule witches of these numbers 400 kilocalorie decrease in energy expenditure on the low fat diet one with a 400 kilojoule witches what's that factor you know these numbers 8.1 and several other studies were Jim Hill studies</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> disagree if anything with what he said so far so far what he said hasn't been particularly revelatory the I think we have to step back for a second cuz you know what the low carb community research Community saying in the conventional thinking in this field is that the brain and correct me any point I get this one but the brain regulates does the fundamental job of controlling how fat we are and the way it does it is by controlling or Miss controlling our intake and our expenditure and the different ends up in fat tissue is that fair to say hi for the most primarily intake but yet so Stefan has a brain Center and the community-at-large does as well so if we go outside and we walk down in Aventura Boulevard and we see someone who weighs 400 pounds over the course of their life and it's been stored in your fat tissue and Stefan says I think would say that the problem is in their brains ability to regulate intake to expenditure is that correct yeah okay and let me I have to fix my headphone so how we going to do this I'm getting feedback when I talk getting feedback it's just weird could be the hold on one sec hearing impaired what I've been arguing so I come along my background I'm a journalist I'm an investigative journalist with a science background okay that's what I do and I'm curious and I've got a lot of you know when I get my first two books for studying with cut pathological science it's about people got the wrong results and science cuz a lot of time scientists do so by I'm very sensitive to this and as I was doing the research for my first book which took five years but I notice in when you take a historical perspective is that the research Community studying obesity was very focused on the brain. Just assumed that that people are gluttons and I'm going to use some socially unacceptable language cuz I'm part that's how they thought about in fact when you read the people with obesity and assumption was that they're gluttons or their neurotic or the ranks weather to skin under a brain Center and when they got to the 1960s if you have was being run by psychologist and psychiatrist who are trying to get people with obesity eat less and in my favorite example is one team that was trying to get they take out the wives to stop having sex with their husbands if they didn't lose weight every week and motivate them I think even you pointed out that sex is a great motivator in your book then tasty Foods ontari är so endocrinologist controlled by this very diverse set of hormones and enzymes in the nervous system is involved in well and our body does a very careful job of the site of basically orchestrating how we use feels after we eat and the implication was and I think Stefan kind of stepped into this with the very person you said Till The Assumption was obesity is it a sort of excess fat accumulation so today when you read the literature the Articles Wapato beat it is a sort of energy imbalance taking more calories and they spend they were still the best scientist in the field the best physician scientist with a look at it as a sort of excess fat accumulation let's look at what regulates fat accumulation the human body some people are programmed or dysregulated to store more fat and if there's store more fat they're going to their behavior is going to respond to be hungry or the weed more than the brain determining energy balance and that determining fat accumulation the idea was the sort of let's see what regulates fat accumulation that's dysregulated if I have a if I give birth to a daughter who weighs 100 pounds at age 4 I'm not going to worry about how much he eats an exercises I'm going to worry about what's going on with fat accumulation in this young girl that her body is just as if you give a you know if you have a child whose six-foot-eight when he's 6 years old you're not going to worry about how much eaten exercises you're going to wear that he's over secreting growth hormone so the idea basically what I've done my role in this is vitally important in the 1960s and 1970s and those obesity people eventually grew into the world that Stefan got his PhD in this neurobiological world where you study what's happening in the brain and you ignore what's happening in the fat cells and fat mobilization and fatty acid oxidation and that store and when you look at that you find a whole world of places in which people can pre be predetermined going to be driven to be fat example when I was in high school senior in high school I weight 195 lb and I played football and my brother two years older weigh 295 lbs senior year and play football my brother never got more than 195 lb and we both ate as much as humanly possible Tropic my brother stayed later became an endurance athlete I became a football player and I lifted weights I put on muscle easily and I fatten easily he didn't the conventional wisdom would be the reason I went to 240 and he never got to 195 was it my brain was different than his my argument is our bodies were fundamentally different so if I see somebody walking down the street brain regulating intake and expenditure I think about what's why is her body driving her to be 300 pounds and is it is it the brain that can't do the job or is it the body that can't do the job in the brain is responding to what's happening on the body a reductionist perspective of the human body separate from the body is nothing except for thrashing is a brain driving what's happening in the body or is it responding to a Tso and you know the brand of course does respond a lot to what's happening in the body and we can talk about that and how that works but you know I think it's a we can tell stories but the things the thing that differentiates a story that's true from a story that is not true is evidence and so you know you talked about the difference between your brother and this is where that genetics evidence comes back in that I was talking about your brother and you only share half of your jeans we know that genetics has a strong impact on who has a greater susceptibility to body fatness and not than others and we also know what the gene do that under light is different in their Prime merely related to differences in brain function that is what the genetics say and so that suggests that the reason why you had a greater propensity than your brother to become fat probably has to do with differences in genetics that relate to brain function that is what the research says we both hate as much as humanly possible never got over 195 and I apologize for bringing you up on the air I know you don't like that used to say that he never gets stuffed he just gets bored of eating after a couple of hours okay even though like maybe if you looked at it scientifically you wait more than him or maybe you ate more Sean no more carbs my body then this is what's the font of Cypress I want to just the thing I wanted to read how much I'll ask you the question how much of the variation in human obesity to those jeans explain so if you look at the genetics of how much is that from twin studies and family studies that measure overall contribution of genetics about 75% of the differences in body fatness between individuals is due to genetic differences between those individuals so you know 1995 America if you just take a cross-section of people and you measure how much is jeans how much is environment about 75% is genetic now we've only identified a small proportion of the specific genes that underlie the propensity to app and so if you look at the percentage that we have specifically identified it's a very small and that's what I refer to my book how much it's like right now I think it's up to about 10% it was 3% when your book was absolutely so you can go check that out about 10% and Mucinex that he's are advancing very quickly and that's why in the three years since I wrote that we have explained a lot more than we did at the time that I wrote that and so we have a portion of these genes identified and what we're seeing is that most of that portion that we have identified relate to brain activity and so that tells us that primarily the differences between individuals that determine differences in body fatness is about differences in brain active I want to be shocked about this the brain generates all of our eating Behavior it generates all of our physical activity behavior and it actually regulates body fat is no one should be surprised by this I am and I was in the how are you surprised the temperature with the argument that I was making in the argument I continue to make imagine if it'll take Stefan's car Meneses Stefan he says Step Up didn't notice that there were humans driving the car so now they're trying to solve the problem without the humans involved why do some cars drive faster than others and they come up with all kinds of hypotheses and some of them can expend even when they interpret the hypotheses one is in effect the Obesity research 10600 Endocrinology the hormonal metabolic regulation of fatty acid metabolism oxidation burning and it sucks when they did it pretty much everything they've done since has been interpreted incorrectly just like the aliens would interpret the car problem if they never know the sea humans so example portable legitimate field of science until then it's a bunch of actually mostly psychologist studying in and out with becomes a sub-discipline of molecular biology and all the molecular biologist jump into the field and they assume that would let them does his control the brain signals how much fat is available at some kind of satiety or fuel deficiency hormone and as such they study the brain and they started leptin in the brain 2002 Jeff Friedman who gets credit for discovering up then perhaps incorrectly publish the paper in the journal science a thing perhaps as much as 2/3 or more what weapon does is done in the periphery in the body and would let them does it's a hormone that is secreted in response to how much fat accumulated and then does it stimulate the brain how much fat or it also works in liver cells which were the cells that were studying in the assumption is probably doesn't all cells to tell your cells to burn fat so it makes perfect sense is fat available in the fat cells now you've got a signal telling sort of influencing the other cells of the body to burn fat so now you've got a hormone that could work in the periphery and the order could work above the neck but you've got a community that's almost exclusively they don't know they're human drivers down here so that's what they do so even in this world I don't I think I know the genome paper on Stephan is probably referenced on his there have been a number of them but yeah Harbor group Kobe's today and one is genes associated with body type so with body type they're all below the neck they're all you know about metabolism basically and the most aspects of your body that you would expect to be controlled like when you build up muscle and you have to take in excess energy to do it makes you hungry I don't think your brain is regulating how much muscle your building other than your drive to go to the gym they took all your body is responding do the stress on the muscle all the things you do when the boys left and it's all below the neck so the argument here is again simple when these people looked at body type it was insulin regulated jeans for the most part growth hormone all these things when they looked at excess body fat they decided they were in the head but the question is when they looked the program to think that excess body fat it's caused by overeating so they look in the brain did they do the same and I was going to call the research involves I never got around to doing it saying if body type body shape is determined by these genes that doesn't make sense that X has variations of body shaper going to be determined by the same genes and did you do the same kind of searches I don't actually know how they determine where the genes work it's the same kind of searches they just came up with different sets of genes so they didn't start with any assumptions they were just finding. where did unions work so there's a common phenomenon all this like with leptin a gene that everybody thinks about working the hypothalamus seems to work and everything can I respond to that can cause your say this in your head you say this in your prepared to respond whenever you're done okay in your book you say that genes work your the body is very basically puts different mechanisms to work as many places that can endure these homeostatic feedback loops in ass thing happens your whole body has to respond so a gene that might work primarily on one cell is scattered all over the body cuz every cell and it'll do different jobs on different selves but if you think that the problems in the brain that's where you look so you get this kind of intellectual phaselock word that's what we do that's what we study and neurobiologist studies the brain Daniel Kahneman no, it's about had this concept what you see is all he's a Nobel Laureate cognitive psychologist what you see is all there is okay and basically if you're studying the brain would you look at if you're studying the garden until we all get trapped into that on some extent and what I'm saying is even in these studies so Stefan and Stephen wrote a book about the hungry brain that is supposed to be about obesity but in fact you never mentioned anything about the metabolic regulation of fat accumulates just not there and I would argue it has to be there even if it's wrong if it's not there the absence of it like you can't talk about leptin without talking about what it might be doing in the body you can talk you know so there's a to put me in a very awkward position so Stephen is kind of the defender of the Orthodox and I'm the one that comes along you screwed up you had psychologist and psychiatrist running the field when the endocrinologist solved and then you discovered leptin and it became of molecular biology problem and you're now divorced from the very simplest observations about obesity you know so we can do huge genome-wide Association studies a sound remarkable but if I would ask a simple question like why is it I get fat here it's not in the front but it's here and not here I don't see what the brain has to say about okay so as you mentioned there have been different genetic studies that have looked at body fat distribution vs. total body fatness so total body fat in this is what we're talking about we were talking about obesity body fat distribution is what we're talking about when we're talking about the fat being on your hips vs. on your wrist now what we see is different sets of genes that come up so body fat distribution we actually see insulin related genes so people that have a central body fat distribution so body fat around their waist tend to have use insulin related genes that are driving that but when you look at total body fatness that thing that causes obesity what you see is that those jeans are dominated by the brain and it really cool thing out the point I want to make about the genetics research if they looked come on Gary it is unbiased that's the really cool thing about it is that they're just this is whatever genes are popping up you said he's do not care about what you believe about what causes obesity this is just whatever genes are popping up so it's unbiased and that's what they're saying and I'm not done here. Now I want to talk about you mentioned Gary that may be left in is having important actions not just in the brain in the body first of all I'm glad I'm flattered that you read my book and I'm glad that you acknowledge the existence of leptin now this is good but now you say that researchers focus on left and actions in the brain because we're phase-locked and we can't get out of our you know blinders of thinking about it in terms of the brain and that's why we focus on left in action in the brain the real reason we focus on in the brain is because it has been menstruated that its effect on body fatness arvida the brain their actual experiment demonstrating this and I'll explain how these experiments work this is all in the scientific literature so if you knock out the leptin receptor only in the brain or only in the hypothalamus you get obesity so that is what tells us that actually the brain is the key side of action and particularly this child drained it tells me Gary Gary Gary and that's it so I mean you get the same obesity if you knock left and out of the brain and tickly out of the hypothalamus that you get if you knock it out of the whole body so that shows that the brain is this site of action that is causing this to happen in this is no surprise we have these mechanisms worked out we know specific groups of neurons that are receiving a left in that are controlling your appetite that are controlling or metal the rate we have many of these neural populations workout in mice we understand we system so well we can control specific popular tiny populations of neurons very precisely cause them to eat a ton to stop eating to gain fat to lose fat like the animals are marionettes I mean that's the level of understanding we have right now is how these systems work so I mean all of this evidence is converging on the same thing that the brain is Central so I mean all of this evidence is converging on the same thing that the brain is Central and that fat cell metabolism I'm just not seeing the evidence for that and Gary if you want to cite specific evidence demonstrating that that is an actual cause of differences in body fatness between individuals in the general population I'm awaiting that evidence and I'm happy to sit here and listen to you cite the evidence that demonstrates that</div>

This is a country that's made of immigrants mean that's one of the weirdest things in this country that this is a country so so obsessed with borders and immigration but yet it's comprised entirely of immigrants yeah Young no interviews Richard Spencer this country was built by white people came up with the patient looking for him I don't know anything about Richard Spencer other than he always gets mentioned as a white supremacist I literally don't know what he stands for what he does what he says and it was such a crazy subject the idea of I mean it would be nice if the whole world was up to the same standards of health and then prosperity and you didn't have to worry about if the whole world was essentially like the United States where you could go to where the good parts were you know if you live in Detroit you save up your money you can move to Florida or wherever you want to go when you can do that this is the beautiful thing about living inside of a country be fantastic if the whole world was like that you can just kind of go wherever you would prosper and wherever things to do well but this the thing about refugees in other countries where weed understand their language of their call when you get scared because you hear the Muslims were worried about Muslim terrorists and it's again it's one more piece of information that just overwhelms you one more one more thing concert what's fear of the unknown you know a lot of it the languages and the fact that were you know is also this has to be this feeling that we've invaded their country several countries and been there for a long time and there's a deep-seated resentment that you know there's the thought of every time you accidentally blow up a wedding party with a drone every time you kill civilians every end-times in collateral damage your creating told numbers of people that hate the United States travel too much this country's I don't I don't see that and yesterday I was interviewing the Afghan interpreters and I said what do you think about negotiating with the Taliban I mean one case I said the guys killed your brother because you were working for the Americans an interpreter so how do you feel about the Americans now doing a deal with the Taliban and what about if the US leaves in the Taliban finishes off then comes after your family messaging I walk America's not going to let that happen America has so much power I know you want to do that they will make sure the angryman a week for the Taliban will be enforceable and it'll be safe he had so much faith and you know like Donald Trump places where you go there but I do think you'll find a Low Places Crystal of American foreign policy that doesn't mean Equity America how many parts that out I think Vietnam grow up and think Western culture of Communism I know which one Generations is making that very simple choice and it could just mean democracy and you think that is in Afghanistan as well yeah that they're recognizing that Western culture provides more freedom and more Economic Opportunity more prosperity and I haven't heard from the Taliban I haven't had too much antimatter understand ASL really made them by cuz I'm talking to hide interactions with with Americans but they would even say as many mistakes have been made in the processing of the war with airstrikes and nitrites in a lot the American soldiers and Marines we met when you were good people and like I said it's it's incredible how many people still believe that to this day</div>

Just so they can make money off of this is the therapeutic dose of ketamine in some sort of psychiatric sort of circle with the environment they're going to do it so they want to have it very much controlled by it looks like they want to stop at the therapist giving in the study in their own office I mean which is which is what's going on now have it controls under under you know Hospital sort of situation that there is a very good oh you bought it with a reception is ketamine legal legal under my prescription baby it's a schedule 2 drug or something along those lines yeah he's he's a douchebag though he's he's up pointed him he had to know who owns that Wu-Tang Clan album hilarious. Might be one of the most hilarious part of that story the FBI owns the Wu-Tang Clan forbidden album how much did you pay for it he paid 2 million natural said you know I mean how many wealthy people out there are Wu-Tang fans what a healthy bid healthy bidding war disparagingly like look at this guy he's a dick you know all he wants to raise the money or raise the price of these drugs that can help people f*** him let's go get them cuz it's Johnson &amp; Johnson so I can for a household name Chicago and is the nasal spray o Jesus on a different that makes it but well it's better than shooting it up because I know that a lot of people take it intramuscularly where you just jabbing in your thigh I believe yet it says the drug will only be given by accredited specialist we must monitor patients for 2 hours after Administration I don't think you can just get it and go home and do that make sense cuz he had some very good results from it he's f****** hilarious guy he's had some real depression problems though he said some very good relief from magnetic therapy and if you seen the involuntary trembling thing he did as well somehow and that helps him yeah Special thinking I had no idea about that after I might being the serious stuff but you know he's a guy fighting demons he's the classic case of the comedian that can never be happy unless he's onstage killing now and then you don't even then that's brief like he's just never this jovial funny guy but he's a brilliant comedian yeah but as long as I've known him for many years he struggled and it sounds like he's kind of an unofficial executive producer for a bunch of other comedians as well. writing adjuster tell us a story then had no idea why it's it's hard when you know I've had a few friends take her life 3 in the last year and you know yet you seek I like Neil and you know he's pursuing all these different therapies and constantly trying to find something that alleviates this depression and you just keep hoping you keep hoping you keep searching keep it and hoping that one of these things sticks why seems really say mean he's very very proactive he's always searching for new things is very open about it and talking about it but the ketamine does seem to have helped him quite a bit and he was telling me like man he's like this is so f****** crazy I'm going to the doctor's office and Havanese full-blown psychedelic experiences at the doctor's office can you translate around the street fitting what was your ketamine experience like I took a tablet and let it dissolve for 10 minutes and I'll lay down so for in a therapist office for 2 hours and I was out on the street again 2 hours like that so how long does it take for a kicked-in I don't remember cuz it was kicking in and I just found myself saying things and concluding things but I wouldn't normally say until the next week and a half I just felt like did you have any sort of a hallucinogenic experience nothing no hallucinate all Listen to listen to music quietly but a few minutes here and there sometime didn't talk at all but yeah just relief is lightness I need a point about Neil being so open to trying everything even that even taking that step is hard and sometimes even getting out the door she want to talk</div>

Don't know I think for a while where I mean that's why we killed an American citizen that would also headlines right on purpose with no trial they just did dis overdo it was because he join Isis is that what it wants our outside meaning that people can't get get food night that because you just come move things around that whatever came out of that guy getting killed they they basically no one was punished for it mean he's an American citizen he was I mean if it was in America if somehow know this guy was in the suburbs of Chicago and they launched a joint a drone strike on them it would be front-page news and if you have real issues with the fact that was in Yemen I mean again the legacy of a rock Santa's but now we're killing guys like him with drone strikes or Special Forces right here in that it's happening almost in secret and I one saying they supposed to be illegal some people are but that seems to be what's happening now I think you're right did the other thing about that is with a lot of these even though it does seem to be illegal people sort of shrugged their shoulders and then no one pursues it and then it just kind of goes away but there's some stories that for whatever reason like Jamal khashoggi did not go away and still still out there like it was so egregious is so crazy that this guy walks into the embassy and just never comes out and then like I don't know what happened and still still out there like he was so egregious is so crazy that this guy walks into the embassy and just never comes out and then like I don't know what happened and then slowly you start getting a different story and then apparently there's leaked there's audio and perhaps even video of his murder yet that ordered by the way by someone who was hanging out with Jared Kushner off to its with apparently no mention of what happened</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> silly but you don't need fans fans wanted they could have been is a representative of the trolls like most of the trolls look like been asked if I can give you any that's hilarious please don't pay attention when I start paying attention to the show I started watching the show and I watched it when you do with tired when time was up here and and you still write like something cuz that's one thing that I always felt like so unfair about tiring is a lot of people just gave him s*** because and I think it started because he didn't take that belt Thrones tour San Pierre so I think a lot of it stems from that looping around is a champion because he retired you said I'm going to step away for you being so long we never took the belt from George and he always wanted that's Wonder Boy fights I think the Wonder Boy fights were so f****** hardly anybody even before that fight wonderboard that way that is the one you fight that guy is what it is yeah we deserve the problem with him is he's so difficult to get close to a different guy because his style so different he'll stand totally sideways on you his hands will be down and he can wrestle I mean in terms of takedown defense you've got good takedown defense and his stripes come from f****** weird angles Manny moves like a snake like a Benz at the waist and Pops Ford young smacka? Kick out the front leg he's very good with it he just you don't even know what's going on he sick maybe going to kick you in the body around around comes over the top and I'll smack you in the face. He's very talented like I like wondered what lot I just felt like you know I saw that show it tiring you said the exact same thing to him and that's what I said too and that's what I was thinking too but easier said than done because partially what I I got into this I appreciate the platform that I have right now is the fact that you can affect so many people at such a rapid amount of time because there's been instance to where I don't even remember that movie what women want Mel Gibson Mel Gibson because no one really paid attention to her she's like no one would care just walked around with bus I apply for a job everyone blew me off no one cares I'm going to kill myself this day but she was planning to kill herself and he heard her because he can hear what women think he heard of thoughts but initially didn't really pay attention to it until later on he realized she was missing from the office and then he like ran to go find her and and sent you the same for life but my thing is that I live by with great power comes great bondability like what if there's someone that's dealing with something at a certain time and yes I didn't ask to be put in that position but they know they just decided no I'm just going to reach I send a message before I kill myself this day and was going to respond I was going to care and I happened to read that message and talk that kid off the last and I kid becomes f****** you know when to Nobel Peace Prize later on in life like that's a responsibility that I didn't I didn't put that on myself but that I have with the gift that I've been blessed with the touch so many people and so how am I going to know that if I never read any of my messages or comment something like that yes of course I ain't all the negative ones Yet Bun blow it off but how do I know it's negative I don't need it now what I do is I read if I even feel like it's getting negative Dilly Dilly Dilly I can't read them all cuz after that fight f****** I got thousands I'm sure so I can't read them all but every now and again when I'm bored enough and I have time like I'll read some of it cuz sometimes it is good but</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that do so well in this country that's one of the things you look at like Nigerian immigrants like successful ratios of the different immigration groups Nigerians are particular or extraordinary Li successful upon immigrating to America family family takes a family decide and we get the opportunity to move to a better place the thing is that the whole Persona is we're going to be able to sustain this forever to my kids are not going to just play around Sports what is guaranteed is the fact that you're going to go to school when you can become a doctor because you're going to get a job anywhere in the world that you want that's why majority of them are doctors majority and doctors Engineers because he's a jobs at high demand jobs you always going to get a job anywhere and so that's all that's all we put you're going to be a doctor or you going to be an engineer to be a professional athlete careful. Like I lied to them the first couple years and I was wrestling I didn't tell him that you know my brother is a doctor in Pharmacy in Dallas my little brother you know could have gotten the NFL who was the football player play the University of Houston University Arizona you know my sister now is in college is in nursing school and college like that's just what we push we want you to get a job that you can provide for your family forever remind me of Koreans in a lot of ways hard-working and appreciate once they've gotten to a place like America where there really is no ceiling on the possibility you could do anything you want what you get here if you work hard as a Lily and then this is that's another thing that's dear to my heart is when you're Nigeria like when you're in a situation that we was at my mom is a teacher my mom on the store to tell the little convenience store. When we did little jobs on the side with told certain things on the side and on top of it raising three boys Rowdy boys like that that's what we end in the school week we didn't even like all these the card buses going to pick you up at three 7 a.m. to go to school and the school was two miles away 3 miles where you walking you better get going don't be late cuz if you got if you was late you was going to get a whooping before school started that's how it was an especially education system so high because you miss going to test you have to go out and get a switch and you were going to get whipped into school for the answers that you missed it would be you in school absolutely the teacher the teacher the teacher was first Warsaw teacher is uncle and Aunt that your uncle and Aunt in school they knew your parents and your family they were going to whoop you in school if you decided to the mess up and that's how it was so that's why there's a lot of these smart if there's no freaking job but we got to somehow make money so f***** up cuz I don't want people to be kids but God damn when you put kids under that kind of pressure my parents put me Catholic school for 1 year and I got excellent grades and afterwards I was f****** terrible cuz I don't want people to be kids but God damn when you put kids under that kind of pressure my parents put me Catholic school for 1 year and I got excellent grades and afterwards I was f****** terrible</div>

Play Napa in an impoverished area at least then you'll get to me yeah the other people yeah people outside of your and I can't believe it you know how grown-up on the Spike Lee movies and where I mean I guess I do shower kind of segregation by thought this was the place where everyone lives together on this week how many teachers did not make each other or they just did not make different language different everything right this is utopian perception that there is a place where everybody's cool yeah it's about a New York school system Public School System the most segregated school system in America New York was the the very good well-supported school in the gentrifying mostly white area or the bad failing Public School in The Gnome gentrified mostly black area where her kids education might suffer and I think I'm remembering correctly hope it get better and it's going to take years and daughter may suffer in the short time but that's what we have to do if we living in this neighborhood it's incredible face while the real conflict of children when your situation is never your first instinct in a progressive white liberal parents he would be very left-wing on every other issue we're really fighting to make sure that kid went to the goods majority-white School place you know because Atlanta has a lot of there's a there's a lot of a lot of everything in the plan. But it's it's a very black City in a lot of ways but also very White City you see a lot of black and white people hanging out together and clubs and bars and restaurants and stuff and it's really like much closer to like a 50/50 split in a lot of places I listen some of the neighborhoods and I've been to when I got back to London I'm proud of about Lundy are sending New York it said it's not a big deal for a group of friends and family arrived to be to be genuinely mixed parents. You know I'd ask you is that because London didn't experience slavery the way the United States did we have a colonial history it's you know I mean here if you have black friends or you date a black girl. You know it's people think you're trying to prove your work right there it was just normal normal it's so strange and my friend Judah who is Judah friedlander who lives there said he's he's lived there for a long time he's like it's so changed it used to be like a lot of artists and a lot of creative people and goes just now funniest people I care where you go to finance everybody just wants the most expensive suit in the most expensive watch and they live in this ridiculously expensive apartment and I thought that went out in the 80s Judah friedlander who lives there said he's he's lived there for a long time he's like it's so changed it used to be like a lot of artists and a lot of creative people and it goes just now top Finance people here where you go to finance everybody just wants the most expensive suit in the most expensive watch and they live in the ridiculously expensive apartment and I thought that went out in the 80s</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm in 10 minutes I'm going to come f****** heroin addiction man it's crazy how everyone was looking at their phone no one was looking at each other like I'm in a movie this is a movie oh my God there's a real problem in sitting next to each other like these people are sick or something wrong need help instead they're looking at nothing to check in their feet over and over again someone's complaining about Captain Marvel being a woman but it's it's not that I think there's two things I think one we didn't earn it is just given to us right it's not like we did all the work to curate all this technology and put it together and figure out how to implement it and I didn't know we just went to the f****** Verizon store and picked up a new phone I mean that's that's what most people are doing that and because of that it's almost like being like a trust-fund kid or something like that it's just all given to you it's all although I feel the same way sometimes about weapons I feel like the discipline required to learn how to use one and create it and build it and then understand the responsibility of actually using it on a human being that's just out the window just go to the store and buy it you know there's no requirements of you other than you never killed anybody yet have you ridden driven in over anybody in your car know if you rob a bank you beating your wife know it's f****** strange and this as a human being the lack of discipline and accountability that we have in this ultimate access to all these things constantly and many of them become just massive distractions and this in some ways is the Utopia that people dream you're not going to stop you have everything you could possibly need so you think will become the perfect human beings and the absence Willis things that would have killed us in the past I would have made life hard in the past and again that's legitimate conflict without legitimate conflict in terms of like actual things you need to worry about like I when I used to live in the east coast when I think it was really noticeable was that when it snowed out people are nicer help people when they're broken down the side of the road they were nice to each other there was a sense of vulnerability that we are all deeply entrenched in this winter nature thing and we got to work together otherwise we can survive you know and I think that applies to all aspects of life that when there's no real danger people become extremely frivolous yeah yeah it's amazing how quickly I'll come back from Yemen Syria wherever I'll go out and get a cup of coffee coffee and I'll read the newspaper and I don't think man I'm the luckiest man alive experience environment so you can appreciate it something so puts it in perspective on this island it rained every day for Six Days Seven Days I mean we were soaked you're soaked everything so cute sleeping bags so cute and so if everything came back home and it felt so good like I've never felt the sun like that before Sean was just dislike this magic love glow that the sky was pouring down on the city everything felt so happy and I realize like you can't really appreciate this until it's taken away from ya taken away from you then you understand what it is so then when the kids of today grow up where they going to be like when everything is please don't lie about shed and you really didn't know you like man I don't know he seems like he's full of s*** you couldn't just have to go to an encyclopedia and you know when actually read the information now you can go okay what year did this happen you pull up your phone get the f*** out of it and understand what it is and appreciate it is but your point if there was a way to actually filter and say this is verifiable this this contains 7 things which are absolutely bulshit we have no doubt about that whatsoever if that could exist wonderful but I mean folks tried a few people tried it and you still it still feels like you end up being described on one side of the fight feel like we need some sort of organized discipline like maybe like a mandatory volunteer work cleaning up impoverished volunteer work cleaning up impoverished communities for mandatory volunteer work doing that but I don't want people to have to do things like I'm conflicted on that too but I don't want people to have to do that you know you went there countries that have mandatory military service they seem to have an amazing feeling of patriotism in those countries and preciation in those countries because they actually do have to join the military for 2 years or whatever it is that over here</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> does Justine to hurt you you get to a point where you have to you're the guy who is to provide you're the guy who has to hold up and it's not not necessarily people saying you have to do it but you you feel that sense of responsibility in my family I felt that I feel that sense of responsibility like and it wasn't like the village villager we live in huts and we had a house but it wasn't really wouldn't have Plumbing you know we had to go to the well or get water we electricity was real that's the scariest thing you know and it's where we even when we came here and we immigrated here yet life got a lot better how old are you when you came in about 8 years old and it was hard to adjust to the school system is it mean you have talked with the funny accent and kids would tell you they want you say this to the teacher say hey b****, I was always in the principal's office cuz I have no idea what that means and things like that so I had to deal with all that Akon and so how much different different different like if I was talking with another Nigerian I was speaking pidgin English you pick out words but it's a little different but can you say something in pidgin English speaking to each other so going from that to you know being essentially raising and then going through school and and one thing that man I haven't I I really haven't ever share with anybody you know very very few people know is that my father has been incarcerated since 2009 and this is the first time really have I ever talked about it like OSHA test is used to justice system here man it's always so so crooked and it is so backwards as of course we're fortunate like I did so many things that were thankful for living here in this country that you know you can sleep at night in your house and not worry about somebody breaking it robbing and killing you and for the most part and she won't be thankful for all that was thank you for the opportunities but my dad was a businessman and my dad built one of the really big in Dallas you don't like an ambulance company and you know it comes to a certain point where people just don't want him to be your own immigrant and you were succeeded in the starting business there where it's kind of like people don't care about people don't want you to be there and you know it's one of those situations where my dad hired the people that he thought with the right people to do what he didn't know the job to run his company why you can't end certain things like us like his family day today different things that I cared about the weather run that company into the ground and now because my dad was the owner of the company they put it all on him even though the people that were doing you know the things that were wrong and Company admitted to doing the wrong things but what the court is saying is that all because you own the company so ignorant it's not an excuse so because we're going to sentence you to 15 years when he didn't know crime and one thing that they rehired these are like that so he had different company but you know one thing that I would say is my dad's ignorance is is he didn't really do is research well enough on the guys that you're hired so you hire certain guys and now these guys are running the business and he's got to like yeah we're going to make you were going to help you grow this business like any businessman fuc yeah I had the right people you help me grow the business so now they're helping he's there doing that if he thinks I trust these guys are taking care of business and most disappointing heartbreaking thing about the business is my dad and they're not they're not the one who does the billing the billing for the business they contract difference I saw an outside company to do billing so it's not them doing it so they're doing the runs they're sending you notes to them this is runs we did to you guys build the government or whoever else to pay us my dad's the owner yet people are doing all this he's not there running the day today So eventually they go on their it's only we're investigating like I think maybe like fifteen patients or something like that I don't know what the exact number 515 patient's were investigating for these runs or whatever that was billed as billing on them until they put it all in the investigation and they're like okay after a while they they come back and he said all right we'll give you your stuff back like we didn't really see anything but will give you your stuff back after they shut it down for a little while so damn. Got to go back to bed I'm getting out of business dirty killed my business for me so now became one of the biggest company but you shut down for so long you've lost you know what you've worked for so now he's getting rid of it getting out of it then it come back later years later for the same thing that you've already said you're good here to have your stuff back they come back is it not going to prosecute you for this so now those guys and I've I've seen that this is obviously how the feds were those guys that you caught the EMS any guys that were clearly did what was wrong to give them a Gionta hey we caught you guys cuz there's got started their own company doing the same chat so they get caught now they're like okay we want that guy so you guys basically gave him a deal to say okay that I got it was in on it and my dad's life and I guess they offer my daddy or plea deal which his lawyer didn't really tell the doctor that court appointed lawyer so he said no new shitt wrong why would I take that deal which would have been I think maybe like 5 years was the deal or something like that I know I didn't do s*** wrong why would I take five years so he goes to trial and broke we've seen murderers we've seen only people that have defraud the government like stopped my head funny guys billions of dollars get Bill not going to give you bail going to hold you with a freeze on your account so you can really fight the case so you're stuck there and now your family left with nothing nothing no money in account nothing and so my dad to deal with that and they just threw the book at you know what give you 15 years and this was 2009 one thing it was a point that part in a trial where the lawyer would basically telling the judge like this got enough standing got milk record you know a kid look at his kids and how well they're doing his older son is in college the second one is in college. The youngest is about to be in college these kids are all scholarship student-athletes great athletes killed me was the prosecution was like the reason that it is is because he was defrauding the government for this money that's why they're in college and I was like wait my dad's not paying for us being called raw student-athlete we learned this we worked hard earn scholarships for us to be in college the defense didn't say that call my dad just got railroaded man and it was like and then it was so heartbreaking to where you're telling a man that has raised his family raise his kids to to work hard get to a place in life and in your tell him that the only reason stairs because he cheated and it was just one of those things that added the chip on my shoulder at all man who actually been so many moments that attitude put chips on my shoulder with everything that I like I've been through so much that I just internalized and I compete with energy and sell it to for that you telling my dad that yeah like you going to sit down and I just end and obviously of course I research more and more into that cuz I was so heartbroken after that like might like you just going to for what for how much you're saying not even up to almost a million they would this day just piled a lot of money on her own this isn't math for a little over other saying little over a million total which is nowhere near that you give him 15 years when he's got headphone guys at that you found guilty for manipulating these markets for billions you give him six months house arrest if that and you saying you going to give me 15 years and I started resource sound like a lot of these judges have steaks in these prisons and do what they do is they they give a lot of time because they get paid for prison of that any other story about that guy in Pennsylvania doing are you sending kids to jail he was extending their sentences and giving them sentences for like nothing and it turned out he'd been getting paid by the Verizon to spend a lot of people there bring someone forward that wants to help you with the appeal my dad actually wrote it went during Obama administration they were sad or clemency deal when they when they were doing my dad actually wrote a letter I see have that letter I don't know where to put it but you wrote a letter to him and it was when I read the letter man I can't help but cry about it because my my dad my dad cares about his family so much when I go see my dad at my dad's so proud of me and I'm surprised him I mean raised us so well and to go see him in there and I mean it's not like he's sitting in the maximum-security but for someone to tell you that you can't go home to your family at night for that you got in here you got to sleep when we told you to sleep we got you got to eat and we tell you to eat for 10 years and when you know I didn't do anything wrong because I chose to say no I didn't do anything wrong I'm not going to take this sentence you give me they say okay fine that you were going to sit in there for 15 years and there's nothing you can do about it it is a man that broke my heart man in it and then when I think about something I just holding it cuz I don't you know I try not to cry about it which I'm just like the story I've have different situation to happen in life you know but I ate that was on the show. Put that chip on that you know what they're going to say that the reason I'm here I was scholarship is because my dad they're saying my dad got money a little bit of money are you Siri what about the freaking hard work that I did to get here what about all the times that I sent in a freaking hot box my bathroom upstairs with the trash bag on because I knew that I needed to get a pound off the next day in order to be able to wrestle at this JV tournament what about all that you know that didn't make any difference you know the reason only reason was there because of that what about all the times my brother ran worked hard to make national team when he's playing soccer or my little brother getting numerous scholarship for division football everywhere like that what it's all that put a chip on my shoulder Joe it's where was like man I got to succeed at all cause I don't really care and where it where this happen where was this trial in Texas and Dallas Texas not the best place to have it but it happened in it and put a sour taste in my mouth states where it's like that job they put you there you there. Is his domain didn't even look at it like me who cares I just feel like you're used it from Yuri on UFC welterweight champion but I think they treated him like that cuz that your immigrant system get in there and that's you know that's a wrap. Put that on that's part of what this next fight symbolizes to me is the attitude that a lot of people have towards immigrants if people are forgetting that Americans forgetting that you have this attitude we're somewhere American go back to your country you know do you know go back to some free country or this and that people like I always heard that growing up I always heard that and I always liked the more research I might but we talkin about first of all this this whole attitude when you walk into a nail shop get your hand feet nails done who the majority of the people that run those nail shops agent I'm not saying all of them the world in the country but the majority of them in agent but there's a lot of people that look down on me like I'm not washing your feet I'm not going to do your nails don't take pride in that because that provides for them they do that is that clean up the hotels life from immigrants I take pride in them because now we're in a better place where we can provide for families do jobs are a lot of people so-called Americans the whole Colby Covington whole Persona are like I'm above that I'm above that that's the persona but then at the same time people not want to cry at all in here taking our jobs let's build a wall that keep them out the fact that you become your have someone do your nails somewhat clean your house and wash your car or someone do all this for you is part of what makes America so great one of the greatest nations in the world and the fact that they want we want to build a wall you want to keep these people out you can't come here you can't bring your culture your stuff here it just saddens me and it upsets me that's part of what this fight when it happened despite represents for me because I feel like that's the attitude that this young man has he's entitled to I should be UFC champ boyan you can you don't deserve you can't hang with me boy that's his attitude he can't do this boy for someone who's born I'm a grown ass man don't f****** talk to me like that and that's the attitude that he has I'm entitled to it I mean I should be the champion because I am this way I'm American I'm nuts and ass bro we're all American here and told that this fight is greater than than just me beating up a guy stalking I'm entitled to this I mean I like you beat a champion because I am this way I'm American I'm this and ass bro we're all American here until that this fight is greater than than just me beating up a guy that's talkin lot of s*** this is it this is fight means a lot to me so when I get the chance to put my hands on that guy let's just know this the wrath of every immigrant that are step foot in this country</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Instagram blocked him store and he opened the door and saw your face imagine f****** belly out like this is ever traded a his life as you think it was going to Robbie Lawler fight with Ben I was thinking when it was over the herb tea made a mistake but the more I wanted the more I think he didn't I think what happened was I think Robbie went out I think his arm dropped and I think when herb came over this what Ben says to that he loosened up the truck a little bit and Robbie came back to it he probably doesn't even know cuz Robbie such a f****** Savage probably didn't even know he went out and you know this is the argument and this is why it has to be right back on this is an argument because when Robbie ran that truck to Ben's face like he was out 20 in the milk you can be out of it but your body will naturally go through certain emotions grab a leg pull up thinking about cooling Brawley was bombing on a Mack truck through his face like that was under his truck to his face like I feel like Robbie knocked him out woke him up knock him out like Robbie was just is Robbie such a different guy I can eat something and a loss with some classy anyting but Robbie explained it as I put my hand down because it wasn't doing s*** it's a relaxed you know cuz I don't want to panic Robbie has that much experience you should know what to do with it maybe that's what he was doing good by the way he put his arm down and look like it was out but then when The Rock when her Dean came to check on him while he was giving the Thumb Thumbs Up her didn't really give him a chance to put the thumbs-up but as far as we don't lose him a joke until this the rep Bulls you offered him all UB pop his head off like that have been lightened up when herb came over cuz you thought that her was going to stop the fight cuz he felt Robbie go limp you don't lighten up because you think someone going to stop at 5 you don't know the point you don't like no because you think you squeeze hard it because you want to make him stop the fight I see a point and also there is a difference between squeezing someone out and beating on them when the referee is coming if there ever comes and you stop punching because me and the guys out yet that's why that's one thing about you don't you have him in a bulldog ear here in survival mode you can't like really you in survival mode that's a bulldog choke some legit I mean they really do work yeah but what kind of sucks is when you're not you know I pass iib time I pass or what what look at this but it is amazing that he's able to get ahold of Robbie I was stunned I knew he was going to get ahold of well you definitely ate some big shots but I don't think is any evidence at all that this is a credit with credit he tried to get up cuz he does get to take the whole look he's drunk driving oh my God man lot of blood, the nasty left hand there and I like he's looking for looking for a bomb and bandages moving forward like a tomboy shut them down a little bit couldn't use the body there by Robbie yeah those f****** body shot good Lord I was trying to take that picture to the body so here we see yeah I do not remember how it happened or what was here it is. Is it reaches down so he's got them in the clinch Year got the underhook on the left side and so someone okay grab the leg thing I don't remember this all I remember is the opening exchange and then the final exchange yeah she's got the single single Robbie doing a good job class together amazing to me how good of a wrestler he is going to be honest with you. restart circles out he's got the headlock okay now it's just a headlock and now watch that right on his foot but this is it this is what I'm saying right here is initially in the situation wait wait till he turns which we turn right right what you put his arms out I'm right here one more time just back it up just a little bit. Speedway drops I was outside so how much do UFC tell him what to do what to the UFC when he listen to happen again like that's the sport were in the judge the jury and if they want the execution what is Dana White say after the fight he said he wanted to fight him again right back cast what do UFC listen this fight has to happen again that's like that's the sport were in the judge the jury and if they want the execution what is Ben Dana White say after the fight he said he wanted to fight him again right back and then not passed</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> sleeping so he called me to Shiloh's lucky shot is not ever going to do that s*** to me next time I'm going to get her only call me when it's slick submission I never seen that before I'm a trained for a next time he's going to be stopping my thing is even the wrestling what I always wanted to do as I wanted to Tech Fall Guys in wrestling and Tech Fall what that means is when you be in someone with my 15.715 point gap they stop the match because it's a basic a skunk like you skunk this guy like you that not going to be in that bad they had to stop it that is my mentality that is always what I strive for any 2011 I believe I not to download 2009 I let the nation Division 1 2 and 3 and whatever intek Falls I think at one point me and Brent Metcalf was battling like every week I would look into at the most hurtful thing is me behind Mimi him and I had the most because that's what Mike was my goals I wanted to skunk guys because in their mind says is you can't f*** with that guy there's you can't hang with him there was nothing you can do it not even it was a quick paying a lucky pants or or this like heat destroy you he just stepped levels apart and that's what I do Eminem fighting now I do the exact same thing I would much rather dominate you from start to finish I want to break you I don't want I want you think about fighting me again it's not you I don't want you to hurt you I want you to say f*** no I don't know he broke me he took something from me because you're going to think about you remember the fight you lose you don't like being so many guys and rest I can't tell you maybe 30 guys that I've eaten wrestling I don't have no idea but the ones you lose you can almost tell everyone and that's what my mind take on it I want to dominate you so bad when you think about fighting me again you don't you say f*** that I'll pass on that fight and some people are like always guy doesn't really finished how many guys want to fight me again not a lot of them do you have one lostinanime yes I do I was out I took the final like a two weeks notice or something like that because it was like eight months in between I fought my first fight and I thought see that's the thing with Eminem Fighters come in MMA now it's a lesson to you guys everyone feels like I'm just going to jump in and it's going to be peachy I'm beginning fights every other week every other month so I fought my first fine I thought okay this is great MyCareer kick-starting I'm going to be doing fight and every so often I want you 2022 opponents within my first fight if I got the second fight because now he knows Google now everyone fall Thrones national champion wrestling I don't fight that cuz everyone wants to get thrown UFC and they figure out the best record you want to be undefeated to get to the UFC so nobody wants to fight anyone that's hard and so of course at that point I was a wrestler I could take anyone down hold him down for two rounds and went fight so everyone no one wanted that fought so it was months and months went by and then that fight cancer I'll take you and I'll be honest I never grabbed hold before that I never did you just too and so I figured I can rest of my way through all this s*** like men f*** these guys guys are low-level guys look who I train with Trevor Rashad Evans in these guys to his life and I'm kind of throwing punches I didn't really know what I was doing I'm throwing punches and I'm trying to Elbow him and Jose caceres. 62616 well taller than me long limbs he throws his legs I mean full Mountain towards his legs around my body I never seen or s*** like that so I'm kind of panicking in my mind I don't know what to do I'm like f****** get out which is what you don't do so I turn my body I'm trying to like get up and walk out which is what you don't do and so he just basically climbed up my back bone we're not even sweating you he's on my back I'm standing up with a backpack on he's 60-something me he has a foot on the ground one foot wrapped around me he's fighting for the show and I think I hold him off for another like minute-and-a-half I'm standing and I'm fighting this choke all the while I'm thinking like oh s*** I can't go down cuz I don't f*** I'm doing down there as well so I don't really know the defense down there so if I go down that just might make it worse I don't know the defense and this dude looks like he knows what he's doing behind me he's got a few more for you got a few fights and I'm kind of scared fighting it now I'm standing up my feet are getting heavy getting shaky I'm like I'm a strong guy why the f*** my feet shaking because they're starting to fill up with blood my adrenaline is pumping and I'm just like oh s*** I'm about to lose your mind to where you start to come to realization think about random thoughts and one of the thoughts I thought thought about was before the fight we had a commission meeting in the bag and the commission said if you get choked unconscious you're suspended for six months so you can't fight for 6 months cuz it in my mind I'm like f*** this I'm a tough guy I'm. You got to put me to sleep I never tap it like if I get it took me eight months to get this fight short notice but I haven't made money 8 months I'm broke as s*** I sleep in I live with Rashad I live with another man I'm broke as s*** I have no money I need money so if I can't fight for another 6 months I have no money so all these thoughts are going through my mind and I hear Alex cazares on the other side of the cage screaming now I'm thinking about that but just for that s*** and I'll man and I just saw it going down and I'm like you can't be suspended for six months bro I know you want me tough right now you want to go to sleep but you can be suspended for six months do you have to you got it you know you got to make money you're broke I f****** dad job I f******. I never felt so I want to emasculate that's the word I never felt so like I just that's why I said like when I lose it take something from you and I walked out of that fight I went to the back I paste for like maybe 2 or 3 hours and a back all the fights finished up and I finally went to lock and got my stuff in and came out but I just paced back and forth and the feeling in my mind was I'm never going to feel like this again I do not ever want to feel like and ever since then I got a f****** Gigi I never had a game before I got a g I started training with Jorge Santiago much is used to coach every f****** morning I was like Brossard give you a black Belle Delphine can my black bra and it and I never I never worried about that I never worried about like yes I was freaking beating up blue belts before I receive in a white belt like yeah cuz I never did that skill running did you choose your skills but like I knew how to Grapple turo certain shortly and I've been grappling with high-level but yet he wasn't just Jiu-Jitsu so he kept challenging me like I was always cuz I want I want to be that guy I want to be the freaking blue belt that freaking works all the brown and black belt but he would freaking promote me cuz I purple belt because you've been training you training McGee I'm going to promote you so he kept challenge me and challenge him so now people knew I felt like all I was doing was alerting people of what to expect when they went with me and for try to really f****** up until he promoted me I think a couple years ago I was a brown belt broke on cutting maybe two-and-a-half 3 years ago and it ain't promoted me to Black. He just asked me to come in the gym I didn't really even though I just felt like all that man he wants to take pictures with about and another thing I never knew I never expected all of this I just wanted to f****** compete no I just felt like okay man you want they want to take pictures with the bout and a freaking is my black mouth and other things for me on that s*** I never knew I never expected all this I just wanted to f****** compete I just wanted to be a martial artist learn all this stuff and compete I never knew that I would get black do I never knew that I would win the championship belt be the best in the world at this at that time so I never knew all that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> believe it or not like for most people to listening to this that's on the light side yeah I know it is but the thing is I'm so mean and I'm on 80 and walk around the Lowes 6% off of you or while who do you use to cut too forward for the last couple of fights man I've been working with Clint Clint Wittenberg up without pi and Trifecta yet and Tri-Cyclen a lot at Clint McClintock Trifecta food system and that they do a phenomenal job for nominal and Clint the reason I chose to go with him is I've always been in my myself I like to cook I cook for myself I always you know when all those fights are they fight in the UFC every one of my fights I usually charge my phone died I cooked myself I do this because I've done it so many years in wrestling all the wrong way I can look at myself I can wake up in the morning look myself in the mirror and tell how much I weigh and I'll be right on just because I'm used to my body so I know what I can or I can't eat what working hold fool I can hold water and it's just it's a discipline thing for me as well and so I so I decided you know what I'm getting higher up now one thing that I don't understand is that I haven't done the research has what foods to eat before certain practice at certain times to Neu me the best to make me help help me feel the best cuz I'm getting older and if things aren't the same that you the way that you want I'm 31 Ambi 32 in May and I'm like mad differences if you noticed a lot of difference like I-24 I just f****** wake up at 6 a.m. and I can go for a freaking 5 mile run like that with nothing now I can do that do you think that is age or you think that is Miles like all the hard training I'm at the combination is 31 year in your athletic Prime . might you know my shoulders are shot my my knees oh my God my knees I've had five knee surgeries Jesus Christ yeah I just had surgery on Tuesday and but I don't know if it was completely off you had a hernia and a broken foot I'm crazy the funny thing is an ally makes fun of me about this a manager is like all fight week like if you saw me you would think this guy was like a zombie Like I Do by Limp around I freaking like in patches on me and I'm in a Boudoir or sleeve and an all I do all days I go to the meeting around or whatever I need to do training come back and I'm just in my room by the game ready on me or something on me but when I walk through that door to fight the Nigerian I flip the switch and all people would would they go back and look at video of when I walk into the cage I stepped right before the case I pray say my prayer for protection and when I walk in I just freaking Darkness inside to flip that switch you say every time yeah exactly the best of my abilities it's never cuz I'm not selfish it's not I'm not getting in that prayer please let me win know it's please protect me in here so I can go back to my family safe and sound and protect my opponent as well and give me the strength to be able to display the best of my abilities and that's it and once I freaking walk through that door I'm the freaking Nigerian Nightmare I just feel like a different person I am my walking it goes away if I decide transform into that person will be surprised at how friendly and easy-going you are outside people can't tell an STD now is this really I haven't been a change in me I'm still the same freaking out since I haven't done anything since fight nothing people I asking me have you gone out party Tunes I didn't do anything I just sit on the couch watch TV go back many go to the the shop that I like to take my daughter to get get French toast she loves his one place so I'll take you there come back that's it or maybe take her to a date night the only difference is now a lot of people are starting to recognize any more so like I'm walking like movies people stopped me and can I get a picture a picture of course they don't but nothing change I'm the same freaking guy I haven't got a chance to do anything I ask I've been in bed for a week so I haven't done any day but I don't think anything's going to change I'm the same guy well you sound like you have the perfect attitude like the idea that you're having making a prayer to just do your best and not be hurt and not have your opponent hurt and protect you and your opponent that is a beautiful attitude and the fact that the way you're approaching this I mean you're just you're just here to compete and to do your very best that you free of the burden of a lot of bulshit that some people carry around with them and I was thinking about this on the way up and it's a lot a lot of those Fighters a lot of those Champions like after a while you you there if they feel this certain pressure to to be able to do this or that and some of the examples that I gave you BJ Penn beat is that actually on acting like you leave it was so much pressure do you run away from the sport because is that actually I feel like you're relieved it was so much pressure just run away from the sport because of pressure</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm about the trash talk of this era cuz there's this is it there's an error right now right is it has burned a trash talk era some people really good at it and some people are terrible at it but it seems like everybody's trying to get doll recently but he just beat Darren till it was it very interesting because you know what his take on it before the fight was like what are we doing this is going I don't like where this board is going I mean it was it's one of those things that I had to adjust to because I wasn't brought on those principles I don't I'm not you know I would do this and I chose to do this like I'm college educated I can get a f****** job and and I'm sitting in office and and punch numbers and all that but I chose to do this because of my burning desire to compete not even now when I compete with guys I'm not competing angry I don't want to kill this guy I'm not Robert ragno that s*** known as competition for me my mind is I'm going to beat you and which is partially which it would go to test with the how I fight and how I compete I'm not like that this is not the only thing that I can do and so this era came about we're not everybody you got to talk s*** you got to say all you got to do this and do that and so initial at some point I did because it was I was fighting the way I was fighting I was dominating guys and I was getting nowhere it was like no notoriety they were kind of like just got to put you on the Wayside they would always come you get a top take out you'll get a top 10 yacht but they weren't happens I call you can fight this guy and you can't really argue with them because it's promotion is giving you the opportunity to even really make money at all for the career path that you chose so far for a while just Batman this is not I guess I just got to do this because you saw it the other clown coming to have it he had to do that with the way that he fights he's done the exact same day since you've been in the UFC but after the first ever fight no one gave it s*** so he thought because he just woke up and started doing it and that's that's it they know you have to do people try to say you have to do but for me is what I'm not going to do is I'm not going to just sell my soul just yeah I'm just trying to earn a couple bucks because I'm not going to do that I'm going to do it the right way George did it the right way and I'm a firm believer that when you do it the right way you will learn what you deserve it will come to you at some point I don't think that you have to I really don't we had something I mean Kobe coming to Dallas because ponchos that was a big victory he did beat Demian Maia that was a big victory those are those are too legit victories over two very dangerous guys he did beat those cats got skill on top of the trash talking but the trash talk in bumped him ahead of you in line and a lot of us were surprised you know I was surprised show me to create an uproar that my name back in the picture and he did a wonderful job this is one thing that I will I will I would say is that he has done a wonderful job and having people talk about it what do you hate him which even the bosses of said the exact same thing is no one has done what he's done no one has ever created the Persona that is unanimously hated worldwide like you now like literally like those guys are they still had fans you know that he wanted to see him succeed like nobody likes he's not safe anywhere no you don't you don't even have to be there's a fly which that one hurt this guy that's when they never taught taught me over the years is that you have to appreciate your things like that and I do I always wanted this moment I always wanted that Connor could be that net that adversary that was shot in Rampage. Hughes and enjoy St-Pierre like you I always wanted that and and he's done a good job of creating that so not just in terms of like a legitimate worthy opponent but the dude that you want to f****** have self braking movie I mean I haven't I haven't been in a fight yet where is like a malicious like I was maliciously trying to hurt someone I haven't been in that fight yes I don't know something about meeting with my mind my mind is strong I don't compete to kill this guy and then you swing by punching you miss now you're dead tired I don't compete like that this one I'm still going to compete as myself but there's going to be a letter extra this one is going to be one that I really enjoy well there was a sin we could be even Connor what he said I want to change your face when I said that I was like damn that's deep I want to change your face and you saw that even went went to be was like that I like the way that I do as far as his mind where it's at like I don't give a s*** what you do talk about me do all this try to distract me like they tried me the leading up to the tire if I did everything what are you going to do then you had his his little sidekick that look like Sideshow Bob that was was talking and doing they're trying to distract me this and then Kobe popped up trying to distract me that didn't change anything that's not going to do nothing to me and I'm going to compete to the best of my abilities and I'm going to embarrass you and then this guy is going to be even more worker the big change in your skill-set from your first fight in UFC 2 now as you're striking the wrestling is always been outstanding you cardio's always been excellent but you're striking is much more fluid and much looser your you you're much more efficient now so you was you're always powerful but it seems like now everything's falling together like you don't have any holes in your game anymore the damn thing this guy's going to be even more worse with the big change in your skill-set from your first fight in UFC 2 now is your striking your wrestling is always been outstanding you cardio's always been excellent but you're striking is much more fluid and much looser your you you're much more efficient now so you was you're always powerful but it seems like now everything's falling together like you don't have any holes in your game anymore the damn thing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> me we're saying as of is a very good argument for the best well to whatever I felt like Tyron is like you got to give it to dislike to this legendary status right there's like Matt Hughes has led Durst ass being the original he was one of the first wrestlers who really knew how to submit guys and then George St-Pierre was of course many people's eyes the greatest of all-time in the welterweight division what time does the long run but I was like man when you retire and beat Zeus Manos like there's a real good argument for number one of all time beating Wonderboy beat Smash and Darren till beaten Demian Maia knocking out Robbie Lawler to win the title at I considered him I I put them in that conversation. Conversation for sure for sure I put him in that conversation I ain't no nothing but respect for tiring it was nice to see afterwards it was just a video of you and tyrants mom and tiring and turns modeled after is a beautiful video me a man I am jerker can I let it go cuz I'm one of those guys I never really sit and then stop and smell the roses and things like that always always have a chip on my shoulder and I'll explain why that is but I always had this chip on my shoulder with everything that I do so I never really sit and celebrate into a ho yeah accomplish there so I did that or did that but I know I known his mom I met her previously to to that the fights I fought in St Louis one time and of course I seen her showtimes at his fights but I was fighting in St Louis and I was there early and she was at the hotel. I wasn't fighting or anything but she just came to the hotel I think she was just hanging out and I got to sit with her before like all the fighters even came into town I had to sit with her and then we stopped for a couple hours maybe 3-4 hours just talkin I got to know her and she's usually such an angel but at the same time she's a gangsta to it like Patty. She seems every day and the only thing the biggest thing I could compare to his if you ever seen that show up for Wayback called Touched by an Angel and I forget what her name is she's like the famous I black actress and and so we got we got clue to know I knew her and Tyron obviously wasn't who I would have chosen to take the belt from but is how long can you hold yourself back because being a chanted huge intolerance himself there's a huge difference between being a challenging the champion now and of course I need I needed to have my family in that I need to get them to that status to wear now I'm setting my daughter up I'm setting you like my everyone up for you know life better life forever and I couldn't continue to hold that back so yeah it was unfortunate that I had to take that from him and I kind of Innocence I felt like I was taken away from what he was doing for them so when I saw her walking backstage I just couldn't control that I just let my just let go and I just can't help but cry on her shoulders and there's a great is a great video what what is her name was women's snacks he's telling you congratulations he's just telling you that they're coming they're going to be coming for you so train hard yeah yeah and just like her attitude Matt it's it's beautiful man it's them it's amazing her character that she handled that mean does her baby or baby just lost and lost every round and it was a little predominant Victory by you and for her to treat you that way afterwards to shows on the amazing character yeah and it's Embraces you open arms it's all good it's all good baby look at that amazing I got it I got it made me cry when I saw it's making me cry now so I felt such a connection to that to her you know my mom is exact same way my mom would how big is sport is is well-liked is not old man that's just a regular fire you guys hate each other in your fighting know this was a competition you know this was two men that went in there tip for a competition and one guy one and you know you saw the aftermath is he the family receive each other man to love them and they love when people put all that b******* aside and I mean you guys had a lot of trash talk at the press conferences and there was a lot of that going on but that sells tickets and it's good for yeah you know this was two men that went in there tip for a competition in one guy one and you know you saw the aftermath is he the family receive each other man to love them and they love when people put all that b******* aside and I mean you guys had a lot of trash talk at the press conferences and there was a lot of that going on but that sells tickets and it's good for everybody and it's natural and normal but after was over it was nothing but respect</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> therapy on a regular basis and what what sort of an impact you think of me when you go over the results of the first therapy where you is almost immediately alleviate to of a lot of your feelings but you still are thinking about planning your next adventure in your next project full session the therapist recommended by would be a major breakthrough I'm asking you normally can't cry at all I haven't cried since I was 13 years I was only four different because that predates your War correspondent yeah yeah session the therapist cried I don't have two or three times in the cameraman cried and I still trembling what would have felt like a breakthrough and then never happened or dinner or something people are enjoying this out that's healthy smiling what is it like when you go to dinner with fellow War journalist out already good friends and we can talk the people to cover that country out of other people from you from your background for your country you should be talking to the people from that country a lot of John listed as possible in Afghanistan and Syria and Iraq have a pretty good life you stay in the 5-star hotel he eat well drink wine every night and each other and I think that defeats the point of reporting Sebastian Junger so there's levels to the involvement yeah the weather or how How Deeply you're immersed and it's it's it's completely upside down in the state because the TV Nugent TV news journalist yeah on the roof of the five-star hotel sometime I mean I think it's it's it's a way for the news networks to to enter claim credibility and then when you see them get deployed then focused on getting material from the war in these countries that focused on the on the two-way right from the team to me that during like deserts in the 90s there was always someone that was over there and it seemed like there was real threat and it was really going on but now everything seems to be done from the desk and you don't really see a lot of me and my right about that cruise you're allowed to spend the night and muscle you know you can go there and film the street and do some refugees who just escaped Isis territory but you can spend days on end of the freelance photographer the rice is that was spending face on in there and getting getting up the real stuff is it because the on-camera people be targeted I just think the risk is too high. For the entire crew of The Very well-known running around so when you're over there and you see these guys show up and you know that they're just going to be hanging out at the hotel and what is that feeling like Whiskey Tango Foxtrot be hot and you should be spending time with the people you'll covering and then if sometimes you can you can think you've finished with someone just go for dinner or tea I just by having normal human conversation you find out so much other stuff that you didn't do that to report on your that's that's what you have to be doing at 6 weeks weeks of getting closer to them and gain their trust yeah yeah yeah prices for shooting from the house and they were three or four families in the house so they are all County show Isis Isis guys went down and encourage the families to run towards us and just seeing moment of civilians fleeing and escaping Isis for the first time after 3 years when they turn the corner and saw rostand you that made it and I just collapsed the ground they were kissing the ground they were hugging each other three or four families in the house so they are all County show Isis Isis guys went down and encourage their families to run towards us and just seeing moment of civilians fleeing and escaping Isis for the first time after 3 years when they turn the corner and so rostand you that made it and I just collapsed the ground they were kissing the ground they were hugging each other for the moments you your</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> but do you think that being in these incredibly tense environment ramps life up in a way that you don't get outside of it like the Judiciary tribe Sebastian Junger he was the nicest most humble he's as a human to just a very genuine really there when you talk to him but that's sort of his take on it is that too much of it but his take on it was that these people are experiencing life in this incredibly extreme environment and then they come back to the the world is just doesn't feel real anymore so it's not it's not sweating when you die but it is real drum you'll sing life-and-death drama right in front of your face when you come back you think you really want to see this post and see this film try out this new restaurant and then you get back and you just don't care just feel fly yeah PTSD PTSD treatment get organized system apps that you part of that study about about rectal bleeding this this need to get MDMA legal but I've been in denial for years and I guess I'm helping and then see if he hasn't done MDMA recreationally before that I mean yeah I came of 18 what is the difference between a therapeutic environment peanuts you towards the right topic of conversation but always makes it makes you actually get to conclusions asking why is this happening why do I think this and put it back on me and make me put two and two together sometimes you listen to music sometimes you have a quiet therapy session of MDMA just enables you to get the benefits Elsa been therapy resistant I think the first round of the 70% of them the benefit someone considered PTSD free after after three month trial so during the three-month trial how many experiences do they have one a month one of my pimping them in in the past MDMA session and they were saying to him why you ruining your life your life your Healthy we want you to have a fun productive full life and enjoy your friends and enjoy your family and he said that gave him permission and that was what he needed he didn't even do the second two sessions wow what an interesting way of looking at of course is real yeah yeah a lot of people to come back from the war that lost friends have that horrible feeling that it should have been them that they're not as good as the person who died or that somehow or another them being alive is the reason why their friend was dead irrational thoughts or maybe I didn't really experienced it because I came out unscathed get my toes so there's nothing nothing nothing to complain about what was your number one issue I think the danger and 2/2 pleasurable things back here I mean like my cameraman in mosul Iraq yummy bics and it was us fighting we was stepping on baldi's to get through rooms at one point we were three or four Iraqis I was just trying to get to the river too costly to Isis positions and they got a radio message is a suicide bomber I got man running down the street towards you now so he stepped into this used to be a shop that's open up and smashed to bits and I sat down as the Two Soldiers tried to shoot is suicide bomber as running toward us and someone said I ate a tidy and the day before or two days before two French journalists and cut it should have been killed when they stop and ID trying to get out and having a monzon I might my cameraman just said you look bored offended like we got my on camera and I remember just looking so bored and I couldn't give a s*** about the suicide bomber that i e d I was just bored out of my brain and that's when I thought this is this is not a natural reaction to what's going on around you right now what did you think your natural reaction should have been I mean blood right in greising heart rate you know what did you think at the time was the cause of you being numb while it was happening I have a referral that much about PTSD I just want to become so used to this and unwanted things that came up in the in the in the Lost sessions I did was I didn't got important enough to get to get showing her and have Medics rush over to help me and maybe I have a couple take me out and you know I know that sounds ridiculous now but in these dramas wow be right next to an ID and not freaking out is pretty crazy yeah I wasn't scared I was just numb it doesn't even feel like bravery just feels like to give you give become stupid about the risk you're taking so talk me through this therapy so you fast for 24 hours you take the MDMA and then they just start talking to you about the things that are troubling you so you take 25 milligrams and then near the therapist would ask very brief question. Just knowing what direction to push me because of wine and I was PTSD I thought because of the job I do and because there was this kind of darkness in there I didn't get involved with anyone seriously for very long time and even so I'm not going to have a family and kids and house and dog I'm very alone in that first session after I resisted it for an hour and a half at what was really resisting it for a long time thinking of leaving a receiver but but there was this wave of relief of course you can of course you can have on it what it what is it about I mean I've done it but I've only done it once the is it just because of the fact that it just alleviates insecurity and allows you to look at things in the morning natural sense you look at everything as if we just talked about having coffee or water everything is it easy to think about on a dress and talk about I think I'll probably explain it badly but I think the science of it is you have five networks in your brain and and I was basically in fight or flight mode so much that was the only mode on you so even when I'm back in New York or something how to close behind me I'm expecting a confrontation I mean fight or flight mode all the time so that your brain is ignoring the other parts of your brain that provide context and the say that thing outside is just a car backfiring it's not an ideal someone shooting for the ndma just allows your brain to Enola parts of your brain to communicate again here and not just in that fight or flight mode so once you get out of that fight or flight mode you can then address things that you couldn't even begin to address before and once you've have these experiences three experiences their profound enough that you retain the benefits some of it looks like I'm in the 25% that still have PTSD off of 3 months but it still helps enormously I mean the next day they caught me to sit down and do a video diary and I was kind of saying this was Revelation and now I think it's 2 or 3 days when you have the but we still go to Moody Tuesday at 2 or 3 days yeah I mean to be at the Ecstasy they would have sold in London would have been poisoning breathe so I know they have a very positive results with this and are they planning on implementing this to the public in anytime short-term mean is this something that like people to listening this right now it's just going to be available to them fairly soon it looks like it should be legal by 2021-2022 the third round of officially FDA-approved trial starts soon the first one that involves people other than veterans and First Responders if that gets is good results for the first two trials which I'm sure it will then then I think it's going to be in because I feel they gave it breakthrough drug States us there's nothing that you know anyone can do to stop it will be legal by 2021-2022 that's very good news for ya it's so difficult for people to change perspective just to have a break from the the normal sort of momentum of your life and to be able to stop that gets is good results for the first two trials which I'm sure it will then then I think it's going to be in because I feel they gave it breakthrough drug States us there's nothing that you know anyone can do to stop it will be legal by 2021-2022 that's very good news for a lot of people that are suffering yeah it's so difficult for people to change perspective just to have a break from the the normal sort of momentum of your life and to be able to stop and analyze</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I don't necessarily think we're getting stupider or Dumber in this country in the world in general because the internet but we're definitely getting weirder in our perceptions of actual world events and I think every time something has mass shootings for instance like New Zealand every time one of these horrific tragedies takes place you see more and more division as I watch people fight over it on Twitter people blaming left-wing people people right-wing people people trying to find some reason and this one is particularly disturbing because it appears that at least one of the guys I don't know their names I don't know if they even released they withheld the names of these guys who've done this I haven't seen them so I thought of it one of them seems like he's trolling like he he think PewDiePie and and said that Candace Owens was his biggest inspiration and he's doing that I guess we could agree some people are saying that that okay sign is a white power sign I know we had this dispute with Tim pool where he was saying I guess it is a game that some people do play what is it called again but look for some game where if you look under the table and see someone doing up there a lot of punch or something something stupid like that I saw the Stephen Minnesota what he's doing up his Blazer and supposedly like this and people are saying that talking about Ron Levin right which is ridiculous like evidence evidence but this guy in custody is clearly making that symbol clearly so like what is he you know what he's like some troll murder some troll mass murderer and he's both he's both f****** with everybody and a cold-blooded ruthless killer people that were praying the Moscone gun down he's a few people in 17 the other way. That's yeah it's horrific across-the-board top-to-bottom it's it's horrific but it's also one of those things were like we see so many of these now that we're starting to get numb whether it's a Jewish synagogue whether it's a you know a Muslim temple whether it's a gay club wear it well whatever it is it's like you see so many of these mass murders now that's just weather the school movie theater like f*** man it's just it all like you were talking about when you're filming the news you're there you're watching the bullets fly by you hear them fly by your head and you are just watching it through the lens weird many many many many levels removed from that and we're sitting here trying to figure out what to do and we're not there we're not where the boat in the people that are there where the bullets take place they try to give you a description of it and even they barely can comprehend what happened but also as you said we're going straight to the argument about who to blame rather than Smith people spend as much time as they spend arguing on Twitter reading yeah I know people say fake news better if there was a website where you eat curated all of the like the bullet proof that's terrible way to describe a rock-solid investigative journalism jobs that are 100% ethical that you could completely rely on for an accurate assessment of what's happening because it is difficult for people and when people they rely on biased websites which many of them do with his bias to the laughter by into the right things get even more mad there's so many of them it's so easy to get so easy to reinforce your confirmation bias whatever you know whether it's left-wing or right-wing just find that website read the comments these are my people they think like me especially now that used to be with you yeah that's thinking I know what my gut feeling tells me I need to find a story a headline that justifies my gut feeling about this and that's as far as it seems to go know you as a journalist as a person who risks their life to bring this information to people how does this make you feel I mean is this part of the reason why you needed to do that MDMA therapy not just the fact that you were really are without better user without a better term shell right I mean you're you're that... There's something that comes out of that that's got to be very very difficult to recover from and overcome yeah but there's also the fact that you're going over there and bring the ship back and it doesn't seem to you don't seem to give a f*** you going to make some kind of difference and when that I think that's not going to happen that's I'm sure your work makes a lot of difference to the people that pay attention to it that I think we're overwhelmed by b******* I think it's everywhere there's what I mean bull should I mean like nonsense yeah you know Kim Kardashian psoriasis is in the front page of the CNN or something like that to her but you know what I mean like there's their stuff that people are concentrating on it's like Jesus Christ country of 360 yeah well it's very difficult to get people to watch documentaries on real-world events you can get them to watch documentaries on like a sex cult from Oregon or somebody Wild Wild Country I probably got 10 and a response they demand people in the public eye to talk about it and you know say thoughts and prayers or something like that but as soon as you say they want to make sure you are the coolest f*** isn't like how could you not be I don't understand this or is it just there just Kid Frost Infuse themselves or just lashing out at any Target they can find or anyone they can find and also I know the footage is available of guys ahead of time as easy as he shot everybody but but she's like that has been widely available for a long time now reminder for a couple days and then more news.. I mean completely pessimistic when you doing stuff for Vice on HBO you do get young people reaching out to you and say I know I did not want to be a photographer or talk to her or maybe that's an effects that's going to be felt down the room I don't know it feels like they're all that there is a generation of people growing up thinking I'm going to play by the numbers if you do have an effect I think by certainly has an effect I think a lot of this hasn't of fact I think it's very difficult to field that affect if you're not experiencing it personally I mean to just look out onto landscape and say how much of an effect is having on people it's hard like where you getting the feedback from how you how you gauge and whether or not this is changing people's perceptions will sometimes it feedback you do get is it on Twitter already having no impact but I think that's an argument for just not making the comment well there's a little bit of that and then you know I had Renee diresta on recently and she's done a lot of work covering all these various Russian troll farms and how they so how they essentially organize conflict online and you know that they set up these things we have like a pro Texas movement and they set him up across the street from a probe Muslim men and they do it on purpose and then they have these pro-lgbt movement things online today organized to attack certain people and certain groups diminish certain aspects and defied parts of the democratic party it's crazy when you hear about you it like that on top of all this you like what the actual news itself so difficult to disseminate it so difficult to figure out what should I pay attention to what's real and then you have this kind of s*** happening on top of that you like moving things online today organized to attack certain people and certain groups diminish certain aspects and defied parts of the democratic party it's crazy when you hear about your like that on top of all this you like walking out to just the actual news itself so difficult to disseminate it so difficult to figure out what should I pay attention to what's real and then you have this kind of s*** happening on top of that you like</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> in like you were saying earlier if they get you and you buy a new Hook Line &amp; Sinker they win if they get you to think we'll how much else is b******* they still win because you're looking at everything with sort of this painted lens now everything seems and that's probably the ultimate goal is to disrupt our social media environment and to sort of hijack the the natural conversation to take place I mean it's effective there's certainly no I was in Estonia last year and they've been targeted by the stuff for decades now 25% russian-speaking population in most of the news that they get is from Russian media right in around the Border they talk a lot about the extreme commitment to educating their citizens to make them realize that this kind of thing does happen this is what it usually looks like just ignore it let it go by and I don't think we are quite there yet I think that there's still plenty of people in the country who don't believe it happened or for some reason are completely incapable of separating the Russian social media influencer campaign happened from it means Donald Trump's election is illegitimate Oregon's Donald Trump colluded right those are very different statements Salud in order for someone somewhere to unsolicited go and support your candidacy so you can believe two things simultaneously Trump did not collude and that is an election is perfectly legitimate that this had no impact into that it still happened and that I think is I am consistently amazed at how hard that ability to hold those two ideas is for people they just believe that supporters of trump they absolutely cannot acknowledge that this operation took place and I or if they are passionate supporters of the far left it's more like an equivocation you know well we don't really know if they did it well well how do we know we know so that's where it plays out very differently depending on which part of the political Spectrum the issue that we have with cognitive dissonance we believe in someone or if we want something to win especially with our team or our person are on our side you know a guy I saw a lot of this when Donna brazile released her book detailing how the DNC server rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders and for Clinton or Sony through the ra Clinton supporters it just didn't want to believe it was like well why wouldn't you believe this woman like you believed her before when she was supporting Clinton and then when she leave now you know you won't believe her because it's inconvenient and we were real weird in our binary view we want things to be good or bad is 1 or 0 this is it and this is a super-complex issue it seems like they've been doing this for a long time and have gotten really sophisticated at it and I think there's a lot of people have been sucked into it that have no idea that's actually influence the way they they form their own opinions this is where it gets really strange people are so now you're and they're so easily manipulated many people are that something like this like a real good solid concentrated effort to try to Target these groups that have these very specific interest and really dig in and form roots and then go out he's so sophisticated to their approaches on one hand horrified and the other hand deeply impressed this is freaking you out when you had to let go over all these memes and you are actually laughing at them and you like God damn it you don't have to hand it to them and how do I properly recognition for the you know I don't think we do ourselves any favors by pretending and confident sophisticated adversary that is very capable those are determined that is constantly evolving and to treat that with the degree of respect it deserves I think that that's just common sense actually I know seems to be disproportionately Amplified or what new communities are popping up I just think it's I think the spread of information among people is just very interesting you know is it it's something that interests me a lot I think route psychology is really interesting ways that crowd psychology has transformed as the internet has kind of come into being particularly with things like the mass consolidation the ease with which we can Target people you know about that but the even in the decentralized internet there's always been propaganda there's always been crazy conspiracy theory is all the stuff but it's that you can reach the people who are likely to be receptive to it now and ask people self-selecting two tribes particularly in this country right now one of the things that's remarkable is the way in which once he starts looking into that tribe in this is the media in your ecosystem and you share it with your friends and Facebook and Shores at the people who see it or the people who are most likely to be receptive to it work with your friends in Facebook and Shores at the people who see it or the people who are most likely to be receptive to it or if you run the ad targeting you directly you know send it into the seeds of people most likely be receptive to it we have this interesting phenomenon where consolidation targeting and then these gameable algorithms mean that it's just this kind of information goes way farther away faster than it ever could it's in the past regardless of whether it's</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> who's who's seen all this stuff is this obviously Facebook has check this out I'm sure Twitter is aware what is a reaction pain and is there any sort of a concerted effort to mitigate some of the some of the impact that these have was when we started like we being independent researchers I guess people on the outside of the company's academics began to find the content you know really began to investigative journalists would identify the name of the page and then me and people like me would go and we would scour the internet looking for evidence of what was on that page so I found a bunch of stuff on Pinterest for example wrote about it guy by the name of Jonathan Albright found a crowdtangle data cache and that we got the names of the bunch more pages bunch more posts we had some really interesting stuff to work with the platforms were very resistant to the idea that this has happened and so as a result of that they were in there was a the first thing that was in 2016 when Trump gets elected Twitter it was crazy that night with people who work at Twitter saying oh my God are we responsible for this which is very Silicon Valley thing to say but what I think they meant by that was their platform it been implicated is hosting Russian Bots and fake news and harassment mobs in a number of other things and there was always a sense that it didn't have an impact it didn't matter and so this was the first time that they started to ask a question did it matter that statement has a very small percentage of whatever on Facebook the amount of information on Facebook and the idea that I could have sworn in so you have the platforms kind of the leaders of the platform's digging in and saying it's inconceivable that that this you know could have happened and as the research and the discovery begins to take place over the next nine months or so used you get to the one the tech hearings happened so I worked with a guy by the name of Christian heresies The 100 and he he and I started going to DC with the third fellow Rodger McNamee and saying hey there's so much does this body of evidence that's coming out here and we need to have a hearing to have Congress ask the tech companies to account for what happened to tell the American people what happened because what we're seeing here is outside researchers what investigative journalists are writing the things that were five just don't line up with the statements that that nothing happened in this is all no big deal and so we start asking for these hearings and actually myself and a couple of others then began asking them in the course of these hearings can you get them to give you the data because the platforms hadn't given the data so it was that lobbying by concerned citizens and journalists and researchers saying we have to have some accountability here we have to have the platforms account for what happened have to tell people because it had become such a politically divisive issue did it even happen and we felt like having them actually sit there in front of Congress and account for it would be the first step towards moving forward and away but but also towards changing the minds of the public and making them realize that what happened on social platforms matters and it was it was really interesting YouTube to be part of that as it as it played out because one of the things that Senator Blumenthal Senator said was actually said Facebook and Twitter have to notify people who engage with this content and so they are there's this idea that if you are engaging with propagandas contact you should have the right to know and so they started to push messages through emails all these people saying you engaged with this Russian and Facebook created a little field a little little page that told people they had like her followed us whole page so it was really trying to get at making the platforms accountable through email importance of Russia but that was one of the first steps toward saying like how do we make the platforms accountable because the idea that platform should be accountable was not a a thing that everybody agreed on in 2015 and they were having this conversation about Isis and that's where there's this the through line here which is and it does Connect into some of the speech issues to which is what kind of monitoring and moderation do you want the platforms to do and when we were having this fishing rod Isis there was a not-insignificant collection of voices that we're really concerned that if we moderated Isis trolls on Twitter beheading videos ever heard of universal agreement that the beheading video should come down but if we took out what we're called the Isis Fanboys which were like 30-40 thousand Accounts at their Peak that we would rather said document called the Isis Twitter census for anyone who wants to actually see research done on understanding Twitter Network in 2015 there was a sense that like one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter and if we took down ISIS Fanboys where we stifling their freedom of speech freedom of expression and like goodness what would come next and that when you when you look at that that fundamental swing that has happened now and 2018-2019 the others that same narrative because originally directions taking place and then now there's a feeling that it's kind of swung too far in the other direction but the original conversations were really how do we make Twitter take responsibility for this and legally they aren't responsible for it right there legally indemnified against the responsible for any of the content on their platforms none of the platforms are called not responsible to have the right to moderate but not the obligation to moderate because they're indemnified from responsibility so the question becomes now that we know that these platforms are used for these kinds of farms and they are used for this kind of interference where is that balance what do we want them responsible for monitoring and moderating and how do we how do we recognize that that is occasionally going to lead to incorrect attributions closing accounts and things like that so weird conundrum right now or they don't they're trying to keep everything safe and they want encourage people to communicate on the platform so they want to keep people from harassing folks but because of that they've also they've got these algorithms and they they tend to miss very often like this whole learn-to-code Fiasco where people getting banned from for saying learn-to-code which is about as Preposterous as a guest I think they'll learn to code Fiasco is going to be the Tipping Point where a lot of people in the in the future when they look back on when did the heavy-handedness could become over-reach learn-to-code because we in Jesus Christ mean that you can't say learn-to-code mean I look at my mentions I mean on any given day especially like yesterday I had vaccine proponent it seems like what was really disturbing to me was like the vast majority of the comments were about vaccines and so few about these uncheck diseases that are running rampant in poor communities which is the most disturbing aspect of the conversation to me that there's diseases that Rob you of your intellectual capacity that are extremely counted as many as 10% of people in these poor neighborhood tab almost no discussion it was all just insults and and you know you f****** chill in the snow my mentions are going to be interesting but I think that one of the challenges for the platforms as a lot of things start out like a watch that play out Covington Catholic was another thing that I mean God be offended but then there was the other accounts that kind of took it that step further and began to throw in like the ovens and the other stuff if you're trying to assess the just the content itself like if you start doing keyword bands but the flip side is if you you know that this is the challenge of moderating its scale which is where and what what side do you come down on to come down on saying like 75% of people with #learn-to-code or just you know not doing anything incredibly offensive and then the 25% who are they really change the tone of the overall campaign in the hashtag for the entire community in that Ricci Twitter I think come in with the more heavy-handed and just shut it down kind of thing I don't I don't know that there's anything answer I think that we are you know it even today it was the latest kerfuffle Elizabeth Warren got an ad taken down on Facebook and there was a whole conversation about was Facebook censoring Elizabeth Warren I I personally didn't think that it read like censorship but read more like a cell phone like she had a picture of Facebook's logo in the in the image and their that violates the ads terms of service and the reason behind that is actually because Facebook doesn't want people putting a bad that have the Facebook logo in it because that's a scam people right that's a great way to probably just like an automated a little Assumption of good faith and so little Assumption of such extreme anger and polarization and no assumption that the platforms are censoring with with every little kind of moderation snafu that it it makes it I think I don't know how we have the conversation in a way that's healthy and look towards Solutions as opposed to the left screaming that it's sensor the right screaming that it censored the platforms you know trying to get around how do we both moderate on not moderate which is a deposition span I think that don't have any good and millions of posts and a couple thousand people working for the organization and then algorithms can people learning this trying to keep up and that's where things like learn-to-code and people are so outraged and pissed off because when they do get banned they feel like they've been targeted what do you mean really just ran into some code and then it's really hard to get someone to pay attention to your appeal because there's not enough people that are looking at these appeals and there's probably millions of appeals everyday it's almost impossible this person is harassing me and I'm demanding moderation and nobody's doing anything about it so it's definitely I think gotten worse it's going to look back at 2016 and wonder how much of the where we are now is in part because not a whole lot happened in 2016 and 2016 I look at it I look at it now particular has it evolved into this conversation about Free Speech public squares and what the new kind of infrastructure for speech what rights we should expect on it it's a really tough I just assumed that it's people asking for car wash right to harass and saying you know how do we balance that I think Jack and vagina or saying this on your show how to maximize the number of people who are involved make sure that all voices do get hurt without being unnecessarily heavy-handed and moderating a thought or content and instead moderate behavior and instead moderate particular types of a thought or content and instead moderate behavior and instead moderate particular types of signatures of things are in authentic or things that are coordinated and looking at again gets to disinformation to rather than trying to police this information by looking at content really looking Instead at actions and behavior and account authenticity and dissemination patterns cuz a lot of the worst</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> where is whether it's conspiracy theorist communities or terrorists or or you know Russia Iran State the state-sponsored actor has the domestic ideologues I have tried to always say like here is the specific kind of forensic analysis of this particular operation and then here is what we can maybe take from it and make make changes we've seen some of that begin to take shape and so I grateful to have had the opportunity to work towards connecting those dots and work towards having this conversation meaning meaning helping people understand what's going on I think I am not I am most concerned about the as this gets increasingly easy to do through things like chatbots you do now there's the if you seen the the website that this person does not exist. Com technology called pictures of people faces of people and so this website is that when you go to it it pulls up a battery goes to this person does not actually exist it says it down at the bottom there so these are not real people and so we have increasingly sophisticated chat technology we have increasingly sophisticated like you're not going to detect that image somewhere else that old trick of like right click and look and see if you're talking to someone with a stock photo that goes right out the window as stuff like this gets easier and easier to do what is it like to live in a world where so much of the internet is fake and I do think for your point about identity that there will be groups of people that sell select into communities where identity is mandatory you know where we're this is who you are and you have some sort of verification versus people who choose to live in the world of drink from the firehose take it all in and try to filter it out yourself evolving Technologies and I don't necessarily feel you know particularly optimistic in the short-term I think that ultimately does like we change has a society to a large extent and in response to this we think about you know they're going to be some pics of the platforms are going to be able to undertake they're going to be working to get better at detecting this stuff maybe you know the adversary will evolve hopefully we get better at detecting it as it involves but it's I think we found them definitely change like people become more aware that this is a thing they are more skeptical that does change are there are ways of interacting with each other but I feel like that is going to be the direction that this goes there's the more like you know the thing that keeps me up at night would be more the the ease of of turning us from us social media problem until like a real world war problem meaning as an example back in 20 teen on the first things internet research agency dead September 11th 2014 they created a hoax saying that Isis had attacked a chemical plant down in Louisiana it's called the Columbia the Columbia chemical plant hoax as I think there's a Wikipedia article about it now but what happened was they created a collection of websites they created fake sand and mock-ups Twitter account text messages it went to local people radio station Collins you name it everything to create the impression that a chemical Factory had just exploded in Louisiana and there was some attribution Tyson this is done on September 11th so this is the kind of thing where this actually did go viral like I remember this happening not as a social media researcher I just remember it actually being pushed into my social media feed so you have these we didn't know that it was in a research Agency for year-and-a-half after but this is the kind of thing where you look at parts of the world you look at parts of the world that aren't the US like their recent drama between India and Pakistan and you can see how these kinds of things can go horribly horribly wrong if the wrong person is convinced that something has happened or if there's a xenomorph this leads to a riot or if this leads to real-world action I think that's one of the main fears as this gets better and better the video face get better the</div>

guys are doing this now they're putting like shoots up on interwebs you know with some physical activity prior to ordering which are good but I am pretty sure I am you know I made it cool yeah it's it's just such a smart thing to think of if you're if you really want to train the way you train and really want to think about you know like tactical situations and real-world application I mean such a great way to go about doing it and is he looks exciting in front of me I have done it but I'm sure it's good I talk a lot how do you how do you stabilize a guy when they have Parkinson's which is that's good that's what I showed this guy trick was his name see if I can remember his name doesn't matter but you 77 years old and he said well I could either come to your course and train or lay on my couch and die cuz he likes to shoot anytime but I have to modify the course to here try try try to set him on by the cooler and then I used during strips are they hold up a target one by too long I

		<div class="paragraph"> Lancaster Lindsay gym and the other person that you did this with this whole project Helen pluckrose from England when I first read it my first inclination to that I had two reactions one was a huge laugh I laughed really hard and then I said Thank God somebody expose this on the wall and so now I am a renegade gender scholar and I write nonsense about genitals that's primarily what I do manage a business at home so I got to Academia teach philosophy Portland State University and Jim years ago we collaborated with written a number of things over the years and at some point it just came to be we had to do something about this it was just too ridiculous and it was translating into the real world and so we collaborated and here we are will it explain what you did and what was ridiculous what we're talking about what was ridiculous is there's many fields of studies that you can get legitimate degrees in that are absolutely Preposterous I've literally filled with nonsense that taught by nonsense people who live in these nonsense Bubbles and then they give these reason these people go out in the real world actually and they infect things their Ridiculousness infect certain is particularly tech industry businesses like you you see it in the more and more and so everybody understands add that your dash off for like Washington poster some magazine or whatever this is a thing like academics work their careers to write one or two of these a year and so they're really hard to write their supposed to be hard to get published so we were up 20 of them in 10 months and seven of those published and then we got lost we five or six more would have gotten in what's the difference between getting accepted and getting published so the process with everything and I can give you is really slow and a lot of people don't know this so you send off this article the editor looks at it and the editor either gives a thumbs-up or thumbs-down if they give it a thumbs up and goes off to peer reviewers and that process takes months often as long as I would one pay for those eight months under peer review so the reviewers look at it they try to figure out if the arguments are good they try to figure out if the research is good evaluate that they give extensive comments they send it back to you then you have to revise it according to whatever they say make it better is what's supposed to happen they made ours crazier and so then and then the editor will either send it back to the reviewers to see if it was good enough for the LG evaluated themselves depending on where it stands and then they'll make a decision as to whether or not to accept it or reject it or ask for more revisions and then they accept it that means the journals ready to publish it but then the publishing process requires all the typesetting proofing all the stuff that goes into making it professional for an academic journal and that can take months and Publishing is the coin of the realm like that's it so the idea is one paper every year in the humanities probably so if you that's how you credential yourself that's how you get 10-year which is a job for life that's how you get to teach people these ideas for then as you said go out into the workforce you know five six years later and in infect everybody with total silliness so the age the gold standard. View so we saw a tremendous problem can we tell people some of the titles of these dog humping in Portland Oregon it was called how did it go is it called queer performativity and rape culture rape culture names go back a long way that's Judas Butler's whole thing was that gender who didn't Butler Butler is probably the most influential feminist scholar their gender scholar actually I should say it's been in maybe the last 30 years she's she's big-time and so she had this whole thing that gender is performative it's something you perform it's not something that ain't to do with reality Urban dog parks in Portland Oregon why is it retracted because it's causing them to rape culture and queer performativity claimed to have closely examined the genitals of just under $10,000 to their sexual orientation so it's totally insane dogs humping incidents and how they they beat female dog they didn't beat male dogs should I put one of the papers that we may do you know the other paper that grows one also they had the whole thing like if a male dog humps another male dog especially men would freak out and break it up yeah stop that because that's the queer performativity part we told him exactly what they wanted to hear and we gave them bogus statistics to fuel what they already wanted to believe we started off with the idea that what we wanted to get to is a conclusion and then we made up all the crap in between to get to it in the conclusion was feminism should train men the way we train dogs so that we can get rid of rape culture help put them on leashes and it's right on the paper it's all day unfortunately we cannot put metalisha is not politically feasible to put metal leashes didn't get published the journal said that this was exemplary scholarship and gave it an award it's not great so it's it either is greater it's not great like why they retracting it were bogus so what you were right well bodybuilding bodybuilding where people comment display their fast before the audience and we didn't manufacturing statistics for that and they love that they thought it you know one line that paper was a fat body is a built body like I wholeheartedly agree or something like that Jonathan Coulton make fun of anything to do with social justice right and so if you want any kind of things that don't have anything to social justice that's good so if we wanted to make fun of men that's great if you want to make fun of white people that's great if you want to make fun of anything to do with social justice that's a problem we went into talking about how Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart have the right idea but then the journal was like straight white male Nuance around that make it clear that their position is white men even though they're on the side of social justice it's not quite good enough you know actually on them for publishing it yeah so it's so funny how racist you can be as long as you're racist against white people that's what we saw is that as long as you are going up the river against privileged than you really just get away with some nasty stuff you can generalize you know like those the hippie times and that's lived there from age 7 to 11 and it kind of formed a lot of my opinions about people like the who gives a s*** part of my my my appreciation for any group what whatever it is real whether it's race or gender or sexual orientation and I just I don't understand it from either way I certainly don't understand it from a racist perspective racism that's condone because it's racism against white people very strange now they co-opted the Civil Rights Movement the good name of the Civil Rights Movement is kind of the brand that they ride on you know they're fighting Against Racism they're fighting against sexism and misogyny excetera and the thing is is that's not really what's going on here they've actually tapped into this to throw around the term this postmodern notion that everything in society has to do with power dynamics and the power dynamics have priests understood in terms of groups and how those groups have traditionally held power and exercise power and so immediately it becomes stuck in this idea that it's all about this group of that group and how they relate to one another I don't mean like hey let's get along really I mean like white people are imagined to always be over black people and therefore you know there's always has natural power Dynamic of of of oppressor vs. oppressor and this is stuff that came straight out of this weird postmodern philosophy were dissatisfied French philosophers in the 60s you know it's all in the all the stuff you're talking about was going down they saw this stuff and they said wow you know okay power dynamics are the thing because I should go back a step to the postmodern philosophers like Foucault and all of this got all hooked up on power because they were too satisfied with seeing what they called Grand narratives Christianity capitalism Marxism it's all these huge you no explanations for how the world works and said you know they're not working look how bad communism failed look how there's so much you no bulshit coming out this or that from religion it's not working we need to just get rid of all of it we're going to deconstruct this we're going to break it down to its power dynamics and then we're going to look at it in terms of who has masterhood over over who who's depressing whatwears dominance and it's just kind of grown it got picked up in the in the academic culture in the 1960s that's how old is stuff is and then it took his huge turn in the 1990s and get really vicious and that's where it really getting us when it turned intersectional actually that was during the birthdays that's that's when the political correct and kind of blew up Yasmin all the stuff was coming out so that would have been you know late 1980s is really when all of this political correctness stuff started coming out of the academy and then a few years later you see it coming all over politics which typically what happens is starts in the academy a few years later it leaks into the culture and politics are Media or detect sector now whatever happens to be The Simpsons are real problem it's so bizarre cuz here's the thing if they missed the mark and it's not funny it won't work and then it'll be a bad show and no one will like it but if it's funny there has to be something about it that people find ironic spiracle to have to be something about of the people are enjoying that has 2.2 some truth and the denial of this and it's dead you know that there's subjects that are off-limits and social justice should never be attacked like to agree to that is it's so it's so Preposterous this is life we're talking about this is literally of Life all the various strange things in the spectrum of human behavior and and all the things you encounter in life and two segments and limit what is and is not what was off-limits it's not off limits based on race is it a person can't control at all you're just born white what you're born in oppressor but you're black or white male you're a f****** piece of s*** and otherwise write all of us acting on behalf of other people in you know you're speaking for them so you know I've assumed power that was reproducing the same power Dynamic that rewrote mine comp whites would replace Jews with white man and you literally took the actual and put it in the war use with the word white men and they accepted what we had two papers that did mine, so I took the whole document on online and we just search the word Jew start picking sentences and paragraphs so what was it that at the end of something like if we don't combat whiteness it's going to be the funeral wreath for mankind yet they didn't they didn't accept that paper though because that paper turns out was written from the perspective of a white lesbian who hated her on whiteness and they said that it was positioning her as a good white and because she's making herself out as a good way again allyship isn't as all it's cracked up to be she was making a problem she should have really been forwarding the ideas of the black Scholars that she's read way more and not talking about herself so much even though it was a paper design to be talking about it because that was what Hitler did so that's what we had to do no the other Minecon paper was about feminism and what we did was he took the chapter chapter 12 we took the chapter where he says this is why we should have the Nazi party and what is expected of people who are going to be part of it and we took out our movement or party Nazi party in the chapter but everywhere he's like our movement took that output in intersectional feminism and then modified the theory around it so that it would fly and that's what they call it Siri I love a feminist Theory I love and they throw that round are you saying that you're saying things like once you say that you're you're good like you said you can have the ridiculous weather today it was something like Southpark how it's been laundering racism into society and making ever be comfortable with racism and that's why everything so racist and people are shooting Jews is because South Park made it normal to see you know South Park came out and started doing these themes what how does it track statisticians can do kind of amazing things with that stuff but they're not doing that they're not testing it and then testing it right there concluding it and then using Siri to do so and they're why don't they test it will if they tested it and this is I'm not making this up you won't believe me but this is true if they tested it in the test showed that their hypothesis was wrong they would say that the test was racist but the test is condoning racism and that's why it didn't give him the desired result they're two different things so I'm not exactly sure how you would test that but conceivably you could gather data survey data and see how attitudes of change maybe you could track kind of Articles kind of events that are coming out you could kind of pair that up with what's been shown on South Park South Park and track down with attitudes I mean theoretically that the problem why because they are not joking they literally believe that use of language creates the power dynamics that Define society so South Park using language and imagery that creates the power Dynamic that makes people more comfortable being racist boom Theory done no test needed no even attempt last the test itself will be racist unless I confirm the hypothesis agenda and then mention the word laundromats could reform gasparin Heather talked about idea laundry I think that's important for listen to these hypotheses they treat they don't treat them hypotheses and then they write up a paper paper like we're saying is the absolute gold standard of academic work they send the paper off the reviewers in our cases made her papers crazier every single time so they push it further into the ideology or the madness how does a review or do something like that what input should problematize allyship if we're going to if we want a paper published we've got a problem with has a lifestyle of that word problem that I think everything is everything problematize everything dog parks we're so we wrote this paper saying that straight men are generally transphobic meaning in particular is a their kind of Niche we're definition that you see on the internet and activists sometimes that they aren't interested in having sex with trans people who have penises trans women who have a penis in particular and so we said well that's the kind of transphobia and clearly the reason that they might be transphobic is because they don't practice putting things in the butt so if they start putting stuff up their butts in particular so you can imagine what we're saying that you put into the back door Peg them through exposure therapy you know you start small and work your way up you can remediate transphobia Olmec must transphobic so self penetrating and are having your girlfriend Peg you you can be less transphobic and not even straight people so they don't really apply so then we have these eight interviews with straight man with conservative and he's just so we can just put in like you know crazy things why don't why weren't there more conservatives participating so I was like well I'm going to run with this thing we invited six and only one accepted into kind of summarize why in the world is it in the paper in the words of one I don't want to be a part of some stupid liberal study about shoving things up your butt going into the back door right there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but it also makes you you know susceptible for counters in a way like like when when Connor was fighting Floyd my biggest concern for Connor was not speed or counterpunching it was the distance that you're going to be able to counter and when when Connor caught Floyd a couple at a couple times in the beginning it was a left uppercut that was shocking to me because I was surprised that he had boxing counter punching speed listen to hack compared to a kick sport I would say if we're standing what two three feet away from each other and kickboxing is 1 and 1/2 in boxing cut that distance in half and still have the counter punching a belly was impressive I mean lower level boxing in the gyms like that is when you get up to that level two different great that's what I'm eating like he's better at boxing than Stephen Hawking isn't astrophysics you might be right you know the car does count even though I probably shouldn't I mean was a real boxing match but it was a guy that had zero professional boxing that he did get tagged Conner Kent punch he's a good fighter he's a very good mixed martial arts fighter but the thing about Floyd is that Floyd is the best and not getting it is better his whole career can a man 5 times it's the end of the fourth round up the other ones are early at Judah Red Hook Ollie's fidget journalist back on days to cover like Ali and his fight this weekend so I kind of came up you know generationally ruin boxing is awesome best moments the best Jiu-Jitsu guys have going for him is that he's not physically powerful like the best Jiu-Jitsu guys are smaller people right because the smaller people learn how to use leverage and technique in the cat muscle things where the fuel Augusta 250 lb gorilla you some cake call player to kneel like man what words book Jiu-Jitsu yeah you don't ever have to be on your back right now like seriously I'm really enjoying in he's a big guy with a card on the ground and then when they find themselves on their back a lot of turtles anything a little guy has to learn perfect Precision technique because they don't have that extra size or the NBA road to just smashed uncanny somebody says it's just raw power and its heat Floyd is all precision and he's all like one of the most fun things from you is watching Floyd in the first round and watching him take away your life like I like to see him take away a Fighter's confidence that Mosley was going to get off with the Japanese he thought that he was going to get off and there's ammo even in the first round I know he gets tagged with that overhead right but there's a moment we're mostly mostly Pops that the left jab and Floyd sees it steps back slightly and then come straight over to right and that moment you could see Shane know that there's nothing he can do because Floyd has time to jab and countered it directly so now your job is done now dropped off one of your arm just cut it off now you got to open right you're not going to do anything to me just right I mean I got the Philly shell it's over I love f****** Floyd man what you learned how to fly Panda or is his uncle rather I shall of watches Uncle fight he would fight on like ABC like whatever television shows having boxing on television during the day and he was ABC I don't remember but yeah I like that family he grew up boxing and you also got to see the things that people do wrong you know and here's another thing that boy that's going for him conditioning undone family is always in tremendous shape always just always in shape when you see me the McDonald's he said she'll think regularly 4% carbohydrates eating sugar or drink a soda after workout he's working out for 2 and 1/2 hours so you can take some sugar f****** place, New York are we going to be my biggest competition to Shred-it Shred-it what is this Johnson he always eats McDonald's he's doing it while he's working out right here do that it's all in how much you exercise</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what is it when it gets in through their ears like is it getting an easy or is it something and I just cringe to anticipate the comments like if they're saying something that I know to be inaccurate if it's wheelhouse like sometimes people say something and I'll just say that's not that's not true here's why it's not true goofy s*** and it just happens to be something I know a lot about yeah and then I have to stop it yeah okay that makes sense to just be themselves to figure out how to get you to be yourself that's what a lot of this is great I want everybody to great by guest mother intellect yeah like Elon Musk was intimidating talk to him today cuz you realize what a champ you are dummy man how to make a cut of that like your electric cars Rockets into space is drilling holes into the ground had to dumb down with me kitty solarcity's right and he basically is opening up to you about how he's not happy right this moment where he's like want to be me this is exact words you want to be me you would want to be me that means he doesn't want to be him on some level he does and he's with these guys that we admire because they have all these brilliant ideas and we're putting this Matrix of role in the success Matrix on some level right where it's like get things done good. They're getting sent that right I wonder if if he's champus in that he's potentially wasting his life being upset or are miserable when he could be focusing on things that would give them Joy at being a chimp is being so smart that you don't even try to just be happy and focus on your happiness I don't necessarily think he's unhappy but I do think that he puts himself in the sea patients where are the amount of stress that he absorbs is almost unfathomable like we was trying to get the Tesla Model 3 production schedule ramped-up him sleeping on the floor of the factory and working literally working like 19 20 hours a day. That's untenable you can only do that for short periods of time but I think that what I was saying about Kanye West applies to him tenfold he's he's got a power output that's extraordinary different than first person that's one thing she was talking about when he was young I mean you could probably put him on some sort of a what but I don't know what the Super Genius spectrum is what's what's Albert Einstein's what's with this guy with that guy he's in there somewhere in this crazy Realm of the way your brain works like I think the brains are like all the body parts some people born with little tiny dicks and some people got giant Hogs and that's just a fact and I think that has a giant hog but brain just works better it just it just is operating on a level that you and I can't we can't comprehend but I never vetted a goddamn thing in my life but I'm driving around Elon Musk are you know that mother f***** made a car and that's like some shity doesn't decide you know his car thing is like happy invented PayPal by the way while he's doing the car he shoot cinespace drilling holes into the ground he's trying to move traffic on the ground here he's making solarcity's like he's he's hooking up Australia with his massive solar panel power battery plant in a f****** fix their energy needs he's he's on another level no doubt on another level it's a different thing but so is he happy Joe I don't know imagine Yeah Yeahs happy right is he is he happy and bursts went well I guarantee you when I saw him he was shooting his f****** flamethrower my my bouye he was happy before yeah right out here you can't tell me he's not happy bro you know what he's happy as f*** cuz he's a kid man we're in a lot of ways and every culture people hire him to consult right and like America's code is it's the verb is to do when the time is now right and we're just kids at the end of the day right it's like everything we were up big tits in America right, Papa plastic surgeries big tits and like France most popular product surgery is getting tips for reduced right everything about them is like Precision in like the food on the plane it's at the end of the day it's like everything we were up big tits in America right big most popular plastic surgeries big tits and like France most popular project surgery is getting tips for reduced right everything about them is like Precision in like the food on the plane</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we figured out a way Carson now you know that right that's the difference that's the shift that's why Netflix can't even compete Netflix is done and they're going to shoot down a $5000000 helicopter and eventually Russian just won't be able to compete right Netflix pays a hundred million dollars to Aaron Sorkin or whoever to make a TV show right to distract you for 2 hours running you to pay 0 million dollars to Joe Rogan and Jamie to make a podcast to distract you for 2 hours everyday Netflix cannot compete for the different animal you got to realize first of all I have way more people than just me they also are putting together something that requires a lot of money to create your if you enjoy films if you enjoy show like Ozark or stranger things on for narrative takes a lot of money to make those things are special effects where's my hammer people and makeup people and there's a lot of directors and producers and 10 square with people Russian threats to there's a reason they paid us terrible throat doesn't matter if it's terrible at Jamie but most to most viewed shows on Netflix right now Netflix doesn't on Facebook do they have on-board how many subscribers do they have that are paying $9 as far as I know they don't share that information subscribers but they're 10 billion in debt they just talk on another 2 billion right arguing know if you look at TV right what the great this this this past years and TV right the OJ trial on FX what is that I remember I was when the OJ thing came out they killed it which is another thing like that ladies and gentlemen is a fuckload of income coming in but they're spending a lot too because they're trying to their trying to overtake all the others and then they got Jeff Bezos you know Captain money bags up there a Scrooge McDuck fright is trying to do the same thing Facebook about witches where I saw you write on but he's doing something that's even more weird because there's no one watching her shows yeah there's a ton of fucken shows on Amazon that f****** no one's watching I would like to see their numbers cuz I bet they have some shows that they might spend a million dollars to Megan have like four viewers SmartPost like you to approach this exact opposite right we're like we're just going to create the stuff that we think people want to watch where YouTube doesn't create much did a little and they found the pay wall like my thing my guess would you to visit there waiting for Netflix you know that scene in the movie where like that somebody caught in like a enclosed space and water starts coming in and the water gets right up to like his lips you know he's like he's trying to breathe little bit more and I think YouTube this is going to be the one to pour the last drop of water such a different thing I think you're talkin about two totally different things because Netflix is never aim to be a user created content streaming site right right they're not but at the end of the day it's just a distraction I think I think that's when we got to start looking at content as right is it is just raw distraction and Netflix occupies a space for distraction that smaller than YouTube so I can watch a 2-hour thing on YouTube at home on my TV I can watch a 2-minute thing on the bus says I'm going to work on YouTube you know I can watch a 15-minute you know peace like blog or some like that I can watch all the whole Spectrum Netflix I'm really just watching at home or like a phone on a trip you know what I mean is really I'm not watching a 2-minute thing on Netflix for now don't get me wrong absolutely the s*** for now right but if I was being if I'm putting my money on it I would say if I'm Facebook I buy it and then imagine have your Facebook feed you just watch the show and then you get to share it immediately on your Facebook so I was Facebook I'll be super careful about buying anything cuz I think the government's been thinking about breaking them up for a while at least have Beth Warren is already talking about that that's one of the parts of her platform and running for president is breaking up Apple breaking up Facebook breaking up Twitter she wants to break up all these things she thinks are monopolies what's your feeling on it please f*** what's Disney takeover of 21st Century Fox takes place I think next week 20th saboya they're going to put out their own stream everything they've just bought like everything except for Fox News and Fox Sports took over all of their production movie facilities like 5,000 people might be losing their job because investing in something that you're going to take off I got to build up a brand and they were going to remove it from you own it all the kids movies facets like a few people never became billionaires that's what's happening right now in entertainment Fame being about distance or done distance distance like I'm Johnny Depp I'm going to go to way to my little home somewhere in the Alps and you will see me twice a year. I'm weird on Marlon Brando f****** done like the days of the days of like Fame being about distance or done distance distance like I'm Johnny Depp I'm going to go to way to my little home somewhere in the Alps and you will see me twice a year or not I'm weirdo Marlon Brando</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is working out right here yeah dude you can do that it's all in how much you exercise with them now that's not all he's eating healthy food on top of that just exercised his comedy in FIFA online he's a great follower on Twitter it's hilarious that you know don't put so much money into your outfit when the blinds in your house for $30 like he'll just a little things like his my guesstimation is this is his Combi like remember you saying yeah yeah she used to sleep at the arena or at least at the stadium he when he played he was obsessed with it he loved the sport he was talking about fighting Anderson Silva at one time stop him hitting the pads or hitting the back. Cuz I think he has real martial arts skill like legit martial arts athlete but in small who's the small numbers well Jon Jones is absolutely an elite athlete 205 lb 250 different weight what you could be right he could be a heavyweight he could bulk up and go up to heavyweight but he's got like weird cap genetics is calves are tiny fry things you don't have to jump that much in MMA and he can hit you in the face with a flying me for anything but what he knows how to do and what he can do physically in terms of his wrestling right and his ability to close the distance to smash guys yet he's an elite athlete but I think he could he could have done that his his two brothers play NFL. moves hands down over dick Euless see the duty sparring now we don't know s*** about him being that guy might be terrible you know I mean the guy didn't want to try to go to the body he didn't duck in know what someone's moving their head around like that just smashed the ribs you go right after the arms hit those arm when a guy is a super Elite wrestler you think you're going to do something but he knows you think you're going to do something so he does it you do what you were going to do he anticipates what you're going to do as an answer to that and then you have to regroup and he's already moving on to step three I just too many steps that he's ahead of you can there be a guy like with him that you don't engage on the ground like you just kind of jab stay on the outside run mental toughness or punishment most guys would have probably gone unconscious there but stylebender like a garlic style Bender would be one of the worst f****** nightmares for a guy like Ben askren for a super difficult to take down and on the feet is not to do anything stupid to move forward and try to grab ahold of him and you just going to eat knuckle sandwich Charlie walk off the pain you switch stances can starts to hurt wacky didn't recognize you switching stances he talks to other leg now both your legs are f***** up and come down the middle with a need of the solar plexus and it's just a matter of doing his game in his install Bender's game his game is keep the fight standing f*** you up and then Ben askren's it's grab ahold of you f*** you up right Brown f*** you up it's a matter of like who who's better at the weak aspect of the other person's game right yeah yeah how can I take advantage and no one could be the best of everything so some anime math is a notoriously difficult thing to do like say say if if Jamie beats me but I beat you but you BJ me we always say that with liking of Southlake by foxing that Styles make fights only go so far with mme it's it's because the Sports more comprehensive cuz there's more skills does more different things happening football compared to basketball made me sick there's more there's more tools that can be used in here via set what's going on basketball the Warriors are going to beat any team 427 games I don't know s*** about basketball or football so I'm just guessing you could be a superstar like there's no one position in football that can change the game Elite athletes body right I want to see a dude is built like tomorrow is mine yes the UFC welterweight champion yeah that's literally at you looking like he's not an elite athlete looks like a UFC champion yammy what makes that guy so special sometimes tools is a is yeah Ben askren similar to he's got a little muffins you can get a little bit Ben askren's got even worse pull up a picture of man down and wait Ben askren and he's got it like that I don't give a fuk so much better as a wrestler that everybody else is f***** give give me an image underneath that that's from one FC he looks even worse now yet winning yeah I mean that is not the ideal male combat body you would think that's not what the ideal combat body looks like but f*** s*** out there's a picture of him would come down there but he's got a shirt on that was my lucky for him but like this is just some guys that okay Francis ngannou is a perfect example some guys look like a destroyer they just look like a destroyer and got it was like 652 hunting maybe more than six have the the work ethic to be the greatest because it comes so easy Sarah likes so funny hanging out and they're okay on stage and it's become so easy to them they don't hit the gym in like maybe it's you need that like Jordan almost like sociopathic approach to it you have more like we're having this conversation earlier is like Jordans happy abducted abducted inducted into the Hall of Fame are you about to tell me he was an abducted in plain sight and I was like well if this guy f**** Jordan to get into the Hall of Fame and he was talking about writers he's talking s*** about writers picture of you said buy shoes looks pretty well he had a furnace right at that competitive dry you know in like I feel like I feel like that happens when you don't derive Joy from what you do you know like you drive Joy from the outcome you're obsessed with outcome you know like at least for me everything before was outcome right it was like I'm good if if I get a special I'm good if run doing these things are I'm good if I kill in the second I was stripped of the opportunity to do those things I actually found like I loved creating more and then whatever the outcome was was extra so I think it's a happier path I think so too but I don't know if it's the path to Greatness as much as the path of the psychopath especially comes the competitive something about the best athletes they all they have a f****** self-loathing they and they also have an ego and they have this this anger towards the competition like if you beat them but they would they would say that if you be joining the game with hole that he thinks he's not good enough that he knows he can get you don't quit motherfuker I'm going to get you and why does he need to get you because it's like he needs to confirm something may be right I need to confer with constant confirmation I need to confirm confirm confirm baseball that m*********** going to prove you're the hardest thing in sports hit a baseball hardest f****** thing and he just jumped from basketball to baseball in which people act like he was trash he wasn't even that bad he hit like 250 but we're talking about at the hardest thing in sports is hitting a f****** based on the fact that he I mean there's a bunch of rumors and why he even went into baseball first place but like do like if you love The Creative aspect and then you have high standards for yourself then you can achieve both I think that achieving quote-unquote greatness and living with misery I don't think that's worth it no I don't think it's worth it for you so you got one shot at this man like this this life men like you have one shot it try to figure the f*** out and it takes time to figure the f*** out but it's one of those things you can really explain achieving cortical greatness and living with misery I don't think that's worth it no I don't think it's worth it for you so you got one shot at this man like this this life man like you got one shot it try to figure the f*** out and it takes time to figure the f*** out but it's one of those things you can't even really explain to people but if you can I'm approaching this point in my life were like yeah I think I get it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it would be like I don't have never thought they like Asian p**** was that much smaller than like I was not allowed to you I didn't research article evidence you know I've met girls that were tiny that you could not f*** hard enough now than it is wide open up want they want Savage they want to get f****** smashed like that is because I think they realize that they had their tiny they have small jeans so they want to get Savage genetics inside them so they have Survivor children I really believe that I think it only makes sense keep going it's a never-ending battle for genetics 100% it's a never-ending Battle of genetics and if you do not like a little while they barely f*** them they always say they have headaches she was a really like them I just do not want to f*** him cuz that was rough but I'm like what are you going to do Trap House in general is a direct result of a failure by men to be fair and buy a failure by men to be actual men into Ray's actual men who treat everybody with respect when men are abusing women those men are bullies their they're weak men the kind of man that would do that to a woman that would like we abused a woman that's a weak man right right up the type of man that would heat up a smaller man or text someone from someone with Force insecurity to feel powerful martial artist go to martial arts gym, I'll take you there are f****** nice and friendly each other half to death in 5 minutes and before that happy play. we want with her to mean women or men went now women women will tell you this maybe get him to like you more do it don't do that not even that loud women don't like women ride one of these are I love more than anything and they'll do this thing with a look around to make sure no one's looking no one's around I'll go look I would never say this publicly but sumbitches are f****** crazy that's what is it I like to look around and decided the thing about these women feel like it it's they've got momentum in this little war of ideas right with the me-too movement and Bill Cosby get arrested in R. Kelly getting arrested Harvey Weinstein and I bet you think there's two things away or they get arrested for abusing people there physically abusing or physically abusing women it's always good you shouldn't be physically abusing I'm out here all these levels before you got to him and your wife got into that level and he was treated like s*** being mean to her and tell her if you want to work town you got to suck this little fat dick personality is apparently a closeted homosexual they want to get caught Gwyneth Paltrow Brad Pitt threatened to kill Harvey Weinstein but you got to swing on a swing on a bro you got to leave some marks that believe it depends on what Harvey did versus would be if he grabbed her add anything to her physically then you got it but if you just said something creepy and you tell him I had him we have words that protected Weinstein II you complain about a guy for grope in or doing something crazy right that woman is doing exactly what she supposed to do sexual assault and she's telling you right now if you silence her and shut her up that's what a system falls apart right right right how old how many people can all them almost there not work cuz they're not doing it but they're so bad because they strip the person who was assaulted from like Donnelly equality but like they stripped her from from life in a way like they made that person go oh s*** life isn't fair and I don't have a shot do you know the expression the diffusion of responsibility it's it comes when there's large groups of people that watch something at someone's going to step in it's like that lady genovese's or something remember that there was some woman who was getting raped and queens and she was screaming for like 40 minutes and there was all these neighbors around like yeah I heard it but I thought Ted was on it to the river yeah you feel like well it's not my responsibility I just work here you know like somebody else is going to handle this right now this is and I think when you if you working in like the Weinstein Company and you knew Harvey was out there slinging dick first of all and when their defense you probably didn't know the specifics right because it's like Harvey's a dog is always out there trying to f*** is that sort of normal like a lot like people have to understand is why I like that get rich why does a guy like that get rich why does he get rich as he likes some patron of the Arts who loves creating a little bit maybe like power</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> those are the same addiction essentially but one is a lot better to have than the other you know it's like even with Kanye right like I see Kanye as like this guy who's just wildly insecure and he's trying to justify his coolness constantly by taking things that are not cool at all and making them cool within a community within his community right so it's like everything Kanye does like down to like it started with like the WASP culture I'm going to take like preppy New England you know polos that are pink and s*** and I'm going to make that call now before the Hip Hop community on I grew up in New York will I get some KC bro with the f*** is that that Kanye wears is like now you got to look fly in this whatever culture right if you see me right this rip sweaters I'm so cool I could beat you up you think Mike me loves cool sneakers imma make Dad sneakers cool and then what is the most uncool thing to his community and what is he trying to make Kool-Aid selfish is all about him and he takes the most uncool thing and puts it on his head and he's a cool and that's when people like at least his community was like now we not going or not going to play with that s*** you know what I think I think you know how like you have something that's supposed to take like 8 volts charger like we have alternating current like you can have something that takes way more amperage right I think Kanye has the wrong plug to the universe and in a good way so he wants to deliver talked to him know I talked to him the phone and it was a stream of Consciousness that was so intense I was like okay now I get it I kind of go we had a long conversation is a very nice guy with a long conversation like 15-20 minutes on the phone which is a long conversation these days on the phone and new fashion and all this and I think he's just catching whatever he can and hold it on to it and waiting through the waves of feel that I don't know how to feel there's a little bit of that but with him it's almost like affirming that he's okay because he's so much different than everybody else like you online like a lot of other people react how you want any energies good energy the Confederate flag represent slavery in a way that's my abstract take on what I know about it right so wrote the song New Slaves who the Confederate flag and made it my flight it's my flag now we're going to do something like the n-word and use it as a positive you could do anything I mean look if if black people really decide ice that do this bit of Isis bit about the f****** Duck Dynasty guy was he was talking about s*** about gay people's like I don't understand it gay people decided to take over camo and the bit was like look what they did to the rainbow I go you can't wear a rainbow shirt anymore everybody like back to pots of gold now it's dude but bucket in a Duck Blind camo camels like some about duck hunting make me horny and some dude just drops in out of nowhere and pulls his camel down to sucking his dick in Vegas at all pornos in camo it would turn camo into a gay thing and just went Whole Hog on the Confederate camo wallpaper absolutely they're doing all these guys are smart pattern that's a bad camo pattern eld-x rape is not about power well then they didn't do it right they also didn't get raped play different like for whatever reasons the connection that's one of the reasons why I think this Kim Kardashian relationship work so well okay it's cuz like I bet she handles normal regular stuff and he could just be cognac like it seems like there constitute know he has just lock you up brother never lock me up my wife never I never came home my wife has some f****** two gorillas that are in those labs suits and they're staring them in my witches a big guy is going to take it to her we'd like to handle this quietly she doesn't mean that you are genius that's a lot of crazy people who are just crazy yeah well he's definitely crazy but he's also but he's brilliant to see the work that comes out of that crazy is genius work right so what is it about him that allows him to be so prolific as an artist who knows how prolific is what music this is all from this energy that's inside of a he figures out how to channel that energy and put it in good ways but occasion like it's not all such as he's not a coincidence it's not a coincidence that when Kanye was onstage I think it was in San Jose and he said that he didn't vote but it was going to vote he would have voted for Trump and the crowd went crazy and they do the s*** out of a then he canceled his tour and then he went to the Mental Health Institute right then his response to that was to double down his response to that was to trib equality to Trump and he doesn't even really have right and so Trump in his in a lot of ways very wise the way he handles things socially he let Kanye come into the White House where that Maga hat what went wrong with him and then Trump just sits there and goes like this and let them talk and then he leaves Trump goes what the f*** the face says okay what is Kanye's like showing Donald Trump his phone to cut down Shopkins live person phone who's the brother of the back he's a hunter we know each other through mutual friends running one of our mutual friends who committed suicide but he's a nice guy agree with a lot of things that a lot of people that I know agree with</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> oh he was losing a s*** in San Francisco it was that night on the f****** motorcycle I mean but how did he choose Colorado so there's a great story and like the early 60s Thompson had had a chance to drive a cargo I got friends car out to Colorado on his way to San Francisco in 1960 the gentlest man with a good friend at the hospital I'm Daily Times and she was older she saw him like after driving 20 hours they come in my house hangout Shields right now spinning Woody Creek in 1963 after Sandy was pregnant Thompson came back from South America where he was a reporter and did a wonderful job like reporting on how democracy for falling apart on their him and Sandy wanted to move west because the national Observer was the newspaper Thompson work they wanted to give Thompson I'm a position to be a western reporter he was thinking of going to San Francisco but instead he chose to stop first or Peggy Clifford was stopped in Aspen and Woody Creek and so he was living in Aspen Woody Creek from August of 1963 to February of 1963 and he was there this is where we begin he was there when John F Kennedy was assassinated time to get to knock on the door and it says Rancher named Wayne Wagner which is an old Aspen family and that ranchers like the president's been shot what's more he's he's been murdered East at Thompson just like let's how to stop and where is down and he goes downtown I'm Woody Creek Aspen and it just gets notes from people with their responses are and so when he then went to San Francisco to 4 he was having a tough time he was already wanting to flee because he got held Angels he was able to stay in San Francisco longer write report on them what would happen if you stayed in San Francisco at first but then because of the success of Hell's Angels he was able to buy out for Aspen's were different but Woody Creek is not that much different Woody Creek is still pretty the greatest but there's a lot of cops almost killed me cuz I did a note for every sound smell or sight or comment if I wrote an at the moment Thompson felt with a f****** my doing here I had the quote where he said I looked around then and I felt what the f*** am I doing here and I had that in the notes so people could see it and it was because I'm one of those people that knew him well and respected him and trusted him to not think that I wasn't any way trying anything but to make a tart off of his life and we was trying to respond to Trump right now and my love of his work in this moment white bunny saying almost killed you it's not possible to write a narrative and then also site every detail of a narrative so each day I would spend nine hours researching outlining with citations I want to write like a novel wanted to be like you know and at that moment I felt like I didn't I see the machine oil from the bay was coming off I wanted to read it vividly I knew that I had to support all of that and so I don't spend eight or nine hours every day just on the shore Arrangement and research and then the next six or seven hours or 8 hours I would write the narrative and that sleep 5 or 6 hours you know when I get up and I would do it again I did this for for 5 months but you know after I was deeply into it and I don't think that's sustainable I think it's better in retrospect to go and report somewhere you know to like going but to try to write something with a dramatizing should I take Thompson right well and have done nothing like his also have almost as many pages of notes showing my work you know showing the math that went behind both those things which was to try to write it and it novel The Stick way but then to also make sure that any question the reader would have but like why did you think that the dinner was at 5 p.m. know or like you know why why did you take the sun was coming up in this way at 3 to make sure cuz I don't respect cuz lawsuit against Garry Trudeau he thought about it I think that's what's really weird is that he kind of knew that it was happening like there's that famous interview where he's talking to that British guy who do the documentary about him Checkers with Hunter maybe or no but yeah one of them one of them but he's he's rolling a joint on the grass somewhere with that Las Vegas visor on and needs to know talking about how he's really become this caricature and it would be actually be better if he wasn't alive anymore you know that then is breaking up with his wife during that it was at least one of them one of them but he's he's rolling a joint on the grass somewhere with that Las Vegas visor on and needs to know talking about how he's really become this caricature and it would be actually be better if he wasn't alive anymore you know that then his breaking up with his wife during that it was at least like a parking lot</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Kitty is that his sort of self-destructive path becomes romantic when you read it and you get involved in his work and you kind of mimic it you know it's up that's the greatest fallacy I think that's what he was trying to say was self-destruction I mean when it was what was it was fantastic till it was understood Ian Ian Warner talked about that in the Alex Gibney documentary that's a great the document are the new book on the new book on Ian winter has great moments of Thompson the seventies just being kind of lost which means you may have nothing without borax but Thompson knew that he may have to live in that kind of afterlife I want one Thompson write about it so beautifully footage of him when he was writing for I forget what newspaper somewhat was it somewhere in the Pacific Northwest what was your writing for who's the author of playing off the rail Google playing off the rail at there's a guy who was a journalist David McCumber yes David McCumber David McCumber employed Hunter for a while when David was I forget what publication he was working for but there's some footage of them Community communicate together and then I was trying to get Hunter couldn't talk and you know sing this is what's wrong with American Society for him to say the way he did when was blade sizes for 1964 by going to Hemingway's Ketchum Idaho own grave and Hemingway's house and it's gorgeous because it talks about Hemingway was a good writer one of the best writers when he was writing about. He understood the 1940s 1930s when there was a firmness to the reality that he could articulate one of the writers goals is to give a pattern to chaos is becoming articulate what happened when the chaos as multiplying repeatedly somebody like Hemingway becomes a literal Relic like his narrative no longer fit into the present. He is in and Thompson * Hemingway's Decline and he wrote about Hemingway's suicide Hemingway it was confusing to him it didn't it didn't fit anymore like his way of operating no longer articulated the present and so Hemingway's last Act was to take away his ability to say anything at all I was only the last thing I ever said was I say I'm not going to say anything anymore was the suicide in Hemingway commit it wrote about that gorgeously you know when when he was wrong when he want to kill himself it was almost unsurprising you know when when I read that he had died. I remember gone man well I guess yeah you know man I mean it's like you knew that he was deteriorating rapidly you knew that he had really bad hips hit at hip replacement surgery the Ralph's light and leg Ralph Steadman to draw on this very crazy image of him with the artificial hip and it look like pain you know I mean I think that it's not my place to even deal with that because one Thompson's book right about that moment comes in the house and that's that's that's his in one right beautifully about the stakes of it how painful it was the people that loved him for everything about it and how that ended up a logical outcome that's not know I needed it so it's interesting that would say read stories I tell myself that moment is so honestly and brilliantly written by Usher at the time of his death you know he was in a sort of a he was deteriorating so badly diapers his entire alcoholism his ability to control body was gone and so one gave this wonderful father and he asked the question like should I include this detail and he's like my father was alive I couldn't include that but that's why I chose that because I think my father would want me to write honestly but I also don't want me to believe that if he was still alive and so included that detail we talked about that the struggle to include that detail which I think William the articulate what you're saying which is the deterioration and I mean amount of energy or effort we really do we have to take care of ourselves if we don't we will pay that price at some point we're going to pay it anyways we're all headed to the same place you want to or not you know and so delete to find a beautiful example of wager of chips that were made for that 1960's and 1970's and I think the best way to honor that is too you know apply the Brilliance that he forged and carved to the situation we have right now with corruption Donald Trump Twitter Leon says she's a trained and we arrived at the station with the off crushing Donald Trump an American democracy democracy is basically it's like literally on says the Walker she's a trained and we arrived at the station would be off like a business use the ladder to get the attic and not Trump pulling up the ladder understand that really really well and I think reading him now whether you know him or not helps you and that's why we're free kingdom was so that can be a lens on his his working backwards on this present right now regardless</div>

I remember gone man well I guess you know you don't mean I mean it's like you knew that he was deteriorating rapidly you knew that he had really bad hips it had hip replacement surgery the Ralph Steadman leg Ralph Steadman to draw on this very crazy image of him with the artificial hip and it look like pain you know I mean it's not my place to even deal with that because Juan Thompson's book writes about that moment when he was in the house and that's that's that's his in one right beautifully about the stakes of it how painful it was the people that loved him for everything about it and how that even if that's a logical outcome that's not know I needed it so it's interesting that would say read stories I tell myself that moment is so honestly and I'm sure at the time of his death you know he was in the sort of a he was deteriorating so badly entire alcoholism his ability to give this wonderful father and he asked the questions like should I include this detail my father was alive I couldn't include that but that's why I chose father would want me to write honestly but I also don't want me to believe that if he was still alive and so included that detail we talked about that the struggle to include that detail which I think William the articulates what you're saying which is the deterioration in the sadness of it and I mean amount of energy or effort we really do we have to take care of ourselves if we don't we will pay that price at some point we're going to pay it anyways we're all headed to the same place you want to or not you know and so we will pay that price at some point we're going to pay it anyways we're all headed to the same place I want to or not you know and so terrifying a beautiful example of wager of chips that were made for that 1960's and 1970's and I think the best way to honor that is to apply the Brilliance that he forged and carved to the situation we have right now with crush and don't try</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> decided to combine Fiction with nonfiction in a very weird blurry way yeah later I think my baby on the show talked about it while we're nothing is at musky was already out of the campaign when that came out most get already lost and so it must have been a f****** monster and a terrible person on that campaign and so Thompson use that version of Muskie and wrote as babysitting a very straight way that it begins story but what I think is even more I think he dramatize the way other people didn't he would say I look left I look up I see he came down to me and then he said people didn't write like that in journalism they didn't go step-by-step and I was really important what I think is more important than afterwards Thompson talked about how he'd heard that there are there was a rumor that this doing it again which is like Ayahuasca or he said that he said they brought in a Brazilian witch doctor . tore that must be the FrontRunner had a chance to beat Nixon poll numbers wise was going all the way down to Florida Peninsula on to try to win the Florida primary and Thompson was like this is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen every stop monkey give the same s*** speech is like a president named Lee me and it was repeated the reporter political operatives cannot make everybody likes sing the song like about like must be like sunshine in his hands over limit and it was terrible and so that night Thompson pulled into a Florida town and was the second last stop and he in this young political reporter named Monty chitty we're going to get a drink at 2 a.m. and this guy walks into the lobby at 66250 Peter Sheridan and he he walks in and he Elizabeth thinks he ends up going out with them Hunter Thompson for a drink and finds out that Peter Sheridan had been a good friend of Jerry Garcia had the angels in California had been to a Honda or can he see was and it was actually a pretty smart guy who is out of his mind in his mid-twenties they stayed out and drink all night at the end of the night sounds like so are we going and I'm going to Miami so there's a really good journalist on Outlaw it's called Outlaw journalist spy on Bill McKee and another comes about Rafi. Thompson took his elevator press the button send a press pass down to the ground floor Peter Sheridan got it so Peter Sheridan could ride free on the Sunshine Express down in Miami the next day so Thompson oversleeps because the f****** lucky campaign doesn't like him anyways instead Peter Sheridan Express Sheridan goes on to order 12 martinis and he goes to give me like a triple chin bucks hold a buck and he runs up and down the car and you know musky has been a really shity candidate at this point he's not be gay do people he got in this weird fight with his wife at a campaign event where they like put cake in each others face give the speech the Caboose and Jerry Rubin the anti-war activist who was one of the Chicago 7 and was it had come to Hoechlin is in the crowd and he's saying he must eat so why did you support the Vietnam War 1968 like who do you think you are and so monkeys yelling at you a Rubik he's a young man keep your mouth shut but needs must be reaching up from the bottom of a caboose Peter Sheridan is holding a gin bottle and grabbing at muskies leg as much as he tries to give the speech and then once he falls back in the whole thing ends that the whole press conference is over like women's wear daily reported this and it came out that Hunter Thompson that had 13 martinis and run up and down and had interfered with it and Muskie campaign really believed that Thompson was working with Donald segretti and Nixon's creep Watergate crew to f****** monkeys campaign and that actually change the course how f***** up monkey was a candidate at that time and Tom said never forgiven monkey for being a pro Vietnam War platform at the 1968 convention and so we talked about it but that report and the way that disseminated through media away with pick up by other newspapers really did help change the people's perception of Ed Muskie at big and Mesquite dial journalism but he did have a little bit of fiction mixed in with that and that sort of ran him afoul of the hell 8 Hell's Angels they were very upset by that right like he did write some things in there that they claim or not accurate I think that when it came to Hells Angels did really well with Joan Didion did really well he took the way the media was betraying somebody and he ship that off and said this we actually are this is what they're actually doing Joan Didion when she writes about Jim Morrison The White Album she's like Jim Morrison was like sex and death in his leather pants with the best thing ever everybody loves Jim Morrison and then in the scene in The White Album Joan Didion write about how they sit at a recording studio for 2 hours and nobody says anything they eat eggs out of a paper bag time article here's how everybody's running about you all I want to do is write the truth about who you are and he did and he ended up riding with them and he's upset with him I don't think they got as mad at him about the way he portrayed them I think they got mad that he began to make money or that he became famous Hells Angels 500,000 paperback copies that is almost impossible to imagine today old him more money owed him something for that he met them at all did he give them any money Barger 400 an hour straight and write it in March Of Us 7 finish it so turns it in makes his Advanced deadline in September they're like he's our author photo and it's shity he's like f*** this so he goes to hell Angels rally he doesn't know anybody cuz he hasn't been with him for 6 months he's taking pictures that's when he got beat up and he hiding his friend who later committed suicide after Altamonte after being involved in the Altamonte security situation by the Rolling Stone one word Meredith Hunter was stabbed but there is a woman that got stabbed man Meredith Hunter Lindsey Lindsey better named Susan I know it's a girl by her this is a weird one. no tonsils very good at empathetically understanding their flaws and their perspectives he never I think may excuses for me said that their inherent perspective is fascistic the rights that you know he said they use violence to respond to where they were in society their idea of total retaliation how they were any events like looking at you funny or being like to drink could be met with everybody beating you up cuz they got determine the they got the whole thing. play about the Reliance on violence cuz he they felt Hells Angels they've been left behind by are moderated Society like ours technology is all these new job if you came back from the war 1950 you had a chance in Oakland to have a middle-class life in a beautiful house and work the rest of your days and have a family that will then go on but by 1965 option and the angels World violent response to that did he ever wind up resolving his differences with the Hell's Angels I think so you know like a mob people went to jail any Barker went to jail I think they at the end appreciated his representation of them because was better than any other you write for six months with somebody and you're honest likely if your hands are not trying to fit what you see into a thesis you're doing the opposite trying to look at the reality house in front of you and then form an argument out of that how did he was coming down it was at the Mayor of Richmond he was coming down to Slick Road and they had hit something was wet or an oil thing and it went out the back tire world was fine but his friends new hit railroad tracks really badly it was a rich man and that's continued riding motorcycles though turn off readers or listeners know this but the edge you know nothing major part of the book where Thompson's fighting with his wife Thompson's finished his book but he's breaking down because he works so hard to do it and so he takes his BSA out and he goes if you don't care if he goes out to the park he hits the Coast Highway and he comes down it and he's like I'm so overwhelmed everything is so f****** terrible is going as fast as he can this is beautiful seen you looking for stamp it's cuz you're in a sandpit near the zoo all the way to Rockaway Beach with people that have gone over the rest the living don't have any understanding of it and all we can do is approach it was apologizing Tamil beautiful becomes back and he sits at his desk until he had a view of the Bay Bridge he can see it to flashing lights full time and he had broken window in a terrible fight with his wife like three weeks earlier and place it the broken window and he writes out that's me right away with his eyes spell scoured wasn't a broken window when she wouldn't give him a gun cuz I was on acid me through a shoot through the windows three there's three versions side do it and then go with the fever since I've heard I heard it from I'm asked her you know she wrote I Really respect Sandy like deeply she wrote it the a few years ago she said I'm done giving interviews with about something that was my life that was then given so many interviews up to this point I asked her you know she wrote I Really respect Sandy deeply she wrote it the a few years ago she said I'm done giving interviews with about something that was my life that was then given so many interviews after this respect that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> my pleasure so your book free Kingdom you know we live in interesting times right now from your face put on I went and got some of my favorite quotes I'm just for my longhand to get sense of what is what is respected was more than once again didn't you do that with the Great Gatsby of the words that's such a fascinating notion because Canadians do that in the early days of Comedy like a lot of guys like before they ever start going onstage themselves they imitate their faith comedian spits like they'll do a Richard Pryor bed and they'll do to their friends and they'll get get a sense of the Rhythm in the timing and get those last from doing Richard Pryor bit to their friends and then they get that bug it's like part of what infects them I mean that's the hardest thing to steal or not play driving but we're trying to understand what decisions they made for work it's so unfortunate when when someone does when you have someone with her Richard Pryor anyone's just got a truly exceptional and unique mind or someone who doesn't like our president and decided when he ran in 2016 to plagiarize Richard Nixon 1968 convention speech is directly crime Law &amp; Order that shity but successful 1968 Miami Jason Thompson knew how effective it that was yeah I wonder if he did that on purpose because he was so good and one thing to Trump is so good at he's so good at getting the media to talk about him and like one of the best way to get the me to talk about I'm was give them something to be angry about that no one else is going to give a f*** about Knicks tonight okay freaking on the book about about taking the emotion of living in this present running back at Thompson's career and then trying to write it like a novel to dramatize all of the experiences he went through that are today so apt to show his respect some parallels you know I mean do you remember when when Hunter got together with Bill Murray and build brother and they did that thing where they were trying to get people to a Nixon got a bad deal we got to bring them back and in people are going along with that Richard Nixon is with his Barbie doll family and his Barbie doll life is like America's answer to America dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde you know he is the werewolf he speaks to the werewolf in us and chose to hide that werewolf because of the place we live in now to amplify I'm all the way to the most powerful position in the world which isn't saying it would be really fast in to see if Hunter was alive in his prime now he would I think his taken a very similar to Matt Taibbi Matt Taibbi in my opinion our more reasonable more put together version of Hunter Thompson because he's more stain discipline long curly appreciative I'm sure you've heard the recently uncovered recording of Hunter calling into some company that install the DVD player is f****** screaming in Yellowstone Lippy lips the media has that information with Nixon Thompson headspace when everybody watches speeches the Press television and they made the Press just like Trump off in the corner when the plane arrived you know being berated by everybody very similar to what is going on now and again we see people getting hot dramatizing corrupt administrations are in war and Thompson that beautifully was Nixon being berated by the Press is that why they chose to have the new eyes I mean he was a crook as people say no president wants it a journalist digging into their life specifically because you don't want chamonix with journalists but they Trump and Nixon both knew that's so much to hide that actually have a journalist like Hunter Thompson who was a good investigative journalist to having a second baby around that's dangerous go to jail who knows what's going to happen how did you get involved with writing this book Bellarmine college preparatory and writing class and so I read something there and then a friend had an audiobook of Fear and Loathing and so I just remember the first time hearing that old audiobook of Fear and Loathing them were somewhere around Barstow came to the desert twenties I really got into Trump regarding the death of Ruben Salazar I'm a prominent journalist oh my god dude this isn't somebody that says dancing on stage or by performing a road narrative has an investigative journalist to go into the most powerful people do things they don't want us to see in a sense risking his life to do so because he says in questions I think that's what a lot of people are saying today was Jamal khashoggi you know Jamal khashoggi's death as got a lot of journalists really freaking out like what you know what am I doing if I'm criticizing world leaders and talk to you about International politics if this can happen to me is effective because it's used to silence either opposition or journalist and so this book and I tried they just didn't like a hundred pages of notes so I'm excited every sight smell or sound that somebody that knows Thompson really well give you like where the f*** did you get the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday nightmare daily give this order to clear the intersection of Balbo and Michigan because of protest 5 10,000 people the Haymarket in which is on the ground floor level does a plate glass window he was sitting with delegates from the Democratic National Convention in the cop charged they did like a double Pinscher formation like Hannibal in like a f****** 100 BC and they split the beat everybody hit Thompson over the head he got his motorcycle helmet on just in time so we can see everything that's going on beating everybody and he's looking around and he's sure that snipers on the roof are going to open fire at any moment so he runs to the Blackstone where he's staying across the way shows has Ricky gets beat up by the cops silent and to not respond then this is not a democracy we know his ex-wife talked about that is being like one of the only moments where she saw him cry for two weeks we talked and so much more so much more of an ability to communicate yeah I think it's almost easier to coordinate violence I was just talking to the head of the proud boys Gavin McInnes is a group I'm Enrique tarrio and he's like you saying he's using the language of the left like I'm a victim I can't buy groceries violence he's like who the f*** are you Auntie feel like I'm Hitman sniper fire from the f****** roof across the way I think there's this idea on the right that we can push towards violence we can get very close to it with our rhetoric or with our actions but that it won't spread like the conflagration won't keep going just an identity and the Gang that they belong to and I don't think they really understand violence you know you want to talk about vinyl to talk to a military guy you don't talk to someone who really understands what violence actually is and they don't have this empty rhetoric like these fools do a lot of these people that are calling for violence like you should be calling for camaraderie we should be calling for communication we should be calling for some way we can all work this out where the civilians the the civilization that we live in that we aren't we all can get along together and most people don't want to impede you from living your life and doing what you want to do most people give me ask majority Hunter Johnson believed in working within the system you know you believe I can maybe a f*****-up system but you can still run for Sheriff now it's been anybody want to resort to violence that means the conversation is stopped disfigures you how much the violence affected him that he experienced punched in the face as hard as somebody can punch you most Americans haven't had that and that changes your ability to articulate something back in that moment if that's political if it's a police officer or political opponent that uses violence instead of an argument to respond to you we've left the round that we recognize and we're not going to be able to communicate even in a limited way Chicago to Aspen and that was brilliant because it was his way to controlled environment knowing that mayor Daley's not listening to his non-violent protest Richard Nixon is not listening to a non-violent protest Thompson needed to find another Avenue to try to work within the American system to make things happen in the great contrast is his good friend Oscar Zeta Acosta there's a wonderful PBS documentary it rise and fall of the brown Buffalo by on Flip Rodriguez Acosta was being pursued by the LAPD was eventually set up by that and for him working within the system he ran for Sheriff wasn't an option to the cops set him up for a high-speed bust you know like a cup at the cuphead undercover Agents from something called the special operations for conspiracy Department in the LAPD at the time and they were trying to use the provocateur is from site violence against the plainclothes please so that or the number please so that lethal violence can be used to silence so they use agent provocateurs to make it look like they're part of the protest doesn't he don't activate effective weapon in silencing civil rights is the lethal force and you can do that in the country of the u.s. is done but you guys can't use tactics like my lilac pumps unless you have the cops then like what happened on August 29th 1978 during the flood because the most effective weapon in silence he's alright is lethal force and you can do that in another country of the u.s. is done but you guys can't use tactics like my lilac pumps in US unless you have a provocative undercover attacks a cop and so the cops then like what happened on August 29th 1978 during the riot and just flood East LA</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> like they sat there and went deep like all night but he definitely Hunter definitely s*** on them always showing them hard cuz you can't shut back on him hard. The first thing that was at the at the at the Holiday Inn in 1968 in New Hampshire during Nixon campaign and Thompson watching this damn guy with the damn key jacket go to a party with on campaign people and with Shannon and he brings a big bottle of wild turkey and so begins a younger with the timing works at the st. Louis on put special school guy and he looks at Thompson not in pajamas like containment nuclear war we're trying to get out of it and they listen to each other till dawn but that first night that they meant now what was your idea behind writing this book like what what compelled you I think we've mistaken Thompson I think that we seem more like a Doonesbury character but I think that most people through whatever cultural forces that we had wanted to know there's a lot of people don't know the comparison what the Doonesbury car cartoon Doonesbury by Garry Trudeau it became there's a character on a call Donald Duke and Uncle Duke was based on Hunter Thompson and he was kind of an exaggerated version of Hunter Thompson with a cartoonish version of Hunter S Thompson and I think Terry Gilliam did it wonderful and kind of altruist job on a job on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but that's also an exaggerated she did Freeman Simon she wrote the straight articles for years to make money for his family and it wasn't until he had his breakthrough without handle that he could develop this style that we identify with today and so I told you that we identify him more as a clown or it like you know more as a cartoonish figure as opposed to a very serious political thinker political activist and serious writer who can give us insight into the f****** s*** show experience every moment today while I think the perception of him is fairly nuanced I don't think that everybody thinks of me as a cartoon character although particulars later on this life he was relegated to that because you really didn't speak well when you know later on his life and he was just the drugs taken over the alcohol alcoholism took on awful piece that he did with Conan O'Brien or Conan went to Woody Creek and shotguns off the back porch with them and you could barely understand a f****** word Hunter saying that's why I tried to end it with Nixon leaving because it was really sad when Nixon resigned under Thompson was at the Connecticut Hilton which is a hotel right by the White House any Lebowitz photographer with was calling him and saying we need to get to the White House Nixon is a leaving the keep going to get on the helicopter I just laid in the grass and he didn't go no and that was heartbreaking any didn't end up writing the eight-page spread that he needed to instead it became Annie leibovitz's photography which was famous and in retrospect a huge mood for her career but I think that pain right there of thinking that he'd spent 10 years in California unipress you can give me the shaft for so long like you won't have dick Nixon to kick around anymore Thompson NC Matt Nixon was somebody who said I'm just a poor son of a butcher I'm just this like very hard-working American that represents all of us where he was a politically no ravenous monster who was it a communist who would go to any extent win and Thompson saw that and Thompson knew that other people saw and 1964 the Barry Goldwater convention in San Francisco my favorite Lee named Arena of all time the Cow Palace Barry Goldwater was going to speak to accept the nomination and what happened was Nixon was introducing it was Nixon's way back from the Wilderness a few rows back the first time they think that that active lines skill in the way used car salesman who live when you make a lot of money off it the way that Trump by selling steaks to people and then they go bankrupt and he gets Rich that's an American skill had some moments where he decided to not do the assignment that he was supposed to do and it was kind of sad like the Ali Foreman fight fight floated in the pool all the way to Africa if it's one of the greatest sports moments it was like there was something different to people than I think it's I don't think we have someone like that today so it's very difficult for us to understand people today look at all leading to go he was a heavyweight boxing champion he was way more than that he was a cultural figure that represented the resistance to the Vietnam War and represented it with the biggest loss that any public figure it ever shown and willingly gave up three years of his career in his prime from 827 to 30 from 1967 from the Cleveland big Katt Williams fight he didn't fight again for three years they didn't trade and do anything they kept him from his career white when he was in his prime when he was the best heavyweight of all time and he spoke publicly and often and in whose f****** hate it all over the country but he represented something different like my parents were hippies and when I was a little kid he lost to Leon Spinks and the rematch was on television my parents never watch TV and they definitely never watched boxing and date they sign from that TV to watch the I remember thinking I can't believe my parents want to watch a boxing match like this is crazy and I was probably like I don't know maybe 8 or 9 years old or something at the time and I just remember thinking I can't believe my parents want to watch a boxing match and that's when it when it sunk into me at a really early age that this guy was not just this heavyweight boxer he was he was a cultural icon he was a historical figure he meant a lot into Hunter he meant a lot he meant something something much bigger than just just a boxer and so Hunter thought he was going through a death sentence George Foreman it crushed Joe Frazier he crushed everybody mean he was so powerful George Foreman to this day's one of the all-time scariest heavyweights of all time without a doubt he he could hit so f****** hard and literally pick guys off their feet he hit Joe Frazier and Lyft I'm off his feet with a punch and everybody was convinced that was going to happen to Ollie's I'll leave been past his Prime and look just look what George Foreman had done to Joe Frazier what is he going to do to Muhammad Ali and I'll leave this rope-a-dope them until he got tired then f***** him up in front of the whole world and it's one of the greatest athletic minutes I mean we forget that athletes they risked you weren't allowed to get free agency for another team in kirkfield was a great player he was like I'm going to sit out and I'm going to wait at least like Colin Kaepernick they've sacrificed it's not the same with Muhammad Ali who was like Babe Ruth and Barry Bonds in like everybody combined at that one moment Ryan but he was risking to become this even more mangled version of himself and get more power they use his celebrity to speak for his virtue in his value in his Thompson was really good at understanding what people sacrifice will have to give up the wager you know between what that act will be what the results will be there maybe later but he knew that and so his respect for all even giving up those years of his prime you know was was enduring you can't Thompson came back from that fight and he gave his son on 1 boxing gloves boxing gloves ask need to hear his take on me I'm sure you would have been so moved when he saw Ali win it wasn't that was indicative of I think the stress my pressure that the last decade covering Nixon had taken out from him what is a little bit of that but let's be honest he was also kind of a f****** I mean when he was running for Rolling Stone and they gave him that that early facts of Antonio unplug it and plug it back in who do it just so you could go to the bar and say this thing doesn't work but that was the end I think it is our Christmas still on you still playing the role of a serious journalist that you would use that Persona as a f****** and there's Letters by Young winner being like you cannot turn in your articles three hours before we go to press I know you made it this doesn't f****** work and so he was beginning to break down that was awful things on the tail end of his decorative wants to admit every deadline so that she could f****** feed his family are like maybe like a longshoreman he was going and looking for work in the mornings in San Francisco you know what to try to support his family was willing to give up writing instead that article blew up and he for all these beautiful that it began arrive at 319 Parnassus what he looked at at the top of the Haight-Ashbury Inn on San Francisco and you know that opened up his chance to continue being a writer but money was the main motivating factor and so I think once money unfurled once alcohol is my thing to its toll and then once he couldn't walk around anymore convention without people just like grabbing his shoulder and set your Hunter Thompson R Us that happened I think things began to change yeah that's one of the things we talked about that I thought was really interesting that he became a part of the story it wasn't just that he was covering stories couldn't be anonymous anymore he was in many cases more famous than the people that he was covering you know like when he would go to meet Nixon all Nick Nixon Secret Service agents wanted to meet him and he wanted me to get an autograph from him shake his hand and it was just too weak everything you got and then there's the alcoholism that alcoholism look at it it's a depressant did Rex you and if you read you know we me and Greg Fitzsimmons on a podcast once read off that one journalist who is detailed Hunters daily routine yeah and so we we read the daily routine and they put a techno beat to it's f****** hilarious I was a bad have you met that the other team that was the biography on her it was in that and it's just it's heartbreaking anyway, remember that the dedication to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was he who makes a beast of himself gets for the pain from a man and I think what they wanted brazenly without being held accountable yeah I think it's hard to pay your bills and you know live the way that you wanted to live and I think a lot of that gets undermined I just want people to realize how much effort he put out especially during those years where he was like all right I want to be a great journalist I want to have a voice in our society I want to participate or national conversation my only path towards that is to work harder than everybody else living think a lot of that gets undermined I just want people to realize how much effort he put out especially during those years where he was like all right I want to be a great journalist I want to have a voice in our society I want to participate or national conversation my only path towards that is to work harder than everybody else be at places when things happen that we can</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> reproduction about Trump if you want to go after like Taibbi did about a financial institution the way Thompson did it what kind of wager time later for time now and he talks about that he said he mean by that he says drink alcoholic cuz I believe I need to go after these moments later I'm not going to have it but I'm making that Campbell play the card down right now and I think that's terrifying and I also think that he gave us bring it writing over one of the most remarkable spans in American history because of it that's a weird tradition in journalism right to destroy your body while creating your art and I think there's a according to my friends were journalists there's a big problem with adderal today and there's a lot of people that are using it to write and it's f****** speed and you know you get addicted front of you closer have you done it with ADHD stop being medicated as a child you were medicated having pills worked on my throat like also olvia 6 weeks I ain't going to take it to write like this world is incredibly painful so I take out a while now and I take it to how often every day today and I take it to take it to go into a library and this is what David wallace-wells were talking but I think you like today what does a functionality that allows and it's always a wager what Thompson writes about his whenever something is given something else has lost you never get anything for free in this world but dexedrine like Rodger was like yo you're breaking down like you're 26 have a wife a very small child your writing right now you want to have your career go forward and not doing well and I was like I'm a doctor I'd gone through med school you know I did it I I've been overwhelmed like you got ran every morning you know he did he did other things but he took texturing so I gave it to Thompson and for that small. Of time it helped I mean it's like I'm not a good researcher and maybe I would be now but the only way I can write about something I can respond so I didn't know him have no experience with him is to read everything that he's ever written or been written about him and then go out interview people and so effort is my only path forward and whatever helps for me is to take the pain away of that effort but doesn't take it away it shifts at around two aspects of the parts of life and I think Thompson when he wrote he who makes a beast of himself escape the pain targets for the pain of being a man we don't listen to that like he was like this effort hard like I'm struggling with this effort beautiful models he wrote his whole life to lose 90 his last novel was at 87 he remember at 76 about being a fighter pilot among other things in the Korean War lyric literary he did it his whole life he didn't he didn't burn out to Thompson I think and literary work did you just take it for work yeah I mean you don't have like an issue that you need I think that whenever we have something like chemical speed whenever we have something like alcohol whenever we have something that's not like marijuana or at least marijuana Cuts your Mania you know like whenever you have something else like alcohol or do we need to ask questions as it is taking the pain away and being productive through those actually he's sending your own too and I think the alcohol is very clear it is Iraq Flag City if you do an amount of time release you can make it work how many Americans do that out of the percent that are prescribed Pino I don't know 10% 20% like a dangerous how often you take time off I'd say maybe one or two weeks of every 3-4 months and when you do that to feel weird when I just watch movies so the only way you produce is on speed just the way I want you right now going to be taking its toll on 2010 that were talking about this because there's so many people like you it's it's so, how much of the work that we enjoy today especially literary work is written by people journalistic work is written by people that are on speed that's not new I mean that's what Thompson and Broad and Southern I meant I have created the situation we have too much work and it's my fault I should not be trying to be a professor and also the report a calming music and also at George Mason and also then be hosting like people coming out and also then like we trying to research something that might be my next thing that's too much anyway Thompson for dexedrine was that he could make reality match his effort there was no longer the limit something that might be my next thing that's too much anyway Thompson for dexedrine was that he could make reality matches effort there was no longer the limit it was the American dream idea</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how the connection between aliens and the Nazis took place when do all the start again this is really available to interface in this incredibly diverse Universe with all these Dimensions above and below and all around us with consciousnesses and the truth is no energy has ever destroyed all continues on the our bodies is a fact or a communal Hive organism of all of our ancestors and all of their race memories but not in just some compressed epigenetic system it's beyond that it's an electrochemical antenna they proven this that connects the higher and lower Dimensions show our bodysuit start cuz our our our our previous position without giving us a bodysuit to this them our families are loving us they're holding they're wrapped all around us their strength or will their bad they're good their sins the good things they did the battles they won the battles they lost a woman who loves of the man they love it's all in all these people if I were able to look into so many things and have so many different experiences cancel all the shaman all the ancient religions everybody says there are the good ones that are the bad ones and the MP for interfacing describes the same thing there are bad things that look like elves that have horns when they show you who they really are and there are good things but they don't contact you unless you contact him and then they are almost not even concern what you're doing I never bought into this was what was obsessed with what they were able to do without drugs all the rituals they would do and how they were believed that be on the either like a skull and bones is your Modesto they do rituals and take drugs to talk to the goddesses well there's just appearing as real sexy beautiful women it's whatever you want is the Spirit guides because lower entities will come in and violate your free will God and His angels Witcher below him will not get involved in your everyday life they will not manipulate your free will unless you ask them in the devil masquerade wife are on this planet the third dimension which is a Launchpad all the other dimensions blowing them up the third dimension all that magic shows is is the Primal sea of where all this happen to the Earth like an egg and we've got all this potentiality and got another transmission for a larger plan but evils willing to come in or is it safe to moralize get rid of children don't have kids humans are bad will be will be better once you're all gone can later what's going on so the nazi-soviet the Deepwater chirp they believed they were basically say on seeing and and then it being possessed by entities that it was before the Nazis were where were the Germans that this happened to the Swiss like dated discovered LSD in the thirties these these people were running the psychology departments they were called they were involved in all this crazy stuff I think we should do is because they have high IQs more than that they were psychically connected to each other and would work like rubbish the Chinese and the EU want robots replacing followers and the Chinese are very conscious when the conscience is also very robotic but the Germans are just as robotics so this entity system pick Germans as its attempt also the stuff with the Brits the other was high-tech weapon systems interdimensional with the Germans and so whoever these players are you can dial into if it's very dangerous they're manipulating the British armed forces the German armed and they got the Chinese arm that's almost seems like a robot army and you study at the globalist go to these events and they take bigger and bigger doses of drugs that you electroshock didn't work just in the twenties and thirties and LSD and other hallucinogens and Apothecary they weren't the electroshock they were they were they were a people turn their heart off to like try to communicate with these things to try to be dominant and get that so you go back thousands of years in these temples and interfacing with these palantir Z crystal balls Walmart on drugs looking into glass to then be able to see the future and understand what's happening to give them temporal power over this planet but like the Bible tells you any pharmacy or any of that always leads to destruction cuz only evil is going to come through that way so we're basically have his light socket we can't check into the higher let's start free will not take time we jack in to the evil so you can jack into evil you can't jack into good right away for the quicker it's easier like Yoda says about quicker easier more seductive and so then I remember being a kid and and and my parents will get mad about this is whatever they know they were here at the time but they had friends they knew it UTI or Vale research projects and then and then they were not but they had virtual reality gloves where you put them on and put goggles on and you going to stuff it look like a Holodeck Star Trek 20 years for existed and they were doing surgeries and all this and they would do empathy loads when they say we need the public because we're so weak as the West is so strong people haven't had traumas they sold him low-level over to create drama like you go to Mars you're not getting any gravity what is his 444 what purple You Don't Know Jack Parsons was he real I'm not bullshiting you I'm telling you this is the stuff I don't believe in this okay there it is right there just patented 1957 svr machine widevision and 3D three-dimensional that was already like you see like paper thin TV screens and it was already I talk Alicia there's no way this is human technology she sees foldable phones Samsung Huawei I believe 1957 notice that's exactly what your dad told me that's what are HTC Vive looks like something else happened and I'm not at Liberty to get into it but I was shown three years ago what the University of I was doing under Bill Gates and this is in the 90s were they doing what are used to date that they don't even know what they're being given its intervenience so you think it's some sort of alien intervention type s*** dude they they they take to get even deeper they turn your heart off for 5 minutes and they pump oxygen into your blog and you're in the meeting I'll talk to you when you're in the meetings with fur Elvis is a man grip but they're little by shutting your heart off it makes you have that psychedelic experience by keeping blood in your oxygen is keeps you alive what level what it's like working once you taking it hundreds of times so then they start taking her most psychic people who were able to do this they turn their heart off and then they put them into these these events and and it's like the things they aliens tell him they come out and they tell scientists and it works so they didn't this won't display would come over that at my parents and security and was involved and she talked about yeah we call it a psychedelic research instead of everything was that's really a CIA deal and you know we just can't have people can handle it they're going in the Hills want this and the elves wanted to basically reduce population and a Grizzly certain plans and it's always you well this is what the hell's want is what they're going to do anything special you don't like to San Francisco dictate solder is dude

In which I don't think Trump's bad and I got little things good but I almost think like it's more sophisticated they put him in on it piss everybody off to get the liberals who traditionally been the real location we love everything get chills right now and so imagine Joe I've been on here for 23 years and I'm a new sound I spend for 5 hours every minute number line across leave NBC news that our government gay people literally seen 10,000 articles and documents are more where they're admitting in 1962 The Joint Chiefs of Staff under LL amateur came to President Kennedy there's none PBS and said we're going to blow up buildings shoot up schools and movie theaters and bombed army bases in the Marine bases we're going to have people with their kids with name chains or CIA but that played really lands and there's another plane that's a drone we blow up and then Kennedy says no but his brother says no I'll do it while they killed Kennedy because Bobby said he would but then he got pissed when they kill his brother so Declassified he wanted to bomb the Honduran Embassy and blow up stuff and go to war with my Scouts Bobby was bad to bomb the US Embassy in Honduras this is be classified so imagine you see hundreds of these and then a Sandy Hook happened in your lister's don't buy it and then it's a psychosis where then will because every every man I knew about this. Every man I knew when I was a kid backhanded me and her bath then later I experienced where I had to guess I did the thing I knew it was true and then people made up a whole story because they don't believe anything anymore so that's all I'm trying to say do you need part of it is that even though the stuff does exist it's almost like there's too many things happening for one person to pay attention to all of them and if you're only focusing on the world that the whole world sees conspiracies diseases things are concentrating on primarily this what I'm saying that operate at Northwoods will go into Italy is if you believe that no other conspiracy theory whether they're right or wrong the government conspiracy should be ridiculed you shouldn't there's no special you're right you should instead of looking at them with ribbon. You should look them up jective lie exactly a conspiracy theories are people that don't believe in any Harris Teeter has any of them yes I understand why you're really killing the other ones you don't believe them I think you should be more I don't believe in that s*** but I understand why people do history and all these things to say like I watch the is hard enough for like a year or two but I watch the minions three or four and it's like the sixties and they break on the set of Hollywood in the moon landings makes text now now astronauts died doing that so I was going to ask is that for their family but which one</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> there's only populated some ways up with our technology but let me just make this Jamie Eddie how you doing I'm doing good so what do you what do you think about the wide receiver of the Browns are you familiar with our seven yeah I would say from almost every story even though the stuff we talked about before in the past I don't believe the the official and quote okay don't worry so you know the tower 7 was the third tower that went down you're aware that right information about in the buildings see the video of Tower San Francisco no one saying it's fake footage at the tower 747 story skyscraper f****** phone it be possible that some people are saying that got hit with a direct energy weapon some people are saying that it was brought down like a controlled demo infection Vegas like one of those buildings you know but regardless of how it was brought down you got to look at that video for them to go away. footage on 50 stations in 2001 and I'm sitting there. will be brought down to controlled demolition to save other building to save other buildings and 455 years or Windows I'm crazy then CNN and all of them archive it on the internet Everyone's Watching Builders of them BBC ABC government on the countdown detonation set up already in the building so what happened is it possible that it collapsed because of those gigantic diesel fires right and then the way I want to 277 had they said it was an inferno and they said it cooked through the antenna making YouTube video that the fire had burned through the internal structure of the building at such a high temperature that all of these floors collapsed they pancaked and then it came back I don't know what happened right when you look at it the way it falls it falls exactly like an controlled demolition exactly so it falls from the top down but if you actually watch phosphate right but if you watch the full video the center of it collapses like there's a full video where you looking at the top of the building in the center of it collapses far before the outside. That's how they take me to take out the elevator shafts advance so they knew that 9/11 was going to come in Tuesday answer my question please don't know what they do is they take years ago is it possible that the internal fires in that building were so unbelievably hot that it f***** up every floor and they really did pancake on top of each other turn the exterior structure just collapsed is that possible because I'm not an engineer problem Joe they announce it fell on its own footprint 27 minutes before it did on thin live channels to him BBC world that's real BBC CNN CNN and CBS Joe is the morning on the radio I drove down a little pizza place at 4 got my pizza was eating in the car and I heard CBS Radio driving home and they said little control explosives to the point where you can paint pouring but then I interviewed the head of Emergency Management for Newark and the Loose Change people got him on and he says no I was there they had bombs to see how you know what's right Gyros blow it up and even though and I know Joe says firefighters will it up cuz the government's humazah 2.0 I don't mean my grandpa was in the Army it's is really did pancake from the from the fire s*** design Tower one and two though they were building like bubblegum in like Band-Aids really know all those pills right leaning I don't know big mob scam or no some of our bill for s*** right for sure right back then this is just a lady scientist lady that was based on the video and and and the pictures that she has of where the towers collapse turn the buildings to dust because there was no rubble a dude gave me a book on that</div>

Probably take at least one day off maybe two but you know as well as I do that you are more in tuned when you get older to what your body is telling your brain</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> pensive there's so much involved in the fact that they're willing to do this for years and years before they really sort of activate the political aspect of what they're trying to do it all so it's it's strange if they're so sophisticated about our culture cuz we don't know a goddamn thing about Russia the average person knows Putin bad evil warlord Crimea he invade you know like Wheatley we have like a four-year-old understanding like if you had her if you just grabbed a person random person's for college-educated person and asked describe what's so bad about Russia wow it's like communist over there or something I mean a f****** they hate us first of all the f-bombs like this so little understanding of their culture but yet they know so much about ours that's one of the weird things about being American when you go when you travel overseas and you realize how much that you know about our elections how much they know you don't even know who the f*** there was running their country don't have any idea but they know about Trump and they know that Hillary did and they know that Bernie wants to give the money away and you know it's crazy it's it's it's weird and these people must have like a deep education on American culture American politics 50 beef jerky from February 2018 I've been three kind of big documents that have come out to from Eastern District in one formula Iran on how it all worked out I think I'm another misconception is this notion of $100,000 in ads they spent 18 million dollars in 2017 I believe that came out during another so they're not just the money is not just going for the salaries in the ad by somebody's also going for they were talking about using kind of consultants and this is where you get at this thing that comes out during the stand up for their like black people who are LGBT don't want to see white lgbtq means and and this degree of granularity the degree of sophistication but then also what you see them doing is engage in one-on-one and that's where it crosses a line from social media operation to this is much more like like spying watch The Americans are the Facebook Messenger messages where they're going back and forth with real activists and they're saying things like you know hey my ad account got shut down can you run some ads for me or the hey I want to help your protest where fellow black lives matter activist and we see you're running a protest up and I think it was like Jessica or something Binghamton how can we help you we can give you some money for posters and they're sending money for posters or they reach out to a trump supporter and they say like we you think it'd be really funny to have a Hillary Clinton impersonator sitting in a truck flatbed truck that's made up to look like a jail lettuce and if we give you some money will you find the Hillary Clinton impersonator and put her in jail and do the Hillary for prison thing and so this is another thing that they did was using Facebook events to create real-world protests so they're not limiting it to ship posting online and make attention online they're actually sending people out into the real world to have in Street violence and so one of the things that they did was the coordinated Facebook event one for the Texas secessionist page and one for the there's a pro-muslim called United Muslims and on the same day at the same time in Texas they have a rally to support Texas culture and resist the islamization of Texas across the street rally to defend Muslim culture and so they like there's literally no answer they just create these Facebook events on these pages and then they promote them with a dollars and other things and and you literally could going to look at the Texas reporting from that day I don't remember if it was dozens or hundreds but it's sufficient number of people showed up that they had literally on opposite sides of barricades police officers and screaming at each other because one group is there for the nation of Texas in the other group is there to like defend Muslim culture so you get to Reno to opposite sides of the Spectrum in the same place at the same time and you literally Insight like a mini Riot so they were there there about eighty one of these events were they were holding a black lives matter style rallies for victims of violence police violence memorials for people who were killed by police officers unit things with Real Americans would do but this wasn't being done by Rihanna Octonauts that's the Insidious thing right is is how does how does Facebook detect that how did you know how do you when you see this come to defend Texas culture and you're a die-hard proud Texan you you're not thinking like the idea that this was just some memes is just not it it it doesn't respond significance of what they were trying to do and how effective that they were with these other things or even if they're just trying it out just a little bit just working to see what works they're always experimenting they're always trying to find ways to create that tension and that's the thing that I think is so interesting about this right this involvement ideas and information War where these tactics involved and you are really at a disadvantage when it comes to actually detecting them turn on the outside if you looking at that you'd say what can what is the objective why would they have this Texas secession is Paige across or rally across the street from a pro-islam rally why would they do that you know if you're on the outside you think about the amount of effort that's involved doing something like this and they also doing this with no leaders right there's no one there that's running it when they get there and so all the protections people do here we are couple times there were comments on some of the like archive pages and things where you could see the screenshots of people being like doo doo head it's all come out there and like nobody showed up black matters Us. Com which I think is still active it's dormant they're not updating it but I believe you can go in and read it and it was designed to call attention to police brutality type things and then there's the black matters Facebook page the Twitter account Instagram page that YouTube channel this SoundCloud podcast the Tumblr that do blackouts they were actually really cute very well done so you have this entire fake media ecosystem that they've just created out of whole cloth all theirs and then what they start to do as they start to put up job ads and so it's come be a designer for us come ba come right for us come photograph are protests come you know they kind of like couple different logos the same way you would if you were starting a you know media brand they start posting ads for do you want to be a calendar girl send us your photos do you want to be on a black reality TV show send us video clips of you do you like they begin to do real work to ingratiate themselves with a community that a physical fitness thing is called Black Fist and the idea was that it was listen to ask in that it was supposed to teach black people how to handle themselves at protest should there be police violence how to fight back and they actually went and found a guy of physical fitness so you know martial arts guy and they were paying him via PayPal so he was running classes for the black community under this Black Fist brand and they would like text him or call him he play tone of voice mails on TV actually heard them after my report came out I think they track him down and he just talks about how they can adjust PayPal do you know couple hundred bucks every time you're at a fitness class this has to be a fake YouTube channel and it was a is called a word of truth I think of the name of it and so Williams and Calvin these two guys would would give their word of Truth and their word of Truth was usually about you know how f***** up America is which I mean they're they're very real grievances underlying all of this and that's a problem right they have things to exploit they were definitely paying them and they are going to channel seems likely channels organized yeah they were in on it they knew what they were doing that right before the midterms like maybe even the day before the timeline here and he made a different video saying he wanted this was amazing thing he wanted to leave the internet research agency he was saying I'm basically I'm tired of doing this work I want to I want to do a leak I want to show you all of the things that the internet research agency is done and so they actually put out this so this guy who'd been in the Williams and Calvin videos of people recognize his face in the 2018 midterms goes and says he wants to leave and he's going to leak all this information and and he wants to like I don't remember all the specifics cuz it was right before my thing came out and I was so busy working but he's saying he wants to expose the truth and I think most people didn't cover it didn't pay attention YouTube shut down the channel deleted the video immediately level well what wound up coming out this is me this is so convoluted I'm sorry I know it's like hard to explain without visuals what they wound up doing what they did drop a bunch of Doc's so they did release a pile of documents in which they claim they actually hacked the Mueller investigation and Mueller had nothing and so this is again another kind of convoluted piece of this where they do release information and end so in this particular example release information that we believe they actually got through legal Discovery so the documents that the investigation provided to one of the indicted Russians were the documents that they then leaked claiming they had hacked Mueller investigation so they're constantly doing these things to generatepress generate attention create just that degree of people don't know what's real or they read the headlines that are then released by The More propagandist We over Russian propaganda and they think that is the true story that that that is that the Russians hacked the Mueller investigation so there's always this how do we create fear uncertainty and doubt how do we throw people off how do we come up with these extremely convoluted spy games that leave people feeling unbalanced that make people wonder what they can trust who they can trust and what's real and even if somebody who looks at the stuff you know day in and day out for years spy games that leave people feeling unbalanced that make people wonder what they can trust who they can trust and what's real and even if somebody who looks at the stuff you know day in and day out for years I do still regularly get surprised by the by the sheer kind of baldness and Ingenuity of you know some of the stuff</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is that the Russians were very much invested in having Trump win right and if they were very much invest in having Trump win with was the reason why they focus so heavily on the African-American Community because of how African-American Community traditionally seems to vote Democrat so they were trying to do something to break that up or trying to do something to weekend the position of the that you know the incumbent worker Hillary Clinton and maybe put some emphasis on Stein or some alternative candidates at the political campaign the plug life actor that played out so they established they start building these relationships in 2015 and the other doing the tribal thing we've got are in group or part of this community and now you start to see them do is there was a tiny tiny cluster in the early primaries were they were supporting Rand Paul and then they pivot to Trump pretty quickly can use and probably Rand Paul just didn't pull well in there like there's no way to get a lift your butt but maybe Trump was getting you some actual left in the media and So Sushi to move into supporting Trump and then for the remainder of the data set 4 from 2015 through the end which was mid 2017 or so when this thing ends it's it's adamantly pro-trump on the right and on the right you see not only pro-trump but you see them really working till like a road support for me traditional Republicans traditional conservatives you see a lot of the memes about like are you with the conservatives or the conservatives in there you know and so the conservatives of course they're like they've got pictures of Lake Lindsey Graham and John McCain John McCain John McCain shows up a million times and Marco Rubio Ted Cruz because there was concern that she would know things that she was saying about increasing freedoms in Russia were very threatening they thought the best bet to get sanctions removed was Trump so they had specific outcomes that they were hoping for and that was one of the you know there's always like a political motivation so there is this narrative around they just want to kind of like screw in American society support for Trump and Eve more than that the clear disdain for Hillary Clinton there is not on Facebook and Instagram there was not one single pro-hillary post there was somebody Trump post because if you're running an LGBT page of course they're going to say negative things about Trump you know and and they're saying it so you should vote for Jill Stein there was early support until the left-leaning pages for Bernie Sanders but you actually see the support for Bernie Sanders come in more after it becomes clear that he's not going to win Thunder using Bernie Sanders as a way to say this was stolen from him biting Bill Clinton's or Jill Stein you know he was a true a true independent real liberal how we should be voting for her if you want to support a woman so there is feminism Pages really pushing this Narrative of Jill Stein so you've the left-leaning pages total ENT Clinton and then you have the right-leaning Pages staunchly Pro Trump and also strongly Auntie Cruise Auntie Rubio Auntie Lindsey Graham basically auntie now it's called establishment Republican and there's this kind of pushing a people to opposite opposite ends of the political Spectrum this is where you get at the conversation around facilitating polarisation so not just it wasn't enough to just support Donald Trump it was also necessary to strongly disparage the kind of traditional conservative moderate write in the course of amplifying the Trump candidacy does that make sense to me watching the election was trying to figure out is this because Trump is so bombastic and he's so outrageous and he's just a different person that the way I was describing on stage was that like finally the assholes have a king because they never had a king before I like everyone who was running for president was least mostly dignified I mean basically it's really difficult to go back in time and find someone who isn't find someone who'd there's no one who insults people like he does me and he insult people's appearances he calls them losers he called Stormy Daniels horse face I mean he's had some outrageous s*** so part of it was me thinking like while maybe he's just ignited and emboldened I actually have this conversation with my wife today she was like it feels like racism is more prevalent like it's more more accepted people feel more emboldened because they're in their mind they think he is racist I can get away with more things Trump is President like there's actually videos of people saying racist s*** and saying hey Trump's president now we can do that so I was thinking that we'll maybe that's what it was just sort of like some rare flower that only blooms under the right conditions poop is back right but when you think about influence of these pages of had in establishing communities and this long game that they're playing like the LGBT Pages even though they're sitting on Trump there really want to support Jill Stein because they know that'll actually help Trump because it'll take both away from Hillary Clinton that they it seems different like political discourse discussions online and social media the way social media reacted there's a lot of people that were anti-obama I before either of his election so he won but it seemed different seem different to me than this one this one seems like like we had moved into another level of hostility that never experienced before and another level of division between the right and the left that I never experienced before and up like a willingness to engage with really harsh nasty comments and the dive into a newt see it all day I mean there's there's certain Twitter followers that I think they're pretty much human beings but I would follow them and they would just be engaged with people all day long just shiting on people and criticizing this and insulting that and it seemed like it seem dangerous it seems like things had moved into a much more aggressive much more hostile and confrontational sort of chapter American history if this is all done at the same time it is happening how much of an influence do you think this Ira agency had on all the stuff what people said in response to the stuff so I looked at now almost 200,000 of these posts as I spent most of last year doing this was this was this research and we can see that they have thousands of Engagement thousands of comments thousands of shares we have no idea what happened afterwards and that's the problem so went once the stuff comes down it's really hard to go back and piece it together so I can see that are some of the pressure point that the really really just f****** horrible troll accounts that they ran they didn't necessarily have a lot of followers but you see them in there like adding people so there you know at and then the name of the reporter at the name of a prominent person and so they're in their kind of like draft on the popularity of you know famous people basically and they're just saying like horrible s*** and it's the tone is so spot-on profile information which was also made public they would have liked to have a gap account and they're in their profile that was like so they would it was a remarkable piece of of of of the culture in which you see that like they're actually sitting on gab to write it and so they can also go and they can draw on there and read it there's you know 900 or something troll accounts were found on Reddit there on Tumblr and so they're just picking the most divisive content and they're pushing into communities and at the same time we can see that they're doing it but we can't see what people do in return we can't see do they just block did they have the fight back did was there a huge you know when this happens on a Facebook page and they're doing something like telling black people not to vote as black people we shouldn't vote what do people say in response and that's the piece that we don't have so when we talk about impact a lot of the impact conversation is really focused did the swing the election we don't have nothing that I've seen has the answer to that question the other thing is that the second question the thing when I think about impact I think from from I think you and I agree on this it also matters how does this change how people relate to each other and we have no real evidence of there being no information on that either this is the kind of thing that lives in some meal Facebook has it the rest of us haven't seen it no or most of these people is asthma Facebook is it mostly Twitter aware what is out of the breakdown of which about 6 million were original content created by about 3,800 accounts there were about a hundred 3333 Instagram accounts with 16,000 posts and then 81 Facebook pages 17 YouTube channels without 1100 videos and so they got about 200 million engagement on Instagram in about another seventy-five million or so on Facebook engagement or like like shares comments reactions you know so it's hard to contextualize what we think happened and you can go and you can try to look at how well did this content perform relative to other real authentic targeting these communities and what you see with the black community in particular is their Instagram game was really good they're so they're on their Instagram accounts the you know the top five three of them targeted the black community in. You know tens 200 millions of engagements so I have to pull up the exact number Instagram you can't really share so it's amazing that they got the kind of Engagement they did even without the sharing function one of the things you can do is if you know the names of the accounts and their lot of them out there publicly now you can actually see them in regram apps so people were regramming the content so Facebook says about 20 million people to engage with Instagram content but what isn't included in that is all of the re grams of the contest 4shared by other accounts so the spread in the dispersion of this it's an interesting thing to try to quantify cuz we have engagement data but we don't know did it change hearts and Minds we don't know if it's influence people to go follow other accounts we don't know if it influence people to not vote there's just so much more I think still too to understand about how these operations work sooner had some impact right I mean is as you were saying earlier when a new person enters into a conversation that it changes the tone of it how much of what they did was their own original post and how much of it was commenting on other people's posts so they created a lot of their own stuff particularly in early days and so you can actually read the data set and one of the things when we started finding these posts I was struck by how sometimes it read like ESL and then sometimes it read like perfect Flawless professional English and then other times it red like normal English vernacular just the way that we would talk to each other and I started digging into what that was so when it was vernacular English American American English it was usually crib from somewhere else so they would go and they would find a local news story from some obscure local paper and they would crib and then they would paste that and then to the Facebook post would be that cribbed a sentence from that article and then there meme maybe they would a sentence underneath it to give it some kind of contacts triangle when they would write their own stuff you would see the sloppiness that's where you could see subject-verb agreement not quite there the you know in which like Russian possessives are different than American possessives the slips there and then the other thing was the really funny stuff which was you know about the post that supposed supposedly written by Texas secessionist right so you can probably have an image of the Texas secession is in your mind as I say and it would be things like Hillary Clinton is a terrible individual and as a as a terrible individual it's completely impossible for us to back her and her candidacy for the American are there more boys or more are going it is clear that you like in English in college or something and see you as you read Communications online like Cantina does this does this read like an American does this read like a communication and what we started to see you as one way to not get caught for your lousy English or your you know how your cultural lack of kind of Native Native abilities is to just repurpose other people stuff and so that's where you would seem memes getting shared from on both the right on the left you know you see a lot of these like Turning Point USA memes that they were repurposing and pushing out or you would see occupy Democrats or the other 98% so memes from Real American Paige's real American culture and they would just sometimes slap a new logo on and just repost it as if it was theirs so it does in those instances read just like you know the right on the left you know you see a lot of be like Turning Point USA memes that they were repurposing and pushing out or you would see occupy Democrats or the other 98% so memes from Real American Pages real American culture and they would just sometimes slap a new logo on and just reposted as if it was theirs so it does in those instances Regis like you know authentic American content and in many ways it is authentic American content</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and I was utterly stunned I had to listen to it twice cuz I just couldn't do it let's get it let's get into this from the beginning how did this start out how did you start researching these online Russian trolls and Bots and in all this Jazz activity in California because Vicodin I wanted to you know put on preschool this is going to fit with the parents basically someone who fascinates and I started looking at the way that small groups were able to kind of disproportionately amplify messages on social channels and some of this was through very legitimate activity and then some of it was through really kind of coordinated deliberate attempts to kind of game is at algorithms were amplifying content amplifying particular types of narratives and and I started writing about it and I end up writing about ways in which #gaming ways in which people were kind of using automation to be in #all the time so it's kind of a way to really gain control of share voice and what that meant when very small groups of people could achieve this kind of phenomenal application and what the pros and cons of that work and then 2015 so the way that that this sort of awareness of social me Alan just came up came about was actually when I was working this other people were looking at it from the same looking at the same tactic but how they were being used by ISIS by the terrorist organization and they're also you had this very small group of people that manage to use Bots and applications really kind of owning a narrative really push this is Brandon digital kalafut to kind of build it on all social platforms almost simultaneously and the ways in which information was hopping from one platform to another through kind of deliberate coordination and then also just wait information flows kind of contagion style Roundup working on thinking about how the government was going to respond to the challenge of terrorist organizations using American Social platforms to spread propaganda so what we came to realize was that there was just this information ecosystem and it had involved in a certain way over. Of about 8 years or so and the kind of unintended consequences of that and the way that Russia came into the conversation was around October 2015 when we were thinking about what what to do about Isis what to do about terrorism and interest you know kind of proliferation on social platforms this was right around when Adrian Chen had written the article the agency for the New York Times and that was one of the first big expose is of the internet research agency the first time in American journalists have gone over there and actually met the trolls been in St Petersburg and began to write about what was happening over there and the ways that they had is that were targeting certain facets of American culture so while we were in DC talking about what to do about terrorists using these platforms to spread propaganda there were beginning to be Rumblings that Russian intelligence and universities were doing the same thing and so the question became can we think about ways in which the internet is vulnerable to this type of manipulation by anyone and then and then come up with ways to stop him so that was how the other Russia investigation began with play around 2015 a handful of people started looking for evidence of Russian Bots and trolls on social platforms 2015 essentially it's only been alive for I mean what was Twitter 2007 I believe so 8 years like eight years of social media and then all the sudden they figured out how to game the system and then they figured out how to use this to make people argue against each other so there was this. If you go back to like like geocities and they always been you know kind of we wanted and so there's this kind of consolidation as a social platforms kind of came into existence content creators were really excited about the fact that now they not only had this this taxes to write their own stuff but they also had access to this audience because as the network effects. More and more pronounced more and more people came to be on social platforms and it wasn't even Facebook remember it was like being friends to her and my space and social networks kind of involved when I was in college Facebook was still limited to like I have like Ivy League schools and so I was ineligible and as you watch this consolidation happen you start to have this information ecosystem really dominated by a handful of companies that grow very large because they're providing a service that people really want but there's a mass consolidation of audiences on to this Hansel flatworms really interesting for regular people who just want to find their friends Elsa becomes really interesting for propagandists and trolls and in this case terrorist organizations and state intelligence Services instead of reaching the entire internet they really just kind of have to concentrate their efforts on a handful platforms so that consolidation is one of the things that kind of kicks off some of the more than one of the reasons we had these problems today minor platforms other than YouTube I mean anything you can tell it's an actual person like YouTube that is a problem right because you can see it's an actual person as your Saviour narrating something you know if you're in front of the camera and explaining things people you're going to know that you're an actual human being whereas there's so many these accounts that I'll go to like how I watch people get involved in these little online beef with each other and then I'll go to some of these accounts like this doesn't seem like a real person and I'll go and it's like #maga there's a American Eagle in front of a flag tag and then you read their stuff like wow this is this is probably a Russian troll account and it's strange like you feel like you're not supposed to be seeing those like you seen the wiring under the Border something and then you'll go through the timeline and all they're doing is engaging people and arguing you know for Trump and against you know whatever the f*** they're angry about whatever it whatever it is that's being discussed and they're they're basically just like some weird little argument mechanism 2016 there's a lot of that during the presidential campaign right and there were there was so much that was written you know we can go back to the free speech thing we were kind of talking about before there's so much I was written about harassment rolling and negativity and these kind of hordes of accounts that would Brigade people and ask them into the Russian operation in it started on Twitter in about 2014 actually so 2013-2014 internet research agency is targeting Russian people so they're tweeting in Russian at Russian and Ukrainian folks people in their sphere of influence so they're already on their they're already trying this out what they're doing is they're creating these these these accounts it's kind of wrong to call them because they are real people they're just not what they appear to be so I think the unfortunate has become like cyborg like semi-automated you know sometimes it's automated sometimes it's a real person but a sock puppet is the other way that we can refer to a person pretending to be somebody else say happy sock puppets and they're out there and they're tweeting in 2014 about the Russian annexation of Crimea or about mh17 that plane that went down with Russia unicorns have no idea what happened and it wasn't their fault at all and gradually as they begin to experience what I imagine they thought of was SAS that's when you see some of these accounts pivot to Target Americans and sew in 20 late 2014 early 2015 you start to see the this try to do that for a long time had been very inwardly focused making their own people think a certain way or feel certain way or have a certain experience on the internet it begins to to spread out it begins to to look outwards and so you start to see these accounts communicating with Americans and as we were going through the data set switch the Twitter date public anyone can go and look at it at this point you do see some of the accounts that are kind of you know that we're that were somewhat notorious for being really virulent nasty trolls and be submitted trolls going after journalists to know some of these accounts being revealed as actually being Russian trolls see that they're mimicking Vester using that same style of tactic that harassment to to get a real people simply make another account that use some sort of you know what is it a virtual virtual server what is that called and it probably also emboldens the actual Mara controls because they're going to go out a little bit further than everybody else a little bit crazier and it kind of changes the tone of discourse Within These communities that are arguing about a certain subject things get nastier and their get nastier because of the interference of these trolls igate seems like they've they've actually managed to not just cause a lot of discourse but to change the way people are interacting with each other and to make it it just make it more vicious so what they're doing is are operating in communities so one of the really common criticisms if you know people who live people think that this didn't have a huge impact did it's from the election we have no idea but the what it does do in the communities that at Target is it can change that tone and that's where you see it's it's amazing everybody probably had this experience nothing just that these are not real people who are joining the group and so there's this opportunity to tip to be no kind of expand the bounds of Tolerance just that little bit more or try to normalize using particular ways of communicating that maybe a group wouldn't naturally gravitate to but then it does so there are definitely ways in which any any type of children that doesn't have to be a Russian troll has this ability to kind of just the language of the communities of the the culture just a little bit know when did the why did the agency do this and do we do we know do we have someone who's ever left their or become a whistleblower who can give us some information about what the Mandate was and how it was carried out marketing agency plus tactics that we would not expect a social media marketing agency to use things that are a little more like what you would expect to see from an intelligence agency so besides just making your pages in your blogs on your social post they're also in their kind of connecting with real people and real activists and pretending to be something that they're not to develop kind of a one-on-one relationship but most of the most of the whistleblowers who have come out lyudmila savchuk she wrote an expose I believe on this and it's described as being much like you would expect if you were doing social media groundwork you have a certain number post per day you know you're driving trying to get a certain amount of Engagement you're trying you got a kind of your quotas are most people are young Millennials the people that work there are well-versed in trolling culture there well-versed in Internet culture you know they're up to speed on like popular memes and things like that and so you see this the other thing that they do is that they talk about in Mueller indictment you see some really interesting descriptions of like the stand-ups that they have stand-up is a thing to do tech company already kind of stands up and talk about your goals and responsibilities and block or something and any stand-up they would be sitting there saying things like if you're targeting black LGBT people make sure you don't use white people in your in your image and you're mean because that's going to trigger them rules for Uno for communicating authentically in an American Community which is you know online and you sometimes they're very specific ways in which a community expects a member of that Community to communicate and buy the eastern district of Virginia the the degree of granularity that they have to recognize that if you are running a LGBT page and your memes of white people you're going to cause some tension and consternation and assuming that that's not necessarily what you want to be doing you should go find a meme of black LGBT people to put in the united to put as Your Meme for the day so there's a lot of there's a lot of sophistication there's a lot of understanding of American culture and then there's a lot of understanding of trolling culture and so these things combined to be a rather effective coming sort of narrative that they're trying to pursue their trying to push for the Senate and the Senate data came from the platforms so what I had was the attribution was made by the platforms it wasn't like Renee deciding this was Ira it was the platforms giving it to a tour government and the information in there what it showed was that across all platforms across Eric Ross Facebook Instagram YouTube they were building up tribes so they were really working to create distinct communities of distinct types of Americans and that would be for example there's an LGBT page that is very much about LGBT Pride there is Millennial lesbian was the voice so it was a lot of you know memes of LGBT actresses and they would brand it with a specific brand mark it was a rainbow heart LGBT United was the name of the patient had a matching Instagram account which would also expect to see from a media property right you would expect them to see in both places and really besides those sometimes walking English virtually indistinguishable from what you would read on any kind of like young Millennials focused social page it wasn't none of it was Radical or divisive it wasn't like the way that they got the division across was they built these tribes were they're reinforcing in group dynamics so if the LGBT page you have numerous pages you knew that was where they spent most of their energy a lot of pages targeting far-right so both old far-right meaning people who are very concerned about what is the future of America look like and then young far right which was much more Angry much more like trolling culture so they recognize there's a divider that the kinds of means you're going to use to Target younger right-wing audiences are not the same kind of means you're going to use to Target older audiences so there's a tribe for older right-wing younger wink and the black community there's a Baptist tribe there's a black liberation tribe there's a black women tribe there's one for people who have incarcerated spouses there is a brown brown power Italy was the name of it page that was very much about Mexican and Chicano culture there was Native Americans United this was not a a short-term thing is started these pages and 2014-2015 timeframe most of them they started some other ones that were much more political later we can talk about the election if you want to but with this tribal thing you're building a serious thing like as black women in America this is yours posts about things that we care about his post about black hair Hurst post about child rearing his posts about fashion and culture and then every now and then there would be a post that would reinforce like as black people we don't do this and so or as LGBT people we don't like this and so you're building this reports like me and you were having a conversation we're developing a relationship on this page overtime and then I say like as this kind of person we don't believe this so it's a way to subtly influence by appealing to an in-group dynamic or peeling to like as members of this tribe as LGBT people of course we hate Mike Pence as black people of course we're not going to vote because you know we hate Hillary Clinton because we hate her husband as as people who are concerned about the future of America is Texas secessionists you know so everything is presented as members of this tribe we think this as members of this tribe we don't think this for a lot of the Pelosi they're not even political they were just sort of affirming the standards of the tribe so they're kind of setting up this whole long game and then once they got everybody on board of how many followers are these do these Pages have eight pages on Facebook and 133 Instagram accounts and I would say maybe 30 of the Facebook page has had over a thousand followers which is not very many and then maybe the top 10 had upwards of $500,000 no there's no somebody run any social campaign sometimes you've hid sometimes your flops as you would see them repurpose them so they would decide you know the same way if you're running a social media agency while we got this audience this page isn't doing so well that's like rebranded a little bit change it up try to try to make it appeal to somebody else 133000 of them and I was there is a cluster of images of Kermit the Frog look at the hell is Kermit the Frog doing in here and so I so the night goes out of the screen and I I want you to turn it into a database that we could track things a little bit more easily across the platform spot so I was cost of Kermit the Frog memes and I don't I look and I realize that the third tributed to an account called Army of Jesus that's all that's interesting. hell's going on here I keep going through it hundreds of Kermit memes and then I get to a post where they say like this page is owned by Homer Simpson now Kermit went to jail for being like I don't know that they made some like some joke was stupid and all the sudden the data set turns into Homer Simpson memes that we can like this kind of raunchy Homer Simpson show me a Jesus a Jesus focused page until like nine hundred posts in so they they just rename the account at some point I used to be called nuts news and then they nuts news was what they called it when it was the Kermit the Frog meme page and then I get to repurpose when they realize Kermit's not doing it it's not getting the audience they want Homer Simpson's not getting the audience engagement they want and then they pave it over to Jesus and then all of a sudden they start you know the lights and and things start pouring in so what they're doing is there actually like deliberately or they're just creating placeholders it's kind of a red flag when a brand new account that was created yesterday somebody starts talking about some highly politically divisive thing or whatever but if you lay the groundwork you do it over. Of 2 years and somebody who goes and checks to see what the account was where it came from how old it is is going to see something that's 2 years old so it's an opportunity to create almost like sleeper accounts where you create them now and then you activate them politicize them you'd actually put them to use a couple years in the future so it's all kinds of we saw this over and over again there was a black guns matter account that turned into an anonymous account at one point they were pretending to be anonymous you know the half of it so they repurposed this black guns matter page which just had it was I was advocating that black people buy weapons and and Carrie and like a pro-second Amendment page but for the black community and they took that page I'm getting I got a ton of Engagement and it became was called exact name of the anonymous page and I don't want to say it was something that's legit into an anonymous page and when they do that do they go back and repurpose the content of the earlier posted a change more insight into a we could see you again you know you think if you started following an army of Jesus page you know this raunchy Kermit from like a year ago that would raise some Flags I would assume that they scrubbed it and restart it but I don't know your podcast with Sam changed how I look at a lot of the pages that I actually follow cuz I follow some pages like that have classic cars or something like that and then I'll see them in most of it is just photographs of cars like beautiful old cars and it'll have you know them giant following and then all the sudden something of your political and I'll look at it and go wow like this is probably one of those weird accounts like they're getting people to get engaged with it because it represents something they're interested in like classic muscle cars and then they use it for activism they use it for 2 to get this narrative across is like you want people to be aware that the stuffings us but you don't want them to be paranoid that it's people deserve to be aware but they deserve to understand how this plays out the flip side of that is you do end up in these weird and you see it happen on social media now or click into a trump tweet and you'll see like you're right caught this is this is one of the challenges with running disinformation campaign so I did it makes it really hard for people to know what's real after the fact that leaves you a little bit off-balance right feel like you know when you feel like you can't quite tell what's real and that's part of the goal is to make you not have not feel entirely balanced and in your information environment is as real as this not and so in some ways there's not much not much downside to doing this because you do you know if you either knock it out of the park and you influence the election and you influence people and you have this secret covert operation going on for years or you get caught and then there's a you know until there's some confidence in the ability of platforms to detect this stuff There's real concern among everybody that that you're in your account or something fake</div>

I once you know Lodi one-sided was going to do if people don't know that they try to do it two arms but with two arms it bounces out and then it's really just a gripping a leg exercise a little bit last and traps but really what you want to do is 1/100 pounder on one hand carry that b**** it's great we do and my gym up a lot of that where we load one side of the time one of the things I love to hear is a guy with a man I never see you doing the same thing yeah like Rob pretty much don't because I don't want to fall into a rather complacent adaptation you know so even if they do you do like only lips once every two months but I'm doing variations out that like a shovel deadlift or suitcase deadlift I suck and like you said are not glamorous I'll throw those in a bunch but you much cardio here's how I knocked out cardio is I have a formula with this program, and website rentals in people can sign up for you by the ebook what's the website calm and the formula is work in working anaerobic chunks and circuits in your metabolic special to meet anaerobic go and then like 30-35 minutes so that doesn't include warm up you know so you could whatever it is for me it's like bag work or something to warm up just to make sure loosey-goosey the older you are the more you have to warm up man damn don't jack yourself up as call Fitness not Brokenness yeah people that's another thing that people don't like to do because it's not glamorous and because people get lazy they don't want to do that work out where that the Pre-Workout they don't want to do all the skipping rope and although just switching stances and jumping jacks and all that stuff but you really need to break a sweat a real sweater before you actually start losing weight people don't like do because it's not glamorous and because these people get lazy they don't want to do that work out where that the Pre-Workout they don't want to do all the skipping rope and all the just switching stances and jumping jacks all that stuff but you really need to break a sweat a real sweater before you actually start lifting weights and then even if you lift weights or do anything like save going to do get kettlebells I'll start off with 35 lb I'll do everything nice and light at first I don't start off heavy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Envision yourself doing something along these lines like teaching tactical stuff or I went through some rough patches as most guys do right man I'm morphed into who I am only like the past six or seven years I retired No 5 I got hired before even retired by a corporation to do training stuff and I kind of fell almost falling into that right of accepting mediocrity plus what I didn't know is that depression I didn't know that I've no idea especially in like the spec ops world you guys are tired because you've been there in in in units with guys with the same guys for a long long time and you there's a level of intimacy there that can't be replicated with another human being and then when you retired miss that, that connection so I had working for a corporation had a really bad relationship I was living in the bonus room of my garage I lived there for 5 Years cuz I had chemistry and so the neural receptors are freaking gone I mean delusional and and it was it was real bad and then I started boozing with depression and a lot of things happened at one time my local cops save my life they said do you need to get the f*** out of there and a bunch of things happened all at once this is in 2013 I didn't want to leave because I love kids so I didn't want to stay there and and just wither wither away Darkness 8:00 at night and I had an epiphany I said you know what I can't I can't do this and I will not I remember saying it's myself I will I will not be defeated I will not be defeated and I put my run shoes by the side of my bed and shorts set my alarm clock got up early next morning and went for a run Forrest Gump and a pound payment for about ten or twelve miles water you know I like it wrong I like Sprint and when I came back from the Run workout my driver for about an hour and my local cops came and they came and said hey bro get the f*** out the kids be alright you need to do this and that and then I started kind of figure it out re-evaluating my path in life o back up a step I got also got laid off from this Corporation and you know where the guy in the military ever think about job security and whenever tired of working for a corporation that was mostly were cut made up of retired military guys so you get laid off me like what am I going to do all that s*** happen the same time bad events and man I was able to I was able to rekindle my own my own my own fire cuz I recognize all right bro you still got to Amber you still got this all you need to do is nurture that and turn it into a flame turn into a flame and then just start adding would add more Dad wouldn't ill becomes get the Perpetual Blaze and it which led me to this thing that I tell people now you know what it is that you got to keep the blaze alive I've got that on t-shirts even because I like I like to kick people in the ass who are willing to sustain their own fire once they get that ass-kicking if they can't if they can't keep the fire going then it's not worth it's not worth it for me you know it took to keep kicking him in the ass but yeah so ever since that point in time they are getting laid off a depression the booze and I was able to ReDiscover me and Rebrand and and pretty much time from scratch I mean I had to start life all over again when I was 48 years old wow at the whole thing from and I discovered like social media and all this stuff cuz I met a gal and I'm married to her now and she's probably the best one of the best human beings I've ever met you know all around human being so she was able to help me with that said hey you need to do this you need to get this social media platform of that one and so it's it's it detonated pretty well considering I've been on a short amount of time but apparently the message is resonating so genuine genuine it out I love that that's my favorite thing when everybody is prone to mistakes and prone to depression and people are prone to hitting rock bottom GIF your life can go down a series of bad roads and you find yourself in a bad relationship or a bad job a bad situation life and it's very very difficult that moment to have faith and confidence that you can readjust reconsider and and re-engage and that's what you did that's awesome I love that I love those kind of stories I love when people get the s*** together and I think that that helps me help other people I could relate and I don't even share with them but I empathize and that's sometimes that's all it takes any empathize and and you just give them just a little bit of the right advice just a little bit you do not too much can you workout your driveway so you got a good day and that's sometimes all you need to do and decide this is what I do for now and I have good days tomorrow's going to be another good day and I'm going to force myself into another good day and the next thing you know I've got some momentum break you got some momentum you could change everything in my life I felt like I could slip the wrong way and I just I see it I see the dark hole when I go f*** that I just go the other the other way the problem isn't people fall into that dark hole they think that that defines them what's the doesn't break it doesn't Define you it's just you right now you could be totally different tomorrow you're a human being again thank you can adjust and there's so much Inspirations one of

did using data from the World Health Organization or sub to call the institute for health metrics and evaluation which is based in Seattle Washington that found something very surprising in that is most of the world's poverty related diseases are not necessarily in the poorest most devastated countries of Africa being like Democratic Republic of Congo or Central African Republic but on the numbers basis most of these poverty-related diseases are actually in the G20 economies the 20 wealthiest economies together with Nigeria which is not a G20 country but has an economy bigger than the bottom three or four so that was pretty amazing amazing for me to find that out because you know at first I didn't believe the numbers because I said well I'm going to be at their poverty related diseases why are they in the 20 wealthiest economies and then Arie that it's among the poor living in wealthy countries so the poorest of the Rich today now, for most of the world's poverty related diseases and what what's the cause of this so why why the link with poverty so that's a great one of the things I do in the book is about poverty that's making you susceptible I don't think we really know what I mean clearly in some cases if you live in poor dilapidated housing without window screens mosquitoes and kissing bugs and sand flies can get inside the house or if you look in Emporia neighborhood so I can turn around Houston you see a lot of environmental degradation or around the neighborhood UC discarded tires that read it is chipped by mosquito or standing water but I don't know what are the tires do one of the best habitats for the mosquito that transmits Dengue and zika and Chikungunya and yellow fever are discarded tires that's what they'll oh so this you know if you go into poor neighborhoods you'll see a lot of Tire dumping for instance and that's those are habitats for that that 80s Egypt by mosquitoes blood in urine Southern California was it when water gets in a tire a year-and-a-half two years and the pool has not been taken care of and I went out into the pool and it was green and there were schools of mosquitoes on going to heaven mosquito heaven you won't but many counties probably probably some of the poorest counties poor District you still do I mean in terms of the way it is on the East Coast like I grew up in Boston and then the summer time you should have f****** mosquitoes everywhere that they just can't get away from them and then I've been to Alaska which is the craziest place I've ever been to In My Life in terms of mosquitoes right have you been I haven't been to Alaska but hilarious Southern super aggressive in their they're also very large the big problem is on the Gulf Coast of the us we have that Pages jipped by mosquito and that's why I got so worried about zika virus hitting the gulf coast of the US mosquitoes and other countries obviously contain malaria mean we've been very fortunate that that's never made it over to hear we used to have malaria used to be widespread in the United States both the one that was a real killer disease called out super malaria on the go coast and even up into Illinois in the Ohio River Valley we had a lot of malaria in fact there's a hole there's a book written by Dickens when he visited the United States called Martin chuzzlewit Noni describes all these sickly people in Illinois and Cairo Illinois on the Confluence of the Mississippi in the Ohio River you clearly describing malaria why so what you're very nice book written by a medical historian at Duke University named Margaret Humphreys call malaria race and poverty and she has a hypothesis what I think she's on to something that hit the decrease the malaria dropped in associate with aggressive Economic Development so that the FDR's New Deal included something called the agricultural adjustment act that got people off of off with a in Pursuit and put them into factories quality housing went up and that's probably what caused a lot of the reduction in these tropical diseases members are really diseases of poverty I spend a lot of time working in China and I'm seeing that play out right now in China in a China his cats is very very aggressive program of Economic Development mostly in the eastern part of the country but in the southwest part of the country going to Yunnan Sichuan province has you go back in time 75 years and you still see those diseases solsprint do you think that the best cure or the best way to stop malaria would be just to increase the economy of these areas in Africa with their experience yet clearly economic development is a very potent driver know what it is about Economic Development we still don't have our arms around that yet but economic development is very important just like for the neglected tropical diseases we study but you know unfortunately for many countries economic development is still decades away so that's why that's the rationale for developing these is it because of Economic Development moves people into more urban environment for those less tropical diseases urbanized environments like you know yellow fever and zika and Dengue as well so it's not only organization yet happy organization with good planning that's not done on check that outstrips the infrastructure in terms of water and sanitation so this brings me to the thing that I wanted to talk to you about in the first place cuz this is what you brought up to me when we doing this Sci-Fi show and you said something me that has been haunting me ever since that the vast majority of people that live in tropical climates have parasites vasundhara that's right ascariasis intestinal roundworm the estimates are on 800 million people have Asperger's roundworms in their belly wow so Hunter hundred million more than one in ten people on the planet mostly people who live in extreme poverty 400 million have hookworm infection 400 million have Whip or Saudis are warmy diseases 200 million people with scabies which is an Ecto parasite on the skin that causes terrible itching and and secondary bacterial infection schistosomiasis is another one the point is every almost every single person who is in extreme poverty has one of these what I called neglected tropical diseases in one of the interesting features about them is they're very debilitating they not so that not only occur in the setting of poverty but I think they reinforced poverty cuz they make people too sick to go to work they make actually shape we can show they shave IQ points off of kids when they have them with this not a hookworm connection to buy the idea of the slack-jawed the dumb Southerner and not one of the things that we have found so ra ra Julio Mejia on my faculty working with environmental activist named Katherine Coleman flowers and Alabama founded hookworm is still present in Alabama for the longest time do minded right and that this could be directly connected to hookworm infection which had run rampant receiving the term given called they called The Germ of laziness that then hookworm infection because it causes severe anemia so if you're walking around with terrible anemia of course you're going to your to your not feeling up to working a full day and and all that sort of several hookworm was widely president present in the southeastern United States turn of the 20th century and then as malaria went down with economic development so it's so did hookworm infection as well but we still have pockets in this country and this wasn't understood at the time they didn't know these people are infected with hookworm freak for for forever no up until very recently so the cause of hookworm wasn't discovered till 1900 what is that cause it's called the caterer americanus the American killer is then that's the name of the worm and it's a hug walking barefoot or that goes in through the hands or all parts of the body are the snow clinical trial yeah when I found that one out I was like oh my god well that's it that totally makes sense because for the longest time was that there was that stereotype and then when you find out that is directly connected to a massive infection of this disease has warm so these are the diseases that are holding back people who live in poverty not originally I thought only in places like the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa are southeast Asia but now I realize it's these pockets of property across the entire diseases worm so these are the diseases that are holding back people who live in poverty not originally I thought only in places like the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa are southeast Asia but now I realize it's these pockets of poverty across the entire planet that people are affected by these disease and these diseases can be vaccinated that's what we're trying to prove that we can make a vaccine again and there is a hookworm vaccine</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that are steadfast in their resistance to vaccines they they also believe in a lot of other questionable things it seems like these things get lumped into these groups of things that they don't trust the government about right right I think that's part I think that's probably true General now they're starting to speak out but you know the people, that's the gold part of the problem with people don't trust their government I say last true but I think most people if you know if we had a few no more visible Public Health Force out there people would listen to it in terms of these poor neighborhoods in these parasites getting the people cyst of infecting cognitive development and what it was the other one besides toxocariasis and the fact that there's actual cures for these things to the mean that I estimated a paper there 2.8 million African Americans living in poverty with toxic Rises wow so not a rare disease Joe this is this is a common disease time to Seattle has the x or the XR in the environment in the worm develops with it within the egg is there any other diseases that are going on that we don't know about yeah yeah sure there's other there's a brain parasitic infection called cysticercosis Mountain from that one is from eggs off in from individuals who have a tapeworm so that's we're seeing cases of that there's some of the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes one of us we don't talk about a lot which is very serious infection is West Nile Virus Infection that's got very high rates of not only Encephalitis but also on one of our faculty members Christy Maria showing very high rates of depression and other neurologic debilitation for and that's another one we could probably use a vaccine for but there isn't a mark incentive to do it West Nile Virus does come up though that least that's disgusting the news and people were I said it right but there's no vaccine is no vaccine but there could be there could be a financial incentive for the pharmaceutical companies to take it off so it is an extremely large investment to develop something along those lines right vaccines are thrown investors perspective a tough sell because you know there's a possibility interpersonal you need many years of clinical you can sometimes take two decades from the original conception of a vaccine to actually going through clinical trials for the hookworm vaccine I've been working on we've been doing it since the 1990s so we're talkin decades-long time Horizons when you talk to an investor about something with decades long time Horizons figure it out right the light the lights go out I mean the very quickly so weird because this is all we were lying on these private invest money to cure a public health issue that's right. Write that seems kind of crazy well so in response to that what happened was after the Ebola Fiasco in 2014 where we didn't have any bowl of vaccine and guinea Liberian Sierra Leone group of individuals came together at Davos World economic forum and including the Gates Foundation and they put around the developed this concept or which an organism seppi the Coalition for epidemic preparedness Innovation to incentivize biotech and pharmaceutical companies to embark on diseases for which of pandemic potential like Ebola like Lassa fever like mares coronavirus infection and that was great promise they didn't address these poverty-related diseases so those of us who work in poverty related diseases are still kind of on the outside looking in but just seems like having everything managed by private companies that need to the need to have some sort of a financial incentive to attack these diseases that seems like a crazy way to deal with Health crisis that's right that's right and so would I recommend it is I said the city that organization seppi is great for what it's doing but we need another mechanism what I've proposed is that I'm since he's diseases are so common among the poor in the G20 countries largest economies to put together public sector funds for that purpose public sector funds for investing in developing vaccines and treatments for poverty related diseases these chronic debilitating diseases and in fact you know we can show that using working with health Economist we actually work with a terrific Health Economist is name is Bruce Lee of all night he's a professor Johns Hopkins he's been able to show that are vaccines are not only cost effective their cost savings meaning that they're economically dominant that they'll actually save money the problems you still doesn't help you with the fact you still need some but the Returns on public health don't need somebody to come along and provide that investment yes I do you know so what's happened is our our technical ability to develop vaccines is outstripped are are are financial instruments that we have to do it so I guess stream of young people in my office wanted to go into Global Health in the commitment for this next Generation I know they get a lot of bad press but my impression is this next Generation there come in the public service is an all-time high and they say you know doctor hotels I'm all in I'm going to go into Global health and they're a little bit disappointed when I tell them get an MBA or get a law degree because where we need the Innovation now is in the ends in the finance sector there's a business model out there that would work that would figure out how to do this I just don't have the background to do it it seems like once the momentum is in the corner of this being handled by the private sector and that the private sector has to develop these vaccines and these treatments and they have to do it with some sort of a financial incentive if they don't have a bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow did not going to take a ride that's right that's right about what I do is not developing vaccines for poverty related diseases there's no roadmap right now to run clinical trials I don't know what the roadmap is to get to licensure and getting these vaccines out to the public the terrifying thing keeps me up at night is there's no roof how much does it cost to get a vaccine in general from developmental. To action application well the pharmaceutical companies have traditionally said billions but I don't think that's the case I think one of the reasons they're doing that is because they're also recovering their R&amp;D costs and other putting money into R&amp;J about they that they that they charge in order to you knows either make a profit or at least they even some friends since the cervical cancer vaccine the HPV vaccine you know when I last looked was $420 for the three doses it doesn't take cost $420 to make that vaccine it it's just that they're recovering their R&amp;D costs which is which is fair enough so one of the things that we're proposing to do for our neglected disease vaccines is will D-link the R&amp;D cost mother was if we've gotten grants whether it's from The Gates Foundation in the pasture or the NIH or the European Union neglected diseases vaccines is will D-link the R&amp;D cost know there was a we've gotten grants whether it's from The Gates Foundation in the pasture or the NIH or the European Union or the Dutch government of the Carlos Slim Foundation we're not going to pass those costs on we'll just you know that was used for R&amp;D and we would just cause 4 the cost of good so at least we can get it down to just a couple of dollars to do so few dollars does</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what are the big drivers of infectious diseases right now in the anomaly in the US but globally there really some interesting forces and a lot of them are social determinants so a big one is poverty that's that's a huge one the other big one is political instability in war because it interrupts Public Health control measures of Venezuela which was leading Public Health control and Latin America for decades with the collapse of the economy and that in the shop is there an hour to the Medora area Majora area we've got a terrible situation where we've had measles returned in a big way so huge numbers of cases of measles while we fed all the neglected tropical diseases come back as well as malaria Chagas disease leishmaniasis so it's really interesting how that is destabilizing the whole region because now Venezuela has one of the largest diasporas of people as big as the diaspora coming out Syria and Iraq another diseases are moving into adjacent areas of Brazil and Colombia and Ecuador and so it's really and then that's another big drivers political instability the third one are we think is climate change maybe very important so you know why did we see this big surge of chikungunya virus infection in the Western Hemisphere razika we don't really understand the forces of that and what's going on in southern Europe right now is quite concerning we've had malaria return grease after it's been gone for 70 years malaria is returned to Italy we're seeing schistosomiasis neglected tropical disease on the island of Corsica we've got Dengue Chikungunya West Nile Virus across Italy Spain Portugal so we're trying to understand why that isn't there some thought that climate change maybe a big driver that know what other infectious diseases or parasites rather do they vaccines for today have a vaccine for toxo which is no vaccine for toxoplasmosis there's a prototype malaria vaccine that it's a malaria vaccine is called Moscow lyrics that's the trade name that was developed supported with a lot of funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and working in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline and that malaria vaccine now has been approved for children by the European medicines agency and it's being introduced now in three countries in Africa Malawi Ghana and I forgot the third one I think it was 10:00 is there an adverse reaction that people have that stuff cuz I know the traditional malaria medication I had friends that took it and had horrible nightmares ending with us while the problem that you got into it with malaria is that before 6 months of age you have maternal antibodies and bring your brother Richard born with antibodies from your mother and they'll start to wane by 6 months of age so the ones who got hospitalized with measles was what's called cerebro malaria which is a devastating condition or severe malaria anemia which is also a killer or those children between 6 months of age and 5 years of age those the ones but we want to protect now and it's one of the leading killers of children globally right is connected to a crack right sickle cell is it has something to do with people developing an immunity to malaria Community but it's a natural protection so individuals who have the sickle cell trait seem to be partially resistant to malaria and that's the thinking why the gene for sickle cell has been preserved in Africa for so long is because it does confer some protection against malaria some of the reason for keeping the gene in the gene pool that we were actually discussing that I grew up with died from it so it seems to play exist in African Americans or Africans is that correct. There's some other places as well but predominantly play stand out there and among African-Americans people whose ancestors came from these tropical climates where they write and yes I was Fritz really quite an amazing story so there's no no no vaccine for toxoplasmosis is there anything on the horizon is there anything we worked on because that's a big one right it's a real big problem on people with HIV it's for instance that's it because it reactivate your toxoplasmosis and we even see it and I even seen in kids sometimes but the thing is is it's in some countries up to 30% of people are actually infected with Toxoplasma and the parasite has the ability to undergo a dormancy stayed in the body until your immune system gets compromised either because of AIDS or because if you get some kind of medicine that suppresses your immune system and then it can reactivated and cause that's called cerebral toxoplasmosis pictures of quite serious so most people Handler toxoplasmosis very well you know you you die with it and don't even know you have it but in some cases it gets reactivated right now there doesn't seem to be a lot of incentive for developing a toxoplasmosis vaccine although I'd be very interested to work on something like why would there be no incentive such a large-scale hundreds of millions of people worldwide right that's right and part of the problem is we have almost no information on the actual number of people who have it and how extensive it is so we call that disease bird we don't have good disease burden estimates of toxoplasmosis cats psoriasis and that's a parasitic worm infection we're finding in the United States among the poor and that's the one so what happens is if you going with the poor neighborhoods you know you see a lot of feral cats and dogs and four neighborhoods Almost 100% of them have this warm in their intestines and their seeding the environment with eggs in their feces in the feces are spread all over the poor neighborhood kids come into contact with him in the worm has the ability to migrate to the brain across syrebral toxocariasis and I think it's an important cause of Developmental delays it's one of those neglected diseases in the US and talk about in the book and there's no vaccine for that either no vaccine for Edwin to very little awareness about it wow so it's not rare I mean in some cases you know up to 10% of certain populations like African African Americans living in poverty are infected with it and it's primarily pets or is it rodents Simon pets is mostly stray dogs and cats and and I get written this is an example of a neglected tropical disease here's here's a disease of up to 10% of African Americans living in poverty in the United States and almost nobody is studying wow Ryan it can affect the way your mind function right so you know everybody wants to know why you no kids living in poverty have developmental delays and people just assume it's because they deprived environment and that sort of thing but I think toxocariasis is an important underlying reason for it in this is an example of a neglected disease you know we I mean everybody's heard of Ebola right and everyone's worried about ebola and the truth is Ebola was never going to come to the United States why not ever going to because it's too difficult to transmit unless you have a complete collapse in the house system we're never going to have Ebola epidemic in the United States but here's a disease of 10% of African Americans living in and no one's heard of it and there's no one sent it to study so that's why I'm trying to raise awareness about these poverty-related diseases and I don't understand why people don't talk about that when I wrote the book was you know I've had a lot of success getting people to care about neglected tropical diseases in Africa and worked you need the u.s. agency for International Development to support a package of medicines that's now being ministered over a billion people annually you know was one of my proudest accomplishments is is helping to raise awareness about neglected tropical diseases like we've been talking about a book Mormon sheet this my assistant Africa Asia and Latin America but the minute I talk about poverty related diseases in the US the lights go out why is there a I don't know I can't I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong I've had so much success getting parent people that care about ntds neglected tropical diseases in poor developing countries but you know there's been no response to this book I mean it is an end the estimates that I come up in the book are we have 12 million Americans live in poverty with a neglected tropical disease toxocariasis is one of them another one is Chagas disease and the list goes on it's been very hard to get people to care about the poor in this country. very strange to me and I've always said that about the way we treat other countries we want to send the maid and rebuild these countries but we don't do anything about these terrible communities that have been terrible in this country for decades upon decades right and so I try to make the point the world has changed you have this this old Norm of global Health developed vs. developing it still exists but it's going away work what we're seeing is our general rise in all all economies in some African countries at 8 or 9% economic growth but it's all leaving behind the bottom segment of society and so I don't care where you show me poverty whether it's in Texas or Alabama or Nigeria or Bangladesh I will show you these poverty-related diseases and you know I I know what's your name AOC congresswoman from New York is talk a little bit about hookworm in Alabama so last time I was in Washington I dropped off a copy of the book in her office but no response yet you had a magic wand and someone said you could do whatever you want to fix this what would you do so I did meet with a couple of people on the hill and and they asked me that question what's the magic wand and there's a couple of things one we need to actually look for these diseases because the problem is they're the the disease that causes a satellite developmental delays so that if you're you know a killer who lives in poverty Elemental delays the pediatrician both even think to do a test for toxocariasis so that would so we need to raise awareness we need to go into poor communities across the country and actually take a blood test and actually measure for the presence of that disease or that parasite once you find that disease what would you do that well it depends on the disease in some cases we have treatments for in life the treatment for toxocariasis is a 5-day course of a simple pill of albendazole yeah so did we have you know we have interventions so one you know doing what I call Active surveillance looking for these diseases the other one is really trying to understand how these diseases are transmitted what is it about poor neighborhoods that is facilitating transmission I think the third problems the diagnostic test themselves because they're very complicated test sometimes you know they are done at the Centers for Disease Control and prevention are lab tropical medicine does a few of them but it's not like you know when you go for a you go for blood work and your doctor and you get a little lab slip from Quest Diagnostics with the you know the blood chemistry is the blood counts there's no box there for toxocariasis and so we need more improve test point-of-care diagnostic test test but just batak so there's a treatment for toxoplasmosis what is it it's a pair of methenamine sulfa drug but it requires a long treatment course how long I'd have to look up the number two days I haven't read a page with toxoplasmosis in awhile but and killed it effectively so most people that have it really don't even know they have this right and most people who have neglected tropical diseases don't know they have it either so that me and Texas princess we have transmission of a parasitic disease called Chagas disease it's a cause of heart disease we are members of our faculty were actually able to track down individual to a donated blood and the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Authority actually found somebody popped people positive for Saugus disease they were told to go see your primary health care provider and the unfortunate the primary health care providers Not educated about these diseases and they just as it must be a false positive so you know our faculty attract them down and raible to get them into treatment and what is the treatment for Chagas had it so that's a anti-parasitic agent called the school and that kills it enough but sometimes you don't catch it we're trying to develop a therapeutic vaccine for this disease but again it's a therapeutic vaccine for a poverty-related disease so it's very tough perfect people of color is well right now cuz you know because it's so linked to Poverty well also write slavery in the history of slavery in this country than the history of systemic racism in places where they just literally would not sell homes to people who are African-American all these things are connected to the the contribution of maintaining these impoverished communities and it's been almost no effort whatsoever other than the people living in the community trying to do better and raise everybody up there's been no effort whatsoever by the federal government to step in and try to rehabilitate it like at a large-scale approach the rehabilitation places like the ghettos of Houston or Baltimore or I thought I knew what poverty living in it I was before I move to Texas in 2011 I was chair of microbiology George Washington University and I thought I thought I knew a property look like I move down to the Gulf Coast it's a different animal I mean the the depth and breadth poverty in the Gulf Coast in the southern part of the United States is just extraordinary and it's been very hard to get people to want to really take it on and really addressed these these poverty-related diseases you think what do you think the cause of it is this for quite a while what the cause of did neglect yes yeah I don't know I don't know what you know of is it something about American exceptionalism or something we just don't want to admit we have poor people I don't know you know that I wasn't the first to come up with you know to raise this issue my poverty when I was in high school or Junior High School I was forced to read a book and at the time I didn't care about it was called the other America was written by fantastic social activist named Michael Harrington who was I think someone was very devout Catholic actually so and he wrote this book called the other America talks about the hidden poverty off the road and the actual number of people who live in extreme poverty hasn't changed and stuff book was written in the early 60s. Brooke was helped was what helped Lyndon first Kennedy than Linda Johnson launched the war on poverty 1964 I dusted off that book and it's still it's still work today and that's how I start out talking my book Blue Marble Health about that book the other America by Michael Harrington you know that that is a very strange thing our acceptance of these and we have always said that if you want to make America a better place the best thing to do is not invade other countries or intervene the best thing to do is try to rebuild these impoverished communities by the United Nations special Repertory poverty until 2017 and his numbers came up with we have 19.4 million Americans who live in what's called Extreme poverty that is it half the u.s. poverty line and roughly around 5 million Americans living on less than $2 a day the same Benchmark could use for Global poverty everywhere million and and guess what those probably all have neglected tropical diseases 5 extreme poverty in Africa $10 + $2 University of Michigan Center on poverty is also shown that we have to get the number 2.7 million families living on less than $2 a day which is probably about the same as the 5 million number Jesus Christ now and again this is not a topic that is very popular presidential debates we hear about ebola and diseases like that and sometimes of my frustration I say you know where these are imaginary diseases and yet here we've got widespread disease of the port in the US in the lights go out remember when that woman came back from Africa and she was a nurse and she had been some in some connection contacted with ebola she didn't have it and they want to quarantine are they stuck around some cabin on the airport or something terrible thought it was so cruel is it just an ignorance of how the ends Modesto right but that means if a single individual gets measles 12-2-18 others get it because the virus hangs around in the environment and so easily transmissible that's right or even in the Avon in the atmosphere so I'm and that's why you get these really large measles outbreaks like your singing Washington State and usually those are infants under the age of 12 months not yet old enough to have actually loved ones wind up hospitalized and then sick the ball is just the opposite a ball is a reproductive number of two or three so unless you're taking care of a dead or dying Ebola patient where someone has recently died cuz that's only towards the end stage of the disease that you really get large numbers of virus particles in the body you're not going to get Ebola so the reason is being so hard right now to contain a Democratic Republic of Congo is not because it's so highly contagious it just that the place is decimated by the Clapton infrastructure assoc of a civil war so even though we have a nominee Bola vaccine it's hard to vaccinate everybody and how is it transmitted Ebola by contact with fluids of somebody with with ebola so it has to get into your tissues because if we could get the after the leaders of those G20 countries together to G20 Summit and say we're really going to do something about the neglected diseases in our own borders and I went through the United States we could get rid of two-thirds of the world's poverty-related neglected diseases right off the bat wow so a lot of it is political will ignorance or lack of awareness and political will what is it seems like in this country kaga to know about allow these adjustments you're describing yeah I know I mean so we'd we need to raise awareness about these that's why I'm so thrilled it was so thrilled to come here because I've just Amplified the number of people who've heard of this concept of Blue Marble Health yeah the name that I've given the different name from Global Health to two separate separated from the two so you know coming on here is so powerful and terms of amplifying that message</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Lyme disease vaccine but the problem was it was actually causing people to get Lyme disease so that's a talk about controversial topics yeah that's so there was a Lyme disease vaccine that was developed actually from a colleague of mine at Yale University and then it was and they licensed it I think it was to GlaxoSmithKline and they developed it is a click all that limerick's it was the Lyme disease vaccine and actually most of the study suggests that actually work pretty well the problem was they were number of who felt that the vaccine made them worse or they said they had chronic lyme disease that wasn't effective so was really up Market perception problem more than anything else in the ultimately it hurt the bottom line of the company and they they withdrew it from a friend of mine's dad got the vaccine and then got Lyme disease they think he got Lyme disease from the vaccine probably not probably is a weird word possible cause Lyme disease is caused by the Lyme bacteria the spirochete called borrelia burgdorferi and the vaccine is not a live vaccine it's a recombinant protein-based vaccine so it's not so there's nothing in that vaccine that could have caused this adverse reaction that they directly Tribute To That vaccine probably not again your same problem I don't know the patient was reinforced by a lot of negative information out there on the internet because it wasn't working but because of Market perception and and all that sort of thing that was a time before the number of cases of Lyme disease have really taken off so equation Works a little differently with measles measles is a killer disease Lyme disease was not a killer disease and people now and some case it seems to be connected to a host of other ailments to correct like Lyme disease that exacerbates a bunch of different maybe possibly even existing health issues well you have to be careful in the end this gets into another controversial butthole I'm not sure we want to get into or not today but you know the Infectious Disease Society of America Francis has come out with a strong statement saying that there's really no such thing as chronic lyme disease and I'm the scientific evidence does not support something called chronic lyme disease yet there lots of people suffering with chronic debilitating illness who claimed that it's caused by Lyme disease so this is something that is out there right now why they saying that there is no such thing as chronic lyme disease was there evidence the evidence is that there's no evidence that they can detect spirochetes in the body in many cases people who had Lyme disease don't have persistent evidence of having antibodies any longer to do the Lyme spirochete so it's a whole different area right but they do have this chronic inflammation and pain in their joint they have something but it doesn't seem to the affections to decide if America which is one of the leading infectious disease bodies in our country and I'm not an expert on Lyme disease so I'm not too comfortable going there with you saying that there's no evidence that that that's actually associated with active infection with Lyme disease and what are they how are they describing and what how are they so another what's what's a what's causing all decent isn't it bizarre the same people got Lyme disease first and then how about these host of issues afterwards I guess part of the problem is in some cases that Lyme disease first in some cases they really didn't have Lyme disease unfortunately there are number of unscrupulous Healthcare Providers even Physicians out there that are making the misdiagnosed either they're making a misdiagnosis of Lyme disease or in some cases they're actually taking everyone who comes to the door and diagnosing them with lime we didn't have Lyme disease unfortunately there are number of unscrupulous Healthcare Providers even Physicians out there that are making the misdiagnosed either they're making a misdiagnosis of Lyme disease or in some cases they're actually taking everyone who comes to the door and diagnosing them with Lyme disease I'm sure you're aware the lone star tick allergy to red meat that's really fascinating</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> causing autism and eating your personal estimation do you think that it is a that there's a rise in the factors that are causing autism or do you think that it's of a rise in the understanding of these variables that contribute to it that you could diagnose people within that before they were previously undiagnosed so I think most of it is that that we're just diagnosing it more recruiting individuals in the autism category that and we didn't before and by the way the number about to go up even more because we're getting better at diagnosing girls and women with autism which is also quite interesting used to say with ten-to-one boys the girls and now we know they're a lot more girls and women on the autism spectrum it's just that they're usually more verbal and they can camouflage it better but they have very high rates of comorbidities like obsessive compulsive disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder a lot of the teenage girls with eating disorders now they're finding could actually be on the office Spectrum so the numbers are about to go up again I mean that's just an example I mean is I guess what you're really trying to get at is it is it beyond that is there is there a Bonafide increase beyond the number of diagnosis and and that one I'm still not sure about an article about early onset gender dysphoria being connected to young girls right autism right there is a disproportionate number of girls with gender dysphoria who turned out to be also autistic I have heard that as well yeah that's actually think about now on your chin and fasting if there's a nice paper by very good environmental scientist Newfield landrigan who used to be at Mount Sinai now I think he's at Boston College now and he publishes about five or six chemicals in the environment which if you're exposed to for long periods of time during early pregnancy your child will be born with some features that resemble autism I have to remember all I've talked about him in the book I want one of them is Depakote valproic acid which is a psychiatric medicine used as a mood stabilizer or an antidepressant so prolong use of Depakote during pregnancy has been linked to something that resembles autism so that common medication the common medication but now that we know this information we don't use it anymore it's a warning things that I've been saying to people like Bobby Kennedy and everything else if you really want if you really think there's some environmental link to autism we've got a list of at least six chemicals during early exposure in pregnancy that are probably causing mutations and things like that that are leading to autism why are waiting why isn't anybody looking into that it's just crazy at me so all the focus on Valley Center vaccine and it kind of sucks all the oxygen out of the room so that you know really understanding the search for autism gets delayed in some cases doesn't get pursued at all or the other thing that happens in many state legislatures and things like that focuses how much about vaccines that we don't talk about what autism parents really need I mean what do I need for Rachel we need you know employment counseling and help we need mental health counseling what do we do after we're gone Rachel right now is living with us and I turn 60 my wife is in a 58 what happens to us 10 15 20 years from now there's no roadmap so so all of that Santa decide because of these phony baloney anti-vaccine arguments when I get angry that's when I start to realize these guys in addition to affecting public health or actually hurting autism families as well that makes sense that you especially as a scientist now when you're talking about these various chemicals that you think do contribute to or possibly cause autism maybe we should really come turn on that and then publish something about this is this something that is there an article that people can go to that says something about that as I talked about it in the book and open up the book I can read online about this without going to your book probably no one of the problems that we face in this country is that we put a lot of scientific articles behind paywall is that we put a lot of scientific articles behind paywall rise of real source of frustration for me and I do they do that well one of the things that I've done now is I'm one of the I found it a an Open Access Journal call the public library science neglected tropical diseases so that anybody with a computer you know an internet connection and a printer can download the articles for you to charge and we need more of that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I want the internet right now they've what does that mean what that means is they've got they put on up by some estimates 502 vaccine websites so that every time you put the word vaccine into a search engine whether it's Yahoo or Google you're going to get anti-vaccine misinformation that's number one second we know now it's amplify social media like Facebook other forms of social media so at 3rd but the Amazon site I mean it's it's incredible so my book this book the good news is it's I think it's right now it's the highest-rated pro-vaccine book on Amazon the bad news is overall strength about 20 because there's 19 other phony-baloney anti-vaccine books so he legislators about applying them with false information about wetbacks vaccines do so and and the problem is we don't have a robust system of pro-vaccine advocacy the counter it so we don't really hear as much as we need to from the federal government from the CDC from the Surgeon General so unfortunately in this country the defensive vaccines Falls to a handful of academic like myself and you know I'm an academic I wrote a book what chance do I stand against this major media Empire. Why do you think that exists why do you think there is this major media Empire that's against vaccines that's a great question what's the motive what's the motivation number one and number two for the money coming from right but there's no money behind those millions of dollars behind this to put out funny documentaries and phony book what's a good funny documentary 2.2 because they're so litigious opened and I don't have the means to defend a lawsuit and I usually don't mean specific agenda do we do now in some cases that the some elements of the anti-vaccine LaPierre promoting phony autism therapies right there doing terrible things like this thing called MMS which are bleach enemas giving bleach enemas to the children bleach by bleach because they're cleansing the immune system cleansing they're doing chelation therapy which is very dangerous that's where they they claim you know kids are overdose with toxic Metals so they give a chemical that actually can chelate the metal but it can kill at your calcium and then put you into a fatal arrhythmia as well they're also who is doing this chelation therapy unfortunately or other health professionals therapy on which is really bad so insomnia Hyperbaric therapy bad welfare doesn't do anything for autism that's broken but it's it's good for recovering from injuries and be under certain selected so who knows what you shouldn't be doing that then the other then that's one so how much of this is being driven by Financial motivation pedaling these phony autism therapist I can take my senses that's not the big piece of this there's also some reports not Russian Bots and trolls that are amplifying this and sewing political instability Ryan tree but again you add that all up the funny autism therapies the Russian Bots intro to my mind that really doesn't get our arms around the Big Driver this thing so I think we really need some good investigative journalist to look into this well do you think that there's some sort of a really believe that vaccines do cause autism they don't truly understand the science and they haven't talked to someone like you and maybe they have this idea that cemented in their mind and they're not willing to look at it objectively and look at the full spectrum of possibilities and look at the science behind what you guys are saying because in there had they've been saying vaccines cause autism they've been saying it for so long that once someone gets that and they're connected to that it's very difficult for the machine gears bit people are really hard not being married to an idea he had no I agree and I spend a lot of time going on the country giving up what it called Grand rounds lectures to hospitals and medical schools pediatric Grand rounds I've had the chance to talk to a lot of Pediatricians nurses and nurse practitioner even and more and more than a few parents my impression is most of the parents for a call to be so-called vaccine hesitant this is the word of the day are not really deeply Doug and I mean you can just going to have a conversation with them and explain to them like we're talkin now and very you know non-technical way you know the evidence showing vaccines don't cause autism in the lack of plausibility given that it that it begins in pregnancy and no vaccinate their kids there is another percentage and I don't know what the percentage for 10:15 in and our holy invested in this conspiracy theory that the that the government is in cahoots with the pharmaceutical companies and body body and then if you try to talk him out of it they just think you're part of the conspiracy so that sort of a no-win approach there but but most parents you can have a good conversation with most parents yeah it's not necessarily the most parents dealing with these people that maybe they're into a bunch of different alternative therapies but two different kinds of cleansing and there's a lot of that nonsense that you find online where we look there's a legitimate but I would guess my point sorry but I guess my point is parents don't get the chance because they're so inundated with phony anti-vaccine information that so what do you think should be done should there be a pro vaccine documentary that makes sense that night for the question I think there's three things that need to be done first of all some of this anti-vaccine media Empire needs to be dismantled his mantis mantles and then I don't know whether the wrong or right like shouldn't does it mean it seems like there should be some sort of a debate right like if there's someone who's saying that there's some evidence of vaccines cause debates you're saying there's no evidence of vaccines cause debate evidence that vaccines cause autism debate where there's some sort of like some sort of them conversation where you can have you versus someone else and break this down yeah but that that has that's a two edged sword to because you know then it gives some false legitimacy to TNT vaccine side it's like debating does smoking cause cancer problem if you do Google Search and you're just overwhelmed right with antivirus seems like they've been lost if that's the case that's right legitimacy what song is not necessarily giving him legitimacy it's giving them you give you rather a forum to dismiss their legitimacy yeah I mean I think part of it has to be done is this gets into all sorts of First Amendment issues and I'm not a lawyer but you know the the idea that Amazon now is putting out all of these phony books and and funny documentaries distributor let me know it's mine tooth, but maybe there should be some Screaming maybe Amazon maybe Facebook should all be hiring Chief scientific officers to you know putting some stops on the dissemination of of information because it's harming children about it actually wrote the book is is kind of interesting I and actually happened before all these big measles outbreaks that we've been having I noticed that in Texas there was where I Laboratories at Texas Children's Hospital Baylor College of Medicine we noticed that there was a steep increase in the number of kids whose parents were opting them out of getting vaccinated to the point where in Texas we have over 600 60,000 kids not getting their vaccines in the state of Texas and those the ones we know about we don't know anything about the 325,000 homeschool kids so we probably have over a hundred thousand kids not getting vaccinated all because of this misinformation campaign and I was really troubled by the fact that the no response to it and that drove me to write the Books of the point is now Texas is very vulnerable to measles outbreak can I say measles more than the others cuz that's the most highly contagious disease with the danger of a child getting measles is there any benefit to know there's no benefit in Melanie's marvelous measles it does not it does not it's remember I'm after so let's go back a little bit smallpox was eradicated in the late 1970s through vaccination 1 smallpox was eradicated radically measles was arguably the single leading killer of children globally 2.6 million children died of your measles because it causes measles pneumonia measles Encephalitis talk about permanent neurologic injury that's a bad actor measles and then deafness at all and then through Global vaccination campaigns we brought it down by the year 2002 about half-a-million kids dying and then the Gates Foundation put up 750 million dollars to create the gavi Alliance to Global lines for vaccines and immunization we've brought it down now to 100,000 but not measles is coming back you're upset disaster right now he's got 80,000 measle cases in 2018 in Europe and now it's coming back to the US and so My worry is the Smith anti-vaccine Empire isn't it started out as a fringe group but now it's really affecting Public Health allowing a deadly disease like measles to come back to do think if there's some sort of definitive evidence that shows to the general public like you could you could show it to them like this is what causes autism we've narrowed it down to these jeans and it it has nothing to do with vaccines if you give these vaccines to people without these jeans there is no way they're going to get autism to get autism specifically because of these variations in their chain you just you just Summarize the book but I'll be more than a buck means in some places polios made a Resurgence of polio in our we're down to about three three countries that still have transmission a wild-type polio it's Nigeria pakistan-afghanistan so hopefully we're getting arms around pelea but measles is now combat roaring back with a vengeance 1 people contracted polio outside of those areas and those are the areas where it's at every now and then some cases pop up wherever it in this could get it on to a whole nother topic wherever there's collapse and Health Systems infrastructure from war political instability these diseases can come back they can come back and the people that are vulnerable to children that are not immunized that's right and when you're immunized you're not vulnerable that's right yeah people always want to think that big Pharma but I've I've said some terrible things about big Pharma and the reason being is pain killers cuz painkillers and antidepressants and there's a ssris which over-prescribed and the painkiller one kills me because I know people directly that have been addicted to these goddamn things in the doctors are passing them out like candy so people look at big farm as being o these are the monsters that push this they're also the people that give you things that save people's lives going on their little big defender of the big pharmaceutical companies I mean one of the things that the empty Max the insulted anti-vaxxers let me as they say I'm a shill for industry they say I'm secretly taking money from a penny from them foundations then I'd like the national opposite of Health right and then they say I'm secretly making millions of dollars for our vaccines for hookworm and schistosomiasis in shock as we do with all that money because my wife says if only that were the case right these are diseases of the poorest of the poor I'll never make a penny on me early phase process development and Manufacturing and IND filing with the FDA investigational new drug applications for working and kind of stuck in Phase 1 Phase 2 clinical trials cuz we don't have the big Pharma money to take us all the way to licensure so I've had a lot of meetings with the big pharmaceutical companies to see if they can partner with us and so far that hasn't happened so is that has there ever been any discussion or any interest in creating some sort of a compelling documentary that's pro-vaccine and I can counter all these things cuz there's there's quite a few health-related documentaries that I know her horseshit because I've talked to actual real scientist in a clinical researchers that say like all these things are saying wrong and this is why the wrong in this you can show this the wrong thing and then when someone says hey I saw this documentary it says that all you eat is toast you can save us a man got to go here and watch this and I'll show you why that's nonsense right is there anything like that right now right now there are some discussions but it's worth a long way off and then and the problem is TNT vaccine documentaries are being distributed widely distributed widely sold and and those people that are talking about it here's another problem whenever I talk to someone about doing this a lot lately or talk to someone about something that passion about what books you read on it was like books that are written by actual researchers people that have spent decades in Labs understanding what's going on you don't really you know you don't get a lot of that from the people that are anti anything right well that's that's what I wrote the new book it's a very confusing thing for parents cuz you're scared you know you have this little tiny baby that you love more than anything in this world and then the doctor say hey we've got this round of vaccines, and you're just terrified that you're going to do something to your child can you turn your child into someone whose is compromised in the point is Promised these diseases her back now and so it did the urgency to vaccinate is now more than ever I mean remember right now look what's going on in Vancouver Washington right now where the measles outbreak is underway the ones who who are at greatest risk are infants under the age of 12 months not yet old enough to get their vaccine so that if your parent right now living in Vancouver Washington you're terrified you're terrified taking your baby out the Walmart or the public library That vaccine because the older kids are catching it will wear the personal Liberties of this parent now who terrified The Taker and when you stay or her infant anti-vaccine he not be aware of the science behind this what is he getting wrong what what he's getting wrong is just about everything you know he's formed an organization called Children's Health defense and and start heating at a press conference about it I think it was September October of last year it is probably one of the best organized anti-vaccine groups out there that was doing environmental health and things like that I don't know any part of that business followed what they what he does with vaccines but it's all it's all nonsense Holocaust denier cars that are anti-vaccine books you've already lost the battle like it's time to regroup and maybe regrouping would be confronting someone with actual scientific information mean you are a real doctor your guy who actually studies is and you're a man who understands the science your legitimate academic you could you could actually put a dent in this with a real conversation yeah potentially potentially so he's very clever Wright and Brian Eno's hot are presumably knows how to do arguments in court and one of my I'm a scientist do you think that he wants to deceive people or do you think that maybe he's just incorrect into his accumulation of data his his his information is is highly misleading now what else is you say the lobby is this an organized good question again we need somebody who really wants to do a deep dive in this and kind of the sect out the pieces to understand but it's it's impressive what you got out their terms of the hundreds of websites and the amplification on social media and everything else is it are there just one or two or three groups behind it or is it a random collection of organizations that that needs to be looked at</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and we'll live how are you good to see you again I'm thrilled to be here thanks for doing this man thanks for having me before we get started I did not know when I asked you to come back on that you were heavily involved in this whole vaccine debate when I wanted to have you on to talk about is tropical diseases because I remember when we did that Sci-Fi show you explain to me that some ungodly percentage of people tropical climates are infected by parasites that's right well my day job is developing vaccines for tropical diseases we developed the vaccines no one else will make because of their for the world's poorest people so we call him tropical diseases but they really are diseases of poverty the vaccine issue the the advocacy issue around vaccines and autism is kind of a new thing that I got drawn into just because I'm a parent of an adult daughter with autism and I make vaccine so is it natural that I'd get traded to yeah so when I said that you were going to come on then I got inundated by people that are you know the vaccine thing is such a polarizing issue and so many people seem to think they absolutely know what causes what especially when it comes to something like autism which is a huge issue in this country to hugest around the world and it doesn't didn't used to seem to be the question is was that because it was undiagnosed was that because it just do it more prevalent today what do you think what is your take on but I don't think we really know one thing's for sure we're diagnosing people with Autism who we diagnosed as something else in the past you know whether it was in a really horrible diagnosis we use pejorative terms like mental retardation start again no no no it's okay he was just saying who just telling me that the clock is screwed up because of daylight savings time right sorry totally unrelated what country's flag is great so we don't know we don't well you know what one thing is clear that the number of diagnosis is going up but part of that is because what we used to call pejorative things like mental retardation now get thrown into the autism category the other thing not do it absolutely well you know now we call it was part of the autism spectrum we also because autism often has a lot of associated intellectual disabilities not always but sometimes the other is that is that based on aptitude tests like how do you how do they decide how do they do they have a list of diagnostic you know one of the interesting side pieces to this is you know the there's a group of people out there who self-identify themselves is the autistic's and they get very resentful or hurt when they're called a disease or disorder the end because they say when we're not an epidemic where we're a person and they said it's part of this whole neurodiversity movement which is quite interesting neurodiversity movement differently from others and they respond differently than others but they're not quote abnormal in and I think they have a good argue I heard of crazy argument once with someone that was said about to the point is that it's you know that the impairment like Rachel my daughter it's not so much her autism that towards her you know ability to have Partners or to have a meaningful career it's the fact that she has profound in her case profound intellectual disability goes along with it when they say that people have there's a spectrum right in some people who are autistic have incredible abilities as write them credible mathematical abilities musical abilities language abilities and then some people do not some people have legitimate issues you have with Rachel's case my daughter it's pretty good verbal IQ 80 90 which is very low perform volume 40 can't do simple math scan count money fortunately Goodwill Industries came to her rescue in our rescue and now she works there 2 hours a day sorting clothes and that's been really meaningful for her to get a paycheck so now he knows I say you're not so but that's why I don't like using those those terms because it puts people on the autism spectrum as though they have a disease right or which I don't like to do autistic don't like to think of themselves as a disorder they like to think of themselves as different different but not necessarily is a disorder right but that doesn't help us when we're trying to discuss it does it gets very hard to talk about which is actually accurate they have an issue there is an issue to say there's no issue is kind of ridiculous it says there's a reason why so many people are so concerned about autism and vaccines and autism Roberta environmental pollution between Autism that neurodiversity thing and actually having intellectual disabilities to go along with it maybe it's a bit of semantics if we don't know what causes autism what we do we do well we're getting there very closely so we've now there was a very important paper produced by written by group of the harvard-mit which is one of the Premier genetics genomics organizations in the country and they've now identified 99 Jeans it so it's a huge team of scientists not only the brode including PSI does a Baylor College of Medicine 99 genes involved in autism are all involved in early fetal development early brain development in the first and second trimester of pregnancy so now we're starting to really get her arms around what autism is and that's one of things I talked about in the book I mean we we have learned so much in the last couple of years but autism how it begins early fetal development well before kids ever see vaccines and that's one of the reasons I say vaccines did not cause Rachel's autism vaccines don't cause autism because autism is already underway in early early brain development is it possible that some people have this tendency towards autism and it's exacerbated by vaccines I don't think so I think what happens is the sequence of events happens during pregnancy but the full clinical expression of autism often doesn't happen till 18 or 19 months of age like Rachel Francis wasn't actually diagnose till 19 months of age and there's a fabulous studies now showing that that clinical expression of autism actually coincides with a big increase in the in the volume of the brain you can actually show on serial magnetic resonance imaging serial MRI of the brain starts to the brain volume starts to increase and that's very important cuz parents I will often remember on my kid got back sneaking around 18 months of age or 15 months of age want to link the two but now you can go back to 6 months of age and Justice studies done at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill showing so that you could do an MRI at 6 months of age and they can predict now they say with 90% accuracy which of the go on to develop autism and then you can take what do they sing what what are they saying they can see you have to go we can go into detail in the paper but they can see certain things on signatures on MRI that tell them that this kid is going to go on to develop okay so in fact all the express DNA of an individual in Rachel's case we did that and we actually find a mutation in a gene controlling neuronal connections which makes a lot of sense if you think about it isn't so so there is a way to to show whether children will be more likely to develop autism and there's there is a way to to look at their brain through fmri at a very early age and and also do the genetic sequence so it's not simply a man how they perform on cognitive test that's right that's right we're getting much better at getting arms around the diagnosis that have these anecdotal stories of their child getting vaccinated especially large doses of vaccines when they hit them with like 10 in a row and then all the sudden or major measles mumps and rubella is the one that gets repeated over and over again that's the one that made my child have autism I've heard that so many times and I've heard it from friends from friends that have children that have autism they had a child I've got the measles mumps rubella shot and then immediately there was a very distinct change in the child's Behavior well no question when you get the measles mumps rubella vaccine many times kids cry and Pen things like that and then autism will then begin sometime between the first and second year of life so it's logical to want to connect it to but now we know it's not even plausible because we know that if you go back to that an MRI at 6 months of age or go back prenatally we can even determine which kids are going to go on to develop autism complementing our massive epidemiologic studies done on over 1 million kids like in fact a new paper was just released this week showing that kids who get the MRI get the MMR vaccine are no more likely to get autism than kids who don't who don't get the MMR vaccine and the converse is also true kids on the autism spectrum are no more of likely to have gotten the MMR vaccine the kids not on the autism spectrum okay so it's a combination of that those big studies of over 1 million kids together with knowing what autism is that completely ruled out the possibility these jeans jeans and then the ability to scan the brain the serial MRI and that so you can tell which children have the propensity is it possible to children have all these issues and then do not get autism or do one percent of those children with those issues get autism it's a good question I don't know I'm a vaccine scientist so I'm you know the amount of the well really tried to do a deep dive in autism doing research on the book vs. human development right okay so so what you're saying though is that if a child does not have these mutations and does not have these issues that are present in during a cervical MRI that they will not go on to develop autism is that true far as we can tell you as we can tell so children without those issues who get vaccinated have have no problems which most children have no problems right yeah I mean you know we've learned a lot about the risk of vaccines and the numbers are extraordinary I'm in the risk of a severe adverse event happening after getting a vaccine is roughly on the water of one-in-a-million between between one and a million and one 10 million so and I found an internet report once a satellite likelihood of getting struck by lightning is 1 and 700000 so it's you know the like there are having a severe event after a vaccine is your odds are better of getting struck by lightning then when you say severe event what do you mean by severe event though there's actually a table that's put out by the national vaccine compensation act that includes shoulder injury that's one Encephalitis and shoulder internal yeah that's actually I'm from the actual injection injecting it in the wrong place so it goes into the joint issues were children have adverse effects and reactions to vaccines what do you attribute those two but one you wanted a milli I think you know when some queso biological variability I think it's hump only if it's a live virus vaccine like the measles mumps rubella vaccine and you have an underlying immune deficiency that wasn't picked up before then. Virus can replicate better but very rare things like that so as far as you know children who are healthy who get a vaccine is it's not biologically possible for them to develop these traits these mutations in the genes and these issues that you see present as best we can tell right now that seems case right as best you can tell right now it's a it's a great thing to say but for people to like on the outside like what does that mean I'm not a doctor I'm not smart enough to understand what doctor hotels is saying like what is he saying that's number one and two bits so there's there's the studies on a 1 million children showing that vaccines do not cause autism. The part one the second is that happened in the second part shows not only is there massive evidence that there's no link between vaccines and autism there's no possibility because we know so much about begins and go back to the first part the first part is studies number 1 million children they played this game and what I want not really a gay but what they called what they do is play this kind of thing of vaccine whack-a-mole because it first they alleged was the MMR vaccine and that came out of the study that was published in the Lancet 1998 then another group came along as if not I know we didn't mean the MMR vaccine meme n25 Marisol preservative that used to be in vaccine and the scientific Community not only damuth debunk the MMR Ling Ling then the end tomorrow we came along and said don't know we didn't mean that we're spacing vaccines too close together then they changed it to get around again I'm saying now it's the alemar aluminum in vaccines so the end of each time the scientific Community respond with massive epidemiologic study showed absolutely none of those things are true and do you think that it's just when you look at see if there's one in a million that has an issue with this and there's no it's not autism so whatever whatever those issues are that they hear these stories in these stories do accumulate because there's 300-plus million people in this country and over 10 20 years of one in a million you develop a significant history of cases where children did have issues with vaccines so these people hear about these stories and people are terrified obviously I have children become very overprotective of his children he worried or not so don't know like why do they get so many shots all in a row like that why does a baby get 10 shots in a day that seems crazy but I don't get 10 shots in a day most of most of the vaccines are now combined so for instance in 1 vaccine we can vaccinate against diphtheria pertussis tetanus polio influenza type B which is a terrible cause of of meningitis and in some cases not even hepatitis someone shot is pretty women's combined and there's all sorts of study showing that it's safe to combine them in and it's fantastic now you can vaccinate with one shot against diseases soul and these are life-threatening disease right so the only concern is that a child's immune system when they're bombarded with this one you're so awesome to causes them to be tired or their gets sick of the liver in the human system is not by the anti-vaccine lobby Blobby remember the child's gut the intestines and the respiratory tree is is this or organs of antigen presentation a baby on average is exposed to hundreds of new antigens every day so the idea that you're going to quote overwhelm the immune system with a vaccine against six diseases just doesn't make any sense I got this is all phony baloney stuff put out by the anti-vaccine lobby</div>

What about this one in the president's chair I think the Russians absolutely wanted Donald Trump to win absolutely definitely undermined democracy through various methods of manipulating people to social media in fact I have a woman coming on very soon when is Renee the restaurant this week next week she's on next week and she actually studied it and wrote wrote this very comprehensive report about it was on Sam Harris podcast and detailed millions of interactions with Russian Bots and Russian fake accounts and that these troll forms that we create memes and they did they do a bunch of different things they didn't just try to pump trump up but they also try to get people against each other and and cause all sorts of civil arguments in parts of online all sorts of unrest online they organized these meetings like they organized one pro Texas meeting across the street from a pro-muslim meeting I didn't get it all through Facebook to get these people to fight with each other they're doing these things to try to get people to take sides and to get people to be angry at the other side they did a lot of s*** like that real sneaky sneaky stuff that we probably do in foreign countries all the time and we know where they're doing it to us cuz now they're doing it through social media think about when we are growing up in the 80s 70s and 80s all of imagery we saw the USSR was very dark and gray and it was very I used to show us these big manly women will do you want and now you're like they're very happy thing I think he's got a kind of do something right once you say they're going to build a wall you got to kind of do something but then ship been built for two years into the president then billshit what is a year left and if we're going to have left the Presbyterians some wall there's some wall that's up but is also a big ass gaps and stop drugs from coming over from that walls he's got a kind of do something right once you say they're going to build a wall you got to kind of do something but then ship been built for two years into the president then billshit what is a year left and a half left of the Presbyterians some wall there's some wall that's up but is also a big ass gaps and the idea that they going to stop drugs from coming over from that walls praying on the wall</div>

We came from a terrible background was there was no love he was abandoned and all the sudden he's getting love and attention for something and is one thing was his man who was telling him you're going to be a great fighter you're going to be a world champion and he would to hypnotize me saying you don't exist the task exist you know you going to work the body and destroy this man and he beat up you would put these thoughts in his head and my couldn't wait to just get out there f*** people up cuz that's where you got the love that's we got the attention from never told him how to shut it off he never give me you have time to work with him cuz he was he was on his way out when he met Mike and so he only taught him how to destroy you never taught him how to cope and never taught him how to understand that there's going to be a lot of s*** coming your way and you got to know what that is and don't get caught up in that hype-train don't just don't get wrapped up in Hollywood and you know he wound up marrying Robin Givens and all that other b******* would be totally different last another 15 years Jimmy Jacobs it lasted another five years maybe it would have helped but I mean it's like once you were once removed from cuss it's like Kevin Rooney was once removed from cos right and then you Teddy Atlas was way more of a hardliner you know Teddy Atlas you couldn't pull any b******* with you know and like those other guys you just got to go I got to Aaron snowell Mike the dance right they got there when he's already at the dance and they just trying to like maintain things and he's not listening to anybody else or weren't boxing people as far as I was concerned when he was he was in a good situation you know there's a lady in the house cooking meals they had caused this cuz they're being a father figure to him everyday and that's what young kids need they need that you know to be spoken with by all the people yeah young kids need they need that you know to be spoken with by all the people yeah and in a lot of the young people nowadays and not even respect in the older people but they can gain a lot of information for my older person you know how do you deal with this situation it works for anytime I get a chance to talk to kids about you know their life and where they're going or is it take that opportunity</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it was slow down there Louis is a good fighter but you know given give give in like 10 years yeah and he would have he would have been these guys he would have given them a good good fight but right now he's obviously older and he's an old fighter doing some steroids it affects you know you going to the rooms like you know you're missing something something that was there in the past and it made you feel good now time I don't feel as good Bryant when you were fighting did anybody that you were finding did you suspect they were on something yeah a couple times but the good thing is that I know is I realized steroids steroids can never get this a strong Chin Chin so you can take as much on the chin right muscles on your face and then these body punches you can't you can't protect around here so they'll affect you as well so that's where you know when you when you hit when you hitting guys around here body punches and hit him on the chin LOL doesn't matter but don't you think that it does makes them stronger physically gives them more Vitality might make them able to absorb more punishment for a minute for a minute just for a little bit suspect was on something when he fought them I don't want to say. first name was his he was the first guy to have a strength and conditioning coach and and all that kind of stuff a dietitian Spanx did when he fought when he fought Larry Holmes he got the same guy Mackie shilstone Mackie shilstone got him in shape for Larry when he was coming up from light heavyweight that's the same guy that have and are used and they're doing it was really interesting because at the time that the conventional wisdom was a boxer should not lift weights and Evander was looking all kinds of weights and he put on all this muscle but knew he was about 200 205 lb when he first bought rap song yeah yeah yeah but this is in the night 80's 90's the good stuff wasn't available back then was it oh yeah I mean did Eastern Bloc women they made world records that was when he was that was when he was a cruiserweight Lookout any was massive amounts of male hormones in their body Flo-Jo yeah she still set the record right now for what whatever it was went and she was also someone that was accused of doing things yeah me and luck track and field according to Victor Conte who was the guy I have my podcast is the guy that got the clear to Barry Bonds and all those guys was supposedly undetectable steroid he said track and field is just dirty sport just like Tour de France like just like cycling's like this Saturday sport you got Carl Lewis trying to call out Husain bolt now right away if you had to give that title to someone who didn't test positive for anything you had to go back to 18 Place wow he's like you are psycho was better than your psycho they're all your off dirty there's a dirty sport he was just better at doing that support while being dirty not good you know they went off to the wrong thing you know people looking for drugs to help them get stronger when it's natural food that makes you stronger with what you put into your system so you know I know Jamaican food is great you know yams plantings Everything full movie Willy P feels better than that steroids was a way better I'm sorry they proved it when you just almost can't do Tour de France the way they were doing it without some sort of chemical help argued by physiologist they say it's actually better for your body to be on steroids while you're doing stuff like the Tour de France because you give your body a chance to recover because they're doing so much work over the course of this race that do without having some sort of chemical enhancement of your ability to recover you just not going to be able to do it now about your body LaFrance the way they were doing it without some sort of chemical help argued by physiologist they say it's actually better for your body to be on steroids while you're doing something like the Tour de France because you give your body a chance to recover because they're doing so much work over the course of this race that without having some sort of chemical enhancement of your ability to recover you just not going to be able to do it now about your body can't do right now</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> before fights a year and then as you get better drops to three fights and then when you're the champion the drops that to fights so that's that's the progression of fighting you can't like for instance how many fights did Beyonce have this year maybe two before he would have like three to four what is a big deal because I ain't talking about Chestnut I think that he's pulled off the greatest Chestnut to move there is shoresy comes over from England he wouldn't he takes the challenges with Deontay Joshua didn't he boxed had a great fight now he's put himself right up with all three of them are on the same line to me and then now for the rematch they wanted people want to see Deontay and they want to see Tyson Fury again because the first fight was exciting Joshua who's he fighting you know he's going to fight big baby but nobody knows him where everybody knows Deonte boxing fans. crazy and then one the rest of the round he gets tagged a few times and starts boxing and then even tagged Deonte I still had them winning that fight was closed by a round of boxing one that night every both guys look great and boxed well and made it exciting fight that the rematch obviously everybody wants to see the real so when the rematch happened that that put Anthony Joshua on the Shelf in my eyes now put them on the Shelf a bit longer ESPN deal and you know Tyson Fury's boxing in front of the public yeah Anthony Joshua and Deontay Pay-Per-View fight Pay-Per-View but at least Tyson walks away like saying look look I won the decision I feel like I should have won the decision there's a dispute there's a debate about it but everybody wants to see that fight is not unreasonable Joshua's a star goes down if she wants real fights Deontay and beats Deontay the Tyson Deontay fights not that exciting Joshua wants real respect he's got to fight either Fiore or Dionte Ryals split you know that's a weird thing to Bigfoot obviously gets respect his heavyweight champion the world but split you know that's a weird thing to I like to see Joshua Ortiz I'm interesting fight it would be goddamn is that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> like a most satisfying victory yeah what is it I seen Rock nice going to say that I was going to say the rematch you should have beaten them cuz that would bother you so much do you know what really bothers me is the fact that I gave him an opportunity I gave him a fight when I'm basically waiting for Tyson and I have to keep busy I'm looking down the list of who to fight his number seven I realize that he's durable is not not one of these guys that got knocked out easy so I wanted to give my fans you know a proper fight box the best guy out there and not box easy guy that's easy to get knocked out I don't want to go home until around so and then another reason a lot of people don't know I went to Africa to fight because Muhammad Ali went to Africa a part in Africa so I wanted to do that once be a world champion I need to fight all around the world so that's what made me go to Africa the only thing about Africa is I didn't know that it was such a high-altitude up there and for me to have a fight I should have got there a lot earlier but I was doing Ocean's 11 at that time I was waiting for them to change the lights then go out and go out there for 2 minutes and then go back and sit there for another two hours while they change the lights pause training but it wasn't like it was in the conditions of training you know I needed a bag I needed sparring partners I'll be up there a lot sooner than above sea level higher than Big Bear don't tell me this was going to be one of those fights we have to take my time so I basically went out there taking my time I realized he's doing the same thing I'm dealing with although he was there a lot earlier but you know I have a couple things going wrong boxing at 4 in the morning they couldn't find a big enough ring then they when they put the ring together it was like 18 by 19 so and then they're the punch to actually I actually thought I was going to block it but it came around this side I put my I put my hand up to block it but it came round hit me one of those things where a man threw a terrific punch with my chin happened to be in the way of what is it like when that's over when you're sitting there and you know you lost but you know that under the right circumstances this guy is not at your level in fact you know my problem was before I got up the rent and you what I did wrong which was the greatest thing that ever happened to me like another day he wouldn't throw a lucky punch like that it wouldn't hit me and he wouldn't have a ref that you know was on his side as well how's the traffic on the side Deonte at Isidro but you know if that was the Refuge even with a condom out straight away at the press conference. Write left-handed the fact that Tyson got up and then won the remainder the round that is crazy I'm so frustrated that fights on happening again whenever you know I'm looking up but heavyweight scene and Joshua Joshua New England and you know we have the opportunity to fight Beyonce and didn't take it I'm like if that was me I would have took that chance because you never know what happens down the road like what's happening you know and you know it's up to me is being put on the Shelf now we have to talk somebody that nobody really wants into boxes he fighting next baby baby Miller Big Baby Miller big baby you know I haven't seen too much of him I don't know too much about him but you know he's talked so good fight and I know he weigh over 300 pounds at one time and yeah and you know now he's got an opportunity to fight the Joshua so he's taking full advantage of it like he should but you know I don't see anything as history to show me that he can beat Joshua allegedly will see never know yeah I mean this isn't one of those things where I think this is where Anthony's got to be extra careful because Miller's going to try and twice as hard and if Joshua doesn't rain like he's fighting Deonte Bryant he's going to he may take it for granted make a mistake and you can do that a lot of trouble gave me a lot of trouble for 12 rounds like literally the guy's head snapping back on this guy's not going or not going around going nowhere know how hard you punch and you see a guy just eating them like some people just are built weird they didn't take a shot know I learned are coming up I learned that like you to talk to the head or weak to the body some guys are tough to the body weak To The Head and some guys just made out of rocks yeah yeah yeah it's almost like ignorant Bliss it's just don't know they're supposed to feel I don't know I mean I really think it's a physiological thing I think some guys can just take a shot they just did just built better lights were on the chin first couple minutes and it's like he does a glint off my chin was like what happened to punch was so hard to hit you on the chin everybody saying y'all did you see that funky never felt tape of it is it because of factors like how much you got hit in training how well you feel coming into the fight where you're at in your career and there's a lot of factors like for instance going to give you a good Wicked Factory box for 2 years and all of a sudden you step into the ring and it's a title fight and you bought you first good hit you get is going to concussion really because you you haven't been getting those hits for that last 2 years now this man hit you with the two years and you getting used to it and you have you felt it and you've gotten over you need to get over that Hill is it a metal hell it isn't meant to her because even for me for me when I haven't fought for a while you know I go out there until I get hit once I get hit that wakes everything about you Citgo like that you're not supposed to hit me I'm supposed to hit you so I guess so the hasim Rahman fight after it was over when you worried you were going to get a we're not going to get a rematch yes in fact we chased him to three courts around the world and that he didn't want to fight me and I'll let you know if I was in his position I wouldn't want to fight me either because you know I'm coming back for Revenge plus there's a big money fight out they were Tyson so so happened to say after the fight no more Lewis Tyson no more Lewis Tyson and he actually left South Africa without visiting Mandela like why you go African up with the Mandela I did just want to get out of there choose this all seems like it was his you signed it yes will you got to give him the rematch this is you signed it to kemuri Matt so you have to give me a rematch so I didn't want to hear that so I was happy. How long did it take two years to years all those bras in the ESPN Studio mahabis slippers shoes in the world why I didn't come with a fight right and I had to like you know to press slipper shoes the worst if anything goes down in those leather shoulder in between after waited so touchy two years have been so frustrating it was it was because you never know if you're going to get the fight or not or you know these guys are running from you they signed to fight a rematch because you know now they didn't want to sign it I remember when that right hand landed I remember that I was watching it home I threw my arms up in the air I was like oh, you waiting for it and hopefully this this fight rock you come cut catch me cuz my speed was different you know in South Africa was a lot slower now he got kind of frustrated because he couldn't get it man over the top of the shoulder you are the greatest of all-time man to have you get ko'd like that personally made it endeared people to in a way because it showed your vulnerability but also your character and your ability to come back which is not easy man when you get stopped like that like psychologically it's got to be f****** with your head let me tell you the first time I lost everybody was coming up and shaking my head and say what what you going to do now let me tell you the first time I lost everybody was coming up and shaking my head and say what what you going to do now like what am I going to do now I'm going to go back and win championships okay you know they didn't think it was going to be possible but I'm thinking Muhammad Ali gain the championship three times so I've only lost it once I can do it again</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> hard but maybe one more gym have any thoughts like that well you know I told people like I'll take I'll take my pajamas off for a hundred Mill I looked at Tyson's history and I was coming from the same history that I'm coming from you know and you spend some time in the car situation while he was incarceration I'm still out there fighting and and training hard he didn't have that where I am there so when when he came out it's like you know he's training again he's doing what what what he knows not what he loves but what he knows that's what's going to make him some money that's going to put food on the table so it's like old-time fight isn't say what made them stay in boxing so long that's the only thing they knew Ryan didn't they're not going to be no singer or dancer whatever they only know boxing and this is where they get their money from so they that's what that's what forces and back into the ring special money at the time but not the money that they would have been making if it was today I mean you know you had to go see it live in like how much I paid for the radio who was on the radio was it Jack Dempsey Gene Tunney that was the first million-dollar gate I think so Tyson was in jail he must have been doing something cuz he came out jacked like you look good like you came out looking different never looked like six pack and we built when he fought Peter McNeeley how many dudes before it's enough bag but they probably had a weight room you know I'm shipping out on Bedard even you know yeah I bet I bet he had to listen to a lot of shity things from guard it's funny when I seen him be arrested taken from the courtroom and they got they must have got the biggest guy they could ever get to go put handcuffs on him or something like that anyway situation that I hope a lot of people stay away from when he went away did you feel like damn it like I'm going to miss out on that fight that I want to guess. oh no I'm gonna have to wait and delay my retirement after you were waiting you are considering retirement even before he was incarcerated yeah interesting in the bowl fight both Fried Chicken Bowl you know you figured that chicken bow are the fires in La where they called all the great ones on Gerry Cooney me Foreman Spinks was there and take a picture I'm like dude you can't stand beside me understand</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> a few years ago what was that like I think in a situation like that most people emerged from a particular disaster and think my God since this is so awful it must be an anomaly and you know I think New York was really horrified as a city by Sandy but there's going to be Sandy's remember the exact that like once every five category storm was Sandy a category 3 so it's not even 5 yeah so if a 5 hidden is it possible for 5 to hit New York Institute far north know I was just a few months ago who is like one of the he was one of the lead authors on that the UN report the New York there's a lot of Consulting with the city and I said so we can build a seawall to protect New York from flooding and he was like Alexa Manhattan real estate way too expensive to let flood so we'll definitely go to Seawall but an infrastructure project like that takes at least 30 years to build and if we started right now we wouldn't be able to finish in time to save Howard Beach and parts of Brooklyn and Queens we started right now he said he knows this and you'll see in the next few years they'll stop doing repairs on infrastructure. Attending to the subway lines in those neighborhoods and even a few years after that they'll start staying explicitly the people who live there you might be able to continue living in these homes for a couple decades but you're not going to be able to leave them leave them to your kids low this is a New York City is like the richest country in the world and he a huge parts of parts of Southern Brooklyn Queens are going to be underwater so for the people that live there right now what parts are you talking about I'm with the one that the one who mentioned which is it's kind of an injury so I can unlock neighborhood and you know it's still yeah really well yeah yeah New Jersey real estate could be underwater by 2030 20-30 it's like Bangladesh that countries going to be almost entirely underwater that's hundreds of millions of people if we wanted to build a seawall they can't afford that who's going to afford who's going to pay for that and this is all because of the raising was sea level because of the melting ice because of the temperature and all that is happening on Rivers because so flooding in the UK is expected to grow 50-fold by the end of the century-old London is already like underwater a couple times a year I mean not the whole city but it is this Jamie this is Bangladesh Carter will be totally underwater apartment buildings like you can see the water level look back up a little bit if it's just a running a little but if you see it look at like does not look like a water level in the the apartment buildings in the right hand side and you were you curse her is like like that's going to go up to wear that orange level is f****** Christ let me over Millennia if they're going to rise their self find they find these artifacts in things in the middle of the ocean in areas where people used to be able to live another can't live anymore yeah I think that'll be we have to move people have to move so what's a good spot Alberta you know I talked about the impacts of economic growth before but they're going to be part of the benefit economically from this anywhere in the north to Canada Russia and Scandinavia will benefit because why can't don't go to Scandinavia go to candidates right there he's got the economist who study the stuff say that there is actually an optimal temperature for human productivity is 13 degrees Celsius which is the historical median temperature of u.s. historical median temperature of Germany what is 13 Celsius degrees decrease 55.4 and so for every degree north of that you lose about a percentage point of GDP of the US is now in about 13 and 1/2 degrees Celsius at a medium temperature that means that we're losing that a half percentage of GDP every year from it but there are parts of the US that were cooler than 13 and are now brought up to the optimal level Silicon Valley is like exactly at 13 degrees right now which is you know notable cuz there super productive and that's going to be so that'll be true for Scandinavia General in a maybe part of the explanation why there's been so much economic productivity in the last generation is that they have already started doing better with temperature crops are going to be more Bountiful in Russia like Russia will have better agriculture because of global warming which is why didn't they make such a another there such a complicated figure in the geopolitical story about climate so they are petro-state they have almost activity has to do with burning oil but they're all supposed to benefit from warming so they're ee motivated to produce more global warming and they have such a f*** the rest of the world perspective that they're not going to stop where is Canada probably they're like like they even though they benefit from warming I probably get on board with any program to avert women but that is a message with the faces every nation you know like Justin Trudeau guess you know talks a lot of s*** about Donald Trump and his kind of policy but enfadoso approving new pipelines Angela Merkel does the same but she's retiring nuclear so quickly in Germany that they're having to use dirty energy and even though they've had this incredible green energy Revolution there their missions are going up and every country in the world is it a collective action problem every country in the world is incentivized to behave badly and let the rest of the world clean up the mess. Starting this guy yesterday about wildfires in California doing so great you know with all of the admission standards are basically you know holding themselves to the Paris Accords even though the country as a whole isn't but that impact isn't local is global so is dissipated the temperature in packed on California wildfires will be determined by it like I said earlier basically what you wanted so in terms of you know what any individual area when an individual nation is doing the motivations are really really complicated there and in California particular is it better with Tangent but the state has done incredible stuff with emission standards fuel efficiency green energy and yet all of those games now are wiped out every year by the fires because fires are trees trees are burning trees are basically Cole in the sense that they are stored carbon when they burn their release carbon into the atmosphere to every time there wildfires like they were last year in California it lit wiped out all of the progress that the state made in all of its green initiatives that year yeah in Brazil that the president wants to like basically DeForest the Amazon the Amazon is responsible for oxygen and is a shoot 2 all plants obviously absorb carbon to produce oxygen to plant life is really good for and is a huge of all plants obviously absorb carbon to produce oxygen the plant life is really good for fighting climate changes he wants a d4c Amazon like at what scale what is he what is he talking about doing so the scientist who studies his proposal say that his plans would be the equivalent of adding over 10 year. Adding a second China to the world global footprint</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> who want to be World historical figures they're literally do that who who do you think is doing that like yeah a billion dollars pouring a billion dollars a year into his into space exploration project which is like I mean I'm excited by space to I think it'd be cool to go up there but there's some pressing problems here which we could really benefit you know that money could really benefit and I agree but long-term I think the philosophy is that we're going to have to get off this planet it if the human race is going to succeed but I'm not just the threat of global warming but of a scallop when is factors it's an asteroid thing I think mommy from Mia Nova's yeah there's a lot of factors particular question of climate there's just no way that the Earth is going to get a tin hospitable as Mars is so the idea of building a colony there as a hedge against global warming is just crazy we could it is ridiculous the positive note if we could fix that s*** all yeah I can imagine what we do here Paradise ideas the machine is going to create oxygen in the environment and yeah well it's a good place to practice cuz no one lives there but you could do all kinds of goofy s*** and go well good news and bad news the good news is we figure out a way to terraform the bad news is really f*****-up marked they're going to try another spot where to go to get your anus yet But ultimately the Sun going to burn out right like I do but if we really do look into the Future something something has to be done you know I mean this is the the grandest of grand scale to the concept of some sort of interstellar arcs the timescale of the threat that we need to avert by space exploration that's a timescale of Millenia yes we have a lot of new technology develop of the thousand years that allow us to do it better and more efficiently the climate change the time scale is like the next 30 Years right so we need to focus hundred now known as the opportunity to do the other why do you think it's sexier to go to space is that what it is like the rockets and I mean I think for these dudes yeah it's a big metal dick in the atmosphere made that argument about Mars this generation of people really grew up in the in the age of like the the Space Race yeah I mean it's and the aftermath of landing on the moon and I think there is like Peter Thiel talks about this there's this kind of unfulfilled sense of future that we all liked anybody who grew up in the post-war years in the 67 they were like yeah whatever his famous line we promised flying cars and all we got was 140 characters or whatever I didn't get that applies to the space exploration stuff is like well the government is no longer doing the really ambitious yet we can do it privately on the other hand there is a government in the world that is doing that s*** in China they just landed on The Far Side of the Moon they're doing really aggressive space exploration and I haven't been there in 20 years but the people I know who live there say there's so much faith in the future there they just believed in a very inherent deep down way that like the future will be better and sci-fi in an exciting way and it's so far in from the way that Americans think about the future that part of the benefit of having a dictator run things I think it's just like they're on a huge upswing right so like there's no debate about how things get done yeah I mean that's what I was saying before it gives you some hope for climate of immediately no more call we look at these Super Rich billion billion are characters that are on the top of the Heap why do we think of them is like having these tremendous Eagles and looking like Gods isn't it sort of just that's just how you're always going to look at someone who lives in of a hundred million dollar house and if possible I think when you look at me not to get to like armchair psychologizing like a young man he's you know just kind of like do EB and now he's like an action hero is it really yeah I mean maybe not like you but he's like he's yeah he's pretty did I just have thin skins on the worlds zoom in Amazon has been actually really pretty great, yeah I like to listen to the guy talk and I loved his letter to the National Enquirer Larry as we out here in front of the King Kong Rampage movie</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> virtue signaling totally I've been asked like you know as I've been promoting the book by lot of people like what have you done to in your life to change and it's like well I'm flying a little bit less Define really makes me feel guilty but otherwise I basically haven't changed anything because I do think of politics and policy of the most important impact you can have and I'm like spreading the word whether I eat like a couple few were hamburgers years it doesn't really matter that much but the idea that you would ask a newcomer to the movement demonstrate their commitment by making themselves the most optimally committed that they possibly could be that's just going to alienate so many people and this is obviously a issue where we need more people engaged in a more direct profound way so I think for me it's like anyone he wants to care about climate wants to vote about climate like come on like you know how they would be really important here corny storytelling about climate change and that there are actually opportunities for like really incredible new kinds of Storytelling I mean in the book I read about the story that happened a couple years ago where you know Anthrax that was killed a reindeer in Russia in the early Twentieth Century the reindeer was frozen in permafrost for the entire 20th century permafrost melted the reindeer thought the anthem released and killed at least one boy and a number of other reindeer in Russia and that is true so in the ice in the Arctic Ice are no of rock is like a record of geological history Isis also record of geological history so they're like the Bubonic plague is trapped in ice the Spanish Flu in 1918 that killed hundreds of millions of people are trapped in ice in the Arctic ice from before humans were around which means the humans system have no experience with them I didn't know that the Spanish Flu like in lab conditions anyway they've revived bacteria that are millions of years old Russian doctor literally injected a bacteria that he had revived from like 35,000 years ago it been frozen 35000 years you brought it back to life and injected it into himself why would you do that just to see what we that's a f****** Marvel comic book come like the Red Skull or some s*** yeah we will be arriving in Copenhagen because the temperature allows them to live there anyway that they never lived we'll be reading about kind of conflict will be reading about you know I mean all this s*** it's it's it's everywhere if you know air pollution increases the rate of autism ADHD it changes the development of babies in utero it's like it's all-encompassing the disease in the ice things really freaking me out I never even with the methane and carbon is going to be emitted into the atmosphere as it melts there we know there was there this species of antelope called a Saiga Antelope they they're mostly in Siberia they're kind of dwarf antelopes and they've been around for millions of years and all of a sudden in 2016 and 2015 they literally all died it's called Megadeth the entire species died they're extinct there now extinct Jesus and that happened because a bacteria that have been living inside their guts was changed by temperature conditioned it was unusually hot unusually humid summer and this bacteria that have been living inside them presumably for millions of years comfortably as a kind of peaceful cooperator became a killer and killed the entire species now we have inside us countless bacteria and viruses scientist believe millions in every human so our guts are full of bacteria that do our digestion for us they monitor our moods you know there's some scientist who think it's really misleading to even think of the human as a unitary animal rather than a kind of composite creature with system yeah and most of those bacteria and viruses are not going to be dramatically transformed by a degree or two degrees of warming but there's so many of them the chances that one could it's hard to dismiss that and whether that would mean we'd all immediately go extinct probably not but what if that means suddenly schizophrenia increases by 15% because schizophrenia is related to a bacterial infection called Toxoplasma gut bacteria Toxoplasma Gondii complex such intricate ecosystems like you say that if one little thing gets Disturbed it could have really catastrophic impact on us and that's true of the planet as a whole I think that's bait that's one of the big lessons of my book is at this is such a delicate system it's been stable for all of human history and now it's not stable what that means for how we live we don't know yet that the changes will be significant will be profound but it's also true of the individual you know our bodies will be living differently in the world is two degrees warmer than the today we can't really predict with those impacts will be but it could be quite dramatic and they could be things we can't even imagine stay because you know by some counts millions of bacteria inside us that we haven't even identified yet Jesus Christ you're freaking me out day that God damn it's a crazy world out there not just crazy but it seems like when it when you talk about things like this we talked about climate change affecting our actual gut parasites or gut biome literally contains what human beings behave mean these are all things are never discussed and it did it just it's really terrifying really is you know I mean and part of the problem is people here in like I'll relax everything's fine this is this constant thing that we do wear if it's not affecting us currently right now in the moment is not a fire in front of us we don't worry about it it's a weird compartment compartmentalization thing that human beings do currently right now in the moments on a fire in front of us we don't worry about it it's a weird compartment compartmentalization thing that human beings do you think that Evolution would have trained us differently you think that Evolution would have turned us over time to have at least some long-term capacity and I guess we do have some long-term planning capacity but we choose to think when really short term ways</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but it really won't be crazy I think a generation from now for another country to threaten at least sanctions and maybe military action to deal with that you know after World War II we built a whole liberal International order around the principle of human rights that would have been Unthinkable in the twenties and yet it led to a series of military invent interventions over the next half-century because people are behaving badly towards their own citizens if we could do that it didn't seem all that crazy to me that tape 30 years from now Imperial China looking at someone like bolsonaro Brazil would just be like now if you can't do that I'm just getting we're just going to go in and take you out and this is all encompassing all impacting read our politics will be shaped by it or geopolitics will be shaped by our you know everything will be shaped by it we could have climate Wars like in the not-too-distant future Jesus Christ being received the book people resisting it is there anybody that wants to debate you on this so I wrote this article a couple years ago that produced I mean was a huge viral phenomenon but it it produced also some scientific criticism and you know we published a fully annotated version where every single episode where every single line came from but they were still scientist who were arguing about whether the messaging was precisely calibrated with it was too Bleak to dark the book has had none of that first of all it's been the best of the first week was on the Times bestseller list number 6 that's out in England it's been in that about Amazon top 10 and all of the reviews have been really kind I think this goes to what you were saying before I think like the conversation is changing people are actually really interested in talking seriously about just how big a deal this is any way that they might not have been just a year ago where is the resistance so is there any right now Facebook with just a concept in general 73% of Americans believe climate change is real 70% of Americans are concerned about it those numbers are up 15% since 2015 who are the 27 that don't I mean I think it's you know it's hard right-wingers yeah passes through a prism of partisan politics or like you know his amazing studies that show that in the early 90s there was no partisan divide between on the question of whether OJ Simpson was guilty when you control for race Republicans and Democrats had the same idea about OJ Simpson's guilt that is totally Unthinkable today and there's now issued Parts in split on whether 12 years of slave deserves an Oscar partisanship is like totally taken over our minds such that the fact that we have 73% of Americans who believe global warming is real and happening to me that a really f****** high number because one of the two part I don't think the Republican party is really anymore Adonai our party I think they're just a party of Skeptics and self-interest they want it like lookout for business interests which actually the calculus they're changing the time to talk about in a second but people don't want to believe that horrifying things are real because who would it's terrifying but 73% of the country that's a lot I mean that's you know that's more support than there is for just about anything so I'm like basically Undisputed I wish that those numbers have grown adult 15-point since 2015 eight points to since March as moved out that's incredible and I do think that the economic logic is really powerful here so used to be the case that there was economic conventional wisdom that action on climate was going to be really expensive cuz you were quite massive upfront investment and it would mean also for going economic growth but all of the new research the last couple reverses that logic totally so there's a big report 2018 that said that we could add 26 trillion dollars to the global economy through Rapid decarbonization by just 2030 we can avoid all these horrible 600 trillion-dollar impacts that were talking about if we decarbonize rapidly and they're also obviously business opportunities there their whole Solar Empires to build their whole new electric grid to build is better for the economy then slow action on climate that hasn't yet totally taken over the perspective of our policymakers globally but I think it will soon and when it does I think that we'll see like a real see changing in their respective because I think for a long time even people who cared about climate thought well I want to do something but if I have to like costume people some jobs and cost like a percentage point of economic growth that's not worth it rode this is a slow-moving phenomenon will invent our way out of it will grow our way out of it but all the new research says like let's get started right now and we'll see how that plays out I mean if we really have to have Global emissions by 2030 it means really really aggressive action which I don't think is possible but I do think it will be much more aggressive action in the decade had to move out of the decades in the past so you think that once there is a financial incentive for people to either some sort of an industry that produces carbon or something along those lines industries that are working to mitigate global warming that once there's a financial sort of benefit for these people to innovate and to to move forward with this too. We're going to see real change of particular companies but also you know government leaders who look around and say if the economic picture is going to be better 10 years from now if we make Macedon green energy then it would be an end even like pass laws you know regulating safe fuel efficiency or even Banning internal combustion engines which I think will happen within a couple decades if that's going to be at the economic picture taking that path is much Rosier than the economic picture of inaction I think they'll go down that path of action and the question is how aggressively how quickly but I do think that you know I do think the incentives will be different 5 years from now than they looked five years ago and that'll be that'll be huge so that that you think would be a great motivator for people to shift their perceptions and particularly right-wing folks may be amongst the 27% that are in denial American arrogance like what it what do you think is the root of that I think it's it's basically bad behavior by the oil companies I mean they've like put out really aggressive disinformation and denial the movie on Merchants of Doubt yeah yeah example. vicious research on climate so they are you know then they ended up suppressing that going forward but they knew s*** about how the planet was going to change before any of the rest of us then and there was no standards for President we would have had to globally cut emissions by about 3% per year to get below 2° we're now at a spot where we have to cut them by about 10% per year and we wait another decade we're going to have to cut them by 30% per year which is like an unthinkable rate so we wouldn't have had to take such aggressive action if we had started early we would have had to just be doing moderate kind of on the margins changes but we're now in a situation where the problem is way too big for that and people who want to talk about the solutions that could have been useful 20 years ago now the carbon tax is like one quite popular things to talk about the UN says that in order to be effective the carbon a global carbon tax would need to be perhaps as high as $5,500 a ton and there's nowhere else in the world is nowhere in the world where there's taxes even 1/100 as high as that right now in the place in the world where they do have contacted everybody dimensions are still growing up so they're there was a time when like the kind of like change anything we'll just like fit on the margins here could have worked if we had taken if we had really been focused on it but we're sort of past that point now unfortunately but it's interesting and oil companies I think I think there was sponsible for denial but I also think that denial is not all that important American politics because when you look around the world you see many countries with dirt with very different politics even quite universally focused on climate issues we're not behaving any better when it comes to carbon then we are and so you think will what is the sickness here is at the Republican party in their climate denial or is it the fact that all of us just want you no more better cheaper stuff and we have a really hard time conceiving of different pads that don't push Us Fort towards more consumption and you know more more than modern amenities that we sort of assumed old keep accumulating overtime I mean people say capitalism is a problem I had some sympathy for that few look around the world I see social democracies were behaving really poorly when it comes to carbon I see socialist countries were behaving really poorly when it comes to carbon it seems on some level I can't even deeper than the systems that we have to organize and manage our cultural priorities and there are now you know getting back to the villainy of the all companies during all these lawsuits that are being brought against them for basically on the model of the of the cigarette companies like that for a climate damages and maybe they may be victorious they may put some of these companies out of business I think it's not that likely but it's possible they're also other lawsuits they're having a really interesting there's one in the Netherlands that some people held the Dutch government they usually Dutch government would not honoring the Paris Accords and citizen Sue to hold them to that and won the case so the Dutch government is now obligated legally to do better on climate than they were doing on their own and in the US there's this amazing court case called you what's the United States which is a lawsuit being brought by kids using this kind of ingenious use of equal protection Clause they're arguing that their generation has been exposed to climate damages that they're the previous generation of parents generation were protected from and so they're saying this climate policy is a violation of the equal protection Clause you're not protecting us in the same way you protected our parents that's of the district court in Oregon which is just one level the Supreme Court I think it'll win in the district court almost certainly won't one of the Supreme Court but if it did one of the Supreme Court it would immediately obligate the US to a totally maximalist climate policy because it's literally impossible to protect the Next Generation from climate damages as fully as the previous generation was but they'd be obligated to do everything they could which would mean sort of suddenly something like that call for which would be really kind of traumatic incredible and I think that's one path for just through litigation because so many places in the world is not just politics are inert like American politics are inert it's just there's a lot of slow-moving bureaucracy and slow-moving public opinion and in the same way that a lot of civil rights victories were fought and won in the courts and then we might be able to make some progress and in the course on climate to we'll see</div>

It's very strange leaving changing lanes for you it's weird it's weird it's very difficult to let go and to give in like that but the strange thing that I was the the blowback from my friends like and they're joking around obviously most my friends are comedian but it's it's hilarious even people have hackled me about it I feel it like I understand that would like the Prius we like cigarettes and whiskey and mock someone eating a salad yeah it's very weird it is very weird but I was just an American problem like other parts in the world but there's something particularly strange about being on that side of it but when did the podcast I told my excuse tell me how great their own but I really did not expect to like it as much as I do and then once I got it I was like okay now I get it yeah but then I was thinking about my own resistance to it because I like cars I have no muscle cars I have a couple of an older Porsche I love them they're fun I like those kind of car they're stupid they really are dumb that's a dumb way to get around the the test was a way better way to get around you yeah and he's got one that's coming out in 2020 that's going to have a 660 my range which is inside me to drive all the way to San Francisco and back with you how to charge Tesla and SolarCity and I don't understand why there aren't more people in Silicon Valley who are</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is red herring the u.s. is 15% of global emissions and we're falling the future climate of the world will be determined by China by India by sub-Saharan Africa those are carbon footprint they're growing China's now almost twice as big a carbon footprint is the US and they're building all the infrastructure outside of China that doesn't even count in Asia and Africa you know the belt and Road you know this project hope that the US had building the infrastructure of the developing world so recently they they loaned Kenya a huge amount of money to build a new rail line which was good being built with Chinese workers they built the rail line then it can you can pay back the debt so China is threatening to take over the entire Port of Mombasa a debt repayment and this is like going on all around the world Highway cross Africa across Asia are being built by Chinese workers as an in an effort to build a new Imperial infrastructure for themselves and is the thought that they're doing this in terms of setting up the debt in a way that's on payable so that they could take over at that's one motive I think I think they're stitching together an alternative to the Western infrastructure of trade and Transit they're basically stitching together an entire system of how the world will work how the economy will work and will be conducted through their own infrastructure and through their own ports into their own airports and that's being done by their own standards or China is now pouring more concrete every 3 years in the entire than the u.s. support in the entire 20th century so did path of development of these other countries China India what's up there in Africa are really was going to be writing the story of the future America has a kind of I think like a moral obligation to lead because historically we had the biggest carbon footprint but at the moment we're relatively small part of the problem and within the US market forces are doing a lot of or making a lot of progress for us so the real issue is how do we figure out a new geopolitics that forces countries like China to better and one answer may be as weird as it is to say that you know she's in pain is basically a dictator if he wants to impose new standards if he wants to invest aggressively in green energy he doesn't. Political obstacles that we have in the US and so there's a sort of weird sympathy among American climate people for that authoritarianism and he has especially since Trump has been elected been a lot more aggressive and talking find it because he sees if America is not going to be leading this is an opportunity for China to be like a real face of climate and that means they've paid you know they've invested a ton in in solar and wind they've done a lot with air pollution to Beijing used to be really awful in 2013 and more than a million Chinese people died of air pollution and now that's much better would have they done imposing stricter standards on on position so emissions but you know we think about we think about carbon in the whole problem I think a little too much in terms of energy energy just 30% of the global carbon footprint and it's the easiest want to sell because wind and solar is actually really cheap now most part of the world is cheaper than dirty energy what's the majority of the footprint well it's all nothing is a majority of transportation and agriculture is like a huge part of it is something like 30% of the global footprint is it because of tractors or what it what is it because of everything everything everything that you need to do to run the farm really everything you need to do to live in the world. Some kind of carbon footprint but you know if we were able to like $3 cattle seaweed that would have like a big that would have a big impact but all kinds of crops have a carbon footprint and they but they would still have to do something to get the seaweed and have the seaweed travel seaweed deliver it to these Farms but you could also do it you know you can imagine lab grown meat having a much smaller carbon footprint it should if it like perseids is it well but the UN says we need to have all of our Global emissions by 2030 to have a chance of averting 2° woman with a call catastrophic women and the projects that we need to put into place in those 11 years are just much bigger than I think we're capable of pulling off they say the UN says what is necessary is a global mobilization at the level of world war against climate starting this year 2019 and there's is no chest that may even be optimistic but the total decarbonization that's required is we need to totally zero out on carbon by 2050 they say and I just think you know a lot of these sectors are much trickier we could maybe zero out on Energy Zero than carbon when it comes to energy in 15 years if we wanted to but just 30% of the total problem because it will allow us to move more slowly than the UN says we need to and still if it works out you know Pizza Planet relatively stable relatively livable but that's you know those technologies have been called magical magical Thinking by the journal Nature which is like the biggest scientific journal writing about their stuff so it's sort of a leap of faith to think that they could solve that problem do you think that we're dealing with like shiy degrees of perception that it is things like your book things like Al Gore's movie things like you know anytime there's a new story that's written the New York Times or in any any periodical we need more of this you needs to be hammered home to people that it's nice to be something that's a global discussion that accelerates totally and I think that that's happening you know I think there was a report that the deal ended in October that sparked a lot of conversation about and I think it's in the grotesquery the best teacher is just extreme weather you know when you see every year these California wildfires every year with are burning and that is really dramatic people I talk to in Europe are focused on the California fires even though they have while I was over there was something about the California fires that they're really worried about when you see these Global heat waves when you see unprecedented hurricane Seasons we just had a typhoon in the Pacific in February first time in recorded history every day on the news there's some there's something you know dramatic extreme weather and when they come one after the other I think that's a really powerful teaching tool so you know there's this term is now outdated but 500-year storm hear a lot about 500-year storm means you know hurricane that would hit a particular area once every five centuries right that means five centuries ago there was no white people in so that means we're talking about a storm that would hump come once as Colonists came to America as they you know committed genocide Native Americans as they built their own Empire State built an Empire of slaves and cotton as they fought a civil war they fought World War 1 fought World War II everything that we've done we expect one one storm of that kind in that time working Harvey was the third 500-year storm to hit Houston in New Year's we are living in such unprecedented climate that it's impossible to look at the news and not learned that despite all of our inclinations all of are reflected to look away I think it is seeping in letting people are beginning to be more alarmed about it and I think alarm is really useful there people in a kind of community who think you know it's it's dangerous to scare people it turns them off but I'm somebody who's awake into this out of fear and when I look history of environmental activism when I look at activism generally like we don't try to get people to stop smoking cigarettes by the like messaging through optimism we try to get them to stop because we tell him how bad it's going to be for them drunk driving nuclear proliferation same thing Rachel Carson you know wrote Silent Spring pesticides it was called hyperbolical I missed it led to the creation of the EPA and you know when you think about that you and directive that we should be mobilizing the scale of World War II do out of panic and I think that. Should be part of how we think about the story obviously I think you know when I look around the world when I talk to anyone when I talk to my family when I watch TV when I watch move whatever read stuff it just seems obvious to me that there are many more people who are still too complacent about this issue even if they're concerned about it a little bit even if they're aware of it they don't think of it as like the overarching all-encompassing story of our time that requires at an existential response and even saying those words make me uncomfortable because I like it's hard it's hard for me to believe that this threat is that big but that is what the sign says and like I said before but when you look at the full scope of it and just how just how large just how Bleak the impacts will be you realize like really need to wake up to just how dangerous a world we're heading into and do everything we can to avoid it it's hard for me to believe that this threat is that big but that is what the sign says and like I said before 7 that science is not going to get born out when you look at the full scope of it and just how just how large just how Bleak the impact will be you realize like really need to wake up to just how dangerous a world we're heading into and do everything we can to avoid it in addition to probably planning to adapt</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> don't think that we're doing it that there are people that can possibly consider some sort of way to mitigate this and what what are the what are the ways of being proposed and how seriously are they being taken other than this idea of building these machines extract carbon in the atmosphere I'm sure you're probably aware of them there's some of the programs that they've talked about suspending reflective particles in the atmosphere to to minimize the amount of solar radiation we receive earlier who's like done the most the most Innovative carbon capture machine I talked to him a few weeks ago and he was like nah nah pollution be used after we should be doing solar geoengineering which is what you're talking about and that means probably suspending sulfur is like the most useful thing in the atmosphere right we're going to smell like sulfur red Jesus oceans are going to change color there is if we do that we suspend more green two more blue but around the sunlight coming to the Earth would be reflected back into the atmosphere and less sunlight Earth would absorb less sunlight which would make it a little bit cooler the problem is that we have some crippling impact on agriculture and we basically don't know other side effects they would have and how would you take that stuff out when you can just stop doing it it has a shelf life of I don't know what it is ten years so you could just stop doing it and that's a big concern actually because if we did that just to mask the amount of global warming that we are doing then whatever program was responsible for it would be vulnerable to terrorism to war because if we if we were if the planet were functionally warm to say 5 degrees but we are suspending enough sulfur that it was actually only two degrees warmer than if we just friends seems like somebody bombed the facility that was doing it the planet would be immediately tripped into a much much hotter State and that would be completely catastrophic even more catastrophic them in more slow approach to 5° cuz we would just do it over several centuries in ways we be able to adjust immediate why sulfur I think it's just something about that particular characteristic of it I don't know wouldn't it smell harm it would literally be like hell like that's what you always hear about with the horror movies like The Devil smells like sulfur yeah and I mean it's a fart smell like are are really toxic and that brings me to methane that's another issue as well right yeah the cows producing methane gas yet on a large-scale Agriculture and but it's also already doing this so we have small particulate pollution that's or aerosol pollution stuff suspended in the atmosphere that's why I like Delhi is really hard to breathe and cuz we have a lot of particulate in the atmosphere that is already suppressing global temperatures by as much as a half degree or maybe one degree which means and that's the reason it does 9 million people are dying every year from air pollution there we solve that problem we saw the air pollution problems save those nine million lives every year we would immediately make the planet at least a half a degree warmer and possibly one which would put us at the threshold of catastrophe or above it there were sort of already doing this program just not in the systematic way we're doing in a haphazard way to mention they're basically two big issues with methane the first is cows so yeah cows produce methane which is depending on how you count about 35 or maybe 85 times stronger greenhouse gas than carbon bow these are small-scale studies that show if we feed cattle just a little bit of seaweed there methane emissions Could Fall by 95 or 99% so we could if if that was scalable which is not clear it is but if it was we could immediately eliminate the entire carbon footprint of beef which people talk about a lot now methane issue is there is carbon stored in Frozen permafrost in the northern latitudes that permafrost is melting and when it melts that carbon will be released into the atmosphere we don't know the proportion that it will be released as carbon dioxide vs methane but there is in that permafrost twice as much carbon as now exist in the atmosphere which means if it were all released possibly in a relatively sudden way it could make problem immediately three times worse and it could be even the effect could even be more dramatic than that if it was released mostly because nothing is stronger gas the most scientists think that's not something that we need to freak out about in the short-term but is there it is melting and nothing is being released at some rate so craziest solution than I ever heard of that one was to bring back the woolly mammoth by releasing them throughout Siberia yes crazy right I mean I think that we're going to have a whole A Century of s*** like that and some s*** like cows eating seaweed that everything you know we'll have our global politics will be reoriented around climate change so that you'll start to see sanctions put against Nations that are behaving badly and yes the guy who's you know the like kind of dog is running Saudi Arabia now says he needs to be totally awful oil by 2050 I think that's cuz he knows that you know the global Community will not tolerate someone producing more oil and as recently as soon as a few decades from now but the impacts are you know everywhere so that like yeah like in California now you know to show yourself in the Smoke which is really really damaging its effects on cognitive performance are really dramatic can lower cognitive performance by like 10 to 15%. development of kids is really dramatic there was an incredible study a few years ago where he looked at places where they instituted Eazy-E pass out here in California no tolls The Institute of E-ZPass cartridges drive-thru and them and they produce less exhaust and the effect on the on premature birth and low birth weight in the areas where the Institute of these new ez-pass toll plazas introduced them by like 15% each that's how dramatic just the exhaust affect is on development of babies how much is an effective electric cars that problem on the technological level has been solved we know how to replace cars with electric cars we can make them even pretty affordable not quite as affordable as they need to be but the new Teslas are like 35 Grand I think he got it down to 15 Grands that'll be you know that'll be issued solution for dinner a lot of other problems that are more difficult like air travel we don't have electric planes around the corner you can't fly planes but it seems I probably at least like a decade away and you know one cross-country flight in the u.s. is the equivalent one seat on one cup cross-country flight is equivalent to 8 months of driving every time you fly from New York to London and back you melt 9 3 square meters of ice every single seat on every flight from New York to London melts 3 square meters of ice of Arctic. yeah I think it's time you fly across the countries like eight months of driving there globally air travel is only 2% of the carbon footprint so it's relatively small but for people in especially rich people in rich countries it's a much bigger part of the 50 Cent lying around all yeah but yeah I know the average American I think that is the average American every year it's enough carbon to melt 10,000 tons of ice Jesus Christ that's just the average American and if you're a person like me who flies like every other weekend it's way worse way worse yeah so know the plus side is it's way better to get hotter than it is to get colder right like ice ages kill everything well do you know the each of the so they've been five mass extinctions inflammatory history in the Earth's history before one of them was killed was caused by an asteroid but the other four were were produced by global warming related to greenhouse gas and one of them the Ice Age movie Ice Age doesn't count it didn't didn't kill did the biggest mass extinction the end-permian extinction which is 252 million years ago 92 95% of all life on earth. When was that 252 a complete slate wiping of The evolutionary record it's like we're starting over from scratch so we want to think that the asteroid that hit the Yucatan did the most damage in terms of the fossil record is that not true is the one that was the global warming was that what are five and four of them are from global warming in the worst the worst one was just from from greenhouse gas warming by the other the one that killed the dinosaurs was also really bad it was something like 70% of our life but it's less than the one where there was a temperature rise yeah wow Steamboat suspended particles cuz it basically cloudy atmosphere with and it dropped global temperatures I think it was two degrees and the human population at the time then shrunk to 7,000 there's a bunch of times but it will be transformed will be very different if what's 4 degrees warmer and you know everything about the way that we take for everything we take for granted today is like a permanent feature of the modern world I think we're going to learn is much more precarious much more unstable and yeah like I said earlier you know dinosaur stable for all of human history that's how we were able to evolve at our able to invent agriculture the part of the world where we didn't invent agriculture the Middle East is now getting almost too high Crocs it's also going to be too hot to go to Mecca for a pilgrimage in just a couple decades weather like we're entirely outside of that window of temperatures which means were functionally now living on an entirely different planet than humans ever lived on before and it's going to keep changing so by the time we get to 234 degrees will be at living in a climate that's you know two or three or four times as much different as the one where is now from the one before the industrial when do temperatures which means were functionally now living on an entirely different planet than humans ever lived on before and it's going to keep changing so by the time we get to 234 degrees will be a living in a climate that's you know two or three or four times as much different as the one that where is now from the one before the Industrial Revolution and yeah it's like those impacts could be totally overwhelming and catastrophic</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that's scared a lot of people but was also very widely dismissed by lot of the people's well how accurate was that movie I didn't prove to be too sanguine it like it didn't deal with a lot of extreme weather I thought that stuff was far away and I think this is one of the one of the big shortcomings of most writing about climate most kind of communication about climate for 25 years is that we were told it was slow we were told it was going to be coming May at the scale of centuries something we have to worry about for our grandchildren but when you realize that half of all the damage we've done at the dental last 30 years and you see already the extreme weather we had a global Heatwave last number totally unprecedented people died in Canada they died in Russia that died in the Middle East the same season 3 million people were evacuated in China from a typhoon unprecedented rains in Japan multiple hurricanes in the Caribbean all at once there was an island in Hawaii East Island small island that won the most people gone to literally wiped off the map by Hurricane they're thinking about inventing a new category of hurricane Category 6 all of these impacts were are coming much faster than scientists predicted even a decade or two ago and so I think the first Inconvenient Truth is a little too complacent but outdoors also you know I know in a little bit I talked to him a few times he's temperamental a technocrat he's an optimist he thinks Market forces can solve all this stuff and I don't even totally disagree with him I think the market forces really powerful we had a huge green energy revolution in the US did you know and had spillover effect elsewhere in the world just do their powers now cheaper than anybody expected it would be that good or two ago although it sounds like we haven't replaced anymore dirty energy with a capacity so the ratio of renewable energy to dirty energy is now the same although it sounds like we haven't replaced anywhere dirty energy with it we just added to our capacity so the ratio of renewable energy to dirty energy is now the same as it was 40 years ago but made no progress because we just rather than saying almost retire this coal plant and replace it with a we think I will have a coal plant in the Wind Farm will have more energy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> beings like to react to things that are immediate right in front of them and I think for us it's very difficult to see the future especially if it's inconvenient and especially if it does something to inconvenience or get in the way of our day-to-day routine and that seems we would have what's happening here and that seems to me to be why people are so willing to dismiss it so flippantly because in front of them right now it's not an issue in front of them now this very second is very day I'm going to go Starbucks it's right there it's open will come outside 65 degrees out global warming is not a problem I mean totally true and I feel it in my own life like I mean I've been living I've been working in this material so long I know it so deeply and yet when I look out the window I'm like you know things are fine and I think that is a really powerful anchoring effect like we expect the world of the future look like the world as it does today but all the Sciences that's totally naive then we're going to have at least twice as much warming as we had to this point and I think we need to think about the future of the world in those terms like what it will be at 2 degrees at 3 degrees at 4 degrees but it's not just like the immediacy I think we have so many biases that make like we want to be optimistic about the future we have a status quo bias we we don't want to change things you think that'll be complicated and expensive we have a hard time holding Big Ideas in our head like that the entire planet is like subject these forces in the book I have a little rougher I set you know there's this new not-so-new now 30-40 year discipline in economics behavioral economics which is about all of our cognitive biases how we can't really see the world every single one makes it harder to see climate there's just an English Professor named Timothy Morton who wrote who wrote a book about climate he calls it a hyper object which is like it's a it's a phenomenon that's so big that we can't actually hold it in our heads at once week I see it if I could you imagine seeing a four dimensional object in three dimensional space if that kind of thing where you can only see it at an angle only partially climate changes so all-encompassing that we can't comprehend it properly but I think that's all all of those things are reasons that we need to be listening to the scientists and what they're projecting not to say that everything you're saying is going to come through will come true exactly as they predict it obviously science works against revised some things are Alarma some things are extreme something just wrong but you know I've been really working on this stuff for a couple years and the number of papers I've read that show that make me have a more optimistic idea about the future climate I could count on two hands and the number of papers I read that make me have a Bleaker view of the future it's in the thousands and when you look at the totality of that whether the six climate River natural disaster prediction is going to pan out exactly is Father's Day who knows when you see you know so many so many terrifying studies that you could feel like I did a 300-page book with them you realize that like there's a huge margin for error and it would like we would still be really in bad shape you know is there a I'm sure there have been some studies that made mistakes in terms of like passed out he's had projected that by now we'd all be dead to be a problem is whole concept we have a wrapping your head around and if we find anything that we could point to say all back in the eighties they said we all be dead by now and we're fine we're going to be fine that kind of thing is that that that is an issue correct totally yeah there was a really famous book in the middle of the twentieth century the population so this guy named Paul are like or who he was like you know the world just cannot support this many people like if we get to 8 billion people there just won't be enough food another planet can sustain that and he's often pointed to as a sort of like prophet of Doomsday that and his prophecy totally didn't work out because we had this thing is called the Green Revolution they see what we figured out ways to make crops way way way more productive and that's encouraging civilization does that a lot we figure out a way out of foxholes all the time but that Revolution was literally like one dude Norman boyleg figured out how to grow crops differently in one got one set of Innovations and he completely transformed the whole fate of the planet what did he do he just basically did like genetically modified crops before like the you know before the name it was like a golden rice guy yeah yeah and you know great that's like incredible progress but a lot of that has with power by the industrialization of this country is so that bill is going to come do going forward and you know I think like when you look at climate change you know if it was just one threat like let's take our Cultural Center time that agriculture estimates say that if we continue on the path where I'm by the end of the century grain yields would be half as productive as they are today just buy the temperature affect so we have just as much land just as much grain crops as we have now but the food we get from it and only get a half as much as we get today what's the cause of that it just a temperature affects plants the temperature alone but yeah for crops carbon has a complicated relationship to crop growth like some plants grow better with more carbon but actually there the weeds and one that we like to eat don't grow better with more carbon and so we could have half as much grain and we could have 50% more people than we have right now now there's a way you can imagine like maybe they'll be another Norman Borlaug maybe he'll figure out a way through that when you look across the Spectrum it's like agriculture it's you know Conflict for every 1/2 degree of warming and you get between 10 and 20% more war do we get to the end of the century we can have more than twice as much water as we have to Dennis's projector is the battles over resources mainly that diamond routes weather in a weather impacts basically everything about unstable societies get stressed by temperature rise the Syrian Civil War was you know wasn't singly caused by climate change but it was that's one of the causes there was a drought that produced it and that conflict is not just at the level of nation-states or even Civil War it's also the level of individual so if you look at crime statistics when temperatures go up there give me 30 minutes to mental hospital more when there's when it's warmer out babies develop less well in the womb when it's hotter out if there's for everyday over 90° that have babies in the womb you can see those days in that baby is Lifetime earnings and we're living working to be living on a planet that's considerably warmer that's going to have real dramatic effects on everything air pollution there's a big study that I write about in the book that's totally alarming and eye-opening just between 1.5 integrated woman just do the effects of air pollution would cause that 1/2 degrees warming would cause an additional hundred fifty-three million deaths which is 25 holocaust's that's just air pollution just between 1.5 and 2 degrees n 2 degrees for me is our best-case scenarios for best case scenario is 25 Holocaust worth of death from air pollution and that sounds terrifying people when I say that to them I like holyshit how could we play that's unconscionable but already 9 million people are dying every year from air pollution and we don't pay attention to it so I think the likeliest outcome even as we enter into this like climate hellscape is that we find ways to turn away and not look at like a real pain of people especially in the developing world but can't answer your earlier question you know like you can imagine agriculture getting figured out when you see just how many impacts there are it's like where everything will be changed and it just makes the challenge that much bigger and more complicated because how you know how are going to solve the conflict problem how you going to solve the problem of having 30% less economic growth you know your side that's twice as big as the Great Depression and will be permanent 600 trillion dollars in inclimate Damages twice as much wealth exist in the world today and that's just you know they need to what the right YouTube refugees food I mean it's it's it's so on and I think that's another reason why we don't want to look at it closely because it's terrifying well there's also a matter of how it's being projected to the public right like in in certain circles particularly right-wing circles there there are people that are trying to paint this with Rose Colored Glasses right there trying to maximum short-term profits and sort of dismissed the risks of climate change and asterisks or rather the impact of our but we've done in terms of raising the carbon in the atmosphere there's some people that pointed that like that's this is nonsense science has been disproven there's a few people like that but it's overwhelming the overwhelming consensus of scientists who study this or terrified of it yeah I would say the standard of physics more hilarious but you know the to the deniers you say things like you know the planet was hotter than this before that's true that dinosaurs lived humans were not here I mean it is warmer of that enclose all of human history for the planet is now warmer never has been when shuman's were around to walk on it which means to me it's an open question whether humans would have ever involved in the first place and this is all from the Industrial Revolution from then on and yeah I like that question is like there are people who say there's some natural woman going on I don't think that's true I think most scientist would say it isn't but I also think if what we're seeing is natural woman that should terrify us even more because it would mean that it's outside of our control and we're really heading down the path that we're heading down Emily yeah and yeah and like to that question is like there are people who say there's some natural woman going on I don't think that's true I think both scientist would say it isn't but I also think if what we're seeing is natural woman that should terrify us even more because it would mean that it's outside of our control and we're really heading down the path that we're heading down and we have no control over it that's even more scary it should be a comfort that we're doing it because I mean we can stop doing it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> just like in the summer time in Houston you know when you're dealing with 100% humidity and is 115 degrees out there I've you can't even explain to people with that feels like I'm eating cooked there's other places in the world that are going to be there going to literally cook you by 2050 so cities in India and the Middle East you won't be able to go outside during the summer without being a risk of dying by 2050 by 2050 like what kind of temperature combined with some bad humidity in Liberty broken at threshold like there been temperature record set every year but last year broke out in 30 in Oman I think but like the scary parts are not some of these crazy desert places that I've gotten really hot at the cities of Calcutta has like 12 million people in it and it may not be able to even be able to live there in the summer in just 30 years and then you think about what other people are going and how much that's going to destabilize everything you know I've talked to people who are terrified about this no talk to people who are nonchalant where where do you set are you terrified you thinking that you're going to be physically in trouble yourself or do you think that with proper planning and does not being tied to one spot you can move to another area I mean I have I have different feelings about it at different times a day cuz it's that big story it's like can it affect everything I think you know I think civilization is not going to collapse I think like they'll be people around even living like kind of rewarding prosperous lives forever and the question is like what shape does life take and where there where it where they are so me personally you know I'm like a relatively well-off person who lives in America in you know New York I think I'll be able to do okay I think my children will be able to do okay and when I imagine a future I think it's a reflection of all of our kind of like cognitive bias he's an emotional play Imagine like my daughter's future I'm imagining a world it seems a lot like the one that we live in today when I look at the science it paints a really really big picture so you know the question of like optimism and an alarm I think it's really all a matter of perspective right so we're 1.1 degrees Celsius right now I think we're basically no way that we avoid to degrees of warming which is like the UN calls catastrophic warming the island nations of the world call genocide and that's when we wouldn't be making me sit in the Middle East unlivable it would mean like semi sheets would start a permanent clap switch could all the melted eventually bring 260 feet of sea-level rise and we're on track for four degrees of warming so that would mean six hundred trillion dollars and climate damages by the end of the century that's twice as much wealth does exist in the world today it would either be parts of the world trying to say where you could be hit by six simultaneous climate disaster that once there be at least a few hundred climate refugees the UN says the low-end estimate is 200 million the high-end estimate is a billion which is many people live in North and South America combined simultaneous natural disaster that once yeah what does that mean like flooding Hurricane Fannin you know some public health issue like malaria it's like every every category Modern Life can be affected by this and like right now in Australia there was a crazy he weigh if it's like over a hundred twenty and lots of Australia they're also dealing with like epic floods in other parts of the country and that's kind of the problem actually would wildfires in California is not just that it's getting hotter is Subs also getting wetter some more rain means more growth means when it gets hot again that grows get baked and then becomes you know Firestarter and that's that you know it's not just it's not just a temperature it's like higher temperatures mean crazy or Extremes in all and you know if that's why I think sort of looking good picture there's not a life on Earth that's going to be Untouched by this Force I go to the decades ahead but that's not to say that will be destroyed by it either I think like we will find ways to live in adapt and mitigate it just a question of how much it's going to screw up our politics how much it's going to change the way we think of History you know they got money and I'm a 90s kid at end of History thinking the world was going to get better the troubles globalization was progress Etc what does it mean if I climate change completely eliminates the possibility of economic growth which probably won't be the case for the us but they're huge parts of the world with that is going to be the case if we don't change course now so like the end of the century if we don't change course The Economist studying to say you could be at least 20 possibly 30% smaller than 30%. How did you get involved in this before you got involved and have a good shift so I'm a journalist I'm an editor mostly actually in your magazine and you know I'm interested in your future like as a result read a lot of sides with papers read a lot of like obscure subreddits and I kind of thing and just in 2016 started seeing a lot more of that a lot more than news from science was about climate and a lot more that climate has was really scary and when I looked around at the other places that like we think of as our competitors in the newspapers TV shows I just felt like the scarier end of the spectrum was just not at all being talked about so most scientist talk about this 2-degree threshold is like the threshold of catastrophe and I didn't lay people think that means if that's kind of a ceiling for warming like without a blue worst that could get but actually it's functionally the best case scenario and we are we hadn't had any storytelling any discussion around what the world would look like north of 2 degrees and I just felt as a journalist I was like holy s*** there's a huge story here like the way that world could be completely transformed by these forces is not going to get anybody is writing about in Parker's it's a long story but scientist and science journalists were really they were really focused on making sure that they're messaging was hopeful and optimistic and they were reluctant to talk about the scariest findings and so I was terrified by the science I looked at it and I was like nobody talking about this is scary spread the word and in 2017 that was very worst case scenario so I met you before I think 2° about a best case scenario for Teresa's we're on track for now this piece was looking at 568 degrees of warming some things we're not likely to get this Century at least and it was a huge phenomenon it was read by a bunch of million people the biggest story than your next Endeavor public and I just thought man that gets there a lot of people like me out there who have intuitions about climate suffering and Terror but aren't seeing it in the white people writing about the story I decided you know there's more to say and even Beyond like telling the The Bleak storytelling that really dark talking about really dark possibilities I just thought they're all these categories of life that we haven't even thought about hello impact us so we we know about sea level rise but that's like I mentioned before that makes you think if you live off the coast you'll be okay but the whole planet is going to be harder than others Global Climate impacts the century but everyone going to be affected in some way and the way that changed our politics the way it changes are pop-culture the way it changes our psychology are mood our relationship the history how we think about the future everything but the past will we expect from capitalism but we play in capitalism for what we expect from technology what we think technology can do can technology save us can technology entertain us while the boat world is burning these are all these kind of like Humanities questions that I felt really wet really had not been talked about the book does like it's a tour through what the world would look like between 2 and 4 degrees but it's also which is a kind of hellscape but it is also you know how about half of it is about we're going to live here we're going to survive in what form where will it mean you know at the mythological level what will it be in at the personal level what will it be in the way we think about our kids and our futures and all that stuff and you know my my my big picture thinking about it is yes really Bleak and I think there are some possible ways that we could divert some of these worst-case scenarios I mean there is technology that can suck carbon out of the atmosphere are already it hasn't been tested at scale it's really expensive but if we really if we can over the you know the next decade or two really like build it like Global plantations of the carbon capture machines then not only can we like stop the problem from moving probably could actually reversible yo seen those before I've seen the designs for those were they had these enormous like the apartment building sized air filter things only in theory the entire the entire carbon footprint of the global economy we would have to change anything we could suck out all the extra carbon opening into the atmosphere for cost of 3 trillion dollars a year is a lot of money but their estimates for how much we're subsidizing the fossil fuel business better as high as five trillion dollars a year so we just redirected those subsidies to this technology in theory we could literally solve the problem immediately there are other complications it's like in order to store the carbon you need an industry that's two or three times our present oil and gas industry which is where that goes in next to who Tone and all that stuff complicated but we have the tools we need is just a matter of deciding to put them into practice and I were pretty like that you know recent history shows that we're not doing that fast enough so one of the big you no points that I'd like I'm making the book and it's six and a heads-up strongly as we think of climate change it started in the industrial revolution like centuries ago but half of all the carbon we put into the atmosphere in history of humanity from the burning fossil fuels to come in 30 years the last 30 years that since Al Gore published his first book on warming it seems the UN establish their climate change panel it's is the premiere of Seinfeld so that you and I have lived through the Lion's Share of all of the Damage Done to the climate in all of human history yeah so we brought the world from the basically a stable climate to the brink of total climate catastrophe in 30 years one generation we have about one generation to save it to me that's like it make me uncomfortable to use this language but it's basically a theological story we have the entire fate of the planet in the hands of these two generations what happens 50 years from now a hundred years from now will entirely be up to the way we Act and what we do and the time scale is so crazy because you have this really compressed we must act now to avoid these worst-case scenarios time scale but also the impact will unfold if we don't do anything over Millennia so like we could have you know if we really bring into being the total amount of all ice sheets that means that eight centuries from now 12 centuries from now people will be dealing with the s*** that were f****** up today we will be in hearing problems for them to be solving 800 1215 hundred years from now and that damage will be done if it is done in the next 30 or 50 years so we are I mean we are really writing this epic story about Earth humanity and our future honest planet in the time of a single lifetime a single generation and that is on the one hand is sort of like overwhelming but it's also empowering you know like all the climate impacts that talk about all the climate hard is that a really terrifying if we make it happen we will be making them happen in Maine and put in the system is how much carbon we put in the atmosphere there are feedback loops the people are worried about their things about climate that we can't control but at least at this point the main driver of future warming is what we do and so we could if we get to a four degree hellscape with hundreds of millions or billions climber Fiji feedback loops of people are worried about their things about climate we can't control but at least at this point the main driver of future warming is what we do and so we could if we get to a four degree hellscape with hundreds of millions or billions climber fiji's that'll be because of what we're doing it's not some system outside of our control even though we're often kind of we find a kind of comforting to think that it's outside of our control cuz that means we don't have to change it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I mean it's pretty bad already and it's going to get I think a lot lot worse so not bad right now right here it's raining too nice out to tell me how long ago were the fires right back you waited since October yeah it was rough but in all fairness I've been evacuated three times over the past 20 years the future of the Apocalypse but you know their scientific estimates to say that they're going to get by the end of the century 64 times worse what ya think I'm a little high cuz that would mean more than half of California burning every year but I mean it's going to get ya know yet it'll get crazy and there's no way to avoid any of this Wildfire stuff Runyon you know if we don't raise the temperature of the planet then but is that the only thing that's causing while if I mean like obviously if the temperature raises there's more dry weaves grass and stuff like that but there's a lot of preventive stuff you can do I mean not building a certain areas used to be you know the Indians who lived here before the white people can get a lot of controlled burning they like lived among fires and I think that's like a probably more responsible way to be but we've now built up the whole state so that they're all these homes that we don't want to burn their all these properties we want to burn and when you when you like restrict the ability of natural first burn that means that like more tender gets built over time and then you know at some point something like some action it all Burns so that I mean you could you could do more controlled fire you could take more aggressive action in terms of you know like spraying foam and that kind of thing firefighters but I was just talking about yesterday I'm actually doing some recording on wildfires in saying that no Santa Ana powered Wildfire has ever been stopped by firefighter he's like a environmental historian wow it's like you can hope that the winds redirect them but like the action of firefighters is basically just spitting in the wind so the action is not the stopped and said, contain it yeah it's best I can yeah and minimize property damage 711 time we were filming Fear Factor and we were way up on the five like probably I would say maybe 75 miles from here and for a full hour driving about 50 miles an hour there was fire on the right hand side of the road for a full hour I mean like Lord of the Rings end of the world again like you waiting for Satan riding on a burning Phoenix over the top of the hill it was crazy I've never seen anything like it in my life that was the worst one I've ever seen but I think that was just because of placement I think that this past one was actually worse in terms of physical damage and size is just I didn't see it the way I saw this one last year there were there were Flames like hopping over the 405 because in my bones I now know it's sort of not true but like my inner emotional perspective on the world is that I live in a fortress I don't live in nature where I got walked out on concrete streets I look up a steel buildings nature can't come for me when you see like fire straddling the 405 that's you know this is a major Metropolis here and we're not safe we're certainly not totally safe that's a major major revelation climate change of teaching us that you know you still live within climate and when it gets f***** up it will f*** you up it will affect you in some way you're there was the both sides before a five-run fire last year last year or the year before that one of those but it was insane it was it was hitting Bellaire and people like with this is this we never seen this before I talk to a firefighter once this is years ago and he told me with the right wind it's a matter of time for a fire hits the top of LA and burns all the way to the ocean he was knocking me anything we could do about it because if the right wind catches in a fire starts at the top of Los Angeles it'll just go straight through la like at this what is that from Jamie 405 fire but that's the crazy video on the left hand side until these are people driving down the 405 looking at you know the most is for a place that has 30 million people or whatever La has to see the entire Hillside on fire and Bellaire up to me Bellaire is really interesting cuz it's you know most climate impacts they hit the world's poorest for me and like the wildfires are they working the river it's cuz it's like people living in the Hills yeah there's the rich people but it just shows you like no matter how rich you are no matter how comforted by that wealth you are like you know you might get hit with the best example was Point Dume and we were flying over at my friend. Bill has a helicopter license and so we went around the peak of Doom it's crazy because you know these are like 20 million dollar States the massive Bluffside homes they thought they were living in the peak of luxury over viewing the ocean and like it to the ground like that's what it looks like now good people voice at all they'll protect the rich folks then protect these ones they can't protect anybody when it gets his crazy they did and I think they lost more than 600 homes in Malibu alone yeah I mean I mean yeah yeah I mean at least have the same way like nobody looking at La in 1850 would have said like yours a great place to build a city but we did it anyway like America and it's like Imperial Swaggart was like now we can create some Paradise out of this completely in hospitable and and both places and then you know it's just a lesson that like you know just a matter of time will the most cocky people of the people that have those houses on stilts on the water in Malibu like that forever I mean if you think about like the long long sweep of human history most human settlements didn't happen on the coast like people lived in maybe they lived on a river maybe you do have a little community on the river but you know the last like 50 years we were a hundred years we built up so especially America's so much more on the coast and that's like you know really inviting disaster I mean all of you and then like all of that is like that was floodplain that like nature was like you know swampland it was and now it's you know new Suburban developments made out of concrete and that just means more human settlements didn't happen on the coast like people lived in maybe they live on a river maybe you do have a little community on the river but you know the last like fifty years we were a hundred years we built up so especially America's so much more the coast and that's like you know really inviting disaster I mean all of you and then like all of that is like that was floodplain that like nature was like you know swampland it was and now it's you know new Suburban developments made out of concrete and that just means more flooding</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you have that I believe who is Jacob Wohl he's a conservative personality but he's very very controversial for like fake news or something I don't know too much about him so I don't accuse him of things they don't know who he is but he was he was in something we tried accusing molar of like sexual assaults and it turned out to be like just completely fake ridiculous had used tactics in the past to influence the election and he will continue to do so using all of his generals other people accounts together or email addresses and some cases IP addresses count together and having multiple accounts in and of itself is not on a violation of our rules can some people have their you know when you are deliberately pretending to be someone else about the Russians do for example in the 2016 election so it was that Playbook and that type of activity that we saw about Jacob Wohl and that's why his accounts were suspended did you investigate Jonathan Morgan wine that's that's the important question why I don't I don't know who that is it might be that someone at Twitter investigated him I personally don't know who that you should know who he is he's more important than Jacob wallets Direction Where We can see Jacob Wohl his sad he's done this so you like working at basket weave and him it was recently reported and covered by numerous Outlets that a group called new knowledge was meddling in the Alabama election by creating fake Russian accounts to manipulate National media into believing that Roy Moore's pop up by the Russians Facebook Bantam as well as for other people but Twitter didn't Jacob while we were able to directly attribute through email addresses and phone numbers his direct connection to the accounts that were created to manipulate the election if we're not able to tie that direct connection on our platform or law enforcement doesn't give us information to tie attribution we won't take action and it's not because of political ideology it's because we want to be damn sure before we take action on a kill someone could use a VPN account and they could game the system can do things to mask who they are and what accounts with their email or text from one morning and said we are going to permanently suspend this particular account and it's not a what do you think it's we are going to do this and I then have an opportunity at test questions I asked a question why she gave me a link back to the document findings in USA Today we took the action I was on Twitter a bunch of people pointed me at this particular case since some of those tweets to her what's going on so that's in the background wouldn't you just terminate anybody associated with the company that is doing this I mean to his campaign was happening do you want us to take every single newspaper accounts attribution because what we were able to do in the Jacob Wohl situation was actually titles accounts in our own systems that he would you control the grounds not just take the word of a newspaper article USA Today he says I'm doing this and you're like okay we can look at that we can see if we get rid of them with with new knowledge you said you did take those countdown I believe we were able to take down at a certain cluster of account that we saw engaging in the behavior but we won't weren't necessarily able to tie it back to one person controlling those to contact him and get some service statement from him in order to take down his account obviously admit to manipulating Twitter after what they claimed that was a false flag reviewed internal documents that showed they admitted it was a false flag operation the guy who runs the company said his company does this he wasn't aware necessarily but it was an experiment so he's giving kind of in my opinion duplicitous like you know not straightforward but at the time of this campaign which she claims to know about he tweeted that it was real so during the Roy Moore campaign he tweets wow look at the Russians then it comes out later his company the one that did it so you're kind of like I was that this guy was propping up his own fake news right then when they get busted he goes oh no it's just my company doing an experiment but you tweeted it wasn't real you use your verified Twitter account fake narrative your company was pumping on this platform until the point I want to make I guess is it sounds like we need to take a closer look at this but work at Twitter I pulling their mustaches laughing you know that person the band button whatever it is you're conservative I think it's just there's a bias that's unintentional that flows in One Direction so you see the news about Jacob Wohl and I can the reason for it to is a couple reasons for one yours your staff is likely more of you mention more likely to lean left and look at certain sources so you're going to hear about more things more often and take action on those things as opposed to the other side of the coin but we have to consider like where the actions are taking place broadly to the 4,000 people that we have is a company versus deliberateness that we have one digit Steam from this mean when we when we look at a company-wide average of all of your employees and the direction they lean versus the new sources they're willing to read you're going to see a flow in One Direction weather intentional or not and so I think the challenges antonella's like what's going on on the platform where the ones that have the metadata bank accounts were the ones I can see patterns of behavior upscale the other account which I got feedback on platform where the ones that have the metadata about accounts were the ones I can see patterns of behavior upscale yes we'd we did have it the same sort of findings in the other Pacific account which I got feedback on pasta her and and we didn't find what we need to find</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> nus law US law doesn't recognize restrictions on hate speech is considered free speech so if you want as requiring all the craziest thing in the world you're allowed to on your platform Twitter you're not allowed to so even in that sense alone your rules do have an ideology behind them I don't completely disagree I think but the reason I bring this up is getting a discussion about Democratic health of a Nation so I think it's can't be disputed this point that Twitter is extremely powerful and influencing election you know what I'm pretty sure you guys published recently a bunch of tweets from foreign actors that were trying to meddle in elections don't even use a company recognized that foreign entities are trying to manipulate people using this platform is a few things I want to be on this but would it be important than to just at a certain point Twitter become so powerful in influencing elections and giving access to even the president's tweets that you should allow people to use the platform based under the Norms of US law 1st Amendment free-speech rights platform this is becoming too much of it becoming too powerful and how are elections are are taking place so even if you are saying why hate speech is our one La people agree with it if at any point one person disagrees there still an American was right to this unit to access to the public discourse and you've essentially monopolize that and not completely but for the most part so isn't there some responsibility on you to guarantee at a certain extent less regulation happen right like love you foreign governments are manipulating all our elections then shouldn't you guarantee the right to an American to access his platform to be involved in the electoral process I'm not sure I see that the world so we're Global 75% of the users of Twitter outside of the United States we think about how do you have a global standard that can meet the threshold of as many countries as possible because we want all the people in the world to be able to participate in other countries Europe the same things that you're being accused of by American conservatives I think of the situations are very very different and I don't think that but the ideologies and play are the same at all tips of my concern I guess is I recognized your Globe your company that serves the world but as an American I have a concern that the Democracy I live in the Democratic Republic I'm sorry the Democratic functions are healthy one of the biggest threats is you know Russian in Russia Iran China they're trying to meddle in our elections using your platform and it's effective so much so that you've actually come out and removed many people you know Covington was apparently started by Foundation Brazil or the Covington scandal with his fake news goes viral was reported by CNN that it was a it was a dummy a they're going to prop it up and they were pushing out this out of context information so they do this they use your platform to do it you've now got a platform that is so powerful in our American discourse that foreign governments are using it as Weapons against us and you taking a stance against the laws of United States and I mean like against like a retinal I mean you have rules that go beyond the scope of the US which will restrict American citizens from being able to participate mean while foreign actors are free to do so so long as they play by your rules they're being threatened by the fact that if there's an American citizen who says I do not believe in your measuring policy and you ban them that person has been removed from public discourse on Twitter saying they don't agree with it violating it by targeting an individual individual repeatedly this course which has become so absurdly powerful foreign. Much weaponize it because you have different rules than the American country has to be clear my understanding and I'm not expert on all the platforms that foreign governments use multiple multiple different ways to interfere in elections is not limited to our platform nor is it limited to social media what the president and so only undeniable I do I'm just pointing out that there are number of different Avenues and individuals have choices and how they use the platform you have a private privately owned Publix if if I could use an alligator would be most apt and you've sent rules that are not recognized by the US in fact when it came to a supreme court hearing is that hate speech is not a violation it's actually protected free speech so there's an actual odds so there might be someone who says I refuse to live by any other means than what the Supreme Court has that down that means I have a right to hate speech you will ban them that means your platform is so powerful it's being used to manipulate elections and you have rules that are not recognized by the government to remove American citizens does a private platform you become too powerful to not be regulated if you refuse to allow people Free Speech but I'm trying to pick apart the connection I think so yes we we do have an issue with foreign entities and misinformation and in this is a extremely complicated issue which were just beginning to understand and grasp and and takacs I I don't think that issue is solved purely by not being more aggressive on something else that is taking people off the platform entirely as well which is abuse and harassment it's a cost-benefit analysis ultimately in our rules are designed again and you know they don't always manifests this way in the outcomes but in terms of what we're trying to drive is opportunity for every single person tube how to speak freely on the platform and that's absolutely not true you were going to light a lot of speech so free speech is not on your platform speaker disable everyone but a great opportunity for everyone to speak on our service some people encounter particular conduct that we see them once to remove themselves from the platform completely which goes against the principle of enabling everyone to speaker giving people the opportunity speaker XO rules are focused on the the opportunities presented and we have particular outcomes to make sure that those opportunities are a social pressing his speech right that's a fact of physical violence however when a default links hands and block the door so that no one can go to an event that is also legally allowed right so what you're saying is that if someone is engaging in Behavior such as going on Twitter and shouting someone down relentlessly that's something external what happens in the world under the US government I am allowed to scream very close to you and not let you speak in public but I'm Twitter you don't allow that so there's a dramatic difference between what Twitter thinks is okay and what the US government okay how are democracy functions and their functions the issue one pointing out is that we know Twitter is becoming extremely important and how are public discourse is occurring how are cultural culture is developing and who even get selected so if you have rules that are based on a global policy that means American citizens were biting by all of the laws of our country are being restricted from engaging in public discourse because you've monopolized it remove play Within those rules they can participate in a discourse even if they are just trying to manipulate our elections on the other hand if the people that are on the platform play by those rules they can also counteract unless their ideology goes in line with us law not legally allowed as opposed to what you allow so foreign governments can can absolutely keep making new accounts and keep bothering and keep manipulating they can even post things I'll go viral and I get banned and not care but a private American citizen can take years and I refuse to back down so we can see that at a certain point you have a Twitter is slowly gaining in my opinion too much control from your personal ideology based on what you've research what you think is right over American discourse if you have Twitter and it's got as my opinion on a lawmaker but I would have to assume if Twitter refuses to say in United States you are allowed to say what is legally acceptable. Then long only choice will be to enforce regulation on your company actually quite a bit of time talking to lawmakers as part of my role had a public policy and a lot of time in DC Jose the Jack and I have both spent a lot of time in DC and I think from the perspective of of lawmakers they across the Spectrum are also in favor of policing abuse and harassment online and bullying online those are things that people care about because they affect their children if they are communities in the affected individuals and so I don't think that in as a private American Business we can have different standards than what an American government-owned corporation American government would have to Institute those are two different things Americans and I understand your point about the influence and I'm not denying that certainly Twitter is an influential platform but like anything whether it's the American law or the rules of Twitter are there rules and those rules have to be followed so does your voice whether to follow those rules and to continue to participate in a Civic dialogue choice to not do that absolutely sure that we are largely influential and we're very important that you are friendly important and that's a compliment Twitter has become extremely powerful but at a certain point you should not have the right to control what people are allowed to say no private or Doug look I'm a social liberal I think we should regulate you guys because you are unelected officials running your system the way you see fit against the wishes of a Democratic Republic and they're people who disagree with you are being exercised from public discourse because of your ideology that terrifies me and we can take it one step further policies around abusing harassment on the platform I'm tryna understand what it is are saying cuz I'm not I'm not sure I'm following you you don't think we have any rules about abusing harassment so even that the threats that you received that you didn't have to but you mentioned the number of threats that you received in your quite frustrated that we hadn't taken action on you think we shouldn't have walls at you're just too ignorant to understand what the hell's going on around them and I see people burning signs that say free speech I see you openly saying we recognize the PowerBar platform and we are not going to abide by American Norms I see the manipulation of Twitter for in violation of our elections I see Democratic operatives in Alabama waging a false flag campaign using fake Russian accounts and the guy who runs that company has not been banned from the platform even after it's been written by the New York Times he was doing this so we know that only our people manipulating your platform you have rules that remove honest American citizens with bad opinions whoever right to engage in public discourse and it's like you recognize it but you like having the power on I'm not quite sure it was so you believe that I should not have any rules about abusing harassment or any sort of hate speech maybe too simplistic the point I'm trying to make is that you're asking us to comply with the US law that would criminalize potential speech and put people in jail for it and you're asking us to enforce those those two while I mean if you inside death you will get the crime you can go you can go to jail for that so at the very least you could move like when you when you're on your platform who commits a crime you don't man them I say why is really weird people on your platform was a bad naughty word</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you know Gavin was saying punch people will you punch people doesn't in their band them in their doesn't realize also Twitter is how old now 11 years old is old 13 years old it was was was last time where they found 5% of the Tweet of the penalty for the post on gambell hate speech no matter Twitter is like 2.4 so it's marginal increase at Gap is called the white supremacy network of course you go on it and yeah absolutely exists they say that synagogue shooter so why the media is is targeting it's it's such a crazy nightmare reality when the guardian the a criminal on YouTube and he's being arrested I thank God every day we have the first members in this country are the cover of a newspaper there was a job somewhere it's been reported by YouTube as is the Anti-Defamation League do you use them in your decision-making process rule development we're very aware of laws with certain of their research and we're very careful about who we take advice from what do they have looks like I hope not hate in the UK and now they're all going to point their you know figurative guns at me for saying this but the Southern Poverty Law Center article where they claimed I went to Aron for Holocaust in their conference and I've never been to around in their evidence was this guy found an archived website from a holocaust denier with my name on it and I was there proof and there are people who have been labeled the extremist by this organization that have been so again like not not to imply that you guys do either by ask civilly because it's been reported other organizations do so we have activist organizations we have journalists that I can attach start absolutely activist that worked for I work for vice I worked for Fusion I was told implicitly not explicitly to lie to side with the audience as it were I've seen the narrative they push and I've had conversations with people that I'm not going to I'm going to keep relatively off-the-record journalists who are terrified because they said the narrative right-wing journalist in particular said that he had yet evidence of you know essentially he had reason to believe there was wrongdoing but he talks about it he could lose his job and they're there was a journalist to report to me that Dan Society admitted they were poured was was was was was incorrect and now you got organizations lobbying for terminating Joanne died because of the stuff so this this narrative persists then you see all the actions I mentioned it before and all the organization saying we're doing the right thing and I got to say like we're living I feel like we're looking at the doorway to the nightmare dystopia I'll do I just want to clarify I don't I don't know if we're going around saying we're doing the right thing we're saying why we're doing what we're doing that's what we need behind what we believe is like the right thing we have to clearly rationalize why we're making the decision were making and more of that that's that to me is a prevention from snowflake Avalanche 124 but I think it's just obvious to point out again like this before we can have the conversation and I can understand you before I'm from where I'm sitting you hold a vastly different ideology that I do and you have substantially more power and controlling my government that terrifies me and what makes it worse is that a Saudi Prince owns was reported portion of that company so I'm sitting here like just a little American can't do anything to stop it I just watching this unaccountable machine turn away you're just one snowflake in an avalanche all these other companies are as well and I'm like well here we go going to be right there I just said that Saudi Prince have any influence yeah that works I think ultimately yeah I get what you're doing I think it's wrong I think it's terrifying and I think we're looking we're we're we're on the Atlanta already has happened and where we're heading down to this nightmare scenario the future where it terrifies me when I see people who claim to be supporting liberal ideology burning signs that say Free Speech threatening violence against other people you have these journalists to do the same thing they accuse everybody of being a Nazi everybody of being a fascist Joe Rogan I know you like Ubi proponents you know some very liberal and except for 2nd Amendment that's probably the only thing that I disagree with a lot of liberals when you see what the media says about everybody you see how they called Jordan Peterson all day and night all right. Write it to remove them from public discourse saying that sunlight is the best disinfectant and upon examination you realize that this is not true at all and that these people look foolish like the Dayton Society article</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> goodbye these approaches by being proactive and by taking a stand perhaps offering Up a Road to Redemption to these people and making clear distinction between what year what you're allowing what you're not allowing you can hold off regulation or do you disagree with what he saying about regular I don't believe that should be our goal is to hold off if we should be we should purchase paid like any other citizen whether it be corporate citizen or individual citizen in helping to guide the right regulation I could be wrong on this because it's been like 15 years since I've done this way from lady with the clean water restoration act at all I don't expect anything so it was at some point in like the early 70s there was a river in Ohio and again I could be wrong than 15 years I've taken on fire and what was typically told us was that all of these different companies that we're doing the right thing but this like as I mentioned snowflake doesn't blame itself no overtime the river was so polluted it became sludge in Lent fire if all these companies think they're doing the right thing and they've all just contributed to this nightmare we need to tell them blanket regulation and so what I see with these companies like banking institutions public discourse platforms beer distribution actually I'm really worried about what regulation will look like because I think the government is going to screw everything up but I think there's going to be a recoil of first I think the Republicans cuz I watch the testimony Congress and I thought they had no idea what they're talking about hair it was like a couple people to make good points with the most part they were like I went over and asked about Russian stuff they have no idea what's going on but there'll come a time when you know friends with one of the one of the great things I brought was that by default when someone in DC signs up they see way more Democrats than Republicans right remember that when you so well that there's an issue and I don't think I believe you that these are like how do you regulate grammar to print algorithm to solve that problem is is is greater your regulating someone to invent technology but I feel like there will be a backlash when too many right now we're saying there isn't one of us around this conversation is that conservatives feel like they're being persecuted and repressed so then it's going to act like I'm going to stop so there's two fields of research within artificial intelligence of Revenue but I think really impactful for industry one is fairness and mo so Earnest and what might learning and deep-learning so looking at everything from what data set is fed to Ann Arbor them so like the training data set all the way to how the algorithm actually behaves on that on that data set making sure that it does not develop bias over the longevity of the algorithms use case so that's one area that we want to lead in and we've been working with some of the leading researchers in the industry to do that because the reality is a lot of this human judgment is moving out rooms and the second issue with it moving our rhythms is our lives today can't necessarily explain the decision-making criteria that they use so they can explain in the way that you make a decision you explain why I really nice today or not being programmed in such way that they can't even explain that you may wear an Apple Watch run since it might tell you to stand every now and then right now those out rhythms can't explain why why they're doing it right. That's a bad example cuz he does it every every 15 minutes but as we offload more and more of these decisions both internally and also individually two watches and and into cars and one not there is no does nobility right now that I read them to actually go through and list out the criteria used to make that decision so this is another area that we'd like to get really good at if we want to continue to be transparent around our actions because a lot of these things are just black boxes and they're being built in that way because there's been no Research into like how do we get these our rooms to explain what their decision is that my husband is Sedonas we know that Democratic operatives in Alabama did this and so I imagine that you know what Donald Trump you know he talked about executive order for free on college campuses so that the chattering is hear someone's going to take a sledgehammer to Twitter to Facebook to YouTube and just be like not understanding the technology behind it not willing to give you the benefit of the benefit of the doubt and just saying I don't care why you're doing it we are mad have some bills and then that's over are biased and I think what you're doing is dangerous but I think that is a matter doesn't matter what you think is right it matters at all of these companies are doing similar things and it's and it's and it's already terrifying people I mean luck when when I saw somebody got banned from their bank account that's terrifying and PayPal has done this for a long time you know that seems like more egregious than getting banned from any social justice or social media platform. That seems to be worthy of boycott man I believe his name is Robert Spencer and they said MasterCard instructed us to ban him and you know what you don't say this to me mentioning Chase Paypal Mastercard terrifies me I'm on The Joe Rogan podcast right now calling out these big companies in defiance and we've already seemed like to know all the specifics of why they chose to do that and I would hope that they would really some sort of a statement explaining why they chose to do that maybe there's something we don't know there was a there was a reporter with big league politics who said that after reporting on PayPal negatively they banned him that's terrifying so it looks reporting on it and what way like we're going to Sargon of akkad issue no apparently as a journalist who wrote about something by PayPal did Big League politics is conservative and so all the sudden he got a notification that they can't tell him why but he's gone so I see these big Tech monopolies I see YouTube Facebook Twitter and they're doing it and they all say they're doing the right thing but all of these little things they're doing are adding up to something nightmarish and some somebody going to show up and in a matter of time issue no apparently is a journalist who wrote about something by PayPal did Big League politics is conservative and so all the sudden he got a notification that they can't tell him why but he's gone so I see these big Tech monopolies I see YouTube Facebook Twitter I see Paypal Mastercard and they're doing it and they all say they're doing the right thing but all of these little things they're doing are adding up to something nightmarish and some some right legislators going to show up and in a matter of time with a sledgehammer and just he's at whack your algorithm</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> shift the public perception of having this left-wing bias maybe possibly addressing it mom has a Democrat and I feel extremely fortunate that I was able to first see that Spectrum but also feel safe enough to express my own point of view but when I go on someone like candy I'm not talking to Hannity I'm talking to people like my dad to listen to him and I want to get across how we think and and also that are thinking of olives and here's the challenges were seeing in like this is our intent this is what we're trying to protect and we're going to make some mistakes along the way and we're going you admit to him with them in the past week and then to a lot more over and over the past three years but you know I don't know any other way to address some of these issues it all it all goes back to trust like our operating principles earn more trust and people in the world at all in there are some people who trust us a little bit more but this is the thing that we want to measure the the thing that we want to get better at Mission within Katie hertzog no know who was it has the wrong person you idiot a Twitter conversation with her in the opposite direction they want more we want more we want more you know restrictions us right so I mean in terms of solving the problem Amor of controlling it wasn't just more but to be a lot more specific about what actions we've taken to promote more Health on the platform like what products did we change what policies did we introduced in the past two years so she's asking questions every question she asked she wanted me to be a lot more specific and some of these things have something that is very specific sum or directional right now because like we we have to prioritize you know what the Direction and I talked about like you know we've decided that physical safety is going to be a party for us and to us that means like being a whole lot more proactive around things like doxxing so I guess you have unlimited funding but we did mention the pier if we go right right safety in an area that's not so that at least you have but you can have some pushback in his what is learn-to-code me and then they can tell you absolutely that's crazy back and just so you know that the trust and safety team is also Global team team so it's not like people from California we're looking at everything making decisions that are Global now I hear your point about who trains them in the materials they have and all that and like we have to think about that and that's that's one thing that Jack has really been pushing us to think about is how do we decentralized our Workforce because he's very focused on what about publishing evidence of wrongdoing in a Banning so when people say you know what did Alex Jones really do maybe like people didn't realize what you what you saw and again it's an issue of trust were thinking of doing something called we call case essentially like this is our case law this is what we use and so high-profile cases make a lot of people just don't understand and they don't believe us when we're saying these things should have put that out there so people can see it again they may disagree with the calls that were making but we at least want them to see why we're making these calls I think and that that I do want to do I want to at least start that by the end of this year so I think you know ultimately my main criticism stands and I don't see a solution to in that Twitter is an unelected you know unaccountable as far as I'm concerned when it comes to public discourse you have rules that are very clearly at all we discussed I don't see a solution to that and I think in my opinion we can have this kind of like we tone things down we had some interesting conversations but ultimately unless you're willing to allow people to get speak speak entirely freely you are and we have an unelected group with a near-monopoly on public discourse in many capacities and I understand it's not everything right it is Big too and it's you know what I see is you are going to dictate policy whether you realize it or not and that's going to terrify people and it's going to make violence happen is going to make things worse you know I I I I I hate you bring up this example on the on the rule for misgendering because I'm actually I can't understand it and I can agree with it to a certain extent you know nothing works back to the trans Community but also recognize we've seen an escalation in Street violence we see a continually a disenfranchised large batch of individuals country with NC only one of those factions band with NC massive multinational billion-dollar Corporation with private about foreign investors and it looks to me like if you hold if you know foreign governments try to manipulate us there I don't see a solution to that problem that you do have political views you do enforce them and that means that Americans were buying by American Drew living exercise from political discourse and that's the future that's it appears on the approach we ground assassin rating as much opportunity as possible for the largest number of people what kind of bass are a rose Investments not and I I get that that's an ideology I completely understand it but we we also have to we also have to be free to experiment with Solutions and experiment with evolving policy and putting something out there that might look right at the time and evolving I'm not saying this is it but like we we look to research we look you are experiencing. On the platform and we make a call and if we get it wrong we're we're going to admit it and we're going to evolving you understand my point I understand that you have to see that as a win receiver what is your priority do you have it prioritized in terms of what you got what you guys would like to change that a couple times but the first thing we're going to do is prioritize people physical safety cuz that's got to be understanding you already have done that pretty much right so you guys experience is it censorship is a Banning like what is it would have been totally right most it depends on heater fourth on Twitter have done nothing to stop rapping towards me or anyone else right back I swear to cut my Twitter I mean my Reddit is probably you know 50 messages from various you know the far left and left-wing subreddits lying about me calling me horrible names including me and this before blocked right and I never used to block people because I thought it was silly cuz I can get a ride anyway but I decided to at one point because out of sight out of mind if they see my tweets last I'll probably interact with me last but they do this and they lie about what I believe they lie about what I stand for and they're trying to destroy everything about me other people I recognized that so ultimately I say what can you do it's going to happen on one of these platforms the internet is a thing as they say on the internet welcome to the Internet so you know what you mean I see Twitter trying to enforce all these rules to maximize good and all you end up doing is stripping people from the platform putting them in dark corners of the web where they get worse and then you don't have a problem it's going to happen on one of these platforms the internet is a thing as they say on the internet welcome to the Internet so you know what to me I see Twitter trying to enforce all these rules to to maximize good and all you end up doing is stripping people from the platform putting them in dark corners of the web where they get worse and then you don't have a problem</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> enforcement ever asked you to keep certain people on the platform even after they violate your rules us you have the issue of antifa versus The Proud boys and Patriot prayer and anyone associated with proud boys antifa counts as we have broken the rules repeatedly branded known cells that have been involved in violence also active is there a reason the proud boys what we were able to do was actually look at documentation and announcements that the leaders of that organization is made and they're due to violence in the real world that was we're focused on and subsequent to our decision I believe the FBI also designated that's not fair just told me about it happened on his show because there was a guy that was on the show and they made a joke about starting a gang based on him cuz he was very effeminate guy they're calling the proud boys and they went into detail about how this thing became from a joke and saying that you could join the proud boys and everything you know is like being silly to people joining it and then it'd be coming this thing to fight antifa and then becoming infested with white nationalist and becoming in the end in many ways of how it was but it's been documented how it started and what it was and misrepresented as to what why was started I think there is something that you be clarified about them but Gavin has made a bunch of statements that crossed the line I have to start taking people's asses Rams like this is not just irresponsible with foolish and short-sighted and just a dumb way to talk so that you have the antifa groups that are engaging in the same thing we do know that the famous bike lock Basher incident where a guy showed up hit 77 people over the bike lock they took his name I'm going to leave that for the time being you have other groups like by emi's by any means necessary that you have in Portland for instance there specific brand infections there is between I mentioned earlier where they Doc's ice agents and they said do whatever inspires you his information and I mean you're tagged in the million times I know you probably can't see it but you can actually see that some of the Tweets in the thread are removed but the main tweet itself from an anti-fascist account linking to a website straight up saying like here's the private home details phone number addresses of his law enforcement officers not removed in September so he would you end up seeing is FBI designated by poison extremist group but it was a misinterpretation based sheer afro to draft saying with no the FBI considers them to be extremists the media then reported hearsay from the sheriff that be I cannot do know we never meant to do that that's not true we are just concerned about violence so the problem is I'll get purged and again I think you know the different story right if you want to go out to the individuals who are socially with that group versus the guy who was on the show and says outrageous things and goes and Joe show is there a specific names that they sell merchandise and they're the ones showing up throwing mortar shells into crowds they're the ones showing up with with crowbars and and bath and whacking people I was in Boston and there's a rally where conservatives are planning on putting on a router is literally just like Libertarians and conservatives and he shows up with crowbars bats and balaclavas with weapons threatening them and I have to wonder if you know a lot of organizing your platform are you concerned about that why are they being banned if I like the rules yeah I've lawyer concerned about that I had the FBI doesn't need them as a domestic terrorist is a loose term that means you oppose fascism but antifa is now they have a flag that had a flag since the Soviet you know it's so hot to your eminence I'll be there around they brought back there specific groups that I'm not going to mention by name that have specific names and they sell merchandise desire to use violence to suppress speech is a centralized organization the same way that I hear you on proud boys but like where they have like tenants that are written out and there's a leader in like but there are specific brand of cells but there are groups that that organized specifically call for violence they they they push the line as close as likely as possible The Advocates sabotage and things like this and you know when the proud boys going into fights and I can't even find themselves you know so they decided to call for violence based on antifa calling for violence actually actively committing violence against conservative people they were there to see different people at 8. Partly started because in Berkeley there was a trump rally so actually after Milo got chased out of the Berkeley they were there is a video of some guy in all black liking someone on the back was on the ground looking with her unconscious so he's conservative see this and they decide to hold a Rally's and we won't back down they hold a rally in Berkeley and then antifa shows up again I understand you can't figure out who these people are for the most part of the decentralized but then this insights an escalation you then get the rise of the base to Stickman they call this guy shows up in armor with a stick swinging back and now you have two factions forming so while I recognize it's much easier to ban a top-down group there are you know what is the difference of a guy guesses while you look at the proud boys it's straight talk down vertical you look at antiphon there's different cells of varying sizes and their different accounts so I don't have to to like I got the arguing I can make is it going to be in the proud Boys by all means under your justification but if you look at a specific Channel that's got 20,000 followers that cheers them on right is our people throw mortar shells of the crowds isn't advocating for you no heroism incitement to violence how come they don't get removed in the past when we've looked at Auntie for a week we ran into this decentralisation issue which is we weren't able to find the same type of information that we were able to find about probably which is a centralized leadership based documentation of what they stand for but absolutely a minute something I will continue to look into until they sent their using Twitter to organize and completely would absolutely take action thing that he did or was it his association with the proud boys and abandon that he's not only that he's disassociated himself with it and said that it completely got out of hand he doesn't have anything to do with it dressed up like a Michael Douglas in falling down you know he did it on purpose brother briefcase and everything I'm like what you doing so he's he's showman in many ways and he did not mean for this to the go the way it went he thought it would be this sort of innocent fun thing to be a part of and then other people got involved it in and then when people call for violence the problem is they think that it that you know you're going to just hit p how to solve a problem it just creates a much more much more comprehensive problem has had met you like you said think we were thinking than Alex Jones ever did but whether whether you want to say it's a joke or not he said things like you know choke on Punch-Out like directly and I would have to go back and I don't want to miss a thing is I don't recall whether those statements that you're referring to of Gavin's were on Twitter so they weren't you know when it comes to the weaponization of rules against like Gavin isn't creating a compilation of things he's ever said out of context and then sending around himself and other people are doing that to him activists who don't like him that's effective in fact I would actually like to point out there's one particular user who has repeatedly made fake videos attacking one of your other high-profile conservatives police reports harassment complaint that just doesn't stop you know so I'll ask this to this regard if someone repeatedly makes videos of you out of context fake audio accusing you of doing things you never done at what point does that bannable it's still the person saying that and you're making a compilation of some pre-existing with all your video so I think in this instance of Gavin like one of the things he said was like a call to violence but he was talking about it was in the context of talking about a dog and being scolded so he was like it's like it turns out like a snip it and then it goes viral</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you could probably get some important light onto outside of Twitter this weaponization of content from platforms is being used to get people banned from their banking accounts you know they're get there we can talk about patreon princess and again I'm not this is something you could try it on patreon band name call Benjamin also known as Sargon of akkad he's also banned from Twitter and it was I do have some some of the details here do you want me to read them but I will say it was that I don't have the dates I'm sorry but he's a white guy I mean obviously he's joking around their neck white people and also sounds regions violation of the rules whether whether or not he was trying to insult some people that's a very good point and I wanted to bring that up is born violation the rules horn generally no good really good for you how to use it to a person you traitor remainer white genocide supporting is llama file to Whistler lover that should keep you going #Hitler was right he's a white guy that doesn't sound like a racial slur at all I mean he's saying f*** white people and he is white and contacts I always knew that person was not to be trusted that f****** Jewish lark undertale I'm not trying to like read but hate all this I'm just telling you what they were so you can I knew he had done things that were like a breeze by Legends of the rules cuz you know I can bring him up to go through in trying to figure out if he'd but that does sound like at least the first one was meant to be things are three things is like a bunch of them kicked off of Twitter he's on YouTube from going to mind his p's and q's the reason I brought him up again found so far away from them but they pulled us a clip from an hour and a half or whatever into a to our lives going to small channel that only have 2,000 views send to patreon and then patreon said violation and banned him outright without warning different from what you guys do just as much as first but was talk about a few things by blocking isn't enough why muting isn't enough and if you think that it's driving people off the platform people post my tweets on Reddit I block them they use a dummy account load up my tweet posts Reddit and then spammy on Reddit so you know blocking and even leaving Twitter would never do anything short of me shutting up there's nothing you can do to protect me or anyone else having won the reason why I don't think blocking and reading are enough is one I don't think we've made me powerful enough, it's spread all over the service you can use it and then you got to go find where you actually music people remove a profile page and that's just it's not a it's a disaster it just doesn't work in the same way that it should work in the same way that follow works before I would just see a weird reply and be like oh it's one of those exactly know so there's also all this infrastructure that we have to fix in order to like past those through in terms of what action you took her what action someone else took to be transparent about look what's happening on the network headed the second the second thing is block is really interesting and I think it's my own view is a totally unsatisfying because what you're doing is you're blocking someone they get notification that you've blocked them which may emboldened them even more which causes others around and ramifications from from the network but also that person can logout of Twitter and then look at your tweets just on the prank wet because we're Republic so it doesn't feel as adorable something like making mute much stronger if you're engaging in public discourse you know if I go out in the street and yell out my opinion somebody could get my face if I get off Twitter cuz I'm sick and I mean you know I'm sure you get away more than I do especially as you know the high-profile probably give me the right now it seems like even if you try everything in your power to make Twitter healthier and better it's not going to change anything about that I'm not sure about that because I do think is that just I'm not in favor of a lot of this heavy-handed Banning and a lot of things have been going on particularly like a case like the Megan Murphy case but but I think that we are doing is we're we're exploring the idea of civil discourse where we're trying to figure out what acceptable and what's not acceptable and you're communicating about this on a very large scale and it's putting that out there and then people are discussing it whether they agree or disagree with a vehement Lee defend you or I hate you they're discussing this this is I think this is how these things changed and they change over long periods of time think about words that were commonplace just a few years ago that you literally can't say anymore right now so bad long periods of time think about words that were commonplace just a few years ago that you literally can't say anymore right now and there's so many of them that were extremely, play some not even thought to be offensive 10 years ago that now you can get band off a platypus for but that's a good point to argue against Banning people and to cease enforcing rules</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> why are people being suspended for tweeting #learn-to-code we did some research on those journalists were receiving a variety of tweets some containing learn-to-code some containing a bunch of other coded language that was witches a farm is worth thousands and tweets being directed at a handful of journalists and we did some research and what we found was a number of the accounts that were engaging in this Behavior which is tweeting at the journalist with this either learn to code or things like day of the rope and other coded language were actually ban evasion accounts that means Accounts at inferring previously suspended and we also learned that there was a targeted campaign being organized off our platform to abusing her ass these journalists that's not true ICC here's a thing an activist who works for NBC wrote that story and then Lobby do you issue an official statement and then even the editor-in-chief of the Daily Caller got a suspension for tweeting learn-to-code of the day at The Daily Show I have never talked to anybody from NBC about this issue so I know so they were poured it don't misrepresent I'm deathreats wishes of harm other coded language that we've seen to mean death to journalists so it wasn't about just the learn-to-code it was about the contacts that we were swinging is a Farm song just learn to code in a particular contacts we made a decision we consider this this type of behavior but dogpiling which is when all is an individual's are getting tons and tons of tweets at them they feel very abused and harassed on the top for truck drivers and things like that could learn to code this was it was almost like in jest or if it wasn't ingest initially was so poorly thought-out as a suggestion that people started mocking it right correct so doesn't affect the first stories that came out we're simply like can minors learn to code it was running and the hashtag learn-to-code is just a meme it's not even necessarily conservative one that you will see more conservatives using it was using it to mock how stupid the idea of taking a person is uneducated as in their 50s who should learn some new form of vocation and then someone says learn to code and so then other people when they're losing their job when something's happening people would write learn-to-code because it's a mean won't necessarily I would I would characterize learn-to-code as a meme that represents the elitism of modern journalists and how they target certain communities with disdain who have been suspended for something like I'm not too happy with how you know BuzzFeed reported the story #learn-to-code right making representation of these people are snooty Elites who live in hours but but but again you know what this is a meme that has nothing to do with harassment but you know it's some people might be harassing somebody in my tweet it why would we expect to see even still today I'm still getting messages from people screenshot saying I've been suspended for using a hashtag and the editor-in-chief of the Daily Caller right heat heat heat heat he took he quote tweeted a video from The Daily Show with #learn-to-code and he got a suspension for it so why why why learn-to-code why is that alone so egregious it's just something I got stuck in an algorithm know it was again a specific set of issues that we were seeing targeting a very specific set of journalist and it wasn't just the learn-to-code it was a couple of things going on a lot of the accounts reading learn to come and wear ban aviators which means they're curiously been suspended a lot of the accounts had other language in them are up to that other language like Dave the brick day of the Rope oven-ready these are all coated meanings for violence against people and so people who are receiving that's for receiving hundreds of these and what appeared to us to be a coordinated harassment campaign and so we were trying to understand the context of what was going on and take action on then is again I don't know Joe if you've ever been the target of a dog piling event on Twitter but it is not particularly fun when thousands of people or hundreds of people are tweeting at you and saying things and that's can be viewed as a form of harassment it's not about the individual tweet it is about the volume of things that are being directed and so in that particular case we made the judgement call and it is a judgment call to take down the tweets that were responding directly to these journalists that were saying learn-to-code even if they didn't have a wish of harm specifically attached them because of what we've you to coordinated attempt to harass them and again like I was saying some of the other signals and coded language and we were worried that learn-to-code was taking on meaning understand that particular context so but in and of itself though it still seems like there's alternative meanings to learn to code it still could be used as Tim was saying to Makkah live you know Elite snooty you're throwing a blanket over a very small issue learn to code in itself is very small the blanket is cast Over racism because the blanket is cast over this all all the other horrible things that are attached to it but the horrible things that are attached to what the real issue just learn to code thing is kind of a legitimate protest in people saying that these minor should learn to code that's kind of preposterous the first articles warrant mean removed from Middle America that they think you can take a 50 year old man who's never use the computer before and put them in a legitimate as it was a mean that #the idea of learn-to-code condenses this idea and it's easy to communicate especially with 22 characters that there is a class of individuals country I think you mentioned on the Sam Harris at the left vs liberal journalist only follow each other so I mean I I still believe that to be sure I work in his office has it has changed. They're going to start again the visualization and and now there is a lot more cross-pollination but we do what we saw his folks who are putting into left and respect him mainly followed folks on the left and folks on right called everyone you have a left-wing activist who works for NBC News I'm not accusing you of having read the article he right he's he spends like a day lobbying Twitter thank God you have to do this yet to make these changes the next day he writes a story saying that 4chan is organizing these these these harassment campaigns and death threats and well 4chan was doing threads about it you can't accuse work until we were talking about the right it was talking about it too as what's Twitter so then the next day he has his article now he's getting threats and then Twitter saying we will take action and to make matters worse when John Levine a writer for the rap got a statement from one of your spokespeople saying yes we are Banning people for saying learn-to-code a bunch of journalists came out and then lied no idea why is fake news then becomes their only legitimate high-profile individuals there for sure probably mistaken there I don't think that any of us are claiming that we got this hundred percent right and probably are too and having a lot of contacts into actually what's happening as well and we would believe it we probably were way too aggressive when we first saw this as well Matic points of view right so this is intersectional feminism is considered like a small ideology it people refer to these groups as the regressive left organic tatarian left is it basically people who hold views that a person is judged based on the color of their skin instead of the content of their character so you have the right wing version which is like you all right electric version which is like intersectional feminism is referred to so you'll see people say things like you know when it went typically when they were white men wear when they say like white feminism desert desert signals that they hold these particular views and is really becoming more pervasive so journalist who clearly hold of these views, journalists he writes extremely biased and out of context story Twitter takes action in response a seemingly response then we can look what happens with Oliver Darcy at CNN he says you know if you don't see if a car has are gullible eating red meat from grifters among other things about the right and he's the one who's primarily advocating for the removal of sir visuals who you been removed and then when Kathy Griffin calls for dachshund that's fine when this guy calls for the death of these kids he gets it gets a slap on the wrist and I love I understand the context matters what grains of sand make a heat and eventually have all of these stories piling up and people are asking me why only Flows In One Direction for the offense without a warning just get rid of them but it didn't happen right we sleep we see these you know people say men or women though and they get a suspension right we see we see these you know people say men and women though and they get attention we see people say the editor-in-chief of the Daily Caller may be the best example #learn-to-code quoting The Daily Show when you get the suspension threatening death and inciting death is suspension to it if it feels like it's only going in one direction looking into those particular situation</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> your platform restrict speech AR platform promote speech unless people violate our rules and in a specific Direction in any direction but Uncle the guy who calls for the guy who insinuates that fits a permanent ban 2015 and found 21 of them were only on one side of the cultural debate when I'm looking at their sweet if someone is biologically male and you called you know about conservative view the progressive view is inverted so now you actually have in your policies a a rule against the conservative perspective against the abuse and harassment of trans people on our platform that's what up my world a bunch of people all around the world to give his contacts in the types of behavior they're seeing how that translates into real-world harm and they give us feedback and they tell us like you should consider different types of rules different types of perspectives different like for example when we try to enforce hateful conduct in a hateful conduct policy in a particular country we're not going to know all the swear words that are used to Target people of a particular particular religion so we're going to rely on a building out all around the world we're going to help us enforce our rules misgender and just trying to pull up some of the studies that we looked at but we looked at the American Association of Pediatrics and looked at the number of transgender youth that were committing suicide and astronomical I'm sorry I can't find it right now in front of you it's a really really high statistic that's like 10 times with a normal suicide rate is normal teenagers and we looked at the causes of what that was happening in a lot of it was not just violence towards close but it was bullying behavior and what was what were those bullying behaviors that were contributing to that and that's why we made this will because we thought and we believe that those types of behaviors were happening on our platform and we wanted to stop it and there are exceptions to this rule we don't end this is all at this isn't about like public figures are you doing something with the intention of abusing and harassing form and are they viewing it that way and Reporting it to us so that we take action so I will just ate I actually agree with the rule on from degree that bullying and harassment entirely wrong with it but I just want to make sure it's clear to everybody was listening my point is simply that you know Ben Shapiro went on a talk show and absolutely refused and that's his shouldn't you know and he's one of the biggest podcasts and in the world so if you have all of his millions upon millions of followers who I look rule saying this goes against my view of the world and yours is literally 60 + million in this country you do have a rule as ideologically bent and it's it true you you did the research you believe this well then you have Ben Shapiro who did his research and doesn't believe it was just explaining the why behind a lot of our propulsion reasons I would agree and I think it's fine you did research and you found this to be true but we can't simply say maybe Ben Shapiro and the other conservatives feel this way don't know we have to we can't you know whether you believe it but whether you Justified or not is not the point the point is you do you do have this rule that rule is at odds with conservatives. Hawaii is to protect people from abuse and harassment on are popular essentially created protected class if this is the case because despite these studies and what the other studies are showing there's a gigantic suicide rate amongst trans people. It's a 40% it's it's outrageously large now whether that is because of gender dysphoria with us because of the complications from sexual surgery sexual transitions her Merryweather is because of bullying whether it's because of this awful feeling of being born in the wrong gender with it. All that is yet to be determined the fact that they've shown that there's a large amount of trans people that are committing suicide I don't necessarily think that that makes that makes sense in terms of people from someone's perspective like a Ben Shapiro saying that if you are biologically female if you are born with a double X chromosome you will never be XY if he says that if that's that's a violation of your policy and this is your creating a protected class contribute to be targeted Martina Navratilova is it to Lova Lova world-class Legend tennis player is being harassed because she says that she doesn't believe that trans women need someone who is biologically male who transitioned to a female should be able to compete in sports against biological female is this something that I agree this is something I have personally experienced a tremendous amount of harassment because I stood up when there was a woman who is a trans woman was fighting biological females in mixed martial arts fights and destroying these women and I was saying with you to just watch this and tell me this doesn't look crazy to you. My point is you should be able to express yourself and if you say that you believe someone is biologically male do they identify as a female that's a perspective that should be valid you know this is someone's someone's this is a first of all it's biologically correct so we we have a problem in that if your standards and your policies are not biologically accurate then you dealing with an ideological you know an ideological policy and it just because I mean I don't I don't want to Target trans people I don't want to harass him I don't call anybody whatever they want me if you want to change your name to a woman's name and identify the woman I'm 100% cool with that but by saying I don't think that you should be able to compete as a woman this opens me up for harassment and I never ordered any of it I just don't pay attention to it right you can call it harassment if if she's in an argument with a trans person over whether or not they should be allowed in sports or in biologically female spaces and she refuses to use their pronouns because of her ideology you'll ban them and it's also not banned permanently like you get warm she was about what happened what I did for the others but my understanding is that she was warned multiple times for misgendering an individual that she was in an argument with in this individual is actually bringing a lawsuit against her in Canada as well so it is one of those people what we perceive to be instances of abuse and harassment purchasing a man is never a woman if that's what she saying and then biologically she's correct we obviously have a debate here but this is not a clear-cut this is not something like you need say water is wet you know this is dry it's this is not like something you could prove this is something where you have to acknowledge that there is an understanding that if someone is a trans person we all agree to consider them a woman and to think of them as wanted to talk to them and redress them with their preferred name and your preferred pronouns but biologically this is not accurate so we have it we have a divided here we have a divided between the conservative estimation of what's happening and then the definition that's the liberal definition of it no spaces to make decisions for women and then this person's arguing and she says a woman is biologically female you are never going to be a woman she responded with men aren't women though and that was her first it in the series of events that's what part of the suspension in the warning that was one of many tweets that record of providing context and actually strike is my understanding but 10 or 12 weeks going back and forth and my understanding is that in the context of all of those she was Miss Jen during a particular person not that she was holding a Believer say to her her ideology of and you have opted to ban one of those ideologies in the context of this conversation is being debated whether or not someone is in fact a woman when they were male I understand that this is controversial I do understand why why people would not agree with the rule but that being said it is a rule on our platform and once you're warned about the rule to repeatedly post the same content is also going to be a violation of our rule the rule it's this seems like a good example of an ideologically based rule if if yours if she saying that a man is never a woman though that is not that context harassment that is a very specific opinion that she has that happened to be biologically accurate now I don't know I don't agree with targeting harassment on anybody and I targeted harassment on trans people work or straight people or whatever I don't I don't agree with it I don't think you should do it it's just it's not something I want to do but in this context what she saying is not just her her expression but it's accurate can an important point is if I tweeted to you Jo-Jo you are not a hamster that's clearly not a violation of the rules however there are identifies a hamster will know it wouldn't be cuz I know I know people who have specifically begun using insult of animals to avoid getting kicked off the platform for breaking the rules certain individuals have been suspended now use certain small Woodland creatures in place of slurs so they're not really insulting and it's fine but there are people who consider themselves trans-species now I'm not trying to belittle that means just want to point out that you have a specific rule for one set of people and there are there are there people who have General body dysphoria you don't have rules on that they're people who actually amputated their own arms you don't have rules on that you have a very specific ruleset and in more importantly in the context of a targeted conversation I can say a whole bunch of things that would never be considered a rule break but that one is which is ideologically driven I'm trying to understand different people's perspectives And all I'll say is that our intent is not to police ideology our intent is to police behaviors that we view as if uses Ben Crossman and I hear your point of view and it's something I'll definitely discuss with my team which is a concern or chemical reaction it sounded like a protest against the LGBT community where there is a division and there's a division between people that think the train women are invading biological female spaces and making decisions that don't benefit these biological females cisgender whatever you want to call them this is an actual debate and it's a debate debate among the progressive people amongst left-wing people and it's a debate amongst liberals this is Amin I would imagine the vast majority of people in the lbgt community are in fact on the left and this is one example. So you have a protected class that's have argument with a woman who feels like there's an ideological bent to this conversation that is not not only not accurate but not fair and she feels like it's not fair for biological women the same as Martina take us to its logical conclusion screenshot from somebody and it maybe it's back I think it was real they were having an argument with someone on Twitter and responded with dude, you don't know blah blah and they got a suspension in a lockout had delete the Tweet because the end using a cartoon Avatar with a bath with the family family with Sam reported inside that I'm transgender he calling me dude and the Twitter user. So I can understand mistakes happen but when you have a rule that's like that there's colloquial terms that are like man come on It's Tricky but in this case of Megan Murphy that's her name right. Doesn't make any sense to me that seems like she should be allowed to express herself in this is this is not being she's not being mean by saying a man is never a woman this is a perspective that that is scientifically accurate and that's that's part of the problem cuz I think that one in particular highlights this idea of where the problems lie and having a protected class and race it doesn't get dick doesn't get removed I'm talking about abusing and harassing a black person in the same way it would be considered targeted racism again it's about targeted harassment on the platform but well I mean what is racism is is racism only mean there's this Progressive perspective of racism that is only possible if your phone more power classroom punching down that's the only racism I don't think that makes any sense I think racism is looking at someone that is from whatever whatever race and deciding that they are in fact less or less worthy or less valuable whatever it is that that takes place across the platform against white people do not saying white people need to be protected I know it's easier being a white person in America the fact but it's hypocritical to have a policy did only distinguishes you can make fun of white people all day long but if you decide to make fun of Asian folks or you don't fill in the blank that is racist but making fun of white people isn't and it doesn't get removed there are tons of to Sarah Jeong from The New York Times that's like across-the-board meaning like it doesn't just protect women protect men and women it protects all Races it doesn't matter in this is how a lot of set up in the United States right you can't discriminate against white men against black men like those are the laws for the structure it is it doesn't it doesn't take into consideration about white people and white people on Twitter what do you do about that journalist on the issue I mean we focus on target behavior that is targeted individual who belongs to that class because if you try to Police Every opinion that people have about different races or religions that to somebody who belongs to that class and that's reported to us that is a violation of our rules and so in case a lot we did see many tweets of that nature that we're focused on people who are white men and our rules of in this area came into effect in 2015 which was a hateful conduct policy and a lot of those tweets were from a time. Where those warrants and offended her defense she was actually supposed to be responding to people that help you don't believe that come on over 3 years she's tweeting blanket statement after the rules went into effect and we did take action on the tweets from after the rules 1 and 2 we're talking about something that might have happened eight years ago but it was like 2011 I searched for slurs against white people black people Latinos and I found copious just just tons and tons of them now then I'll go back up most of what I found to go back to Fox about seem like you guys are doing your best but there is a lot</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> into a person and you delete you banned him permanently there's a little more than I want to make sure is clear is that you had somebody who actively called for the death of people understand the context issue maybe he's talking about video games Hudson scale and scale so this is a verified user and the complexity Margarita's areas that I prepared so here we have someone with over 20,000 followers he's verified numerous times insights his followers to commit a crime against these kids the action taken against him is deleted tweets you guys to spank you get time out then you have people like Alex Jones who berated a CNN reporter permanently banned you get Milo yiannopoulos he was mean from Italy band Milo had a number of tweets that violated our rules going back to 2014 but I'm going to talk about the final three in this concept he claimed to be a buzzfeed reporter in his bio and he's a verified account so that is impersonation I'm not sure why he did that he did do that will BuzzFeed the left-wing things he was doing parody everybody who knows Milo with no that is not a buzzfeed reporter that people who don't know Milo look at that and they removed his verification if you were my child I'd have dashed your head on a rock and try it again which we viewed as a threat really should have swallowed you a bunch of things that he posted that we viewed as incitement of abuse against Leslie Jones there's a bunch of them but the one that I like to look at and which really convinced me is he posted to doctor tweets that were supposedly by Leslie Jones they were fake tweets the first ones that white people are getting on my nerves like how can you call yourself human and then the second one's said the goddamn slur for a Jewish person lazzoni ain't paid me yet damn fixed nude better pay up chopped and they were faked can always tell so it is possible that he didn't know they were faked not only did it leave it alone he said don't tell me some mischievous internet Rascal made them up! So this in the context of a bunch of other things he was saying towards Leslie Jones on Twitter I and my team felt that this was taken as a whole incitement of harassment against her multiple accounts that were connected to him there were a bunch of other issues on a background but these are the three primary things that we in terms of the other things that were in the background weren't they multiple accounts that were connected to him like that I think it was more that we found him to be engaging and coordinated behavior and inciting people to to attack Leslie Jones know they don't sound that bad for the death of a child Maga hat thrown into wood chipper the fact of that guy still out there tweeting and yet Milo's not Milo's initial the whole thing stem from other than the BuzzFeed thing stem from his legitimate criticism of a film and he's you know he's a satirist he was mocking this film an enormous amount of responsibility for that because I feared daily for the things that are happening on a platform that are translating into the real world to Milo is a contentious figure and they're certainly things you can pull up that I wouldn't agree with anything you did there I think those are horrible I think Joe got some really good points but what about Chuck Johnson why was Chet Johnson band I don't have the details information. Johnson said that he was preparing something to take out a McKesson and in the journalistic contact people you mean he was going to do a dossier or some kind of hit piece Andre it's probably band am I understanding and it's been a long time since I've read this there was some leaked emails I think from dick a stolo where he said maybe it wasn't that I don't know who it was exactly they said I don't care to get rid of him and he was off so you have I don't know this is always leaning towards the left are you feel that way I don't think that's true I think we look it each individual instances violations are rules and try to make the best case that we can then I'm not trying to do things just to say I do think we've failed in a couple ways and I want admit that number one we haven't done enough education about what rules are violated like for a lot of first-time users of the platform if they violate the rule once almost two-thirds of them never violate like a bunch of people accidentally like if they know what the rules are most people can avoid people when they feel the sting of the violation that go okay I don't want to lose my rights to post let me know what types of behavior and is found to be in violation of our rules being very very clear like this week was found to be in violation of this particular combination of education and transparency is really important for an open platform like Twitter it's just part of who we are and we have to build it into the product examples of a wood chipper versus Chuck Johnson saying you should take this guy he wants to Google prepare. CA to take this guy out or how do you say I want to eat something like I'm going to take out DeRay McKesson with he said I'm preparing to take out there some like that I can't. who assassinated the other ones a director at 1 guys banned4life the other guys still post any can I'm happy to follow up I just don't have all the charm then it's not about one thing that it's about a pattern and practice of violating for one thing but if there's a pattern and practice like there was for Milo we are going to have to take action at some point because we can't sit back and let people be abusing her house and silenced on the clock</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when I was physically threatened on Twitter you guys refused to take down the tweet and I showed up in Berkeley and someone physically threatening me because they were encouraged to when I was in Venezuela I was physically threatened by high-profile individual 10,000 people tweeting at me you guys do nothing right so I guess there's the obvious question of why does it always feel like your policies are going One Direction politically you say it's about Behavior said several times already examples of that not being the case and you will always be able to find those example examples where you guys were alerted multiple times and did nothing like when antifa doxxed a bunch of law enforcement agents some of its way to remove but since September this tweet is still alive with a list of private phone numbers addresses yet Kathy Griffin she's fine the guy who threatened the lives of these kids in Covington and said lock him in school and bring it down you did nothing I mean you got to spend it was he banned for threatening the lives of kids absolutely not that are meant to protect people and are meant to enable for expression as long as you're not trying to silence somebody else now we take a variety of different enforcement mechanisms around that sometimes you get warned sometimes your Tweet is forced to be deleted it's a very rare occasion where we will outright suspend someone without any sort of warning or any sort of ability to understand what happened so in a particular case you are docking policy really focuses on posting private information which we don't consider names to be private we consider your home address your home phone to your home phone number or your mobile phone number those types of things to be private so not particular case we took what I think now is probably a very literal interpretation of our policy and said that was not a doxxing incident I would probably ask my team to look at through the lens of what was the purpose behind that tweet and if the purpose was in fact you identify these kids either dock them or abusing her ask them which I probably was then we should be taking a more expansive view of of that policy and including that type of content error with hundreds of millions of accounts all around the world numerous languages we're going to make mistakes even if we get better there will always be mistakes but we're hoping to learn from those and to make ourselves better and to catch cases like Tim's or others where we clearly may have made an error and I'm open to having those discussions I'm not I'm sorry too unfamiliar with your specific cases but I'd love to follow up with you and really don't understand tweet a lowercase this is also an evolution in participation as well as we've come to recently as we do we do need to we do need a price are these efforts both in terms of policy enforcement I were thinking about evolving them one of the things that we want to focus on as number one is physical safety and this will lead you immediately to something like doxxing and right now the only way we take action on a dachshund case is if it's reported or not I want to move to is to be able to recognize those in real time at least in the English language recognize those in real-time for machine learning algorithms and take the action before has to report it to wear Focus purely right now on going after a dachshund cases with our our them so that we can be proactive that also requires a much more rigorous appeals process to correct us when we're wrong but we think it's tightly scoped enough it impacts the most important thing which is someone's physic what you learn from that we can really look at that the biggest issue with our system right now is all the burden is placed upon the victim so we only act based on reports weed we don't have a lot of enforcement especially with with more than more than more the takedowns that are run through machine learning Mariposa Q based on severity and this is the thing in Willmar severity of something like physical safety or private information run on so generally we try to get through everything but we have to prioritize IQ even coming in as if someone threatened the lives of someone else you would would you ban that account would you tell them like three times kill these people I want them dead three times is that do you want to give out specific usernames because then that people just point the finger at me and think I'm getting these people band but Covington this guy said multiple times to he wanted his followers to go and kill these kids and we have to look at that but we have to look in the contacts cuz we also have I think we talked about this a little bit in the last podcast but we we have Gamers on the platform who are saying exactly that to their friends that they're going to meet at the game in the game tonight and without the context of their relationship without the context of the conversation to wear we'll take the exact same action on on them incorrectly I think in the case of Covington know this user was so high-profile he's a verified user he's got something like 20,000 followers and it was highlighted by numerous conservative media Outlets saying wow this guy's screenshotted is being shared I mean here to Disney producer like saying a picture of a wood chipper with a body being thrown in it saying that's what you wanted to happen I'll clarify fact check me on that but that's the basically the conversation I was having this guy Disney was he posted a picture of him Fargo of someone being tossed in a wood chipper and he says I want all these Maga kids you know don't like this you had another guy who supposedly said lock them in this world burn it down set a bunch of disparaging things and then said If you see them fire on that money to that more than once individual to commit a felony is a crime like incitement to violence has issue but this is where I talk and automatically suspend accounts with one violation because we want people to learn we want people to understand what they did wrong and give them an opportunity not to do it again and it's a big thing to kick someone off a platform and I take that very very seriously so I want to make sure that when someone violates our rules they understand what happened and they are given an opportunity to get back on the platform and change their behavior and many of these cases what happens as we will for someone to acknowledge that their tweet violated our rules force them to delete that tweet can get back on the platform and in in many cases if they do it again we give him a time out which is like seven days means I look you done it again to the temporary suspension if you do it again about your mom and say what you done it again the temporary suspension if you do anything about your mom until you're not exactly and if you do it again</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> needs to be stated that Twitter by definition is a bias platform in favor of the left. This is a question I understand you might have your own interpretation but it's very simple conservatives do not agree with you on the definition of misgendering if you have a rule in place that specifically here's to the left ideology You by default are enforcing rules from a biased perspective lets him there a lot of people in the last you don't agree with let me know what he's talking about I mean in terms of generalities that in general things we need far more left would you agree to that I don't know what that means that people have felt that I don't want to be on this platform anymore because I'm being harassed and abused and I need to get the hell out about that and I don't click notifications have anymore because it's basically just harassment and I even when so this is a really funny anecdote I was covering a story in Berkeley and someone said if you see him attack him like it was it was I'm paraphrasing they said basically just swing at me take my stuff steal from me and Twitter told me after review was not a violation of their policy somebody made an allusion to me being a homosexual and I replied that instantly gun so when I show up so so for me I'm looking like wolf course Twitter is going to enforce the social justice aspect of their policy immediately in my opinion probably cuz you guys have PR constraints and you're probably nervous about that but when someone actually threatens me with a crime in inside their father doing nothing got done I'm not the only one who feels that way to hurt you my part or in the team's part that it was only after media pressure to do social networks take action so that's why I bring up specifically cuz it's reminder P are constraints to get rid of him I think if you look at the pr that's what our way through in that incident it wouldn't be that we was good enough and that's not at all why we took action over a weekend is what Alex mentioned on your on your podcast with him he was removed from the iTunes podcast directory that was the that was the linchpin for him because it it it drove all the traffic to what he said basically zero immediately after that we saw our PR companies Facebook Spotify YouTube also take action we did not we did not because we when we looked at our service and we looked at the report on her service we did not find anything in violation of our rules then we got into a situation where suddenly a bunch of people were reporting content including CNN who wrote an article about all the things that might violate our rooms rules that we look into and we gave him one of the other warnings and then we can get into the actual details but yeah we did not follow we resisted just being like a domino with our peers because it wasn't consistent with our rules and with the contract we put in before our customers so what was it that made you ban them attention after the fact that were reported To Us by by different users there was a video that was uploaded that showed a child being violently thrown to the ground and crying so that was the first one the second one was a video of that we viewed as incitement of violence I can read it to you it's a little off a little a little bit of a transcript but but now it's time to act on the enemy before they do a false flag I know the Justice Department's crippled a bunch of followers and cowards but there's groups are grand juries there called for it it's time for medically economically and judiciously and legally and criminally to move against these people it's got to be done now get together the people you know aren't traitors aren't cowards aren't helping their frickin bats hedging their frickin bats like all these other assholes do in let's go let's do it so people need to have their and then there's a bunch of other stuff but at the end so people need to have their battle rifles ready and everything ready at their bedside and you got to be ready because the media is so disciplined in their deception so this is call to violence against the media that's what it sounded like the time and there been a number of incidents of violence against the media and again I take my responsibility for what happens on a platform and how that translates off platform very seriously and that felt like it was an incitement to buy if you only put it inside man to violence would have been fine if he only could be only three that trance was that egregious enough for you to say that alone that wasn't number to right right so the question is what was the video context of the kid being thrown to the ground was it newsworthy violence against a child does not something we would allow on the platform but we didn't feel that that was the texture well don't use a video that's been going around that was going around few before 5 weeks ago the one where the girls were yelling at that big giant guy and the guy punched a girl in the face and she was like 11 years old I saw that multiple times on Twitter that was one of those vile things overseeing the giant man punched his eleven-year-old girl in the face and that was was that removed from Twitter we looked at was a verbal altercation that Alex got into with a journalist and in that altercation which was uploaded to Twitter there were a number of statements using eyes of the Rat even more evil looking person he's just scum you're a virus to America and freedom smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear end of a dead cow you look like a possum that got caught doing some really really nasty stuff in my view there was a bunch of that's a little hilarious practice herbal altercation that was posted on your phone that we have individuals we saw this pattern and practice one starts you strike three strikes and we made a decision to permanently account onto Twitter so we can we can agree with you when you say this thing was like you know Alex at this sound like a threat he was raining this person saying awful things but ultimately your judgment is the contact you say with pay attention the contacts we just trusting that you made the right decision well I'm getting you as much as I I can give you here and I think that this is the real hard part of content moderation a scale on global platforms it's not easy that I wanted to get in touch with Jack when I first saw them on because my thought and I wasn't as concerned about the censorship as many people were my main concern was what is it like to start this thing that's kind of for fun and then all the sudden it becomes the premier platform for free speech on the planet Earth becomes the premier platform for free speech on the planet Earth but it's also a platform that use their views and harass a lot of people and used in ways that none of us wanted to be used unless it happens I think it's an enormously complicated challenge for any company to do content moderation at scale and that's something that we are sitting down thinking about how do we take this forward</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> dos Uno come on tricaster life to Tim Tim pool that's a lot and Jack Dorsey plays Gemma thank you everybody for doing this appreciate it thank you thank you that the cash app is one of the sponsors of the podcast it's been a sponsor for a long time and also a giant supporter of my good friend Justin Brands fight for the Forgotten charity building Wells for the pygmy The Congos is very important to me and I'm very happy that you guys are part of that and you are connected to that I don't that's mean it's easy for them to stay that doesn't have an influence on the way we discuss things but it doesn't so if it does I don't know what to tell you actually have like 80 shares in square which is really that much but it's something it is it is it so I don't want people to think you know whatever you're the CEO of square I think right but there's a lot of people that were upset that they were some issues that we didn't discuss or didn't discuss in-depth enough or they felt that I didn't press you enough I talked to Tim because you know Tim and I have talked before and he made a video about it and I felt like his criticism was very valid so we got on the phone we talked about it and I knew immediately within the first few minutes of conversation that he was far more educated about this than I was so I said would you be willing to do a podcast and perhaps you a podcast with Jack and he said absolutely so we did a podcast together it was really well-received people felt like we covered a lot of the issues that they felt like I didn't bring up and so then Jack and I discussed it and we said bullets bring Tim on and then have big John as well so that right I'll get it right I promise but it was so weird today you know who Shawn Baker is he's a doctor who's a prominent proponent of the carnivore diet his post was his account was frozen today I just sent it to Jamie yeah his account was frozen today because of an image that he had cuz he's a proponent of the carnivore diet there's a lot of people to believe that this Elimination Diet is very healthy for you and going to cure a lot of autoimmune issues with certain people but some people ideologically opposed it because they think it's bad for the environment or you shouldn't eat meat or whatever the reasons are this is huge in the the Bitcoin Community well it's a lot of people that have autoimmune issues with arthritis so because he has a photo of a lion in a header eating looks like like that his account was locked for violating is ruled against graphic violence or adult content in profile images that seems a little silly and I thought I wanted to just mention that right away know whose decision is something like that like who decides to lock a guy the count out because it has a nature image of you know natural predatory behavior how we operate as a company as we rely on people to report information to us so if you look at any tweet you can kind of pull down on the carrot on the right and you can say report the tweet and then you have a bunch of categories you can choose from I think this one in particular those probably not for them so how does he have the option to protest or to ask someone to review it absolutely I came in to make sure that it is actually a violation of the rules are in this case if it's not then it would be removed is that a violation of rules that image I don't think so I don't think that that would be what we're trying to capture in terms of graphic images in an avatar it's more about violence towards humans unless it was some sort of Cruelty to pick dating or something like that but not the intention of the world Target an individual cuz it with him he's a like I said he's a doctor and a proponent of this carnivore diet but he's also he ruthless in his condemnation and mocking of vegans does it all the time until then they get it upset at him and they can Target posts and just report them and mass and when they do that then this becomes an issue I'm at scale in Desperate I don't I don't know what happened in this case area it's hard for me to talk about it but what I would say is it doesn't really matter if one person reports it or 10,000 people report it like we're going to review the report then we're going to make an assessment and we're never going to let you know kick someone off the platform finally and Forever Without a person taking a look and making sure that is an actual violation One Direction I can't imagine he would Target vegans but vegans retarded him right who are just jerks that don't like him cuz he's getting all the love people are weird yeah but it's just the idea though it does kind of highlight a bit of a flaw in that it's good that someone can look at you might see something awful someone dachshunds him or something like that and then you can take that and report it and then people can see it and get rid of it and minimize the damage that's done that there's another big problem here in that is the carnivore diet legitimately healthy is it a threat to your health and if it is what is Twitter's responsibility in controlling the information right so just to clarify my my my opinion is if you want from your partner for the carnivore diet let him but you've got people on YouTube or being deranged for certain beliefs about certain health issues that I would agree with and so one of the rest of them is you know we're coming towards a position where people think some ideas are better than others therefore as a company were going to restrict access to certain information anti-vax exactly would you guys restrict someone from sharing in for black false information about vaccines I could get someone hurt that is not a violation of Twitter's rules now or at least showing people other information that might be counter to what they see and there's there's a bunch search I would suggest that further and bold interviews there's also research that was suggested it at least gives of a consideration about what they're what they currently believe so would you guys we have a little bit more freedom to show more of the spectrum of any one particular issue and I think that's how we would that we would approach it from the start said we haven't really dealt much with the misinformation we're probably across like these sorts of topics we've we've focused our efforts on elections and what made me elections right now it's kind of a different thing Artemis is really in love to have a discussion about this do you really want corporations to police what's true and not true absolutely. It's a really really tough position should we try not to do that we don't want to do that are going to be harmed by this responsibility to correct unique to a very small fraction of people in this world that you guys actually ban people for the way I think of it is it's behavior-based and I know you think of it as content and we can we can disagree on this point but this is about why are you doing this to a trans person why are you calling them by this name when they chosen to Go by different name or yru outing them in somewhere like what is your intent and purpose behind that a transgender individual changes their name when they transition a deadname would be their birth name or the name they went by before the transition so my mom's probably going to miss gendering and a naming orientation and their gender identity so it was something that broad-based is that you you can't choose to attack people because of these characteristics would you do have limits on what characteristics of police right so you're not you're not for targeted trans-species others right in-person stupid 5000 times we probably do that as a dino Chargers hi level I personally and this is my job to run the ball team I believe that everyone has a voice and should be able to use it and I want them to be able to use it online now where we draw a line is when people use their voice and use their platform to of using harass other people to silence though because I think that that's what we've seen over the years and number of people who have been silenced online because of the abuse and harassment they received any either stop talking or they leave the platform and it's in align is when people use their voice and use their platform to abuser as other people to silence them because I think that that's what we've seen over the years is the number of people who have been silenced online because of the abuse and harassment they received any either stop talking or they leave the platform and its entirety if you look at free expression and Free Speech laws around the world they're not absolute they're not absolutely there's always limitations on what you can say and it's when you're starting to endanger other people</div>

That's a good move financially I guess heartbreaking heartbreaking right here here it is wannacry I want to cry at sad so fresh it does open up Anthony Joshua Deontay Wilder which is very excited but no time soon maybe Luis Ortiz yeah and that's enough fight for him Big Baby Miller custom f****** power you don't think so that's Madison Square Garden to write first time Anthony Joshua's fighting the United States do you have to wear a f*** Tyson Fury wow that seems like a fake name it's like uniform name is Breeze you call Brazil suck me up when you find United States do you have to wear a f*** Tyson Fury wow that seems like a fake name it's like uniform a football name is Brees you call Brazil</div>

Right if I will forever be marred by the fact they separated them when Damien had one hook and he's trying to take us back to those that f****** a homeboy see who that was go go to Demian Maia vs Usman and see who who separated them cuz the ref Matt Matt the terror Sarah was going f****** crazy about that and he's a hundred percent right do you know how difficult it is to get a hold of a guy like loose pain like that into have one hook and standing up and be working to take his back of them to separate him it is nonsense she went on to know how much harder it is that's hard to take would lie down and control stand them up yep yep I think about Damien Myers last fight right who the who the f*** they just choked unconscious with that someone really good free as I can see the face so it's mine and them there they're exchanging is my cracked him who is it like for the Christian I know to referees I don't know it's Leon yeah okay well for whatever reason I don't know what I did to say I didn't say anything bad about Mark Goddard I said I do I just grew them standing up I don't know why you said the commentaries off but Dominick Cruz did say that he can't wrestle the reason why he's standing him up is cuz you can't wrestle yes he said that we do not agree with stand up referee in that moment he's wrong. what is your in your Coke comes commentators make a lesson observation of actual events I will book Joe Rogan's ask that's wrong that's why I was so rude I didn't see that it is your and your cocoms recollection and observation of actual events I'll save my side for later with that doesn't make any sense recollection actual events I don't know what he's trying to say there and Co, I didn't say nothing bad about him other than that I don't agree with the stand-ups Dominick Cruz has said that he can't wrestle and I don't know if more product to wrestle I know he knows how to referee and know this computer Dominick Cruz he cannot wrestle Robbie Lawler's controversial kind of the arm went limp and see how it made I think it's unfortunate and it may have been a mistake but it might not have been a mistake I'm still at all don't forget to love but with Mark daughter don't be the guy trying to John replied he said I was trying to be respectful we just call it like we see it too but there's an arrogance with which you deal with the fighters, taters and many in the Sport &amp; I by One Man steak and I'm quite sure you'll give yours for everyone to hear while manic Worldstar I believe between decisions separate the fighters and John said exactly that's what I was referring to that that two of the consensus baffert best referees of the game would handle those two situation so differently I understand the athletes are different but there are parallels to be drawn John is 100% correct because it's not very professional and I think it's very emotional and I think he's probably just feeling the Heat you know I like Mark Goddard I like him a lot I think it's a very good referee to rest in the business I love Mark daughter keep f*** that up my question is I wonder who is telling them they should stand things up when it shouldn't stand things up and wanted pressure he feel pressure you feel from the audience you think the crowd maybe it could be that people are very nice you know sometimes in English buttercup what I think let it go. I just I do not agree with stand-ups cuz I think of a guy can hold you down like this are saying about Ben askren if guy like Ben askren can hold you down and give you no keys until the fight over about got to something about it exactly so he's not cheating keep it up tomorrow how hard is to control Woodley on the down and he didn't even complain with right back at him and took him down again again he's a monster a cool story bro he is f****** hard to deal with sometimes ecobee4 everyone on the planet Earth but stylistically when you look at the fight for Colby I look at what Colby just the thing about Guzman is he's got power he's got striking he's got wrestling but even maybe more important already four days here is always mine you're not getting in there I sold on Friday how adorable was it him with his little daughter hey Manny go bad when it feels like your husband win the f****** world have World Welterweight Title</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> until has a shot to be a champion I'll tell you what you know Robbie Lawler lost that fight God damn you look good you look good physically like that the way any look Jack best I've ever seen if you looked amazing apparently he had a tremendous strength and conditioning routines I was real good old and I think maybe the time off was good for him because he had to get a ACL surgery so vitamin D on something before his last fight we don't know do you think maybe it was to wear been asking. So one-dimensional you have to worry about the Striking at all just a little bit of that for sure but the f****** fight started because he launched been asking his aunt's landing on his f****** head. What should I do crazy how much time it could have got pretty dicer for f****** to Dick goes limp now here's the question did it go limp because he just let it go cuz he's trying to like let you know just let it go cuz you turn on hang on was not understand now people need to stop saying they have to be under the chin to Ciocca Garden, you can choke a guy unconscious across his face for June go across the face right like this if you have a real squeeze you have like a Marcelo Garcia squeeze you can put a guy to sleep stupid and has a real squeeze phenomenal squeeze with that bull. Portugal amazing torque so I don't know if he went out and then been let him go a little bit and they pop right back awake that's what he saying your natural movement though if you go if you're fighting a choke your your natural mousse to hold onto it is not gold lamp that's true that's true that's why I'm like I may be was out we thought he was out he's out he's out. He's out but damn he can take a f****** shot he can take a f****** shot cuz Robbie hitting with some ass use a Twitter media I think it was Twitter and I think maybe he might have either reposted it or replied to it or reposted it with a comment he says this is what happened to see it when he said this is what happened then go to whatever he was commenting on you'll see the video whatever he was coming on is the video Don't Lie saying that in the video that she was checking out here is chalk chalk chalk a little bit and then her detect click on that click on the video there it is right there at the top right there watching this so check this out Will Herb said would herba saying is he told them to stop when the arm went limp when the arm went linn-benton said is it is lightening up and then he lightened up and then Robbie came back to life that's fair that is entirely possible folks it's entirely possible I do not know but I do know the Robbie Lawler's are classy mother f***** because you complain for a little bit what the f*** does that man good job good fight in the game so long he's got a great attitude and I don't think a stock dropped in that fight I really don't know no I really don't and I would like to see the rematch I mean he says no but then says no more fight in the first place why would you yeah band you performance of s*** you barely one you're ugly as f*** your chin is too big not to miss you have no respect for no 100 go see your curly headed foxy in London Muppet well tell out the top fight in London O2 yeah no joke man has a very tactical guy he's very good wrestling and I think that's probably where he's going to try to put Darren till after that Woodley fight performance of s*** you barely one you're ugly as f*** your chin is too big not to miss you have no respect for no 100 go see your curly headed foxy in London Muppet well tell out the top fight in London O2 yeah no joke man has a very tactical guys wrestling Two Men and very good wrestling and I think that's probably where he's going to try to put Darren till after that Woodley fight</div>

Champ the road for him to get back to me so f****** tough because of what he did when he was champ I feel better with me the greatest ever do it when I was making the argument before this fight that you could obviously you could argue that if he beats Guzman he is a great attract he's in the greatest George St-Pierre right he wasn't Legend at welterweight is career mean how many years was George Chapel was it 6 years or something crazy ahead of time so you have George Matthews in Woodleaf Matthews as Legend status cuz he was the original right he was I mean he was the first wrestler that really developed rock-solid submission skills the fight with Frank Trigg the the mean the money armbar George St-Pierre and their first fight between who's amazing but then the new school was George George was the best welterweight of all time but I was saying that he's in the running right now if you consider the opponents he beat Wonderboy twice knocks out Robbie Lawler to win the title and then goes on from there beats Demian Maia I mean you you look at how he beat Darren till for some reason he was an underdog in the Darren till fight with didn't make any sense to me I thought everybody else get it I got it Darren Till's very good but I did not much I never saw him on the ground I never saw a real wrestler take him down a ground-and-pound I didn't know what he had off his back yeah I think there until to be a prom person but really it's dies and is he still I think especially now that 170 what what is if you are a fan of fighting what is fun is bleeping out the welterweight division so fun</div>

Crazy crazy and no I mean for the beat to beat the number 6 on the workout it was good I didn't think it helps to beat stock cuz there's so much hype on it stop fighting that walk away from that bike one oh my God I can't wait to see him fight again why I look good but when you when you hear Mark Henry's ghost talk about him I mean to talk about him like he's the next f****** did you see a 360 roundhouse kick you tried get head doesn't play that game no don't play the game like Cody garbrandt played the Patriots in the Colony golf light was crazy I just lost control 3 in a row I just couldn't believe you standing with him like that he got him hurt and then he got her and then he was determined to take him out and then they were literally going right hand right hand right hand song with oh yeah and Pedro can take a shot so can Cody shots he ate some big ones call Center for Kodi so technical I know it doesn't make any sense of the head by City I've had button just saw Brett but he definitely did you definitely got head-butted talked about it again angry about it yeah yeah yeah you got to fight and tell them you obviously it's super easy for us to say bike coming off two losses which I've been there you're usually a little more like I'd like to go down that road where I've been knocked out twice and I know how that ends with I get here let's learn from our mistake right right right champion no. No doubt about it is Pedro Munoz okay we play that game on dealership in both of those fights he hurt TJ Dillashaw he's just got to be more cautious and fight more technical or disciplined yeah you know I mean wouldn't be a bad idea to get some mental coaching you know get some game plan coaching what you might have been doing I don't know but I don't know just speculating I don't know who I'm striking with either but you know to mix things up more and be more unpredictable would also be a good thing and obviously they'll be the last exchanges were just not predictable at all before I mean not unpredictable. Fully predictable just right hand Cody did in their fight that he got hit in the unemotional he fought Reckless. Tom went after Cody that worst day he said I know what it's like you just lose the game plan start to get wild yeah it's just it's hard to see him. He's fine I hope so it's not like he said I know what it's like you just you lose your game plan to start to get wild yeah it's just it's hard to see him get KO three times in a row like that he's in me fine I hope so. I hope so it's not like alright let's give you a warm up fight boxing but I warm up Jimmie Rivera or f******</div>

I don't know I'll least he had a calm self down cuz he got himself worked up into a lather it was just so so angry and so you know so hyped up trying to act like a crazy person and when they were doing his pre-fight Medicals they were like hey you know like you can't fight your f****** do something wrong with you there, them down he had to relax and calm down so so smart at like psychological warfare there's never been any anybody like him psychologically that could just he would first of all he was very funny you would say hilarious s*** like Howard Cosell said to him trampy champ you seem very truculent good on that was just perfect he was so he would know say things that were funny he would say poetry he had that guy bundini Brown behind them and they were always you know they were always like laughing and joking around together but you had a tremendous support team and on top of that he could fight his f****** ass off and he was a heavyweight that moved around like a middleweight unbelievable plus pound 215 Tour 20 lb man and he would Shuffle and move and by we even he would be out there almost I do well to what he's the greatest boy it's hard to say who's the greatest heavyweight of all time but he's certainly in the conversation it mean you would have to say how would he have done against some of the bigger stronger guys of the past like a Lennox Lewis who will you know what's in his prime the high 240-pound range much bigger much bigger guy but there was nobody like to see how he also comes in two stages there's a lie before 1967 they took his license away and there's a lie after 1970 when he came back and when he came back he was never as fast he was never as fleet-of-foot cuz he didn't work out at all for three years didn't do s*** he just didn't look right he didn't look like he had the same movement is body didn't have the same musculature he just he thought Jerry no wasn't very coronary quite that's what was and he beat him and beat him up but he just didn't look like them</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Spectrum so you got people that don't even know their human or life exists is this all elucidation because they've been lied to so much for so long then it was true and then over here you got people to just believe whatever they see on CNN and me I'm just trying to look at everything going well find the universe and that's why they staged events so they can try to bring order within that event that's on what it would have been are you talking about no Northwoods or going well that's what we'll do it just what is the system on it rid of free speech right to self-defense the family defend those things and ask yourselves what are we about 8 then I believe in that you can say that should have got was it right to bear arms Free Speech what was the third one I think mystery switch to get why she had me on guys don't want to be like my life is not Sandy Hook I'm said to tell me what you were telling me earlier that you were actually even before all this happened you were planning your exit strategy like you get weary of this yeah it's not like I'm 45 and I've had a long adventurous life so I'm probably like 60 I was already like I wasn't sure about Trump or whatever has really bad feeling when he got elected nothing's bad just like all the words that start and then I was already playing kind of face tanks out just cuz I don't want to break down I'm 55 a heart attack and the fact they attacked me so much makes me have to battle and fight and never give up and and and and so it's not like they even wore me down before they ever they kept me in the game on this planet they kept me in the game attacking me and lying about me because now wall out I'm now becoming I was worried about now I dream about the stuff that was what you were worried about initially yeah because I realize about the 45 years ago this obsessive that was already totally obsessed you were you were telling me that if your head is certain amount of it after a while just f**** with your head jobs like planning things eaten food and like put my kids to sleep in like no cutting trees down and like walking around like normal and just being a normal person you're going to be pinned against the wall but you're going to make sure you're going to fight to the death and then I'd only got to say this but I realize it's God's plan I'm not going to be turned loose I wasn't just going to do a couple chores in this fighting BP turn loose and realize that this is all big stage and God wants to see some people dance but I tell you the globalist think they're like running me out it's the opposite now they've turned me into this Maniac well do so there's definitely some sort of a struggle going on right now and there's a it's a seems to be like a universal struggle for figuring out what people are and how we should behave and who gets to decide that and there's certain Universal truths are ignored and they're certain ones that are emphasized overemphasized there certain ones that are you know that are in the Goldilocks spot and we will working it out I think that's what's going on with human beings but we have to be really really careful of is that by silencing some people and never giving them any path to retribution we create Eternal enemies in this is this is what he's we could be happening right now with when someone doesn't have the ability to express themselves because an evil Force One Hive hive mind sort of thinking to a lot of this there's not a lot of debate about smoking let's just say this show and and 210 play nobody else you didn't give into the pressuring of the threat it was more than a game like a siren like a busy woman audience women play the wife and put out good ideas and talk to people but folks are going to make you choose a site and that's what's happening in this quickening is I don't want you to say that's why Ryan Seacrest got a nail nobody's coming to Ryan Seacrest for like political advice he's got a nailed it host a bunch of shows a real nice guys got a great smile he's figured it out but you understand wide open entropy is a stagnant water still clear dead and rotting what's a live ocean big crashing waves to take all your successful Joe cuz you play along it's perfect that mean it's bad it was real that's why your success and then they come in he's a go I'm not saying you're bad I'm saying way-o all these people are telling them because I've got nothing but they want you because they're soulless and to all I'm saying is you made the right decision and I'll just hang have me on cuz I'm not perfect is deciding no America still America the world still the world we're allowed to talk about play ball with them because I've got to get off this thing but they want you because they're soulless

It's too easy being beat the s*** out of him then the Shane Mosley fight was the fight that he lost that was the next fight in during the wrapping of the gloves Shane Mosley's Camp was so what the f*** is in his raps they recognized it and how to rewrap his hands and then Shane Mosley beat his f****** ass and they beat Robert Garcia and then Manny Pacquiao f*** them up and then Miguel Cotto fought them out but the Miguel Cotto fight the first one it was it was bad when his face was busted up and butt and that's when people had suspicions but they didn't know until they saw the wrapping of the gloves mini look at every one of his fight before that and we'll go all this m*********** at Plant City that City Stacy Keach Monticello sages first movies and John Huston directed it who are the best fight movies ever is fighting I was talking about earlier the Luis Resto fight just Billy Collins jr. guy was he was an up-and-coming Contender and he was blinded in the fight and can never fight again this kid that he fought Luis Resto they pulled all the padding out of the gloves and he just f***** up this guy's face it to the point where he had detached retinas and he couldn't see straight when an alcoholic after work Winter is right there look at his face and it became a really big a big store out with a deadly weapon and I think at the end of the other guys live for it at some point he admitted that he did it it was him documentary about it but the guy finally admitted that he was using done that forever people doing that forever I was born with a guy wants and I want to touch his gloves and was like what the f*** is in your glove and his padding had all been it was those old style old style does the padding you can push back and it was like it was all like almost run knuckle people are assholes people are actually fighting bare-knuckle there's a whole Bare knuckle boxing organization out of Wyoming you have all your knuckles actually fighting bare-knuckle there's a whole bare-knuckle boxing organization out of Wyoming you have all your knuckles yeah they're all they're broken up one that was broken nose Bobby sell these nose</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Cassius Clay beat Sonny yeah he's like eight to one another fight with a lot of people thought was fix the second fight 2nd and Main you can see the punch but it was like he called it an anchor punch cuz it's like as listed was coming for he dropped it down on him like that and a lot of people say it didn't land but you could see his head reacted definitely landed the question was whether or not he decide stay down once you got hit and I think you did if you watch it just doesn't look realistic I give you when he goes down the way went down seeing maybe legit but the way stumbled around if he didn't stumble around like a guy with central nervous system. Jack here we watch radio what is that was enough to take him out like that bank it could have been watch the KC if you can find The Knockout Jamie because the what's not what's so crazy about it wasn't him dropping them cuz I think that was legit with crazy was how afterwards he stumbled around like he couldn't move or he couldn't get up it just didn't seem real what did we just had it there Kevin Spacey here it is here to watch here's the punch boom that watch he goes down and just to lay down on his back and then he kind of stumbled around and acted like he couldn't get up they just keep showing it over and over again it was 100% of legitimate bunch of people who say it's not they've never seen people get ko'd cuz people get ko'd and all sorts of weird ways doesn't really make sense like it's human being getting punched in the face weird s*** happens especially you get punch on the jaw like is two people get touched with like a jab sometimes and then go out doesn't make sense and also sometimes here it is right here it's also sometimes it's weird because you might have gotten hurt real bad in training so a lot of guys come into these fights and they're already injured they just poop right there now it's watching stumble around so it goes down they lay down I see this is where I'm not buying it this see just seems like horseshit but I could be wrong now he's stumbling see like right there that seemed like he decided to stumble and go down and he's trying to get back up and I could be wrong I could be wrong but I'm not buying it and so the referee was Jersey Joe Walcott who is a very famous his own but now they study but now they steal away by the way he stopped the fight I don't know I don't remember I don't remember all you know the first fight fifth-round I think it was Liston put some white stuff on his gloves yeah and he blinded there's no crooked the game was he blinded Ali Cassius Clay so listen wasn't above cheating</div>

He won't he won't punch a bag or anything really that thing comes up in him where he wants to do it again it's like an addiction and he's got to be 60 now and still while welling up inside about respect him so much you know I always looked up to him when I was fighting cuz I remember the discipline that that guy had I remember watching videos of him but he was living on the cape you would treat him probably half an hour and he would run and Maze Runner or he was getting ready to fight Mustafa hamsho he's running and Shadow Boxing yelling war and could you imagine if you had a fight that f****** guy when he was the middleweight champ of the world first of all he was chiseled like he was sculpted out of bronze even look like it was so jacked for a boxer when you think about like most boxers they didn't have that kind of physique his physique was like almost like a gymnast you know when he was in his prime and you just was so disciplined and sofa and then beat the f*** out of everybody and then lost that one very controversial fights with everything that I was up at 5. scary movie with Marvelous Marvin Hagler in it nobody has that he could have kales Leonard but he didn't even go to a decision you lose that decision they pay him a boatload of cash and he goes to Italy what is it is it a movie I've ever seen that Jesus Christ so that's a long time ago because he looks really young back all my God he is in one of those movies wow this is an Italian spaghetti western when did while he's still jacked in that movie so yeah I'm kind of exercising this is so hilarious thank God I see pulled the punch I did a movie night in Boston called Southie with a guy throws me a dumpster and kills me right they had to do it over and over I just got out of Walpole the State Penitentiary Anaheim Angels 1989. India one retired somewhere around 8687 when they fight Leonard would have what an error that was amazing we should watch runs closed-circuit fights would go to a theater you watch it on a big screen closer and it tells you how many fifty bucks and I've walked in a Tyson knocked about the first round that was all that never happened people trying out of your eye with him Mason it yeah yeah but it is what it was 787 interesting movies but the best out for a goof know he had a whole career really f****** hot he had an extra inch of skull or something that was saying no is it the side temples is that what it was Temple muscles they said he was almost like built with deadly driving death Mugabe was a murder but not Marvin Marvin took a punt better than anybody modified only started Juan Roldan I think Juan Roldan was the only guy that ever knocked Marvin down but it wasn't a real knock-down was a trip and they counted it as a knockdown a tremendous fighter inside looking out again since I was Mugabe and then Mugabe was never the same again once you realize that this m*********** could stand right in front of me now I'm sure that's what is this referee stop what you doing I don't know what's going on at that smoke Lane hey now that we have a break in the action I'd like to I'd like to plug my movie Sweeney killing Sweeney we talked about it what it comes out we'll put it on Twitter like fighting but he said that but he was that guy Marvin Hagler was to me like he was the epitome of discipline you know what I thought about like a discipline fighter like that knows him always in shape always ready to go and then the discipline to never come back that was amazing to to me I've respected the f*** out of that his Fighters never know when did Wendel leave he knew when to leave and to this day I saw him in an interview recently he's fine completely</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> call you were while you were in the middle of this especially in the beginning in the early days that this was that you guys had a special Van Halen in the early did you guys had a massive impact on culture where you guys are aware of that like while it was happening how I mean I was in high school graduate in 1985 and you guys were the s*** my girlfriend might my sister's rather boyfriend's my sister's boyfriend's license plate soundtrack soundtrack to you absolutely enjoying Joe was intentionally I can tell you now Devine healing knew it but can't articulate it right there instrumentalist words and my thing we began very early on identifying that there's a whole lot of different neighborhoods in Southern California and you this from being with my dad all of his patients was like a Benetton ad you got to change your evil ways broken is different than what we're going to play for the Surfers Venice Beach that's Aerosmith stuff genius is in the details and how you interact with that crowd in between we would play out in Pomona at a biker bar guy got killed right in front of us and we finish the song what happened a couple of bike bike gangs went at it and there's a scrap and whenever next night we came back Vengeance had been sworn there police everywhere we go Champs out from the wall so we can hide behind the incident took up the seventies it was a mighty time wow in our thing was that we could play anywhere we had to otherwise you had feed ourselves alright and that meant by 45 minutes that's in the night five six nights if you could get it and we would ping pong all over the South lamp anywhere we can drive for two hours two hours north south or east is what how we would do and every neighborhood was a little different and that shows up in the music you know now you can take a look like dancing the night away or Jamie's Cryin there's a there's a Latino influence in that okay chachkies stuff because here this is she know you're surrounded by Hispanic culture here and we had heavy metal influences okay we had super wealthy stuff showed you have to be able to move to acoustic you got to be able to ease up if you get hired for a wedding and more importantly perhaps you know artist to artist I don't know Springsteen better during the song or in between careful going to the Broadway show about a $12,000 ticket now and I'm passing you know if they're almost peripheral to his narration in his descriptions and his poetry when he's such a guy like you have to hear the in-between stuff you want to hear imbrued you want to hear him talk you want to hear him think about things yes and where do you learn that you know Joe that's not a good Springsteen young man Joe what I was trying to get out was it does it ever freak you out like when you're ever alone and you think about what you guys did and what you've done in your career does it ever freak you out the impact you've had that if you looked at the amount of human beings have had the kind of impact that you've had its at did the tiniest tiniest fraction of a percent like the amount of human beings that can relate to your personal life experience paraphrased Brown movie there's two of them both were more helpful heavily produced by Jagger okay and he doesn't even a little bit of me football is all that you can trace it back you follow crying it's not that I don't think of it is impact that's a result what's the verb contribution at Family reunions whatever we go around everybody picks a word and my favorite word ever was contribution my favorite word ever was contribution did you try go climb the tree cuz my favorite poem I saw it inscribed on a rock by it and I'm as polite at the base destroy the base camp on Everest go climb the Treasure Mountain do not return empty-handed where are you now</div>

Glassman 40000 hour I will hook you up, right it's about 30000 hours and that's 10 hours a day every single day for 10 years and that's what creates a Jet Pilot a great surgeon a great writer very easily so he's off and go hand-in-hand something about people that get things very easily that for whatever reason it slip through their fingers more quickly as well when my sister my dad was an eye surgeon I did well and when my sister wanted to go to college you should I think that's a great idea and made her pay for it sign my first contract when I was $1,350 stereo and three records I worked all summer shoveling s*** at the local horse stable in Spanish are they do they enjoy themselves or they on team like their tournaments or is that something that I'll back up I'm leading up to something I'm making fun here and be a poetic but the monitor blows the guitar players past rehearsals whatever as memorable as possible because you can do a whole lot more to get ready then you are throwing the punch anybody on one of your shows yeah yeah yeah if the band says they don't like rehearsing you're doing it wrong if you're sitting on your laurels you're wearing them on the wrong party to buy Steven in Cleveland you can turn it into your place to your file what is your routine if I what music did you listen to you dig how did you warm up simple simple things you know of singing when they go into singing the idea of will go in and sing along with a dozen of your favorite songs put your headgear on get the Reverb to send out for me that starts with Motown I'm a soul Growler I'm closer to Wilson Pickett than the guy in the Rolling Stone I don't know what that sounds like no babe.

A proton is a good song by Steve Miller yeah but me and he had some everything and knows those songs and if you Skype you even start to play doo doo doo doo doo doo doo that's a no weight division thing and yeah one of the all-time greats the Ali is probably Rod Stewart okay his songs you can have other people singing butts in something other now journey I would recognize the guitar player but that's just listen to that kind that part of the band okay I'll my favorite part of the orchestra is the gone compare you sing for Journey was not so much a personality is an eloquent sound yes alright so it's a universal sound and if you even get close to it if it is part of every prom every wedding every going in and coming out party okay if you going into the into the army that's the last song the band's going to play yes even Tony Soprano we're not sure what happened but it happened to Journey truth that's right yes even Tony Soprano we're not sure what happened but it happened to Journey yes true that's right</div>

It's about Dad me I'm a hero and you can start to think in those terms using actual language movement same thing at this point in your career with jiu-jitsu and grappling you have a vocabulary that starts to expand expand by having to learn and Challenge and challenge people Bonneville at Anthony Bourdain it was to be at home everywhere no matter what somebody might say or posture or present he was able to Let It Go by when later or no will do it out right here and you have the capacity to stay cool in the middle of all of it so maybe it's just a cool school and food and culture and he just wanted to know everything about how these people thought about the world and saw things differently and Ryder and the capacity to stay cool in the middle of all of it so maybe it's just a cool school when you think why he just had a fascinating mine for travel and food and culture and he just wanted to know everything about how these people thought about the world and saw things differently and if you feel bad now for people that don't travel I really do I just feel like you're missing so much of what a human being is</div>

I'm kind of retarded no but I know he's proud that's never wrong became a universal truth even f****** start believing the Earth is round no flat Earth Society the Flat Earth Society is controlled opposition nobody gets in flatoril okay and it had to circumnavigate the planet and you will be there with GPU no no no no I'm not going to be there one of the astronauts it's going to go to the ISS just have a GoPro camera on his helmet and just go uncut no cuts no cut from the time you get in on that ship to the dock and I want you to talk to me like that and Friends that did happened would you want us to back home Alex Jones they're real people man they were there real people real people you don't think it's really constructed or you would like to see the footage first so we talked about the people that don't believe we went to the moon when they also say they're faking other spaceship to you have to kind of understand where they're coming from and they run through the Minions going to run through Hollywood center stage of the moon landing people had a right to do that but the difference is that they say I say that happened the truth is that we have a bunch of times chat with a Walt Disney correct Yahoo in the fifties just made up space they never know anyone ever went to space good conversation, I can't do this I don't know I don't know what they are about Jiu-Jitsu you never talk about how effective martial arts are just from what about you you don't exist and nobody exists so because you have to understand what about before when you adopt is what we talked about before when he was talking about the reason why he questions anything is cuz he's he's seen so many different things that turned out to be both fight Wars and shut like what that's awesome Tesla right healthy to be where you're at questioning everything versus buying everything all I'm telling you is is the stuff we have now a hundred years ago would be considered Magic way more sense to me and it's one of the things that Jamie there actually discuss when we talked about the Gemini 15 photo the famous photo of Michael Collins that turns out to be just a reverse of a photo of him on a training Mission or he's in the harnesses whole thing they used to be weird is that another group of ships, you know of me and told me about anything I just shouldn't do it another group of ships and this is not drama I was going to meet with him I met with him at the former NORAD command base this the Hilton outside Austin and he wouldn't tell me in like a week later his heart blow but he was ready to tell me should know it's real but there's more advanced and in here like letters of how she looking at me like a man guy like run the cameras Light number 3 and NASA like that for engineers freaking cute in Vietnam and black ops in Cambodia and he said he said well we lost a lot of people with those were clandestine operations I wasn't part of my soul compartmentalize they said you're right there were a bunch of missions beforehand cuz he was willing to kill 250 people to do that just to see if they can get someone we had mental ready to die over and over again for the one time at work and that's what pisses me off of Gus Grissom in those the original will be incredibly tragic if it is if they actually did go to the moon but they fake the footage because of the radiation so they release is b******* footage and nobody ever believes you know but you know how horrific that would be if you were a guy like Neil Armstrong and you do the footage is b******* but you actually had gone to the moon be like f*** and nothing was like people starting a little while he's was over there on wires and there's that other on trampolines like defeat 222c level on average is 10 feet of water about 6 in of stone there's dirt but why is the Sun so big on the Moon looks so much bigger on the horizon why is that why is it red the atmosphere whatever it is you get a bunch of chest x-rays right when you fly during the day because the sun solar radiation because you're above everybody knows you're in the mountains you're the worst summer less oxygen less dropping the movie efficiency of water and 6 inches of stone washed 35,000 ft of dust the filter on WOW is worth coming up that part of it it's bubbled into for glasses on the edge so you looking through all that atmosphere you look at through pollution you look through dirt everything that's amazing yeah we've got a weird situation huh a big ass 1/4 size Planet just floating just floating above us we stare at it what was the full moon tonight that is f****** weird there's a planet that's right there it's floating above us we stare at it but it's a full moon tonight that is f****** weird there's a planet that's right there last night missed your call</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> no bangs well because it's all taboo and then people let me tell you I have 100% doing DMT 100% communicated with something the question is whether that something was actually in my imagination or in my mind or that something was something that takes place in another dimension I don't know I can't be sure there's no way to put on a scales no other through its run through a test but what I do know is that it's the same experience okay Eric Mueller who know love Mancow Muller because he's the one guy willing to let me tell a story I've literally talked to I see a lot of people probably more than that cuz I've known for a long time he is a Christian but he heard about all this so he went down to a couple places in Central South America did it twice in the group and he's like well Alex I just don't believe in demons but I did see call Shane until I will see the same thing but I think it was a chemical reaction you don't have it if you everybody gets drunk we all think about what happened was in high school or college or what's going on with that we all have different experiences when you're taking hallucinogen and suddenly you're all see the same thing it just means it clicked off the part of your brain is a filters you crazy see if no idea there certain insects to just don't see anything there's a centipede or whatever and I didn't how do we know what they see what you don't know your right hand we we buy dissecting dead ones we have an understanding what sensors they possess and we can we think of a b or a fly sees like in a bunch of little like that look up The Vibes the difference is 35 years ago they had remote control rats with microchips they can send 500 yards of the alarm. Building close it with a camera on their top pay at 3 to write the difference is that why can't you parents that interdimensional being and learn something from it and be a better person because whatever reason it first it's all beautiful and sooner and Aztec base catnapping all the local tribes in killing whoever's the tallest of the smartest every time it gets control it starts murder and everybody and it always starts beautiful it always starts crate so you talking about ancient civilizations were the original eyes psychedelic drugs and they wind up killing everybody whenever Josh and the Shay we have to throw babies in the fires with a cut their hearts out we have to buy congenital true or false supposedly the mushrooms were used by the Aztecs so that they wouldn't resist the demo high on mushrooms from Chicago and they don't resist existence of true or false though they didn't use mushrooms makes the temple at other I forget how you said to con Tela con but in this one Temple I think they killed some insane amount of people after it was constructed ass after the tens of thousands they sacrificed tens of thousands of people that the ones that were actually working to build the temple once they can tell everybody and they didn't take it internally the mouth they would take enemas of dozens of Illusions and alcohol and so the priest would take a couple of drugs and then the priest wanted to communicate with the aliens and the aliens wanted blood and they also 400 persons were sacrificed in the ceremony in 1487 the Aztecs completed the temple and how do you say the temple name pull up to the top of it how do you say it's all over how do you say the temple name bananas, you go down there and you're walking around in the woods and the Mayan God goes the bones and they pick up and you're like it's not graveled if petrified bones are everywhere and so you would eat the meat and the most valuable meat was Warriors what would you want the ball throwing game but it went on for days they would kill you they killed you the ones who won were murdered this is the thing they used to think that they sacrifice to losing team now they realize the sacrifice the winning team had a bit about for a while Well site has been a long as f****** game ever he's going to you're going to interface it upload its brain and you look at their paintings it's all like spaceships and dials and they are perfect in the Spanish Museum Fortuna tears drawings of a two-year-old Spanish true or false smoke penis blood they did the one that what they did was soft but only the most skilled would sit there and brought them through and they would smoke the blood to their ancestor the lower the lower priests within guide sacred leaves and they would smoke the general blood of the high priest and then maybe talk to them</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> free powerful why do people misinterpret results with ancient texts over there like what you read Ezekiel like three burning Wheels land there's a blue firm gives me some of the plan that that that has been infested and God Must Destroy everyone in this an alien story about the wheel within a wheel holding off the ground in Hebrew and then the face of Shifting different creatures is it really only makes sense that unless they have a constant basis or if they'd if they came by themselves they came by themselves a long f****** time ago like if they were able to make Interstellar travel like 3000 years ago which is not that big of a leap if you think about us three thousand years from now we probably can do something like that right so if they were doing that 3000 years ago and they found human beings and these are the stories that we have these stories like Ezekiel and like there's a bunch of different ancient stories about contact with the skies you know the ancient Hindu text you can't buy herself yeah people say oh that's not real but its manifest and then go to Thousand Years in the future they have advanced technology don't send people anymore now he's an alien if you go back to the old days it was actually some sort of humanoid or a large thing like all the zecharia sitchin s*** the Comfort Inn in Marion tax there was a visitor to this planet 510 15,000 years ago if there was maybe more maybe there was a visitor hundreds of thousands of years ago that actually did genetic experiments on Lower hominids if that was really the case it makes sense that their technology would have increased far more rapidly Carlos is we are If there really are hearing it more and more they only put soulless people in charge who are compartmentalised nobody else knows who will carry this out we're able because we're Advanced look at this that there is no reality and God creates a whole new virtual reality gets life does all of it and then his genetic experiment by Rogue elements gets involved it's all right there don't you actually look at it and you expand on it and you're like oh my God this took me on a science fiction book and so they obviously think that's why they keep telling us all look piltdown man was fixed up nojo they do accelerated now something new they do the accelerated immunogenic program on this planet and Humanity what what is the Bible start with it says we are made in the image of God was it mean we don't have God's knowledge without God's advancement we are the image will what is it images ask and it's numbers it's a genetics it's the potential so we are the aliens Joe and everybody already knows this we are the aliens do you think that we are a product of alien intervention they took these lower Eminence May accelerate their evolution by applying their genetics do you know they say we're 97% chimpanzee but then actually getting the deeper genetics were closer to Pacer rats so I think that this was an environment built for us where the master genetic program and they're all subsets of us just for a backstory and that's what the glove was created the elves are biological Androids the grace and then there's other systems going on and no one knows his own Warfare psychological stuff no one knows the truth cuz it's it's working reality once you get to that level so no one knows we just nowhere advance but we are I'm obsessed with rifle powerful the globalist are obsessed the elites are obsessed because she reportedly obviously we've got some big giant Mission and maybe that's a program I don't know that pretty super-advanced but you can't put something out like a Spartans were their kids were seven that throw up two years of the woods you can't just put something I like like like like liberals you can get her very everything they're little assholes so this is like boot camp and training and they have to test us and do all this and basically this planet is what the people say it's a big testing ground for other things that are going to come and we are at we are God and I don't mean I'm God I'm already gone I'm a chief cuz you can see the potential yourself and Emma and Emma and the lower-level elves will tell you that cuz they already know you're badass but if they can trick a tadpole's going to go into Godzilla to do kill itself they're winning so use up so that you can attach the elves are tests on us to attack us and an empty the survival of fittest but there nothing there like consciousness of the universe is inter-dimensional space craft beyond that it was like a comment for my research and it it it it has it hasn't had as Corona Consciousness Consciousness he carries evil in the tail-end Consciousness as a location know there's this giant Consciousness has gone swimming in a giant system of survival of fittest that God has created godself okay looks like a comet so you got Gods concerts in all the good things that knowledge going forward but God knows everybody has to be tested so the tail goes out and at the end of the tail is basically evil that's what Christ says Get Behind Me Satan and it's always trying to test God and infiltrate up into it to sabotage damn they do pull the plug in this podcast is a good way to end this m*********** something at the f****** governments come in but you know they love you cuz you're so much dude trust me this is one of the biggest YouTube videos of all time but maybe they are describe what you saw do you have these experiences where the thoughts become patterns they become like geometric patterns that are moving through space and they change and shift but they're letting you know that they know all your b******* they see right through you and they walked through watch want you to relax yes there's a lot of that there's a lot of thought of creation I never referred to him as a not of this world not of our average think I would listen I would think it was aliens if it woke me up in the middle of the night and took me aboard our ship and that's why I experienced I would be 100% convinced that I went to an alien spaceship and I talked to these things the difference is how it was like to smoke it and then lay back and then experience that is like I expected that progression of of events but if I woke up in the middle of the night I was going to take a leak and light Shone down to the bathroom and they suck me through the window took me aboard a spaceship and I saw the exact same thing that I saw Wells High on DMT I'll be one hundred percent convinced that I was in contact with aliens the different the only difference is how I got there like I got there through a drug I got there through smoking something that's produced by the human brain that I knew was pretty safe no one's ever died of it I'm like let's see what happens in a while back group yes yeah I was just a psychic connection but it's beyond that you could argue on one person's a psychic leader they projected everybody else's mind but who's projecting that so that's the only way it's out this is why the Pentagon and play might not be someone projecting anything in your mind it might be your newfound ability to perceive things that you could the way I look at it like was just a psychic connection but it's beyond that you could argue on one person's a psychic leader they projected everybody else's mind but who's projecting that into them so that's the only way it's out this is why the Pentagon and play might not be someone projecting anything in your mind it might be your

		<div class="paragraph"> let me tell you what my deep research and Baisley vision is okay to talk about 12 Dimensions 11 known 12 E90 presents Owego State actually exist to say that is arrogance I won't say that but I have had dreams my whole life that come true and the weirdest thing like a lady drops a thing of pickles at the store 5 years I have the dream that one day I'm there and it's the one in the pickles break or or I want to know is this behind a building and all the sudden there's some dude in a purple and green striped shirt attacks me and 6 months later it happens and I mean it happens exactly so what do you think is going on if you don't mean all thoughts of yourself aside just just look at it objectively what do you think that is you could say that it's human programming and basic programming in the brain you think you're tapping into a timeline that maybe you can access what time rent one of the reasons why you can rant and Rave and and when you spew out information the way you do which isn't very impressive the way you can talk about the in 3 hours they get excited about time you do the majority of your programs entirely by yourself no telephone communicate that's like in the beginning of the thing we were talking about Sandy Hook I kept trying to slow you down I was like I'm not following you down this River you just hit this one rock want to talk about this rock I want to talk about the next Rock but you just keep going the way you think about things is your your chaining one thing to the next thing to the next thing to the next thing and for people who are not thinking the way you're thinking it could be exhausting but you trying to follow what you're saying about all but I'm wondering because of you telling me that you had these dreams exactly the way you drop them I know you're not full of s*** you're not a liar I've known you for a long time if that really did happen to you if this is your real life experience I want to know what the f*** that is you are you are you on the periphery did you have your finger on a membrane that maybe other people can't totally touch or occasionally just occasionally get a little peek through and get to see the other side you would have told me once or twice in your life who's to say that what your experience by being able to see these things that manifest themselves realistically in the future that this isn't what human beings will have 5 years from now or hundred years from now you can talk for a lot longer than both of us did people can do that you can't let me try to describe it and I know uses against who knows I don't touch it cuz it's that whole religion that can not talk about it by the time I was like three years old I would have this dream that God has cuz God knows everything is a super-intelligent omnipresent unlimited mentioned but God doesn't know where God came from God is like a virtual reality simulation as well and God every operation turning evil loose could lose everything show I would have these drinks but earliest memories like 2-3 years old or I would fly out to the edge of infinity and it was a it was a continual message find out where we came from find out what it is and it would just be this big giant spinning black Vortex like a black hole and then I would have to go into that trying to figure out what was going on and ever and I was just thanks and soldiers incredible frustration show then growing up and dealing with things in question politics and questioning all these other areas then having dreams that come true exactly and like knowing what's going to happen before it happens and then questioning it and then it never been wrong weird. Brightly crazy stuff man like like just so much stuff works becomes like you came with yellow you like dial it out and then you just reach that point where you don't even know what's real anymore because it's so crazy but then you she liked the mathematics of the whole system and you know it works it's not like you're so schizophrenic you talk about it you deal with it and actually works like now and you fight the system you automatically know what to do when you talk about something the president word for Worton repeats me Trump is what Freedom out word for word whole speech idiot savant have to do with the speech explain that Trump speech every other system that we say like think of this there's no one has no one heard there's no one Bird that's running all the birds is no one person is running all the people cuz it's all chaos even if we elect someone that they have the f****** people hate them everybody's in chaos with condo try constant power struggle are you so long you think they realised do you think that the idea of God God is literally afraid when organisms God is Not Just free will God is consciousness it's all the organisms it's every f****** technological innovation to tell the thing God might just be just like every other organism on the planet it's just something that's moving in a certain direction trying to protect itself and trying to procreate and trying to advance and trying to innovate and try to be better than it was yesterday that's on everything is doing every f****** animal to start out as a single-celled organism is Vibe create themselves necessarily that it didn't create itself with something created it slowly but surely there is a pro-human future and a pro Free Will future and the globalist</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I want to find one point that you had about that was really good you were saying that if you sent yourself you just like I just sent to myself a little bit just a little bit we were first of all we gave each other big hug we talked it out we're both happy that we're not angry at each other and then we start talking you made a really good point you said the thing is if you sent herself just 1% censor myself 1% how did they want them to make them happy and then they just going to keep moving it just got to keep moving it forward and you have court move the goalposts and providing with more money and giving you more things but keep moving in a certain direction and if you keep giving in to it they're going to have a hold of you and they can control you and that's on network television got started if you really think about what network network television is the reason why they don't swear and they don't have explicit content isn't because people wouldn't want to see it the reason is because the advertisers won't let them there's a hole aspect to it it's not it's not just hey you're the CSI guys or hey you're going to organize with sleeping Giants and a couple million people that call and threaten that attack anybody and then noticed show once you're done with me now it's Joe you better not have this person on or you better have that person on and show what is your soul what is your destiny worth and I always thought I was smart exactly what I was and that's what I'm getting at is the biggest Liars without people to know the truth I don't come up with some cold-blooded calculation about what I think should I Advance my personal life I really care about people and the process I've seen things wrong I've grown I've heard people I apologize that's true that's true what you're saying about you and this is one of these animals try to explain to people and people get mad at me for knowing you like I have a great time with that guy every time I see him I had a great time in Austin we had a great time with the UFC we've hung out at numerous comedy shows that have done in Austin I've done you were so if you've had a lot of fun together and so when when people get mad at you about Sandy Hook or about anything or just go even when you are mad at me I wasn't mad at you I was like I just got to talk to him it's one of the two of us to talk to each other guns on you just so you know it's like to be judged I thought that you probably never have no show was not attempt to get back on your I do listen to I knew that if I'd gotten to the point where you would that upset that I must have made mistakes to I'm not I'm not that person that sees things and always points in the other direction I pointed my some up f****** ruthless self critic ruthless I'm terrible like so I beat myself up about every thousand loved one word on stage and I'll see let me race that she'll be tossing and turning 8 years ago add and by the way I want you to pump Bitcoin which I believe in cryptocurrencies I believe it's the future we had a private seller Reserve it's on Fiat I'm not judging anybody I'm just okay be careful and I was so dumb back then don't even say so dumb I was not in the corrupt mindset the way the world worked like I knew how politics work and I knew how science word and I knew how crypto type your government and CIA stuff work but I was like never trying to get a deal for myself I had my own thing so that I look back Prospect where where that was going on so when I saw you was my Breaking Point go hey Alex Jones is full of crap George Soros was a victim of the Nazis in the Holocaust that's not what I said I didn't see her. I said that he wasn't a Nazi I go the story that I watch the interview and I don't know what he did I don't know the guy I don't know him I don't know I've know very little about him but what I remember from the story was that he was saying that when the Nazis occupied he was with his I believe it was his uncle is Godfather and took him around as a Christian and pretended he was a Christian where they were stealing from these Jews when they would take their and he just thought it was normal because he was 13 years old but he was talking about it he was shielded by this person so I would be willing to take his butt butt butt butt associated with and they said listen George Soros told me to tell you that he'd have been killed if you didn't to do that and that and that and that he did what he had to do run and I said you tell George if somebody put a gun to my head and said we're going to kill you if you don't help round up Joe Rogan's kids and play with a concentration camp I'd say oh yeah they were 26 it was you not to show take your property and then you don't go away I don't know I mean I don't know what happened in Romanian hungry but Joey what he was saying it was more because I don't know much about it inform me I'm telling you I don't know anything about it was incorrect if somebody tried to kill people that were trying to kill people he said on 60 minutes and then I learned your being sued cuz you did this is why he's finishing well I'm not going to stop saying it because of that I get he was in a bad situation the problem was to be play the clipping said it was the best time of my life it was happy making it was it was invigorating to be there with all this evil going on but I was with my father and I had faith in him and so we were able to do this and I went to the log and the records of him going over in French man and getting their money and he got the money is another I'm not running White Flags George Soros George Soros over through all these different government trying to crash the pound George Soros is that is the archetype of James Bond films and the fact that his money so unnerving a kid when I was like eight years old my mama he's like crashing economies and when I was a kid watching PBS maybe they rely means great George Soros was the international currency Speculator who overthrew government to governments like what are you do I'd literally know nothing Walmart she got hired brought the US he work for the CIA OSS before that in his view from his perspective George side I've had the former head of a Chevy got Jamie tried to crash the pound-for-pound anyway I told you they got him in Pig things you're saying I have to know but how do you know if you never research he ran the cuz I'm at the auction open years ago he ran the Marshall we got here George Soros break the bank of England make a lil bigger please in Britain black Wednesday September 16th speculators broke the pound it didn't actually break it but they force the British government to pull it from the European exchange rate mechanism joining the erm just want to Europe screwing up please all this to depart from the European currencies the British pound blah blah blah compounding the underlying problems inherent in the pounds inclusion in the ERM not seeing this where's the park with George Soros tells us to the pound but speculate is George Soros among them began heavily shorting the currency British government gave withdrew its ER at the ERM as became clear that it was losing billions trying to Bowie its currency artificially although was a bitter bitter pill to swallow the pound came back stronger because the excess interest in high inflation and cemented his reputation as the premier currency Speculator in the world now if your currency speculators know what you do though I don't know what a currency Speculator. Should I don't want to get into George Soros works for the people around our government and he's a guy willing to do at all and he's been very successful okay my point is two plus two equals four in my in my equation you don't fight the Nazis because you're 13 14 You Think You Can't you join them and he says he's talked to me about the investment ice done with someone else would have done it that's a quote it was happy making it if you help Round Up Jews and take the property don't say what happened but you don't talk about it so my point is him saying will you you think the way he describes it even is a problem it's problematic it disturbs you the ways describing there was happy making that it was not a big deal if I didn't do what other people have done it that's a problem what I'm telling you is I me to get off at the store hours is that if you divide 5 minutes over there on James computer do you think the way he describes it even has a problem it's problematic it disturbs you the ways describing there was happy making that it was not a big deal if I didn't do what other people to done it that's a problem what I'm telling you is I need to get off of the storehouse is that if you like 5 minutes over there on James computer either good job</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you are based on your psychic ability and on your IQ and then on your commitment to the program and so the program starts with will you go and check black people shuffling for a greater cause or will you do research programs on babies where we tell poor women that were born nurses have noticed now that babies disappear at Birth it's almost your baby. That's why I said it was a doctor of babies and love getting caught now very concerned with late-term abortions where is very concerned how much money do you think they get and get bitters with me doesn't notice the babies alive yeah you know how they engineered Tomatoes the last on the Shelf yes you can pull all this up California's passed it to keep babies alive and allow knows the governor goes we don't want about the future and maybe she keep Baby Alive a week maybe she's trying to get rid of baby is this a viable baby there's nothing wrong with this baby to not pass a bill for post-birth abortion should not kill livable post-birth viable babies already born can be killed if the biologic for I bet you can't Millions pull that up Jamie post about this but it says that he did it's been taken out of context. he said a month ago his first Froakie said that she the left is so compartment singer the last mainstream media whenever we're so censored now they're making their move right now who today million dollars to your charity of choice not to listen to me if you can prove that I'm making up at the governor said we keep babies alive after they're born we keep them comfortable and then turns out he's an organ harvesting thing and that's what they're doing so they keep babies alive Bernie for the black face they're using the blackmailing and they aren't as soon as he's really as soon as Trump and we all covered as soon as he tweeted he said yes we're getting rid of babies after they're already born you don't want none of that no. Figured out with George Soros putting it right now I think it does I'll take it doesn't start in people with you I mean I think I've dance around the capital spawn time today in the song that you wrote you at the f****** song about it one million-dollar I believe you listening to you the phone no they want the organs and so who gets two years ago and then they have a Chinese government in the US and they got the sucker Kathy Tran made her case for lifting restrictions on third trimester abortions as well as other restrictions now in place and she was pressed by Republican delegate about whether her bill would permit an abortion even as woman is especially dilating ready to give birth and she answered that it would permit an abortion at that stage of Labor do you support her measure and explain her answer Julianne. I certainly can't speak for delegate Tran but I will tell you one first thing I would say this is why decisions such as this should be made by providers of Physicians and the mothers and fathers that that are involved that are involved, there are we talked about third trimester abortion in these are done with the consent to Ababa see that the mother with the consent of the positions more than one position by the way and it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities there may be a fetus that's 9 Bible so in this particular example if a mother is in labor the infant would be kept comfortable infant would be resuscitated if if that's what they bothering their family desired and then the discussion wouldn't so between the Physicians and the mother so I think this was really blown out of proportion but again we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions we want the decision to be made by the mothers and their providers and and this is why Julie that legislators most of them were Men by the way I'll be telling a woman what she should and shouldn't be doing with her body and do you think multiple physician should have to weigh in as is currently require she's trying to live that requirement pieces of butthole weird is that she was told they were talking about resuscitating the baby and then we keep the baby alive than the decision will be made isn't that that's like euthanasia like you can't even turns out when I saw that clip a month ago cuz they had a debate about the bill front and they said yeah I will kill babies after they're born and they're debating its jurisprudence there's a law that you can't do that so this is not involved the medical system usurping if they can kill a baby after it's born cuz sometimes a deformed you know she is sometimes in the phone here's the key notice he said we were suscitate they don't consider you alive till the bioethics board says that you're a viable human and under the bioethics in Europe and of the UN now which is all knots above the EU was set up by the Nazis Volkswagen Volkswagen Hitler was a really bad dude but he literally killed babies that was 1934 and the final solution happened like 6 7 years later and so he sang cuz I got a big problem I got Undercover videos are keeping babies alive what blows up I'm up he doesn't so they've got to start getting it going now with Governor positions and people to go to the nurses are freaking out and drive away what's going on $1,000 who's playing in the chain of delivery just on time delivery organs worth a lot of money and show but but if you kill him on the spot for like why are we wasting this seven pounds of meat so she if they can keep them alive now they built these new Wings they built how to take the lives but it didn't resuscitate its flesh it's at least it's passed into a special Ward with doctors and make a few million a year and a little lash ball is kept alive and comfortable until all the orders come into planes land and they take the organs and they take the blood and they take the skin Joel you see how it work do you know why I don't know but see is a southern love invoice my dad do organ Harvesters in Dallas and he said don't sign your organ donor card they've got corrupt hospitals where if you get her totally viable they take your organs of cheese and Men Dallas Texas and Chicago caught killing people that were viable to take her organs I will let you know the problem is some of it makes sense because people figure out a way to rationalize a lot of things if you see a guy's manga with a car accidents but he still alive and you know you can sell the organs Parenthood workers laughing saying I made a million bucks yesterday eat last year it's incredible please just keep him alive longer will get 10 times the money when we get to 50 grand for baby cuz we got to kill them before they leave the building the mother. No there they talked her into it oh man Grandpa baby cuz we got kill him before they leave the building the mother. No there.

This is not my opinion this is the real research that I have heard that I have talked to Army generals commanding generals major generals General generals CIA everybody and they're all 100% And I thought it was a sigh out before and then I researched and I talked to hundreds of people that are not on here that make a film on this to take an Ayahuasca and DMT I'm not taking it and and it's unbelievable because I needed a hundred percent of San Francisco is the main project site literally have an alien base and they are literally communicating and they got like astronaut level people taking super hardcore levels of drugs and going into meetings with these things and making Intergalactic deals painting using a broad brush and what you mean by the government Rogue intelligence agency that they're using psychedelic drugs to communicate with inter-dimensional beings alright everyone who's done a high dose of psychedelic drugs has had this experience so everyone is listening to you right now who's done DMT or done 5 grams of psilocybin they know that this is a you have some kind of communication with something else that question is is that something else inside your psyche or is that something else a chemical doorway is there a chemical doorway Inside the Mind that opens up in the belief is that when you die and this is what the afterlife is that when you die your brain produces these chemicals these chemicals open up this doorway and this is the portal to the next Dimension so you're saying you're saying that the government is aware that they must be aware of this enough people talk about it they must have done experiments on it that have the courage to experiment with these things and try them themselves realize that this is such a profound experience that it is it's so alien that if an alien landed right now in our parking lot and a little gray man with big black eyes got out it would be nothing compared to what I've seen on psychedelic trips will be getting into the show the people you understand that I know about this for a long time and I just don't think people ready for it but a lot of folks who have low oxygen and and have Hulu and I hope reins well well who have your sleep apnea of a Big Macs big head show my whole life where every night was a DMT trip show I basically I don't just to town are again it's not I've seen everything well I believe that when you were dreaming it's most likely the same chemicals that are being released I'm not saying you're bad I never said you were the CIA I say the CIA is on record and everybody promoting hallucinogens of the sixties they admitted it was a plan to try to she would with the public and make them more suggestible but there's a larger program and then I kind of backed off because it kind of got out of control and actually created some the Ayahuasca DMT They promoted which good strong people that have got Compass don't have problems with the weak-minded stupid people and others cuz example this guy smart Erich Mancow Muller I told you I talked like a hundred people I talk to more people are going to do in these these DMT Ayahuasca trip outside Austin yes and I'm only showed he told me the same story everybody tells you living in Peru or being Costa Rica when did two trips down there and he said yeah we're sitting there and we take the Ayahuasca and then all these basically Elm aliens come out of the woods and we're all staying the same aliens we're all hearing the same thing Oscar and then all these basically elves aliens come out of the woods and we're all staying the same aliens we're all hearing the same thing and it's like for each three of us or whatever she and he goes but it was the drugs affect my brain no no a drug everyone see something different when you open a gate and now inter-dimensionally your brains already filtering out most stuff because you can't handle your eyes already sent a cat looks like a dog</div>

It was crazy as give me all these patents for mind control using wavelength should microwave and I'm sitting here looking at it and I'm reading it and I'm and I'm seeing it and the Baltimore Sun says the CIA is testing on cell towers wave links to call the public during crises I just had baggage on with Pat and talking about that what that explains his it's not that the microwave I somehow interface with the brain we already interfaced with a space and all these other magnetic fields everything else so they're all just testing this stuff and so everything they deployed at all either technology my dad was Beauty and 65 when he was in high school computers everything but it oh God he's doing that find one thing he did a chance me and make that his whole world that's what I'm telling you is it's been in the newspaper that the cell towers are being used for mind control someone over here to believe everything they see on Fox News yes okay yes trying to figure out what's real spacewalk for the first time and they're out in the universe and the whole planets under them and what are they going to do they have mind-blowing will imagine once you realize we don't know everything we don't understand it sinless and there's all this crazy crap people donut and it's humans learn more more as you become more advanced morphoses fixed on everyone in downtown so they can scientifically try to orderly carry this operation up but then I go wait a minute you're detonating over a hundred hydrogen bonds the upper atmosphere to see if you could ignite the atmosphere destroy the Earth I do but what I'm telling you is the same professors train people's the people that detonated those hydrogen bombs in the 60s they're dead Now does not we're not the only the same human beings I'm with you on most people you in some ways that everything evolves and things get better this is one of my argument about operation Northwoods that if they were able to push operation Northwoods and get it signed by The Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962 was it 62 - if they were able to do that and no one went to jail and no one got arrested for proposing that they were going to arm Cuban Friendly's and have them bomb Guantanamo Bay and blow up a Cuban jetliner text and obviously that was unchecked no one went to jail for that nobody got time for that the significance of the research is that although the cell phone power is low electromagnetic radiation can never List have an effect on mental behavior when transmitting at the proper frequency what is this article Jamie side of an American and Scientific American mind control my cell phone so it really does have an effect I didn't study on so there is so would you think that they're making this not notified last year 37-page CIA manual for the 1974 they were putting up cell towers that look like trees already testing at neighborhoods okay beyond that it's a microwave relay relay system they can manipulate and then the towers be more powerful so this is a device given to us by the gods okay given us by the technology that that the Breakaway government NASA has developed that you don't just think they made up themselves right what do you mean who do you think made it up while we're ready to get to it I want list</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Sandy Hook you up no problems I really do believe that I believe there'll be problems I think people would look down on you and call you a right-wing lunatic and also to other things which they don't even know when I knew you when I first knew you you were getting arrested for going after George Bush I remember when Jordie you are not a right wind I'm a question and you were asking a question that was running for president as a Republican and you you were getting arrested for questioning CFR to my point is you weren't you weren't a tie to a party you were trying to find a truth and I don't know your pregnant when I align with Trump that's when all hell broke loose yeah that was part of it I think that was definitely not in awhile talk to Trump. Jr. was on Tucker Carlson last night were talking about me and they don't have to be strong and the fact that they use me as a way to start the cashless society and then and then and then I imagine you're never supposed to block somebody from banking if they have I had an a-plus-plus rating with my shopping cart and bank accounts I had for 22 years and Banks looking quite frankly never seen anybody with a credit rating everyone to charge batch with our shopping cart people do that was that mean chargebacks who does the ratings The Secret rating system for like Taliban Al-Qaeda the mafia they give the bank executive two days before PayPal bandage they put a hate designation of the Southern Poverty Law Center Shane I'm basically a terrorist call you a hate person now that means a terrorist in Interpol show all over the Western World I am listed and we would send documents out of England and out of the US that I can't believe it they had terrorist and that's how they took five of my sick bank account and got me down to one bank account with perfect credit Shang you cannot take money on your shopping cart and porch where I come your product books whatever you you are not of him, because you are a terrorist and what do they use to Define terrorist hateful person that you promote hate no juries the global Chinese social score that's what they're all testing for here this is what we were talking about this very important this is actually dangerous this is actually dangerous to give people's ability to Define p without any strick Ridgid qualification without anything you can point to on faith out of prison and sell t-shirts but if I was Charlie Manson specials on on on Hitler has to say he's a bad guy well why can't you read Alex Jones other side because they have found what I talk about is effective against people thinking and they want it shut down because we we relaunched populism enforces done this Battalion test 1776 worldwide read the sensor I control the populations in the nose and I talked to him so mad at me and I made a huge issue to Trump and I sent reports the present I know he got and that's what happened on that Sunday night when they said that's it we're done with Joan we have to take him down because I got investigations going at the National Security level sending big reports the president through law firm of lawyers and AP and then the Articles which he wasn't getting where China is given of the code keys by last year and is moving their database are all the code Keys them and given to the Chinese government and applesauce or just part of being there and Google's building dragonfly project with a social credit score to get you off the air and a sensor and to take away your ability to make income not because of that but using that as an excuse because of the other things you do like targeting things like Google and talking about things that you talking about we were there in China and China's allow they're allowing time to censor the population Google I know someone who used to work at Google I should say their thought process was that Google is going if they don't bring Google to China in the center form they're going to copy Google this was the real the real worried because China copies everything I mean their intellectual copyright law over there true but if this is what they're saying I'll just get some apple juice in your system Fela they were thinking this is what I was talking to a woman who was a very high-level executive into saying that they're going to steal it if we don't work with them they're just going to steal Google and and take the code and make their own version of it so them as a business or like this is inevitable they're going to do it anyway we're just going to give in to their censorship to Matt's I don't agree with it I don't think it's a good idea but I don't know what I would do if I was Google what should I do for China you're dead on what that person told you when I had the globalist 15 years ago 20 years ago try to buy me often the air you know whatever I choose all that when I did all that what were they trying to do who's turn the volume up join this help save the planet do all these big things but I got the same speech when he was in high school rtut it planned to tell you about that later but if you don't join us then the bad guy was Nationalist and and capitalists in our own CIA Declassified left us the Ford Foundation that's what about the CIA helped put the tricomp Empower it took him decades to get running water in toilet they have no environmental standards no rules that had all of our investments they've been built up because the Chinese, Clute over the world with one when you go and you were in Shina they make you become

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yes Alex Jones or Alive loud could it be back for the second visit good to be here man good to see you we've got going on which led to just a lot of talk to drive him and then we got to do another podcast and we cleared the air on the phone we decide to clear the air more in a podcast there's a lot of things going on I told you a long time ago that I would have you back on and in the interest of being completely honest there's I was hesitant to do it not because I didn't want to talk to you but because of just the amount of b******* that I get from people to get angry that you and I are friends you know that why give that guy a platform that's the big one platform that's the big one but you and I've always had a good time together was that we've always had fun together are only problems have always been when we're not like if you're talking about me or if I'm talking about you not if we're talking to each other it's the distance has been the problem of communication the lack of communication has been a problem the thing that people are upset about you the things we want to talk about like quick to get it over with for a knock-knock quick but just to get it front up yes is the Sandy Hooks guess yeah so your take on it just give me your take on it first off because it's always misrepresented I believe mass shootings happen and they're real tragedies and I believe Parkland happened and you believe Sandy Hook app absolutely and now just last year and he sending people to Parkland parents houses and there was no video no audio wasn't true I think I said I believe Parkland happened so I'm not going to be the mass shootings and I'll guy I have been branded as the Sandy Hook Diamond imagine a Final Cut Pro video editing timeline you go back almost feel the seven years ago and the internet how did the guys on Prozac in a mental patient which was my listeners and other start sending me all these anomalies and things and later turn off Family one actor it and then I just moved on from it okay I didn't kill those kids but now people don't know Adam Lanza killed her kids it's me I think the majority of them are angry because the narrative has been that you're sending people to the Sandy Hook families host homes responsible for these people getting harassed because you said on your radio show that it wasn't real yes there is it happened yes I did but now you do think it's real because I learned some of the anomalies were not accurate that's a problem with all this conspiracy s*** right cuz the conspiracy theory stuff the people that want to believe they believe in conspiracies with everything and I think there's a certain force and we talked about this just a few minutes ago because you are now saying that it happened they thought that you'd been compromised a certain percentage of people exactly that people have is some sort of a staged event is trying to take them down or control this or mind control that that's a big factor in a lot of this conspiracy theory is mental illness when I started saying that I'm Beau Bridges or that I'm Jeff Bridges or that I am your little Bill Hicks and people in restaurant screaming Matthew Bill we know it's you and it's kind of like Dan Rather the guy threatening a signal incubators ghost narek War but I kind of realized a few years ago that I kind of had my own mild psychosis and it when you've been lied you to the media and the culture so much over and over again everything then starts becoming automatically you're sure it's fake and everything you she fits into that whoa there's a certain percentage of people that are way off on the Spectrum where they believe everything is fake and there's people that believe everything I hear is true I mean you should be you should be questioning you should have the right to do it but but somewhere in the middle and so I questioned it when people brought up on the Internet push me to keep covering it I probably 20 times in the first few years it happened and then as soon questioned it not being staged I got a tax so much that I said screw it mass shootings happen I believe it happened but then media would call me or interview me and say okay but tell us the anomalies why you question they were getting me to say it again not that have the right to question it but they they thought it wasn't me here to figure out what's going on so when Hillary few months before the election gives us huge faces of Alex Jones has a dark heart he knows Sandy Hook kids died but he says they didn't any sensible their houses he's the worst kind of world I never see anybody the houses but I apologize was taken out of context but I am sorry for the families please stop saying that I'm saying it didn't happen please stop saying I'm sending over to his house cuz then what happened when they put it on every major TV channel local TV channels radio Alex Jones Sandy Hook and you put in a title a certain amount of people just going to click on it Alex Jones is still pushing a Sandy Hook conspiracy theories one that I saw just two days ago exactly and they think I owe you know it's like looking for the Mothman or something they're all running up there in the media saying and in my name and I'm staying no I believe it happened years ago and shows in I'm getting the blame in the attacks of the demonization of the threat for what the corporate media is saying over and over again that I'm saying that it didn't happen and the families are getting the threats and the family is it going to be in tax and the families are getting called crisis actors oh my God it absolutely but again I legitimately didn't think my show is as powerful as it was so that I wasn't retrospective Lino's looking everything I was doing as much as I should nobody's perfect as you get older you growing you learn things but I just began to realize about three years ago that they're making my identity not being a nationalist not being a populist not being a free-market guy they're making my whole identity Sandy Hook and another going to sue me then yes but says about 10 before I ever got sued I said I believe Sandy Hook happen it's not my daddy I barely ever covered it stop redby understand that's not what they do. Trying to make it even worse but they're not trying to make your identity they're not trying to Define you or do some sort of a documentary biography on your life they just finding something that people want to pay attention to this is one of the problems with with news coverage today is that they find things that people want to pay attention to and they focus on them out of did they say that I'm making money off Sandy Hook when when the newspapers in the publishing houses are using me as a way to put out that incendiary hurtful thing also be hurtful I'm saying stop it because everything they do radio stations, newswars.com but reaching New People's very hard and then now that I've been silenced the mainstream media can say whatever they want show about you about me and I can't respond to this is where you and I kill the families of Parkland please just kill the parents there's no free speech for killing parent and I'm like dude do not say that I'm going to get killed I mean I have never said nobody died at Parkland I sure tell its they kill their parents let's let's take the step-by-step I'm sorry I wanted to give you an opportunity to communicate and clear the air and talk and some of the s*** that you and I talked about earlier there's a bunch of things going on one there's it's a story that attract people's attention write a story of a guy who sang that people didn't get killed when they did get killed and it's horrific for people to look at it terrific people think about the Drone children will not only get murdered but then someone would accuse them of being crisis actor so then they start pushing that story and that story becomes something that they make money off of which is really in in some way it's kind of ironic they keep the story in the news and they keep getting clicks off of you and misrepresenting some of the things that you said I'm not even defending myself people learn stuff as you get older hindsight your life but why did I do that I used it whatever was a big hot thing on the internet I would just debated cuz it was interesting but that's what I wanted to get to you you were doing the show and then the show you're on the air hours and hours a day and you're ranting about all these various things is this is it fair to say that you weren't really a hundred percent of where what kind of influence you were having and that way but if you did know you would have phrase things differently and done things differently and and I was covering what other people were saying I was not the first the 10th the hundredth of 10,000 you're reading about on the internet there's a certain amount of people that think that there's a conspiracy even when it's just a plane crash even when it what would it feel in the blanks any sort of national traffic like on I-5 support people's right to question and I understand because there was so much lying and corporate media by governments and end-stage the event that are admitted Declassified that wants people see that one thing was staged then everything else must be staged and then I have been on the receiving end of I support people's right to question and I understand because there was so much lying and corporate media by governments and end-stage the event that are admitted Declassified that wants people see that one thing was staged then everything else must be staged and then I have been on the receiving end of literally thousands of made-up conspiracies which you laugh at until people in a truck with gun show up</div>

I believe there's a weird sick irony in the media that says that I'm the one that put generated Sandy Hook didn't happen when I wasn't too thin in my name popularize it to a level of like they put out more than the other problems going on for years everyday you're thinking this because it's about you so because it's about you it becomes a primary point of focus because it's affecting your life and something you're concentrating on what part of the problem with the way we do news today anything that generates interest I need of the honestly if the media really cared they probably would have never talked about it and they're probably never brought it up that we had a real charity sixties and seventies that weren't staged to go back and look at them like the weatherman all that stuff in it and that the government to me it didn't cover it was a long time ago that means different countries yeah okay let's try another country's they don't print the name of mass Shooters in the newspaper cuz they don't want people to get attention for that mean some different contraceptives years or so and I realized it once I saw a bunch of Declassified States like North Woods or like gladio or Lionel</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> well there's a there's a movement going on in this country right now that the social justice movement and it leans in that direction that people don't want to look at things for how they are they want to look at things for how they want them to be that just I just don't understand you cannot legislate that everything is going to be equal for everybody because everybody's not equal I'm sorry they're not equal they may be equal in terms of their value is a human beings yes but they're not equal in math skills they're not equal in how fast they run they're not equal in creativity they're not equal everybody has their own value but that doesn't mean they're marketable skills in an open Society in an open market are going to be the same now it's ridiculous the story about a woman who was guarding the White House she was the Lone guard at one of the doors in the White House in some crazy man broke in and knocked her to the ground and just ran through the White House and he was running around inside the White House for like 3 minutes before they finally some off-duty secret service agent tackle this guy I saw like what the f*** that people think that a woman can do everything a man could do like a woman making a Magneto is that true and some woman he was in that crowd economy stores like he asked that doesn't make any fucken sense here's why doesn't make any sense because a man can't do everything a man can do I go look I've met Shaquille O'Neal and his dick is where my face is and if the White House is experiencing a shakatak I'm the wrong person save the world guess what I'm getting in okay I love my family but if it's between me and get elected as know where they going to be able to stop me I love them to death but I'm a man and their women and if there's a woman guarding the White House I don't care who she is I'll f*** her up it's not going to happen this is crazy but this someone had this idea that they would put a woman in charge of a very physical job you should have a giant man with a violent temper and he should be on okay cuz this is the guy that's keeping bad people from the f****** president I don't understand it just seems like you got to find your own lane I mean yeah you don't want to put me in the NBA. Physical things in particular women and then is also mental things everyone has a chance to work at CERN right everyone has a chance to work at the Large Hadron Collider including people that have no idea about physics whatever real time these equations work that's what I mean about finding your own Wayne yakyuu I can't add two and two and get five every time I'm just not good at math but I'm good with words I can talk I can read fast I can comprehend well but I am not good with math so I got myself into a lane where I talked for a living I read I talk I it's qualitative not quantitative I can accept that I'm not suited for that I don't feel bad about mice because of that once you do something you're good at it you can accept not being good at other things it's much easier if you find a thing that you're good at whether it's gymnastics or singing or painting whatever the f*** it is if you could find a thing that you're good at it'll make you be it'll give you a feeling of self-worth and you won't need to be good at everything you can accept and you can enjoy other people being good at things as well a personal truth but I found a currency because at that time in my life I was a pretty decent athlete for this small school I was going to so that was my currency so now it didn't matter what was happening at home because I got Strokes for being able to jump high and run fast at school so that became my currency so now when I compared myself to him okay maybe my home life wasn't as good as his but I could run faster and jump higher so that became my currency so okay that level the playing field for me and you all would like you said find what you're good at at a given time and do what you're good at find something you love find something you're passionate about and that you could also excel at and if you can work it out where it's your vocation and your application you love doing it and you get paid for it then you're just double blessed yeah it is and if I just think if you're in your life and there's you don't have something that you're passionate about I mean I don't mean that in a cliche Quay if there's not something where you wake up every day and there's nothing in your life that you're excited to do man you need to go back to the drawing board cuz if it be if all you're doing is just grinding it out everyday go to a job you don't like do tasks you don't care to do and come home to a home you don't want to come home to and wait to get them do it again the next day you're burning daylight what the hell is existence is that I just I don't I don't care if it's a gardening or or or Athletics or something find something you're excited to do different things with that very purpose of finding something that you love to do something for something healthy that's not illegal it's not going to be high risk or something you can do that's not going to kill you or put you in jail if you can be excited about yeah and I think it's one of the most important things to do when your parent is to try to expose your kid has many different things as possible to find those things for them Dubois you know and you know one of them really well and I did that growing up because my dad never took me hunting a single day in his life he never took me fishing a single day in his life he never took me camping a single day in his life he never took me to the lake and never took me skiing voting anything so I was I took them to all of those things I didn't know I had no clue what I was doing but I took them turkey hunting duck hunting deer hunting but skiing go skiing camping I did it all and to see what they like let him pick and boy when you don't know what you're doing as a dad that's a b**** yeah we just little things like you will you go camping and you don't realize that sit in your tin up on the side of a hill cuz even if it's like 8 or 10 degrees is a bad idea realize that sit in your tin up on the side of a hill even if it's like 8 or 10 degrees is a bad idea if you got to get on flat ground let me look bad to me but it didn't look like it was</div>

game and he says he plays a movie in his mind of the entire game before he plays it cuz the football game you're going to have 11 or 12 possessions during the game just to have football games football 11 or 12 times news saying I'm going to carry that ball three or four times for possession and he knows which place he's going to run you can run him through his head he would see it even know who was

a military hero he just sat quietly in his home and when the situation came about it revealed who he was and I think that's what happens I think if you've got a hero they just sit there sit there sit there situation reveals who they are I don't think it makes him a hero I think it reveals that they're Heroes and I think that's what happens to people they they are who they are until they get them in the opportunity comes along and they're going to show you who that is they may show you their coward or they may show you that they've got the focus to hang or they may show you that there a hero but life circumstances are going to come along and going to show you who somebody is I think what's also interesting is when someone does get revealed to be a coward they can become a hero it's very hard it's very hard to get past the the memory of you being a coward will tell you I think that's true and self-worth but nobody ever talks about what it really is or how we get it and I think I think about it in terms of self attribution because you know how you form opinions of other people like if you look at this guy and you maybe you work with this guy and so you watch him across a couple years and maybe this guy shows up to work everyday and he's there 15 minutes early and he unlocks the place gets every ready put the coffee on Hazard desk ready he's all buttoned up and man when the bell rings he's ready to go and you just learned that this guy's buttoned-up ready to go Dependable never misses he's always there so you a tribute certain traits and characteristics of him based on your observations of him and you experience of him based on that you assign certain traits and characteristics to him but I say that's exactly the same way we form our own self-image our own level of self-worth we watch ourselves go through life and we watch how we handle certain circumstances and situations and that's why I say overindulgence is one of the most Insidious forms of child abuse known to Parenting it's not the worst it's just Insidious because if you overindulge your children and do everything for them you never let them observe themselves Master their environment you never let them step back and say wow I did that I built this I overcame that I handled this I did that and so that's the same way we make our own self-image and level self-worth we watch ourselves overcome the third grade we watch ourselves stand up to a bully we watch ourselves handle a test with a information that intimidated us and we watch ourselves make it onto the little league baseball team and actually get a hit when we needed to or we watch ourselves get onto the debate team and actually argue something successfully whether it's academic or athletic or musical we watch ourselves do it and so we go back and say hey I did that I a tribute to myself the ability I can hang I can do this I can rise to the occasion or we watch ourselves fold pup tent in the wind storm and say I can't hang I don't have it and we make those attributions to ourselves and so we shrink from The Challenge for the rest of our lives until like you said it's hard overcome that and something pushes you up until you finally observe yourself overcome something and I think that's how we form our level of self-esteem and our identity about who we are and I don't think most people think about that good a look back how did I how did I get to be Joe Rogan as I sit in that chair you have a self-image you have a level of confidence and ego strength a level of self-worth that's attributable to things you've watched yourself do or not do achieve not achieve overcome or whatever throughout your life and in I think to know yourself you have to know what those things are I think you're 100% right and I think for children participating in they're going to test you so critical giving them this opportunity to realize it did the there's a line between success and failure and then you could push through that line you could you could become successful at something and watching kids at that's why I think sports are so important for children I think that's one of the things about having these participation trophies for kids that just goes down as an environmental non-event something to do it's also psychologically it's coddling it's very is very damaging for your potential education that you would get from that situation the bad feeling that you get when someone scores on you is motivation for you to be better at defense is that not everybody is meant to be an ass Elite so okay look good go do something else be good at what you're good at and if you really want to do it well you got a long road it's a greased he'll start running everything's not for everybody so find what you're good at and watch yourself achieve in that lane you know that's like I can't carry a tune in a bucket I can't even Play No instrument I can't sing I can play a radio that's got a big on off knob that's it and so I don't try I'm just not good at that so I go in the lanes that I can do stuff and observe myself in that but I think you cheat codes if you don't let them Reserve themselves faced adversity in overcoming absolutely and it's also an interesting lesson to learn that life isn't fair and then if you're a kid and you're playing basketball with a fifteen-year-old LeBron and you're my height you go huh you know maybe wrestling's not for you either you know maybe maybe you we need to do something about your body before you engage in any sort of a combat sport you'll they did an experiment back in the did something called teaching machines have you ever seen that it was a short. Time but think they took students in the class where they put the steps of learning the information so close together that there was never a failure experience it would say like the War of 1812 happened in 1812 then the next thing would say the War of 1812 happened in blank you feeling 1812 I mean come on potted plant could get that do they put it together and they would teach the information and they would teach it to criteria where you mastered the information you had it 100% And they said wow this is great everybody learned it so everybody made a hundred everybody got the information they truly did learn it there's no question about it they learned information and so they did great then they took him out of that program and put them back in the regular classroom and the first time they came questions they didn't know the answer to the first time they didn't get a hundred they came apart like a cheap suit they Panic they didn't know how to handle adversity they didn't know how to handle it when they didn't have the right answers they didn't learn how to not be perfect and so they scrapped the whole program cuz he said you can't do this because that's not the way life is and if you're not teaching them how the real world works you might as well teach him to go on red and stop on green and then give him the keys and put them out in like cuz that's not the way it works and those kids were absolutely screwed up when they got into a truly competitive environment you can't be success only doesn't make any sense it's not healthy it's not good for you if you don't learn from it mean that the whole idea about school is your supposed to be setting kids up for the future he supposed to be teaching them not just information but teaching them how to learn and how did yeah that worries me. You know I read that story not long ago when you students I think it was at UCLA and law school complained and got a professor either disciplined or fired because he required them to take a counter argument over something controversial like Ferguson he said I want you to show you that you're all on the point of view now I want you to prepare an argument for the other side and they all said that's that's upsetting to a Swedish squish can't do it and I went to the administration and complained why that's crazy because all you have to do as a lawyer you may have to represent someone who's done something you don't agree with if that's what you want to do for a living right do it they went to the administration and complained why that's crazy because you may have to do as a lawyer you may have to represent someone who's done something you don't agree with if that's what you want to do for a living right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and thought me I had Pam on and we both worked a lot in deception detection and interrogation techniques and stuff and so just and it came right at a time when Jesse Smollett is in the news about you telling the truth is you're not telling truth and then here we have this conversation about you think immediately when you heard that story I was very suspicious f*** that guy that use real nobody was just too much like a movie with a bad movie I mean it's nine below zero and two people are lying in wait just in hopes that he might come by at 2 a.m. I mean now he's saying is some untreated drug problem so he's trying to carve out some path to explain his bizarre behavior but there are very very very specific why behaviors that people can't really control and I can what kind of stuff well for example when when people are really desperately trying to convince you they're telling the truth they'll do a lot of times what it called convincing statements rather than just telling you what to do to didn't do well do convincing statements like you know me like somebody somebody stole the petty cash in the office if you know me I give more money more money than was stolen Fielder this convincing you this is this nice guy and then they'll have any of the wrongly accused with someone do with their wrongly accused of the wrongly accused they'll look you straight up in the eye and tell you I didn't do it and if you ask them what do you think should happen to somebody that did an innocent person will say I think they should be found and then you should be held fully accountable to the extent of the law somebody is guilty I don't know I mean people make mistakes how do you get a second chance do you worry that in coaching that you're essentially coaching Liars by telling people this kind of stuff and someone who does steal the money you know it'd be able to kind of like a it's not for amateurs and when you there are some things that you can tell people to watch for but one of the things you do there's somebody that you suspect is you increase their cognitive load doing the interrogation and there's no way you can prepare for that how how you do that well you plan a virus for example is there any reason somebody would have told me that they saw you near that cash box about the time it went missing I'm dumb people talk at a hundred 25 words a minute they think at 12 to 1400 words a minute now it takes you 5 5 Seconds to tell me know you took the money if you were nervous right now if you didn't take it you know you didn't take it you don't need to run scenario through your head to think who could have seen me what's been I mean I didn't see anybody one millisecond to say absolutely not have you ever been wrong before we see someone is guilty oh sure because if if you really want to know for sure if somebody is guilty or innocent you need to invest a lot of time you need to get a baseline on what they normally look like talk like feel like and then knowing that Baseline you didn't need to compare how they're behaving on TV so just walking by the screen and seeing it you might see things that would ordinarily be light behave it could just be part of their personality so if you're going to really make a judgment you got to put a lot of time in and figure it out and what you should do before you decide you're going to be a human lie detector is do your homework and you don't try to figure it out objectively before you figure it out behave early Miata do your investigation find out if somebody took the money and you'll find out where they were and you look for fingerprints do this do that mean you're really objectively figure it out before you rely on these things and so unless you get a Baseline and get one-on-one with him and spend a lot of time then you can't be you can't be really certain that you know whether they're telling the truth or whether or not it's it would be fine if it was that easy and that some people are pretty obvious when people are guilty they tend to plead and cry and then when they're not guilty they tend to get angry when they're accused people that are wrongly accused are generally irate from the beginning till the end I mean every case is different but if you're wrongly accused that person is going to be pissed off from the minute you accuse them till the end because it's like their self-righteous like I didn't do you're saying I did screw you yeah and they don't take a step back and when you eat you see people they they do these convincing statements and they're pleading for you to believe them and then anytime somebody says now in all honesty usually the next thing out of their mouth to lie Joe honestly as opposed to everything else you've been telling me why we bracketing this one out is all right or if they invoke the deity as where's my God God as my witness and I don't know whether I have not done what I said you need to do with Jesse Smollett but I do know when he went to the shed at he said you all know me I swear to God I didn't do this and then be there like three or four of those kind of statements in like two or three sentences there is another one today a guy loses house on fire and think in Chicago and said he's a gay fella said was a hate crime and then they caught him a lot of that going on you know lot of fake crime very strange that sometimes people accuse people of something and someone will say why would why would someone make something out why would someone turn themselves into a victim is a lot of you get a lot of attention a lot of love I think there's a lot of false accusations and false attacks and is a lot of real ones but man when the false ones, but it just does a giant to service to everybody there's a fair amount of research is to why people do these hoaxes and prickly hate crime hoaxes and one of the primary motivation course it's sympathy and attention and all that but one of the interesting reasons that written research is that they really feel like it's emblematic of how the system treats them over all this is just a dramatic example of it and I feel like I'm treated this way anyhow so they're just discriminated against us I'm put down this is just stay focused example of that so I'm really not lying I'm just role-playing how I'm over all treated so they justified in their mind if they're just going to bring all this treatment into one example to bring it into focus and so while it's a phony deal it really is truthful representation of what their life is really like they justified in that way and that's a deep psychological put it in your mind that way it's just strange to because it gives people this this is just giant public show to watch now a lot of town two people are f****** crazy well if somebody said that somebody says it's really talented singers and actors were the weird kids from high school that win drama and I'll but they did about on stage and he's like guess what it's not f****** normal to be able to just cry because you could just cry and pretend something's wrong and cry as they that's crazy these are crazy people you really can't go to a certain place if you don't have a little of that in you my dad used to always say when he's working with patients you take out that oh boy I can't stand about me you say you can't see it in them if you don't have a little levity in you yeah yeah it is a hundred percent reason that that is a thing that Rising the craziest about weak people I'm so terrified to seeing weakness in and then just just just just being pathetic I'm so terrified and seeing that in myself I see it in other people noticed it smells I smell like a drug-sniffing dog like are there it is</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> people Champion like I talked to Tony Romo right after the Superbowl about Eastern Illinois University so I got nine students or something is a little bit of University and he turned out to be quarterback of America's team for 14 years set all kinds of records and then goes to the booth and becomes a number one color analyst and television mean champion champion champion y I like asking those questions you can't hear people talk what do you say to young people about that what made you a champion are you going to let your kids play football but with all this CTE and stuff what what do you say I'm at I like having those kind of conversation did the same thing with Shaq and Charles Barkley and different people what did he say about what makes you a champion for him he said that he has this didn't you want that kind of swagger sort of person that you came in cocky like he was going to own the field and own the game but inside he said he had this absolute drive that if he didn't win he couldn't live with it it's like if somebody thought that you played the game somebody beat them beat him that gif the idea that that person went home thinking that they were better than him that they could beat him that he just couldn't eat sleep pink until he got back and owned it again and got back to it he said he just is this drive to win and so he would mean he said he would be out at 1 in the morning in the dome throwing a pass that that route got intercepted he got jumped on that route and he be trying figure out why on Thursday and practice he saw what he needed to see why didn't he see it on Sunday and he would analyze and analyze and analyze until he could get there until he could do it until he could win if you just had to drive to win Super unhealthy Obsession they all share that Michael Jordan had that I mean we've talked about that several times on the podcast so many people that are extreme winners there's psychotic in there except session with winning that's all they want to do they lose they could date date it's almost insufferable they almost can't deal with it I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing but the difference between winners and losers his winners do things losers do not want to do they will get up in the middle of the night they will do this they will do that they feel it more they just do things losers don't want to do that pay a price losers just don't want to pay yeah he's not worth it who sings losers don't want to do that pay a price losers just don't want to pay yeah and it's just not worth it and every winner has been a loser winner</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> these all these folks that are on medication today I mean how many of these people do you think legitimately should be on medication I mean is it something you can access you know I can't answer that and terms I'm sure there's research of people how many people are on medication but in my personal experience most of the people that I see on medications in my opinion don't need most of the medications they're on now and that's just anecdotal as my opinion he asked me to hang a research survey or study to support that I can't hand it to you or I can point you to when I just tell you after 45 years in this experience I see people that are on medication they've usually seen someone for 6 or 8 minutes and said you know I'm really feeling kind of down yep here's some Prozac use this here's that they give it to him and I don't even really ask why and they just give it to him because medicine has become a high-volume business and that's not necessarily the doctor's fault I mean the way that it's now funded and Medicare and Medicaid you got to turn them and burn them and now you can't stay in business and so it's a high-volume business cuz they don't have an hour to sit down and don't take an hour to sit down talk about it well let's find out what's going on is there a reason like I said this guy's got five parts of his life that have gone down or woman is got me all three or four areas of your life that have really gone down in quality then they should be having poor mood so why masks that let's come up with an action plan and change it so most of the people I see on medication not all but most of the people I see or on too many medications in too high a dose or either don't need it at all and I'm really bothered by polypharmacy that's where I really get frustrated but it it's not the norm today though it seems like more people are treating this you know air quotes depression issues if it's a medical disorder like like diabetes or yeah and look for a lot of people that works I mean yeah people of mood elevator and they say I feel better and then maybe they change their life maybe they move their life into a more positive direction they can wean themselves off of it because one of the things about depression for example using as an example is you get what's referred to is psychomotor retardation there's a there's a lessening in activity level and I think old sayings get to be old sayings cuz her profound like you not going to get hit if you're not swinging well if you're depressed and so you think slower less actively you behave less actively your chance of getting rewarded goes down right you don't get out there and you don't mix it up socially is much you don't apply for jobs as much you're not as productive on your job is much so you're less likely to get most likely get rewarded well maybe you go take a pill and it lifts your mood up so you get more active and so now you can start getting pats on the back you start getting people to engage with you more so that lifts your mood and that takes care of it so you took the medication short-term your lifted back up in your okay short-term it can be an alternative but I've seen people on everything from opioids to mood elevators for years and that's where you lose me. Don't get it yeah I know people have been on things since they were five years old yeah they're in their forties and then you have wastebasket diagnosis like ADD and ADHD where what used to be a spoiled brat is now add or ADHD so they start prescribing Ritalin neocortical stimulants like Ritalin and if you give a does not need a neocortical stimulant a stimulant you're really going to throw him off the charts now cuz you're you've got a normally active brain that you're now making hyperactive so you're creating a problem that didn't exist before you give the medication because you didn't do the proper diagnosis yeah I had my old neighbor it's insanely common not chemically babysit your children and who knows where these kids going to be 20-30 years from now and we were just looking at this rash of people being treated for these ailments are quotes and then we're not seeing how this all turns out in the long run and how much damage was doing these people that are clearly psychotic schizophrenic delusional that without medication or absolutely impossible to manage but if you put them on antipsychotics and so you can lower their delusional Behavior their hallucinatory behavior so you can now have a meaningful conversation with him so they can respond to talking therapies it makes all the difference in the world and where those antipsychotics you would be lost without them so there are some medications for some disorders that are absolute Miracles that without them you wouldn't be able to do the work you need to do to get the person back where they need to be pushed back from a lot of these positions from the establish medical community sometimes but mostly when you talk to people about it hopefully they agree with with what I'm saying I mean most people will agree that you need to be thoughtful about prescribing medications and that medications are too readily administered I mean that's certainly what we've seen in the opioid epidemic right now opioids are so readily prescribed right now that there are enough opioid prescriptions for every man woman how did America that have their own bottle and if you renew that prescription one time one time if you are taking those opioids at the 7-Day Mark your chance of being addicted at 1 year is 1 and 12 and if you renew it at if you're still taking the 30 days your likelihood of being addicted is one in three and these things getting written with way too high a pill count and it's in so the addictions that we're seeing a whole different kind of addiction now coming out of the suburbs and they take him for a while and they're very expensive and actually take him for a while heroin is cheaper so they dumped the opioids and start taking heroin so you're saying soccer mom heroin addicts that you weren't seeing 10 years ago get started on prescription opioids and then they can afford them or finally the doctor Cuts them off but they're addicted and so they start taking heroin cuz it's cheaper tinnitus obviously very disturbing pattern but where do she is going like when you look at the future and mean it looks bleak in that regard to me I've known several people that have had real problems with pills the problem is that I think people have is they think because of doctor gave me this because it's on a Prescription Pad that this is safe body doesn't know whether you got that in the back alley or you got it from a doctor it still has the same addictive quality and I think it is at an epidemic level in I've testified before Congress about this and I think there are several levels of accountability at the manufacturing level and at the prescription level and at the educational level so people understand I think everybody has to take part of it and I'm doing everything I can to raise the awareness about it as well when you testify before Congress what was the reaction they're very much aware that this has become a serious serious problem because the the cost that is as you see the Lost labor in the workforce is in the billions of dollars you see the the demands on the healthcare system that this is creating young mothers with children and babies born addicted to these opioids I mean the numbers are just going through the roof so I mean it's putting a strain financially on the healthcare system that it just can't stand so you start costing money and it starts getting politicians attention so they start saying okay now we got to start doing something so if there's a problem well clearly you got to start educating people and the manufacturers have to be required to start labeling this much more clearly positions have to be much more conservative in prescribing you I just had to shoulder surgery and I took like 1:1 opioid one pill they gave me in the hospital and after that you can manage it was like Tylenol or something cuz of Surgeons now or so good with the orthoscopic surgeries and stuff it's so much less of an insult to the body that was ice and Tylenol W can manage it if you just kind of focus on it a little bit and if you've had surgery and you're having organic pain for god sakes good head of the pack they had but when you as soon as you can get off of it get off of it and understand what's happening so said to be like Macho Bill need a leather strap between your teeth and go have some surgery on me and ship it hurt to take the pill and get past it but realized the minute you can get away from that you need to get away from it but yeah they don't need to give you a 30-day Supply right I need to give you 3 or 4 days and then you got to go see your doctor again if it's still a problem discuss it I mean that's what that that's what I think needs to happen to just be a lot more concerned about what you're giving these pharmaceutical companies make so much money they don't want they don't want to back off that they got private jets and Ian and pay for their starting to shut down some of these they had some of these pill clinics in pain clinics in Florida where you can go in without an x-ray without an MRI and just say you had back pain and there was a doctor there that would give you a 90 count prescription on-the-spot no Quest so you had back pain and there was a doctor there that would give you a 90 count prescription on-the-spot no-questions-asked 90 and you're out the door and you go down straight to the next one because there was no database no database and that doctor might be a foreign doctor that flew in from offshore wrote all the prescriptions during the day flew off again at night and now they're shutting that stuff down so that the Hammers coming down well one can only hope</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I know that there's a stigma attached to mental illness and that really bothers me there should not be I mean having depression or anxiety or whatever to me you should have no more stigma than having a knee injury or kidney infection or diabetes but there is a stigma attached to it and I've tried to talk about this in a way where it's at you talk about it and not be ashamed of it is okay if you got anxiety you got PTSD whatever it's okay let's talk about it let's get help for it get it behind you and move on I mean just not that's not something she should be ashamed of what do you do when you talking to someone that maybe has depression do you try to get them to exercise first you try to get them to visit a psychiatrist immediately and get on medication like to take it on a case-by-case basis will I do but everybody has a philosophy about it and I'm not saying that mines any better than anybody else's but I do have a philosophy about it and I'm very slow to medication I mean I think I think you use medication for biochemical replacement I mean for some reason your body is not making enough of something it needs then maybe you support it short-term biochemically but I look at depression there's a lot of ways you can break it up but I look at it like is it exogenous depression or endogenous depression I mean is it coming from the inside out or the outside in is it because you're reacting to something I see a lot of depressed people that in a sense it makes sense I mean you look at their life and if you're not down about this you shouldn't be when you've lost your job you've gotten a divorce your health is in the shutter your I mean you should be down about this it's external things so you don't need a pill I mean put somebody in a chemical straitjacket because their life's falling apart what the hell is that going to do but that's just putting goggles on and where they can't see it I would much rather get them to behave their way to success and say what are you reacting to that you're depressed let's put that on a to-do list and start like you said write it down and start Crossing those things off was figure what's an action plan to change this action plan to change the next thing actually and then when you start doing that then generally see their mood lift a lot of people that are depressed or just realistically reacting to a crummy circumstance in their life it's not necessarily a mental illness it's just a really realistic reaction too bad spot near wife yeah that's such a good way of putting it to that you weren't in a bad State looking at this might be something wrong with you that you're in denial if yam mean if you got a divorce lost your job your health in bad shape your kids are alienated from you and you're saying I'm fine then you're not in touch with reality and to give somebody a pill mask your feelings about that just keeps you off task I don't you paint a good motivator I grew up in like Texas and Oklahoma I don't know you've ever done this but we were supposed to spend my summers in the thriving Metropolis of Monday Texas you ever heard of Monday Texas now it's m u n it's a you not a no Munday Scott like 2,000 but in the Summers it would get hot in Monday texts and when I say hi I mean you look out in the backyard and your dog burst into flames that's what I'm going to be out so we would be going to the swimming pool or something barefooted and you get halfway across an asphalt road and you look down in your I mean like holyshit me your feet or just on fire so what are you going to do I mean that is painful you're going to do one or two things really are going to make a U-turn and get your ass back over to the side of the road and get the grass or you going to run to the other side and get off the road and get in the grass but you're not going to stand there in the middle of the road and melt yourself down to the knees pain is a motivator pain is not necessarily always bad if you're in pain it's going to motivate you to move to change something in the match that was drugs to do that pain with drugs is not a good thing that is Wise Wise advice and I'm I wish more people felt that way particular more doctor so you know I have so many friends that have gone to a doctor cuz I'm not feeling so good that they're almost immediately wanting to throw him on something but it's more like depression as prevalent like the term depression or what it doesn't mean I don't really remember it being a thing when I was a kid there was discuss the ways to spell now it's discussed the way people discuss all sorts of other ailments is it just an awareness thing or is it just people are thinking about it now in different terms well I think it's part of the narrative now and I think with social media with the internet not your social media but with the internet I think there's just a lot more it's a lot more in the nomenclature and there's a lot more awareness about it but I think it was just as prevalent in the 50s Christy's is it was now but in the fifties and sixties there wasn't a psychologist on every corner and there is now and there wasn't sub doctor licensing then you mean you well back then you had to have a PhD or an MD is a psychiatrist to see patients now they have marriage and family therapist a licensed social workers they have different levels where you can do independent practice so that's broaden the number of people that can provide services and some people think that's a good thing some people think it's not I generally think it's a it's a good thing cuz I think 58% of our rule markets today have no psychiatrist available and something like 50 or roughly have no mental health professional available at all none have no mental health professional available at all none so there's just nobody available to help people in in the outlying areas so I think the more people you can get into the profession so long as there's a degree of Competency is better but I think it's always been prevalent I just think people didn't talk about it very much just something I swallowed or they took the church or</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> a lot of responsibility to try to give people advice and try to straighten your life out and show them the the flaws in the errors that they're making the most of the time pretty complex pretty layered they have a lot of different Origins and they're often times comorbid a lot of things exist together so I don't think problems are simple at all but two solutions are often simple don't you think I mean it's kind of like the old joke you know the doctor and he said he just hurts and he said well then don't do that anymore it's a lot of times it's very simple in it somebody will have a complex thing that comes from childhood or maybe it's a drug grounder they've had trauma in their life but the solution is change your behavior I mean stop rewarding bad behavior choose a different path in life just behave your way to success sometimes the solutions are very simple even though the problems are very complex because it's some point you have to stop focusing on Y and start focusing on what state of why it happened what am I going to do to change it so sometimes the solutions are pretty simple implementing no Solutions are often it's often very difficult for people to change their lives change their patterns it is in in patterns has the key you're nobody does anything in pattern if they don't get a payoff and if you can identify that's why that's why inside so important that's why I think it's the number one outcome to whether somebody's going to respond to the talking therapy for example if somebody can identify what their payoff is they really can figure out I'm doing this repeatedly and my payoff is I don't have to work or I don't get held accountable for this or I'm escaping accountability over here or I get attention or sympathy or if they can figure out what their payoff is and they convened control that with his for themselves to the kids or whatever if you control the currency then you can control the behavior they have this comfort in their patterns and even if their problems are self-destructive events drug abuse or alcoholism or did those those the comfort in those patterns following those patterns it seems very compelling to a lot of people I mean hi and a off and if you if you get high and so you don't get a job and you don't take care of your kids that's a payoff that you're not doing things that you need to do that you should be accountable for its a pathological payoff but it's a payoff none-the-less and so that does reward you even though it's a pathological payoff it's a pathological thing you call it a reward and it if you but if you can identify that what they say look I'm not doing what I need to do I need to stop rewarding myself in that way and hold myself County to be there for my kid I tell my kid I'm going to be there every day and I don't show up cuz I'm high on drugs then you know I need to stop doing I don't usually I need to not let myself get away with that and instead require myself to show up for the kid when I say I do say I will and then you see what's in the kids eyes you share the experience with them now that becomes your payoff so then you'll start showing it for your yeah how many people take your advice how many people just listen and try for a little bit and then bail you know it is hard to say because I think are sometimes our most productive guest are the ones that don't get it because the mail we get they'll say oh wow that guy didn't get her to that woman didn't get it but I saw myself in them and I'll Never Say I saw them being such a right fighter or I saw them being so hard-headed or so oppositional and I heard them say things I've said and they left and didn't get it I got it I'll never do that again so sometimes those that don't get it at all while they're there are the ones are the best teaching tools for the millions of people that are home watching yeah that's interesting isn't it oh okay I see that in myself am I just got to not do with that guy to and then also you see the stubborn pigheadedness that some people have when they won't listen to advice and you could clearly see how they're ruining their lives by not being honest and sometimes a story that we might have is maybe extreme where you say I don't do all six things they're doing but I do two of them and they are in sharp relief to me so I can get that thing and do that anymore so I mean that's where I think you get a payoff in ill people go and find these things on the internet I mean last year and we have a channel that we put up meal different clips divorce show their parenting shows or whatever and we had over two billion views in the last year people just go and finding that information and looking at it so I know people are seeking information out and looking at Beyond to show itself so be seeking information and we just don't have a good distribution system for mental health in America so I think they look I think they're hungry for it they look for how many people out there trying to do better but trying to get their lives in order and you know it shows like yours and you know they're giving out inspiration and knowledge it's so it's such a important thing for people especially for people who didn't grow up with wise parents or maybe good support system around them I think this let screwing grew up with a alcoholic father and it was a pretty violent home and and he was a really bad alcoholic and I know having grown up in that you wind up with what I call a damaged personal truth and you feel second-class and the problem that kids make cuz I know I did it and I cannot see others do it is you compare your personal truth what you know about yourself and how you really live and what's really going on you compare your personal truth to everybody else's social mask cuz you go to school and you know well I know that last night the windows got kicked out of my house I know that the utilities got turned off and I know there was a big like my kitchen last night and the kids sitting next to me he's got on a shirt that's all I earned and his face is all bright and clean and you know he looks like he's just got it all together and you compare yourself to that person that kid and you feel like your second class and the problem with that is we generate the results in life we think we deserve so if you think you're damaged you think your second class you will generate results that you think a second-class person deserves so if you don't fix your personal truth then you'll spend the rest of your life saying well you know those really good results those belong for somebody else for me that's for somebody else and you'll settle for second-best and you won't get what you might otherwise generate for yourself if you don't fix your personal truth and so I think a lot of people are struggling looking for a way to kind of get out of field good about themselves and damaged self-esteem Demi self-worth and they really don't know where to go so that's why I do the show I don't look I'm not done with the mishap prevention that we're doing 8-minute cures up there I mean come on we're not doing that but I think if you can point people in the right direction if you can raise their awareness you can get them thinking about it you can create a narrative where they at least say you know how do I feel about myself I mean is there stuff I need was off I mean what am I saying to myself you can get them thinking about that then you know maybe you've done something yeah you know Tony Roberts once said once that it's incremental changes over the Long Haul in the way you have to look at it as if these two boats are going in a parallel Direction and one of them two shifts 5° over the course of time this boat is going to be in a far different place than the other both is going the same way it was always going the important thing to realize as well is the next year's going to go by whether you're doing something your wife or not I mean we're sitting here right now at the end of February and the next 10 months are going to go by whether somebody is working to make change of whether they're not and they may think you know how my God I'm so far away. I'll never get it on the controller I'm so behind in my bills or I'm so depressed everything is so out of control what you know what you make those incremental changes and then pretty soon in December you go hey I'm way better off and I was at the end of February so you make little changes and they all had it up and if you don't by the end of the year you just didn't deeper so every little bit matters I tell people to write things down one of the best ways to get things done is to write things down write down what you trying to get done write down what you need to get done on a long-term basis which need to get done on a short-term basis and ran up a force yourself accountable the difference between a dream and a goal is a timeline and accountability did you do what you said you were going to buy this time and if you don't hold your feet to the fire because it mean just sitting around dreaming someday and someday I'm going to get a different job someday I'm going to change this will someday any day of the week you mean just sitting around dreaming someday and someday I'm going to get a different job someday I'm going to change this will someday in a day of the week you know there's Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday look on your counter some days not on there so you got to say OK I want to take this small step by here this most hit by there this most hit by there and then pretty soon you know we don't leaps tall buildings in a single bound we take it to Florida time</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> crazy but in these areas is anybody talk to other people who were just on the edge of this while I'm family members involved in this and it's just been living this many levels of violence violence because you look at some of the worst cities like San Pedro Sula Honduras Caracas see that what is I need to places which have levels of violence which you like way was the Medieval Europe play some Medieval Europe I mean look at the figures 400,000 because some of them have not over a hundred a hundred thousand hundred 50 hundred thousand a medieval Europe early cities would like twenty one hundred thousand so that way was not Way West in the wild west the night now there are some place in the United States to Daylight. I know it's going to be interesting to compare that to Latin America significant still more than medieval Europe yeah wow Baltimore's worst in medieval Europe Chicago it's not that I'm in love level thinking Chicago comes out around when you do something so it's not now the American at the house City now then again what were things about the fault in the United States compared to Latin America in Baltimore is is is is significant about the city of Baltimore is very smooth lights send Mexico you haven't are states that are lightweight even or odd countries in Latin America is it is it significant Pizza Palace bubble city of Baltimore is very smooth lights with a talking about send Mexico you haven't are states that are like really Vonore. Countries in Latin America was in the u.s. attempt to be neighbors with your violin so if you really focus on the southside of Chicago a similar levels to Baltimore if you look at the whole city</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> well I mean if you get Braviary you want to see Solutions you want to find Solutions and you want to come to the optimism with finding Solutions and then you want to justify why you doing this doing this for but you tell the story about to look for solutions to this is three areas I believe they agree with you on the phone uphill battle, not going back to 2012 I wrote editorials about in a one of the reasons you should legalize marijuana is because if the marijuana come from Mexico which goes to cartels which pays Killers which pays for corruption but at the same time marijuana stays so you will see what the issue of heroin cocaine Fentanyl and you call the cartels are going to punch bottle rockets now they steal crude oil some big deal they still billions of dollars worth of crude oil from pipelines tap into a pipeline or something to put to take the same sorts of crazy video recently small town in Mexico with a bunch of there was a top opener spring out and a bunch of people lining up just to pick up the oil from the pipeline unexploded and it was just a crazy that stole from from from now. But I will Lyme disease attacking what do Americans spend on illegal drugs and it is an estimate of a hundred billion dollars a year so text books for $10. Rudy creates this this monster I mean we have they want to needs it because heroin addicts follow up heroin so everyone you say from that you could I know you can stop a lot heroin and I love that money with this money goes to these people who doing this stuff but a second there I believe is his social work in the neighborhood ticket with the Assassins with Achilles in cartels in Mexico and a noose around Latin America than driving around Jamaica and Brazil Central America Colombia talkin to Los Tequila's especially cuz I'm in some cases different profiles there's some of them this is done Honduras which is suicidal crisis situation when I was 15 and he was driving for us and he was also carrying a gun to help us with that you've been hit before being at the shop at 4 and then I met him again after these guys I'd he described how he been abandoned as a kid by parents and had this rule hate that he had with the world like can I just f*** the world I need to scrub the first time that he cared about mothers and it will be done crazy stuff for the first on the counter mud was probably the freakiest when he was 14 and they got a family that went to a house could know what they call family and the family describe describe. And then describe later on you know how he became a hired killer anything about him do have these conflicts inside the heart that he was someone on all this about the interview and he had his heart is to balance that someone who does evil but also has been a victim as well a victim and victimizer and you feel. Pain symptoms and his himself in be murdered he butchered his family is 14 week was he stealing money from them so the story with that was he said that he was hanging around with his baby Street kids I'm on the other kids said or know where there's some money in the house we can get some money in the house so they went in there and killed his family and it turned out those my money that the reason allocated said go that was cuz he'd actually been living with his family being abusive to him so he wanted like revenge on his family but was so pretty sick of how is that when he was describing it was they had this family and they would distort them defending themselves they would like Tatum one by one lap in the manner in a room and take them one by one to take them out butcher them out what's going on I think I mean watching itself but how like teenage kids can think about that stuff and then later Roman joking about the decapitations he was talking about they get contracts with decapitation inside the cut like a sailor who won this killing we wanted captured the guy we won this stalking you want to see video of the garden capitec we won that we want to go to suffer a money hacks the heads up there sometimes to be a moment when I'm when the body is to lock twitching how many packs the heads off their sometimes to be a moment when the light goes out them and when the body is too loud twitching like he says they can still see light cuz of the Headless Chicken is a bit the part when they still lacked which in a bit even off today and I have lost connection</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so I I came to Mexico or went to Mexico and year 2002 round for a few years in the UK wanted to get into journalism so I found one way to get into it was to start working in a foreign country rod and gun to my local newspaper and work and go to a foreign country and start working and I had a romantic idea about Latin America thinking I'll be like I saw the movie Salvador romantic comedy about running around with gorillas fighting military ships arrived in Mexico in 2012 in English language newspaper 27 when I first letter u k at 28th in Mexico traffic nobody cares about Red Light Green Light they don't care it's stressful they won't cut with the kayak all the time people shouting you a lot you have to use people quoting you like pendejo Saturday I'm nice motor like the Mexican Spanish would like you wake a possible way so when did you start getting into Narco journalism so romantic are there about what I'm not covering it in Mexico or Latin America when I write my bracelet back in Ukiah grew up around drugs in the UK so going back to the 80s I grab it on people taking drugs I had a few friends who died from heroin overdoses back then fool people in need. I have another doses I had a sister who went to became a schizophrenic smoke a little smoke around that time as well will pop yeah. That it was a Moroccan hashish there's a connection you know when we've been exploring that a lot lately yeah we went into this marijuana debate between Alex Bernstein and Doctor my cart from Canada and we talked about it and I know people that have had that happen to them where they've had schizophrenic or psychotic breaks because of just a massive doses of marijuana and special people that don't do for people that do it too much for too long it does happen I had that debate that's where it came to mind I mean I don't know a lot of people smoke weed when she was 18 and I was 16 at the time and when I came out it turned out was in my my my grandmother had schizophrenia or if it was how much the the the hatch was involved in that there's other issues as well so I don't really know the signs of it but battery going back so so I've been around a little drunk before so when I arrived in Mexico actually one of the first first arriving in Mexico ended up hanging around with some some people never smoked a little crack in Mexico people smoking crack down on it so when I go to a job with a local newspaper in English and how that link to the cartels and then very soon just very very quick I just fell in right away likes everything to happen by accident I just fell into covering the crime beat this is got back to mmi so then I was calling about the into a great journalist from twana Jesus blancornelas Roll legend from Tijuana to survive the shooting by by cartels and the time just getting him give me information give me tips on how to restart when they're not big store idylis back in those days was the court-martial some generals for drug trafficking and that was really what it began that been generals for drug trafficking how much of an issue stop me corruption must be unbelievably ramping so I mean corruption even in this coming up word for it sometimes I couldn't State capture 18 years of covering this stuff mrs. the very beginning but they're not in a whole lot of crazy stuff in that time of how bad the corruption is or what it really means IUD be placed when you get to know the policeman in a certain Town Center City and talk to know you know how old military guys are partitions and then you going to believe these are good people going to believe this good policeman out there who really want to stop crying so there's one policeman his nickname was Tyson Tyson like Mike Tyson his nickname was Tyson Fury's well-built guy and then it came out that he was actually a drug cartel member ranking every drug cartel and he actually confessed they have a thing with a police the the federal place when they go I'm going to confess on camera and he confessed know only was he turning a blind eye as he was training the young kids how to take people how to cut people up expecting in graphic detail how he died you know how they make the cut limbs off Alex Young People trained to cut limbs off to get them to lose that fear so that's the level of corruption replacement really would not really who they are the crazy things about a corruption down there did you have any hesitancy and getting involved in Norco journalism knowing something I would imagine that's one of the most dangerous Avenues to pursue in journalism so this was geopolitical involved in carbon is so like about 2,000 if this hadn't happened this war hadn't happened it was still a crime issue at that moment so I began to cover these things and then around 2,000 for allergic to the Houston Chronicle out of Houston Texas I was covering of the stream cover in Mexico for them and I threw up to a lot to Nuevo Laredo and there was a tough War beginning that which is really beginning of the drug war pull Mexico pop began on the border with Texas in the city code Nuevo Laredo over the bridge from Laredo Texas back in 2004 so there's a lot of interest from the detective newspapers what was going on there's a whole bunch of bodies party not that call I just drive the car to know better I do with myself crazy stuff so that you can get stopped by an armed group has Rosie could be could be a group of guys with guns people a lot more careful about the roads will be very careful how you move and how you plan this stuff when do by yourself around these places so it's about that when this was happening and there was trying to figure out why and I know there was one guy interview to is a head of Chamber of Commerce and I told him about couple weeks later he became the chief of police for the city and they are things that are you scared can I use get about being killed in almost good at 7:00 p.m. to get killed and he was shot that 6 hours after he gave that statement they shorten that and that was one of the real mark Cuz if something really strange is going on in Mexico something is like going to a Rock to Mexico and then from there it kind of just escalated and escalated and start work for the other media Time magazine New York Times different people off the water to the condo what new stores by describe books about this stuff is big and it's complicated it must be immensely complicated to the people that live there it seems like there's no Escape I mean if you can't turn to the police the police are the cartel there's the cartel the police all of the politicians most likely if they're alive have to be compromised yeah I mean they think some very very desperate people and I mean this being some bird if it means breaking people's wealth this has been heroes are our heroes I'll just get more of a sense about that means on the ground as well and some of the things you see some of the things that stay with me and I prefer a while it was quite romantic covering this is not why I'm covering I'm going to be places where Chapo Guzman is from now look up to the village and meets mother meets Family I'm wrong about these these crazy people but then you start seeing the human pain in all of this one many stories does the stick with me was a mother in Monterey school teacher know when you have armed guards leaving around it was so like really affecting the Civil population has attacked Nashville population I'm one mother she was in a home with a two children in Monterey and a just chilling in the house and then the door broke down I'm about 15 guys in bulletproof jackets who came in taking stuff from the house how the family room down to the mother which of your children is the oldest I choose not to know how to reply I mean which of your children the oldest how do how do I reply that just couldn't speak and yelled Estancia Tucson 118 115 the ATM and he said I'm on the oldest so happy you're coming with us take him away the next day she got a phone call saying not to be caught your son give us about money will give him back so he went around to my relatives is called the money she's going to get the money right away she turned out with the money gave some money and then just cut off the clothes and she hadn't heard from him since station the paints that I couldn't and I met her when I went to report on one of the worst atrocities which was 49 Boris who being decapitated who had the hands and feet cut off and open dumped on a road I know it take him some Morgan Monterey and arrive to the Morris house inside the motor smelling the smell of The Dead Boys is going to wait smell you get from that became flesh conical sweet smell you get from your Aunt has places where you can smell the bodies how do you start the motor on a cam out she's outside the move and she was trying to see if it has some might be among those people among us borders wow but you know it's it's so insane that this is right next door to America and there's so little effort put on doing something about it including doing something to mitigate the influence of illegal drugs by me drugs legal and that would be one gigantic step your you're not going to stop people from doing drugs means is a nailogical ridiculous approach I don't think people should do most of those drugs but when you make drugs illegal only criminals are going to sell those drugs and this is exactly what you have right next door to American it's just unbelievably insane that there's this amount of crime a drive away from San Antonio what's legal and that would be one gigantic step your you're not going to stop people from doing drugs when this is an illogical ridiculous approach I don't think people should do most of those drugs but when you make drugs illegal only criminals going to sell those drugs and this is exactly what you have right next door to American it's just unbelievably insane that there's this amount of crime a drive away from San Antonio</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> famous people who are studying the Narco Wars with all this Build That Wall stuff all this was going on in America there's this this is very strange right vs left polarizacion over here about whether or not there should be a wall between United States and Mexico sure I mean anything let Mexicans Dinotopia rapists and murders yeah someone's doing the raping yeah how many levels does anybody like me Trump and Mexicans are like a contrarian front once I'm in the in the heater guy being deported and he was like I knew this guy Trump going to turn out to be a great president so so very very Auntie Trump in terms of the world I mean about this and he was describing which is right on the border with the United States Nogales Sonora Nogales Arizona on the border there and he described the he first took people over the border the United States back in the 1980s when he was at school so high school and the offense and there's a hole in the fence to go through and the first time he to people through people derive from southern Mexico so you know how to get to u.s. mixing all this way and they give him a tip at the first only about $0.50 was made to take people's United States 50 Cent nowadays the cost of dragon of the u.s. is $5,000 images more expensive one is more expensive that means more money going to criminals which means there's not an industry doing it so now the cartels make a big percentage of that money of human smuggling into the u.s. 2nd president sang if you even agree to pay the world and why you to come and meet me and then it was like while he's really going to try Shakedown Mexico for like billions of dollars he's really been trying to do that and that was kind of scary mime and then tapering point field Mexico when he first and then he's going to deport 3 million and he's going to kill NAFTA lost Apple music from Possum really hit Mexico very hard to the concern was that he was going to take money that should be allocated to other ways it's going to help Mexico and he's going to try to take that and use it to build the wall diplomatic Family First careers that was kind of scary for a moment from the point of view of Mexico but I think off Utica lost copy if you haven't really hit Mexico whether not he wants to do the woo house is a bit the big fashion in terms of the spending here but if he wants to build it or Extended Stay Braeswood in section the board already if he wants to extend it and now it won't stop a lot of hard drugs I mean if you look at heroin cocaine if I buy the drugs they normally go through the Port of Entry so shipping trucks trucks go over that for every day now. Mountain trucks how many lights can you search in a day or the way they can hide this stuff in truck they can hide drugs in like a metal that can put lemons in in some kind of metal container seal it up solder it up put a bunch of stuff it doesn't smell so somebody with a blowtorch inside timer when the first Narco Corridos. Drug balance it was good Contraband and threatened treason for the 1970s was about hiring hiding marijuana packaging and tires Tri-City Tri-City open fire trucks door has to be activity I would imagine if there's a will there's a way in there's that much I mean I remember hearing that from my son a reliable source but from The Sopranos we were talking about only 20% of all the shipping containers to get brought into America gets searched yeah well that's that's crazy they have is you get they allow some to get busted you allow one guy to get busted a set somebody up so that taking some drugs through they get they get busted in the United States border the United States border yes, sometimes they might catch him in Mexico sometimes but the majority United States of the United States border patrol guys are they ever caught being corrupt US border patrol and Customs entry people who have been quoting a bunch of money</div>

It's ancient civilizations that were incredibly Advanced I follow the work of Graham Hancock and Randall listen in a few other people that are being proven actually correct more and more I almost on a daily basis by new discoveries it show that that Civilization predates what we initially thought within way back from somewhere around the Great Pyramids which is like 2500 DC that was about as good as anybody gotten you go up act like ancient Sumer which is about 6000 years ago and what they're saying is that know there was most likely a reset a global reset of civilization due to a cataclysmic disaster and there's a s*** ton of evidence there's massive evidence in the form of the smooth clear glass that exists when there's an asteroid impacts of and also there's a guy named dr. Robert schoch is when the first guy proposes it's actually went he freaked me out the podcast he said it was a mass coronal ejection that most likely cause a lightning storms like a rainstorm lightning like that much lightning going the ground in the only people that survive with people that could get undercover they can get into at serums mass extinction of the large mammals in a very short window of time almost instantaneously North America the the end of the Ice Age like 10,000 + years ago there was a mile high ice in most of North America North America gone and all is the all these areas all these points of interest to this one one moment in time that's somewhere between 10 and 12,000 years ago that some big event happened and that most likely just crippled civilization and then people had to rebuild whatever people were around the same group of about 5000 people that well there was a super volcano that erupted somewhere around 70,000 years ago they think this is predating this cataclysmic is at 12 are Yellowstone Caldera Yellowstone going to get us all Payson Zip by you know they're there Texas lately is skepticism about UFOs yeah that's why I want to talk to you about this because you told me that you've become obsessed with you if I was completely flavor combat footage and also just like I know a friend of ours I don't know if she wants to say but her father was an air traffic controller and he told her that every air traffic controller has seen something a commercial pilot when you're sleeping your brain is producing all sorts of endogenous psychedelic chemicals almost all of these experiences happen when your sleeping almost always experience when these people are abducted or taken from their beds which is when they're dreaming like there's some real clear easy steps to follow for Occam's razor and not you not get crazy with it not so sad but it doesn't knock out like Barney and Betty Hill when all the people that are fully conscious and that end that remember it without hypnotherapy Barney and Betty Hill I know the story but I don't know them so I would have to know them cuz there's a lot of people that I've tote like I did a show for Syfy call Joe Rogan questions everything that cured me do cured me of a lot of my nonsense with with conspiracies and talk about this beavers UFO Believers in the one thing that they have in common is they all seem to be kind of lost and dependent upon this thing being real instead of being objective one lady that I interviewed that saw Bigfoot that they really seem to be telling the truth but I think she saw bare Bears walk on two feet all the time they do it all the time and all the time and she was in the Pacific Northwest which is incredibly dense Woods you see some Glimpse it but I was hunting one sitting and in Canada and Alberta and I thought I saw a wolf for 2 seconds it was a squirrel okay I understand that but when you're looking for something you think everything is that thing you're looking for yeah so I thought that f****** squirrel was a wolf that's my expectation and perception are very linked yes yes crazy thing is very when I was a kid I went and saw Carl Sagan speak you have today at the University of Toronto and I was like 14 but he did an equation on the board of the possibility of alien life other than us in the universe and it came to the smallest I mean he spent the whole time writing on the chalkboard it was fascinating at the end and it was such a small he says there is there is something out there but they are so far away that do that unless I can go faster than the speed of light which he said was impossible time yeah the seventies skepticism in general is like like the skeptic Skeptics of the 19th century were the ones you said germs don't exist literally trillions and trillions of earth-like planets speculators before the real problem is that if some there's a leap and a leap a technological leap that opens the doors to massive Innovation that once this happens once this happens in this and then all this stuff sort of exponentially expands in terms of the technological possibility all you would need is a few hundred years and you have an unrecognizable set of Technology figure out source of energy never even experienced yeah you know doesn't exist so they've the speed of light barrier becomes moot because there's that guesses they holographic Quantum hologram Quantum holographic theory of the universe militants that that space time is an illusion is and that it doesn't really exist and that's why you don't like entanglement is possible at a distance the universe that really right next to each other it just seems like they're adopted into the uterus cause our ability to perceive is basically based on what we have to do to stay alive on this planet so our meager little chimp frames are trying to trying to quantify all of these things that are around us all the time so we put them into this so three-dimensional box of movement and distance and and that the entire him the entire universe could be a compact thing at like a hologram undo screen I love these kind of conversations cuz I'm clearly too stupid to really understand what when I don't understand I don't understand anything and I don't understand you two so how stupid does that make me well we don't understand each other we are all the same give me the most intelligent people in our community from examining something like the ridicule kept doctors from accepting germs cuz they didn't want to they didn't want to be ridiculed by their peers and even I you've got people that look like Michael Shermer will cling to the most absurd explanations for phenomena like the F-16 radar footage entailed having to basically diminish any respect you have for any of the people who reported on the events in order to eliminate it about ancient civilization and it wasn't very good for him Skeptics are believers will the problem is believing believing problem is being a skeptic itself you're actually sure about something that means you should be objective not carry at destination is not mockery it's not it's not there's certain people that are just deep bunkers they now call themselves Skeptics but they're not look anything like hell maybe that is effective maybe that is healthy maybe that is interesting know they don't look at it that way they're looking at it they're trying to pick it apart and that's fine if you can pick it apart but if you cannot you have to be objective about the fact that this is a very interesting case, none in that this is what we know about science is it in this is know about this thing and right now we have we have a weird conundrum Denarius of the Gods and did he was he was he believed 400% is all it is still in all in the most compelling piece of evidence that you know and he pointed to this Mayan stone plaque that's in Palenque how have you ever seen it it's in the book it's a God one of their one of their former kings that is lying on his back and he's looks like he's moving some thing it's just really cool carving that they found that looks like there's a guy who is in a seat and it looks like his fire behind his back and you could stay and play controls on a ship and he's shooting a rocket into the heaven I would like to see what the the mainstream version of that is cuz all so it could just be art imagination they knew about certain things being propelled by fire. Is yeah that's it so if you see this mean that's a big a stretch to say that guys in a spaceship I don't know what the f*** that is he's sitting down and alter kind of me it doesn't look like he's looking through an eyepiece right that's true but what does that mean is it a telescope maybe just got a telescoping astronomer yeah I don't think they had telescopes telescope was even invented till a little glass at that point but that was number one piece of evidence was Chariots of the Gods and everything was so new images look at the bottom of it even the part where the flame supposed to be coming out from below him but I mean I'm not even sure if you were going to draw fire you do a really shity job that's your fire stuff around them what's all that stuff that that looks kind of mechanical the right Lucy there's bolts does today have a fire God maybe they drew the fire got a monkey kind of face with titties titties</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> mathematical idea how can anything be infinite I mean Dino and two parallel lines will never know that though that's the real question like why is why do we need everything to be defined by a very obvious beginning and an end because it's it experience has a beginning and biological has not experienced the same way because we have our life and our life has a beginning and an end all the lives of people we know obsessed with that we want or we terrified of beginnings and ends got to Yanina or else you don't understand where am I now I have no end my very uninformed Theory which is that stuff that everything is meaningless but that only the brain-damaged are capable of conceiving of meaninglessness cuz our brains are meaning machines and that we evolved and it gives an evolutionary advantage that we give meaning to things like that's why can't we just get up and walk around on it like it's a song from a mutual agreement meaning let us organize our lives let us be better Hunters we decide not to drive into each other cuz we painted a little line on a route down the middle not to cross that brings just evolved and then we got to put we realize we're going to die we go well this got to be some meaning there too so then we had to create myths that where do we get upgraded meaning about our lives that's a very dangerous Loop of there's no meaning to everything and nothing has no mean nothing has meaning. That's a dangerous Loop for a person psychologically because you can get stuck in that and you can really but I don't think you can because it's impossible to conceive of unless you are seriously bring damaged damaged will know I don't think it's impossible to conceive it's it's you won't you can that you can intellectually think about it but you can't you can't grasp it really living in the now kind of the same as life has no meaning</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think I'm obsessed with lately is skepticism about UFOs yeah that's why I want to talk to you about this because you told me that you've become obsessed with UFOs yeah I completely uninstall labor games locked on a UFO found footage and also just like I know a friend of ours I don't know if she wants to say or what her father was an air traffic controller and he told her that every air traffic controller has seen something a commercial pilot and she said yeah turn around because when you're sleeping your brain is producing all sorts of endogenous psychedelic chemicals almost all of these experiences happen when you're sleeping almost always experience when these people are abducted or taken from their beds which is when they're dreaming easy steps to follow up on Occam's razor and not you not get crazy but it doesn't knock out like Barney and Betty Hill when all the people that are fully conscious and remember it without hypnotherapy but I don't know Barney and Betty Hill I know the story but I don't know them so I would have to know them cuz there's a lot of people that I've tote like I did a show for Syfy call Joe Rogan questions everything that cured me do cured me of a lot of my nonsense with with conspiracies and talk about yes Bigfoot Believers UFO Believers and the one thing that they have in common is they all seem to be kind of lost and dependent upon this thing being real instead of being a lady that I interviewed that saw Bigfoot that they really seem to be telling the truth but I think she saw bare Bears walk on two feet all the time they do it all the time and all the time and she was in the Pacific Northwest which is incredibly Woods you see something you Glimpse it but I was hunting one sitting and in Canada and Alberta and I thought I saw a wolf for 2 seconds it was a squirrel it's okay I understand that but when you're looking for something you think everything is that thing you're looking for yeah so what I got for Christmas I thought that f****** squirrel was a wolf that's my expectation and perception are very linked yes yes visual centers of crazy thing is very when I was a kid I went and saw Carl Sagan speak at the University of Toronto and I was like you know 14 but he did an equation on the board of the possibility of alien life other than us in the universe and it came to the smallest I mean he spent the whole time writing on the chalkboard it was fascinating at the end and it was such a small he says there is there is something out there but they are so far away that do that unless I can go faster than the speed of light which he said was impossible time yeah the seventies but that's a skepticism in general is like that it looks like the skeptic Skeptics of the 19th century were the ones you said germs don't exist everything we know those are literally trillions and trillions of a share plan Earth-like planets speculators before the real problem is that if some there's a leap and a leap a technologically that opens the doors to massive Innovation that once this happens once this happens in this and then all this stuff sort of exponentially expands in terms of the technological possibility need is a few hundred years and you have an unrecognizable set of Technology yeah sure that they're still trying to figure out source of energy experience Riesling that space-time itself doesn't exist so the speed of light barrier becomes moot because I guess it's the holographic Quantum hologram their Quantum holographic theory of the universe and it's a rental Through the Wormhole thing that space time is an illusion it is and that it doesn't really exist and that's why you no like entanglement is possible is cuz they're not really an opposite ends of the universe there really right next to each other it just seems like they're upset into the universe cuz our ability to perceive is basically based on what we have to do to stay alive on this planet so our meager little chimp brains trying to trying to quantify all these things are around us all the time so we put them into this so three-dimensional box of movement and distance in the entire universe could be a compact thing itself like a hologram onto a screen I love these kind of conversations cuz I'm clearly too stupid to really understand what when I don't understand I don't understand anything and I don't understand you two so how stupid does that make me well we don't understand each other we're all the same just silence even the most intelligent people in our community from examining something like the ridicule kept doctors from accepting germs sure cuz they didn't want to they didn't want to be ridiculed by their peers and even though you've got people that look like Michael Shermer will cling to the most absurd explanations for phenomena like the F-16 radar footage we went to Great Lengths that entailed having to basically diminish any respect you had for any of the people who reported on the events you know I need some funky moments with Skeptics are believers the problem is the problem is being a skeptic itself about something science is being used and it's not carry SS nation is not mockery it's not it's not there's certain people that are just deep bunkers they now call themselves Skeptics but they're not look anything like that is effective maybe that is healthy that is interesting know they don't look at it that way they're looking at it they're trying to pick it apart and that's fine if you can pick it apart but if you cannot you have to be objective about the fact that this is a very interesting and dominant in the distance show about science is it in this is what we know about this thing and right now we have a weird conundrum something gods and did he was he was he believed 400% is all it is still in all in the most compelling piece of evidence you know and he pointed to this Mayan Stone plaque that's in Palenque if you've ever seen it it's in the book it's a God one of their one of their former kings that is lying on his back and he's looks like he's moving some that thing it's a really cool carving that they found that looks like there's a guy who is in a seat and it looks like there's fire behind his back and you could stay and play hey that he's manipulating controls on a ship and he's you know shooting a rocket into the heaven I would like to see what the the mainstream version of that is cuz all so it could just be art imagination they knew about certain things being propelled by fire there it is that's it so if you see this meme that's a big a stretch to say that guys in a spaceship I don't know what the f*** that is he's sitting down and alter could I but it doesn't look like he's looking through an eyepiece right it's true what does that mean is it a telescope maybe just got a telescope immediately just Stone astronomer number one piece of evidence was Bigfoot you know and Chariots of the Gods and everything was so new images look at the bottom of it even the part where the flame supposed to be coming out from below him very very bottom but I mean I'm not even sure I buy that if you're going to drop fire you do a really shity job that's your fire what's all that stops at Dallas kind of mechanical the right Lucy does bolts does today have a fire God maybe they drew the fire got a monkey kind of face titties titties who's chilling and it looks like he's looking through something what's that thing hanging across him most compelling evidence so what is this obsessing what what is your more recent obsessing about UFOs what's the origin of this the evidence the evidence itself says you have to take this seriously and yet no one does or very very few people the possibility of some non-human intelligence that F-16 stuff is pretty compelling what is the F-16 to the Stars Academy said he's the best goddamn rock band the planet okay here's something interesting about this and this was pointed out like by okay video film by a fighter jet shows an unknown object near San Diego video from 2004 was released by the US Department of Defense while the way it moves there's something about the way it moves is really weird huh not from this world they have to go we'll find that that make arguments like that jet fighters are not better observers than anyone else up Nick Ward's take on that board the guy who he runs deep metal bunk metabolic runs a debunking site and he's another one of those guys that is all in with the the conventional explanation goes way out of his way to not anything that could be remotely debackers razor if you have to go to Great Lengths to dismiss something right that's not falling Occam's razor right during the video where the pilot shifted from One X 2 to X which makes the image move more because you're you have invocation Lakeview use magnifying glasses are by nose like if you use a 15 x by nose is very difficult to hold on them but 6-6 you can kind of look at things in distance but that's if you don't have about him about 3 million dollars worth of stabilization equipment on your dad just walked onto the subject right which is why that stays in lock through the lock and that's almost impossible I have a question possible for anything that man has to do with the quality of cameras today why is this footage so shity what is he saying the program doesn't make that will larger for my stupid ass for all you make sure you are talking about the Right video there's two that are confused here were talking about the gimbal video which is not from the Nimitz incident discussed here so it's cool down a little bit the gimbal video is an okay yeah that's when we looking at unknown date and location from an app from unknown pilot nope The Tick Tock one soon as I that's 2004 okay that's David fervor the media's discusses videos Tom DeLonge to the Stars the link contains the frames with the saying keep going keep going keep going Black Sheep on the object some kind of infrared Flair glare we know the shape of a very bright infrared Source like the engine of a plane to me much bigger than the object itself is explain to your okay so the circle flare it does explain again Occam's razor is okay so this guy is saying it's a look at it looks nothing like it even if it is a Jetta chats not capable of Breaking Free from the lock right now if you look at that you can see the jet example the bunks is debunking come up with something that is more credible than a trained fighter pilot who is there and Visually seeing it what do you think of the tracking of you I guess I don't know I don't get Crazy Craft is a crafting piloted intelligently straws and weird looking at a an ant colony you didn't go listen to me ants yes you just looked at him you know there was a White House what is the nearest yeah Roseanne the first second pulled it out remember that something that's got here cancer at they shoot him they shoot him out of his hand me the end of the movie he is resurrected that's right right now those those were the days we thought that they would communicate like an old rash of them that were seen over Washington DC yeah there was a. Dozens of UFOs tracked and admitted by the government that they were tracking them and watching them but they then and then I was doing a show with her years ago and she just telling us the story that's pretty funny and she doesn't know they took a scoop out of my back and I'm like a scoop they take a scoop out of your bag she showed on their back shoulder there was a hexagonal diamond shaped scoop out of her back a divot. no scar tissue and know how to make punch hole punch back there at the time years ago when I went into the ailing section was the world's biggest bookstore in Toronto on Monday of it and just look through all this crap up immediately in there are other people and some of them have like little pieces of something in there body about this many many years ago interested in Plants you're talking about people that have alien implants get body yeah silence debate is unbelievably potent sure and we're part of that were part of the Machinery that was used very very consciously by the government to silence inquiry you know it was like you know feeding it enough in the story the right way too late night talk show hosts made it so that nobody would talk about it so do you think that the government consciously fed those ideas like Johnny Carson those folks the UFO phenomenon but you see these people freaking out you're okay luck we'd look reviews all of our military might all of our scientific power and we don't see s*** I'm not buying this but he's people freaking out just has the real potential to get out of hand go sideways honest about aliens with my regards to Trump if there's anybody that would f****** tell us into UFOs are real but CNN is fake if I knew that to become president met you get all the access to your photos in Mecca Ashley pinata legitimately thinking that aliens were going to come propose such a possible scenario in that movie was so good now the lighthouse Lighthouse light for a spacecraft that they were within 20 feet of a craft that they saw and took notes on did drawings of against it and they wrote down notes all like different set of hieroglyphs on the ship itself described at the casino describes the feel of it is electrostatic field of being around it and the official explanation was they mistook a lighthouse several miles away for the spacecraft so Occam's razor against that's hard to believe that these trained observers that's how they always try to dismiss the idea that trained observers are better observers but they are better observers sure high definition camera the lenses are too wide but they saw something but they just you know what is the likelihood that trained observers who have been on this base for years on this night would mistake a lighthouse if they've seen every night for the entire time they've been on this base for UFO I mean what is the the likelihood of that that explanation is correct rendlesham and rendlesham are you afraid there was a UFO and it's a nuclear insulation that these observers saw something run described it accurately is it something that it crashed if you want to say that it came down was was landed in the forest and then took off what do you think of the Rhino case the day of recovered a crashed UFO and alien bodies in the next day or so. We made a mistake was just a balloon invisibility cloaks will they they showed up again the next day with a bunch of weather balloon scraps into separate planes and the Truman met them there yeah Beekman alien question myself so that's my problem I want stuff but I won't like I'll be skeptical about something just seems crazy or well if the preponderance of you haven't said something happened but doesn't tell you what happened but then you still have to believe something happened not knowing what happened isn't evidence that it didn't happen and yet you're still a flower skeptical about something just seems crazy or people that you know belief service crap something metaphysical explanation for all this might my thing is just well if the preponderance of the evidence says something happened but doesn't tell you what happened but then you still have to believe something happened not knowing what happened isn't evidence that it didn't happen and yet you're still a flat earther</div>

Guantanamo Bay is garlic a really looking at the rest of my life with that will they look for it and everything everything's a conspiracy and then when it comes back to you and they say damn is involved in this right and then you see how this works fathers on the deeply involved and stand Arden and the Russian trolls that's what you're doing at the store or you don't know I have a friend of mine who thinks that the CIA started Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix there's a book about that called weird scenes inside the canyon going on in Laurel Canyon shirt probably about p**** there's a lot of weird shaped going on the CIA the rancor was all over there there was a lot of s*** happening well I'm sure there was a lot of s*** happening but there is not a f****** intelligence agency in the world that can create a Jimi Hendrix imagine being in that time in the the country when everything was just falling apart left and right around us Vietnam War Kent State just f****** Nixon's the president and it's just chaos left and right no internet yeah everyone's doing drugs it must have been Wavecrest it and then just I'm a Kennedy guy I think there's something wrong with that yeah for sure for sure FK was did you know that no hay call the FBI in Houston they said Subs George George Bush I'm in Tyler Texas and I think I know who the Killer is me informed on this guy James Parrott and James Parrott ended up being like one of his staffers it was a good cover-story cop planted and that came out in the memo and there was another Melodies are Declassified FBI information after the assassination CIA the problem was George Bush should not have been working for the CIA that point he should have been just a private citizens who suggested he was working for the agency for very long time and he was made the the director of the agency for one year after the Family Jewels came out which was this whole thing with the CIA went to Congress made mitad that they're done all these things from you know ku's and a fermenting Revolutions in countries and they made him the director for 1 year after that happened to break to make a clean break from all the nefarious activities that the agency had been involved with but if you take that memo to mean that he had an existing relationship with them he was actually just becoming the Joker doesn't make no sense anyone there like why is the lightweight becoming the head of the CIA he's made the head of the CIA and then after that memo was on Earth people are saying oh he had this was an extension of the cover-up he was being made the director at this very interesting time in history because he actually had worked with the agency forever and he was not at all a lightweight he was a serious operator and he was going in there to kind of clean up and transition them into a new era it's and I'm telling you I'm already out current s*** I need some like Julian Assange I need something bright I need some Edward Snowden through the bush

sensory videos from what I've heard but I was reading that thing you tell me about Jamie this whole like p*** or child pronography pedophile Network communicating with each other in YouTube comments are responded yesterday and they said that they people comments on tens of millions of videos and deleted a lot of accounts that were they were communicating in the comment section of a little kids cheerleading and what not to share c********* or were they communicating to molest I don't know in the Wake pedophiles communicate and their network but Sunday pedophile dark web burner computer for underage girl in like I think some people CNN said we've seen it but it's and that's led to him going in cycle what what did you watch and is that legal probably is legal cuz you're watching under the guise of Isreal and the fact that there's these networks of people that are trying to you know cultivate these experiences Datsik predilection you're going to find a way to breathe out and what they're doing for example okay they post remarks appraise the girls asked whether they were wearing underwear or simply care to string of sexually suggestive emojis about 2 years ago hundreds of companies pulled money from YouTube over concerns about ads showing up next to problematic content from Terror or hate groups and videos of seem to endanger exploit children I think you know what we've talked about this before with YouTube with the issues that we've had with them they they have way too much content and way too few people there's no way they can watch all of it and when s*** like this are people doing things in the comments it's almost impossible to check ya mean it's just the YouTube comments are one of the rare free-range sort of like unchecked message boards in the in the world shall find out later who is that don't read it yeah yeah I wonder if there's ever going to be a time where that is impossible we're like these child pedophile Rings they can figure all that out I'm harder now than ever before I imagine because so few people want to believe that it's a problem in the way that it is but because they're good people in the world that don't think these things are vicious so I think there's the political Bill isn't there because people don't aren't really they don't understand that it's you know and then the people that are doing these things are very wealthy powerful people and they have a lot of control and they can kind of cover their tracks if they're all wealthy all all your power pole or pedophile you're not going to a ring what are you doing call Nick and kind of cover their tracks if they're all wealthy volume power poor pedophile you're not going to a ring when you doing some kid</div>

There's a real because here's the thing orange if you're told me something made a lot of sense when she goes it's really be a waste to get into this type of business and end up in an office writing for show you don't care about in a job you hate punching a clock and that's stuck with me and always think it might be harder to go the other way and to build a fanbase and to do what you want but it's going to be it's going to be better in the end and you're not going to be angry you're not going to be resentful I think a lot of the people that were were against his comedy not so much his behavior but it's comedy are people that are would want more in this than they have in the resentful at guys like Louie because it is it's not fair have counted yet it mean he says controversial things he always has what do you agree or not like things about the Parkland thing you know got in trouble about you know saying that all you did was push them fat kid out the way yeah that is so consistent with his material the idea that anybody saying like oh my God he's punching down like you need it go to his material again because he he said a lot of risky shift because it was funny and he had really good points about it yeah I know is that something that I would joke about probably not right but he did about fat people but I I don't think I would joke about kids getting shots and take yeah I think he could I think honestly we were we're dealing with first of all the embryo of a bit mean he's really only been doing stand-up again for a couple of months in fact that it was even last and I think ultimately his idea that bet is that big brother is that kids today like they want to be a variant of them and they have 78 different genders and why am I interesting you're interesting because you didn't get shot like that is his take on it and he probably with overall reaction in anticipation of reaction I would have eliminated that part of the b**** or and you know I'm saying like you know that is his take on it and he probably with overall reaction in anticipation of reaction probably would have eliminated that part of the b**** or and you know I'm saying</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I mean I do think since Trump got elected conspiracy theorist have been demonized and nobody talks about that I was always doing on it was for sure please play cool to hate conspiracy theorist more people that are like let's take another look at this there's so many factors are elected by A Perfect Storm of people getting getting fed up with political correctness yeah someone coming along that's not a politician yeah yeah this system is so rigged to put in office material and then one guy gets up and just goes f*** this and screams and yells and destroy the room wanted the whole night they wanted somebody to come up and just realized how f***** everything was and have nobody was having a good time and that's kind of what Trump was stripped material hammer and trying to stab his friend this is one of the funniest things he was speaking and he was giving stump speech I don't know where was I think it was wasn't in Iowa but he's referencing Iowa and he's talking about Ben Carson's book and the Ben Carson had admitted to going after his mother with a hammer and trying to stab his friend with an I mean these are these are in Trump is talking about it me and my friend were driving to New York City we were laughing so hard I said this guy Erwin I shall tell you why he's going to win I cannot stop watching this I can't I am so fixated by the idea that there's a guy like this on National stage and he sang whatever he want there was something intoxicating about that lot of things you were saying were horrible but he was saying them Hillary Clinton person and I'm like it's just boring yeah show it to me I'm like sometimes the entertaining person wins because you can't take your eyes off them well in this case for sure I mean that it was a perfect you know polar opposite between him and her no experience versus vast amount of experience right no real experience in the real world vs vast amount experiences yeah I mean there's a lot going on between the two of them it's a bad way to choose how the world runs really is very bad to look at Canada to go who's the most entertaining it's also a bad idea to have one person write a bad idea to have this the same system that was in place back when there was f****** you know a thousand people here Nexus of powerful institutions where you have career politicians career diplomats career military service people that kind of don't leave so I think that's one of the reasons that we haven't changed the system is because one person can't ever do that much even though Trump is Wiley crazy he's done a lot of bad things I don't think he would be allowed to deviate from many of the policies like that his predecessors had kind of a stye but I think they like American government and that's why this to turn with the Deep state which a lot of people ridicule it's an undeniably true that I mean our policies are not just one guy gets in the office and he goes here's how it is where I mean it's the result of a lot of you do private corporations lobbying forming all kinds of formula agenda and a non-democratic way you know you're not accountable and a lot of these people that work at the CIA or the FBI a lot of them are appointed and not elected have no oversight we have plenty of 22 intelligence agencies now interagency by Thicket I mean I think you have the capabilities with all of these different atoms 22 bits a lot and they're all competing with each other I have to have it oh yeah the one on having now we have to I don't know what the national geospatial-intelligence thing does or any more relevant than space Force One National geospatial-intelligence agency did a spyware keeps checks I mean this is what I mean like what the hell are these people doing and what is its 16,000 employees with their motto know the Earth show the way understand the world an intelligence agency of the United States intelligence Community with the primary mission of collecting analyzing and distributing geospatial-intelligence in support of National Security which is what what the hell is geospatial-intelligence this is what I mean like an idiot it says its intelligence about the human activity on Earth derived from the exploitation and Analysis of imagery and geospatial information that describes assesses and Visually depicts physical features in geographically referenced activities on the air I mean this is Scamp uncovered a pretend agency that nobody that there's a guy right now Patek Indigent special 16000 other employees going to real job and shipping docks from space give me the stuff it starts to get crazy the amount of people that are doing things we have no idea what they're Diamond 10 I just did a private gig at the Bethesda Country Club in Maryland okay it's you know I'm still doing private gigs in the world you know what I mean it's all defense industry Raytheon dyncorp things you've never heard of in their old and it was a good gig Venezuela the morally compromised while they're also hired a comedian the f*** with them but I don't know what that means I mean maybe we need it but listen again to stand-up comedians talk about what the world needs I'm out and about trying to stress this more than ever because the fact that I have a microphone right and people are listening don't f****** pay attention to me okay I'm not right for the best thing is listening you don't know you might be right but I'm definitely not an expert the best thing is if you go on Twitter and a comedian will tweet something really you know it's like we're living is fascism and then and then the next week got my web series I need to know are we are we living in if we're living in fascism you can have a web series you can have the time to luxuriate in your web

The problem with it is that as soon as you start to put any regulations at all and you know he say all you shouldn't be allowed advertising to advertise even if it's advertising honestly about a great product the people that will have real issues with that already right cuz I'm saying honestly so this is a big controversy evil words exactly the impossibly hall and the billboard said something like all you beach body ready but that's so silly I mean this is it's not an unattainable ideal you looking at two examples of it they they're real human beings yeah but that's like saying that you have to be that way but if you do want to look like that man and have that body it is a possible goal majority of people right like if they don't have the time or the effort it's not but very many people have radically changed her body not saying you should do it I decide it is a possible thing to do and if you don't trying to sell Fitness wouldn't you sell an example of someone is really good at it like if you're trying to sell a business course we can you show a guy with a giant house in a Ferrari like this is a guy was done really well at business look at his Penthouse apartment overlooking Manhattan you wouldn't shut you and say well that's an impossible goal I'm going to show you a person in the middle-class suburb cuz this is good as you ever going to get us at that point I just two things. people smoking while they want to take them days to Nanny State issue the problem with these are impossible to achieve body goals we already have regulation of these things get the contaminants out the atmosphere Sweden thing which he says is actually corundum II cessation so how do we stop people being pumped full of b******* junk values right adult soup with thyme trouble budgeting explain budgeting to them how we do it right so cool from school is called middle-class School wasn't super rich middle class without having a problem with the kids at the school were becoming obsessed with getting out the latest Nike sneakers he realizes that kids like a ship something else going on it they are so obsessed with getting these things that he designs this program that like to reinstating breakthrough identifying that people of course they like my car but I thought the quickly people would say Nike sneakers the parents with name expensive tell me how you would feel if you got these Nike sneakers right even your head where did you get that idea because everyone thinks they're smarter than the ad but giving people the ability just to see how Halo those drunk parties without the first bumped into it longer how could we build more back into your life unless of these junk bodies every week I'm just needed just meeting once every couple of weeks and check in on Saturday to take my kids to the beach and we went whatever it going to stifle materialism let's Asus monitor bypass a casa letra significant ships in people's bodies that they had a significant decrease in 25 years and a significant increase in in moving for intrinsic values and we know that correlates with lower depression and anxiety of the time</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the resistance tends to know how many people arguing for reversing the Cannabis legalization hate you. Right now we've been a little bit about Clash of Clan Has Come Out repeating the kind of bit till I contest between him and Alex Bernstein and dr. Mike Hart from Canada and there's some new some reality to the dangers of cannabis use people that are susceptible to schizophrenia and I think that there's also some at least anecdotal evidence to the point to the fact that some people experience The Psychotic breaks and these schizophrenic episodes probably directly as a result of large dose use of THC or there's two Edibles or whether it's through smoking at some people freak out I've known people I've known of people that have had real issues with it and we had a comedian here a couple weeks ago talked about he doesn't smoke pot he's from Brazil smoke pot use a vape pen took a bunch of hits and was f***** up for 2 weeks there are dangerous and problems so it's really important case that legalizing cannabis is associated with alcoholism he's basically only making the case for it to be negative and I think there's far more evidence cannabis is it a positive influence on people it reinforces community and makes people more sensitive and kind this the thought of paranoia might actually hit it makes people more humble it makes sex feel better if it makes food taste better there's this creativity aspects to it that are undeniable there's a lot of very positive aspect to it for some people it's not good but it's like saying hey some people die when they eat peanuts without while peanuts morning your children about peanut yeah I think everything you just said is right I think it's another lie of that's going on at the same time at a kind of below that which is really important to understand this thing so very open people will say republican debate in 2016 2015 movie we call it legalized cannabis because it used to be THC content the day before alcohol is banned in the u.s. most popular drinks by firewood beer and wine in the weeks after alcohol prohibition ended most popular drinks again today in between you couldn't get ahold of beer and wine or whiskey and moonshine if we had to smuggle alcohol that bar in a wagon from the Canadian and Mexican border from Tijuana we can get drinks mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup what you were buying the pharmacy right very low-level Earth IPS when the ban happens is not good most people who drink alcohol don't want to drink vodka and they sent me that one drink app sounds most of the time right most people want a mild form of that drug that's true there was an emphasis on the strongest possible stuff because people wanted it I mean it was a direct result of people having higher tolerance is because marijuana was so readily available and they if you have a high tolerance and you smoke a lot of pot you want strong pot because week pot doesn't do anything it's the number one complaint amongst cannabis Enthusiast is someone having weak pot she cost approach with people who are cannabis right but I don't think it's a matter it's not the same thing like Janet obviously is more potent than whiskey or than beer rather it's easier to carry Jen around you have to carry less of it with cannabis people are still buying the same quantity they're just getting more f***** up because their tolerances are so much higher they need to stronger and stronger THC a variety of options cannabis to do different things or tell me where there's some people want maximum THC maximally. Some people were still a market for for lower grade weed when they have it listed at all these have Spencer he's they have it listed you know 20% 35% they have it listed so you can choose a more mild marijuana if you like to but the OG people the people to do it everyday cause they want that really potent weed at not like more like the people in Vegas navigate to Vegas for the weekend and just want to play roulette with concentrated milk a very dedicated uses and want to get maximally f***** up of tightly right I was I think that's what pushed the I mean it's also and botanist and I'm friends with a bunch of people who breed and grow these various strains the heat Hilda's 38 kind of significant Active Components maybe I'll pick me out a dozen over a hundred cannabinoids I think we just discuss this right and we wanted things he argues and says right people you have a very widely used drug is is that's really problematic right financially evidence so why do people who are prone to psychosis schizophrenia one cannabis right cuz it there's a lot of B12 Vivid Seats psychosis and schizophrenia rise I should give it as a treatment in some places I injusto pill form so actually it's a slightly more complex picture then kind of his supposed to suck Isis right very rich THC and some people will cause such as a real problem there are things we can do to bring that one of the good things by legal Market if you can regulate it so we can limit the amount of THC that is available just like we can limit by state has been arguing its we need speed and they exist but they need to be commercialized and promoted more in public health Wayne officer commissioning cbd-rich kind of helpful to people with psychosis the the volume more slightly more complicated than Steven is offensive about this behind Epiphany about drug legalization one day there's a car parked in Wayne New Jersey in 1970 he would have put it this way but legalization pressure regulator weed barrier between kids and drugs that doesn't currently exist right this is why since they legalized cannabis in Colorado that's been a significant. big premium I'm getting these substances out of the hands of armed criminal gangs and into the hands of licensed legal businesses yeah I don't think anybody's going to argue that means I think that anybody rational rather I think that makes a lot of sense I think that the number of people that have schizophrenia is fairly it's fairly stable in terms of the percentage of it across-the-board cannabis users are non cannabis users and so the argument against the Cannabis causes schizophrenic break so that these people already have schizophrenia and it just hasn't really manifested itself in a in a tangible sense if this is one of these Professor nuts says that there is some evidence that people is it a different paranoia players a subset of mental illnesses very specific as a significant genetic component although that can be environmental triggers for it so it could possibly trigger ball that could possibly trigger psychosis details so I don't want to send great confidence I've been saying the other stuff as well we know that kind of excuses massively increased in Britain for example a folding creases 1916 Britain and get levels of schizophrenia Dodge Ram trucks in Britain says I haven't looked into that engrave detail side bicycle riding think that I have looked into that he says do they know what the mechanism would be that would cause someone to consume THC and have a psychotic break have that have been examined enough about I would seem to be a big issue right like find out what it is that's causing its trigger and whether or not this exist in these people anyway and maybe a stressful situation and a bad breakup losing basically rotten thing for I have looked into the he says do they know what the mechanism would be that would cause someone to consume THC and have a psychotic break have that as I've been examined enough about I would seem to be a big issue right like find out what it is that's causing its trigger and whether or not this exist in these people anyway and maybe a stressful situation and a bad breakup losing their job maybe one of those things could also causes</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> about in relation to addiction I think when you talk about addiction Robin Schulz it caused by childhood trauma that experienced drug addictions right 20 years ago gambling addiction at the time so it just seems like you wouldn't do this the whole time alone every Madden and took him to put his arm around the end of the end of the shy right that wouldn't happen in the sitcom a lot of known a lot of gambling addicts did you feel that they were there their they're straight-up junkies and they might as well be chasing crack play everything you do that you like yes you do for me so I think it's integrated in the brain but self-destructive issue there's something about gambling there's a lot of self-hate involved in and this is overwhelming feeling of failure but a lot of gambling addicts have because they fail so often and they're they're always trying to chase the dragon there was trying to make up for all the past things have gone wrong this big score with this big score weekend filling out about your same relation to him I got to go pizza cutter and he's a professor in the Netherlands who he says we shouldn't call it the diction we should call it bonding the human beings have an innate need to bond connects right I mean you're happy and healthy you'll bandhan connect with like people around you with meaning for 1 but if you can't do that cuz you're isolated beaten down by life we haven't or have to do that you would bond with something to get you some sense of relief right now for some people that might be pulling for some people that might be gambling severe alcohol what I thought because if you if you only have one Bond getting ready relief you will obsessively returns that pond right someone I know very well how about some of mine has a gambling addiction and this is someone who has no alternative form of Joy or pleasure in their life right and gambling gives a moment most people don't have a problem with the relief of just being absent from your life for a moment or 5 lug you play rather than I went to the Lost connections book about depression I went to the first of the internet rehab center in the United States High School restart restart Washington and I'm in the kind that I'm about driving as a clearing in the woods so I wouldn't play something with instinctively looking at my final fitting but then it would be World of Warcraft not before night and this young man but no longer cat like what is something I feeling the other people see them to that part of a tribe I feeling that that moving around your kids spend very little time Outdoors now right I think there's also anticipation there's puzzles there's things we trying to figure out whether or not something's right or wrong and how to get it and then if you do get it you get this positive surge if you don't get anything there's a human reward systems are being near there and gambling as well I feel you will get it something from absolutely underlying psychological need everyone needs to feel like it is something if you don't have a sense of moisture in your life you will be depressed and anxious right much more like people playing video games and active actual Avenue for career now there's Esports careers where these young guys are making millions of dollars playing video games not like the old days where you would say hey you're wasting your life now it's basically almost like practicing golf but we have a set up back here when we play video games against each other it's very addictive don't you think it's addictive has movement and exercise attached to it so you get some positive benefit from that addiction I was definitely addicted to Jiu-Jitsu I would even train when I was injured you know but what does that mean it means I enjoyed more than Android not doing it does the difference between a lot of video game addictions and particulate gambling addictions is that they tend to wreck people's lives with almost everything I've done in my life in some way shape and there's some of it where you're trying to do something positive to mitigate the pain or the frustration or the anger or whatever it is bothering you but I don't you know the video game thing was a real addiction now cycle compulsion and I wasn't lying here's how did you stop playing I realize it was kind of messing up my life and my career was taking up way too much time and I just came to a realization I was like I got to stop doing playing way too much that's why I just said the only way I'm just too competitive enjoy it too much and so the only way to do it was to stop playing it all together and we started playing it again recently after more than s*** more than 15 years of ever playing it at all you know and it's still addictive but I'm so busy now I can't really fall into the grip of it I'm actually just enjoying it for an hour here or there do you have in your life that is Meaningful that is good MPG pleasure or Mastery the less space that will be for these objects of obsession the happier I am the less I want to turn to you know the behaviors that develops child to avoid being present with like violence in the kitchen light Obsession w+ Obsession Obsession way of being in the world right like to sex in or whatever it is it is it is it a way of avoiding pain a way of avoiding pain

heroin but doctors can prescribe it sit down when the doctor say to the biggest Crackdown on doctors in American history are the 12,000 doctors arrested around it up when they come to the one in Portland Oregon that don't decide what we meant to do with all these vulnerable to take two people and one of the agents that going for them in the like they'll make good fish food but that was the attitude has resisted intensely how much more mature attitude Houston we have not right it's not that people thought is good we should celebrate every instance of drug use and I want things that right there were problems and there was there was some Joy associated with drug use and terrible things associated with their real homes as well as Society location of this right really we all the outlier that most societies have had licensed intoxicants in different societies a different nabina Society in prisons this many of its citizens this High proportion of its citizens anyway so many people and the conditions in his prisons are so terrible that the United States is only the first Society ever remove men have been raped the women that's how extreme this this war is right and what we do to people in the world creates get some historical out while we are in a freak experiment right and one thing you can say in Spencer right the United States now that there's a gigantic business behind it all through from private prisons to prison guard unions to the pharmaceutical industry that would benefit from keeping most of these drugs illegal so their profits continue to rise to law enforcement I mean down the line it's you would be disrupting like an evil industry but an industry I think that's a real facts about don't want to overstate it most people often do you think the drug war has failed say yes and most people lost do you want to legalize any drugs other than cannabis say no very strongly do education I think it's about to do this year 2019 time behind the really high like nightmarish I can drug saying Rogers again kicking it like ants with some people injecting the streets like anything I'm about to crack down and so people would go in like hide and dumpsters or in Alleyways to shoot if you're hiding and you overdose no one sees you just on the right 20 Springs gdata dad died and he's like I caught just sit here and wait for my friends died and left me to die but I would have put it there today no officials nothing like that just had to send it all the downtown Eastside, with problems to solve everything they were very skeptical but they liked bud and we can do something else can we do but went to the library he learned in Frankfurt in Germany they do open safe injection rooms but like what happened in California until they shut it down and swing shut it down right-wing Darko filipovic comparison to be taken and the change of the local military base in Chilliwack and never let out if you sense where he's coming from right his friends everywhere and the coffee have written on it before you open a safe injection site every time I speak in public one of the famous people with addiction problems with stand up and say he will do next before you open a second tonight I'm one dady Wilson one of the main people involved they stood up and said Field oppenheim Apartments big Park in Vancouver with a cross more than a thousand cross is each one representing someone who died of an overdose and they write the names of the people on the crosses and one day after exercise to meet Milton Friedman to Nobel prize-winning Economist who grown up on the alcohol prohibition and Luther Freeman explains drug Probation Department South America things are going to change around here open safe injection site Philippines right wing party is so horrified they deselect him today and he's helping his career but I'm more liberal guy wins the election in the room stays open followed by 88 0% average life expectancy relation to change a big pot while doing chasing the scream anymore you don't write people off right I realized runs the saying we should lock them up in the military base right you know anyone who can be persuaded by message of love and compassion and the most unlikely one of the biggest champions credible what with the Shriner iPhone on the downtown Eastside sacrifice his entire political career over again given the chance for the schools he said how often do you get to save thousands of lives of the most vulnerable people he died he remember they sealed off the streets of the downtown Eastside with Butthead lived as a homeless person and they had this incredible Memorial ceremony in the loads of people at Knotts are many who need that they were alive because of what got it started and could so many other people to join them so many people who didn't have addiction problems open the right thing came that day everyone watching your show listening to a show is more powerful than Bud was that day by the day he started that right. They have a device on which listen to this right but didn't sit there thinking someone else is going to handle this he didn't say that Stephen Harper tried to shut down this injection site and the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that people with addiction photos of a right to light to live and I suspect you have a voice you have a human voice that you can use to persuade other people with love and compassion you can tell them stories you can build people's love and devotion in the middle of this catastrophe addiction crisis right I mean more people died last year in the IPO crisis than soldiers who died in the Vietnam War combined in the middle of this catastrophe drugs out of all prisons where we have a wool primitive able to move around at the whole time so good luck keeping them out of the 3,000 Mi Boda right that will never happen you might as well take all the money that will be spent on trying to keep drugs out that way but I didn't know what is absurd that's never been such a society most striking tomato-based places is the people who what initially skeptical and initially thought it was crazy very often change their mind it was crazy very often change their mind and then</div>

It is f*** you I'm an American citizen of single a f****** place right at that point Harry anslinger resolves to destroy her the first man he sent to to track who is a man called Uncle Jimmy Fletcher reflection has dropped out with a bag man. He dances with her nightclubs against another really well and Billie Holiday was so amazing that Jimmy Fletcher fell in love with her and his whole lot he felt really ashamed way did he passed they when they come into such as she she she makes him she pisses in front of them at the trial was called the United States vs Billie Holiday and she said that she sent to prison for 18 months in prison but what happened to her next I think is the coolest thing she gets out of prison and about time to sing anywhere but I said alcohol you need a license doesn't get it so one of my friends wants the cruelest thing you can do to take away the thing they love they take away singing from Billie Holiday weekend in criminal records example Hospital text her but she says to her friend Molly Duff tea on the way in the answer his men were done with her they're going to compel she said they going to kill me in there. Let them they're going to kill me she wasn't wrong in the hospital she's diagnosed with Advanced liver cancer and probably related to severe alcoholism and in the hospital she she goes into heroin withdrawal so male friend my sister she can methadone stop to recover back is hurting the girls quite dangerous when the week while on your old weave and answering his men come arrest her on her hospital bed hospital bad friends in to see her outside with sign saying that lady they live they were big purse right then after 10 days the cost of methadone and she died the next day have friend at one of her friends told the BBC that she look like she had been violently wrench from life right bus right set with three whole days to die for one second late is been insanely racist from the stop right at the same time to hurry up. Billie Holiday have a heroin addiction he found out Judy Garland Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz had a heroin addiction one of the agency sent to destroy Michael George white guy trapped in the last days of our life we now know I mean he's a psychopath he was she should I be Skies constraints Gotti infiltrate a Chinese drug guy when he wasn't. But he he boasted in his diary about murdering people about women and raping them I mean which are only one who epic story about people with addiction problems and that they sometimes recover from their addiction that is indeed a heroic story everyone want you managed to do that is it here pause of the deep sound she sang Strange Fruit should be people through bubbles I never stop singing that song right and I think about a lot and I think about you know Everyday People Listen to Billie Holiday and they feel Stronger Everyday will still following the policies of Harry anslinger and it makes us weaker this conflict the beginning the start of the drug I think one of the reasons why the debate about the drug war is so charged because it runs through the hearts of all of us or anyone the anger is useful in most cases we need to understand how to change your life right but that conflict is is very deep in us and he invented Perfect story about Billie Holiday and I had no idea that Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz was also addicted to how did you munchkins about them as well why was Harry anslinger hate towards her so extreme so when he was a kid the book is coaching the screen cuz when he was a kid eat tuna in Pennsylvania and he lives in a van house and they go up in the storm house in the next Farmhouse down there was a wife you had an addiction and these drugs are evil and we need to destroy them especially later on he was in Europe during the first world war very Kings is Diplomat hurricane sends that you only need a little bit contamination and it will go to s*** and so he places for The Killing Fields New Mexico to Switzerland ricocheted around and actually how he made he thinks he's stopping the screams. Should creating for more screens in that in that in that place yeah but I still don't understand why he had this people with addiction problems so I'm telling her story but this is what he did to huge numbers of people right he wanted to destroy the whole jaw seen that one amazing thing spending time in his archives and Penn State was a single these memos from his agents are such them go to a local jazz club in the evil things that happening the ocean man and had a lyric that said when he gets the notion he thinks he can walk across the ocean and he's like there was good epidemic of drowning across the United States that people use cannabis because they believe they can walk on water about time we supposed takes over comes the Federal Bureau of Narcotics is it when Frankenstein's monster bumps into a spliff on the staircase Frankenstein's monster dies of fright like these extraordinary Lehighton claims and trying to get support for battle cannabis in particular with the help of the Fox News this time has passed newspapers this is what will happen if you use cannabis tragedy in suit with hearing these discuss stories again about about something that was said but I think about the motto for the entire drywall the waking second already have the power to get wealth in Ruins and this one part when he goes to the new United Nations and he's insisting this happens and they basically threatening people this thing will cut off your phone 8 or you won't be allowed to sell Goods to the US market if you don't do this tornado you might be allowed to sell Goods to the US market if you don't do this ambassador from Thailand is like</div>

Play some wrong they do play a role I think the prices of salt isn't it wasn't thinking primarily by stop which my mother is an is nicotine chemical hook and so in the late eighties when nicotine patches were invented cigarettes without any of this shity cancer-causing smoke us surgeon general's report complicates later finds highly motivated people using nicotine patches 17% of them will stop smoking right now that's a big deal the other things I talked about in in lost connection so I mean it's a whole range of them being a few are acutely lonely we have a lonely Society that's ever be right you are much more likely to be vulnerable to dispatch depression addiction if you are controlled and humiliated at work with most people now on to some degree you're much more vulnerable to these things I've been to the place that solves annoyed crisis that had a disastrous opioid crisis and ended it right and they did something that's very different to Americans are being urged to do so I'm as Twisted as income like in the public parks people like injecting in the neck like nightmare seems right that be bad anyway but the Swiss people this is like the worst nightmare right and they trial supposed to think I tried the American way arresting people punishing people shaming people and it just keeps getting worse and worse and then one day they got this incredible I think the solution is to legalize heroin legalization what you picture is anarchy and Chaos she said what we have now is anarchy and Chaos right we have unknown criminals unknown chemicals to unknown drug users in the dark or filled with violence disease and Chaos legalization obviously know maybe there's some really hardcore Libertarians but No One Believes we should legalize her in the way alcohol do cannabis illegal right now I think that should be a heroine oil in CVS and Rite Aid Clinic well if you see the clinic so the way it works is you have to go to the clinic at 7 in the morning cuz Swiss people believe in doing things really f****** idiots posted this agreement between me and my dad you turn up you got in that give you a heroin addict if you medically Pure Heroine you can't take it out with you you going to use it that part because I don't want to sell it on but my knee cuz I wanted to you to make sure you made it to go to your job Supportive Housing work and therapy to figure out why you can't batsby person in your life it's really important syringe surprise me really weird is they will give you any choice of heroin that you want to pop them on that will kill you and there's never any pressure to cut back and yeah I wouldn't know when it was 13 years after the first started there's almost nobody on the program. The whole time almost everyone. how can I because we're told the chemical hooks take you while you need more money if you have unlimited Supply you would just carry on how do you explain this to me like I was dumb and she said well we help them in their lives get better and it's your life get better you don't want to be annexed at us so much 15 uses histogram zero deaths stats on legal heroin no one person can people transfer in cuz why would you carry on using expensive city street drugs when you could be getting help and getting the drug free and when is fascinating about this roaches make Donald Trump look like Oprah Swiss people after this has been in practice for five years had a referendum on whether to get rid of it and 70% of Swiss people voted to keep her when they go I was most women don't want to be on the street being f***** by random strangers but the body if I don't like an alternative but the change my environment to get out of the Icelandic Asian until like that smell like Rat Pack what we do in this country finds out that you are using a percocet or Oxy addiction continue how to turn your life around will give you a criminal record with Shane you with stigmatize you we put barriers between you and reconnecting what kind of hawks at the Y. Crisis which is also creating a society is becoming harder and harder for people to be president especially in those in those places I keep thinking about in the in the 18th century Britain lines of people were driven out of the countryside into these disgusting Urban slums in like London and Manchester and something happened cycle the Gin craze right but basically shitload of people just become alcoholics drink gin until they died right it's a famous painting from the time go gin Lane of a mother down in like a bottle of vodka while a baby like fools out the window right and think about that really well happening now they said unto us if only we can get rid of this tentacles that because anyone in Britain who's over the age of 18 can go and buy genright and while we still have some alcoholics to be sure we don't have mass epidemics of alcoholism. Babies falling out of Windows what changed wasn't the amount of availability availability of the drug what people's basic psychological needs are not met right where they have shrinking number friends and social connections with a toilet life is about money and buying s*** and displaying it on Instagram sees me where they spend most of the time jobs they find unfulfilling controlling and humiliating you going to create growing pools of people who call anybody who constantly insecure insecure able to set aside $500 for an emergency comes along with insecurity in the society you going to create very large numbers of people What a Feeling Marianne Faithfull the great like 60s British singer with Mick Jagger annoying this drug use is happening because it performs a function right what am I supposed to bite my face by chasing scream and lost connection is that these forms of Despair depression anxiety addiction they are meaningful signals right they are telling us something that happened Rising year after year after year that way now at the point average white male life expectancy is bullying in this country for the first time in the entire peacetime History of the United States and that's because of drug addiction and suicide in fact it is largely a response to The Brave Little Toaster other things going on this one and we can talk about then once you understand that you realize it's going to be a deeper spot that I went to places that do notary Switzerland Switzerland what is the overall population 5 1/2 million so it's a small country how much money do they have to spend to keep this program going in the time constraints in terms of like how long is he's got an addiction problem allowed to stay there and and receive treatments you can stay on your entire life if you want to and practice that doesn't happen very they stay in the facility night they live in apartments did good reception sites cheaper than the police constantly harassing people putting them in prison putting them on trial bites are really expensive in-state Hermes unbelievably cheap if you buy a legal aid and it saves money right which is why Swiss Peak nearby pragmatic than you know the most compassionate people but they are pragmatic people that's why it was so right and every year they were like Swiss then they were trying American Way Shane punishment stigma and things just kept getting worse and worse and worse and then one day the prime minister is the leader of the opposition got together another week are going like this and they decided to do something really Radical Something know what a dunce is the drug will be down in this country 70 years before they said we like awesome scientists what the best thing to do would be a panel of scientists Tony Patterson on the first of a drug treatment center in in Portugal founded after the detection and they said to them and look at all the evidence and figure out what the hell week and a half or two years and they come back and they say i k solution is weed decriminalized all drugs for cannabis to crack but next time take all the money we currently spend a f****** people up arresting them shaming them imprisoning them and spend that money instead on turning around and interested in the United States right so I do some residential rehab write this up a big part of a small lines so people with addiction problems could stop and run businesses the things that I thought were important at a time people are crazy that you can spend it on Throgs lunacy not by the time I went strokies woman like the cliff right wasn't that stupid problems of course so well it's virtually no one in Portugal instead great God code Crown figure era decriminalization with the top drop top in the whole country and he said I'm sure loves you listen to the timer call do this when I went to see him website he said something like everything I said what happened didn't happen and everything the other side said what happened did I told you how I felt really shined it's been so many years prior to the decriminalization screen people's lives up when it could have been helping them turn their lives around never do they have really terrible Rising problems the places that have policies based on Mckellips restore order to the market and its Liberty to drug uses and love and compassion and practical help people with addiction problems have declining drug problems right they did this in Switzerland what was the primary cause for this drug addiction and how did they deal with that so if they dealt with it in Portugal with these loans and helping up businesses by paying for half the salary and all those things like that seems like a wonderful idea what do they do in Switzerland to sort of mitigate one of the issues whatever the issues were there causing people to be drug addicts in the first place so it's a combination that gay people have been terribly to be used as a lot of evidence that giving survivors of sexual abuse safe places in which they can release the shame about that leads to a big fool and depression addiction and other problems. Kind of the pieces is it's a big driver of a lot of diction for lot people that claim everyone and some of it was just two people who have never been given a chance in life I have never had stabilized cookie cutter wide open up open up in drug treatment in the United States what is plenty good examples as well you know you'd arrived and they say this is your problem we're here to tell you your problem I have to solve your problem it's very much Guided by the person themselves right people who are in deep pain sweet experience thinking about all the time I was writing about depression light in the day that I realize why I kept thinking about it so much I was in Vietnam about 5 years ago and I was really tired and so this big red apple I'm so tired I lay on the bed and I start eating it was just gross try was thing really really chemical taste it was like how I imagined casually projectile vomiting and it gets wet food I have food poisoning before I buy City from Fried Chicken in my 20s I was not Anisa's radio and after about four days I said to Hawaiian translator who's when I'm like look actually I'm sitting in this hot with this this woman is a 96 or woman who was the only person from the villages to survive the Vietnam War take me back to put me in the car take me back to Hawaii right now I'm so annoying and jabbing me with everything that was going on and the off Mila's questions and I kept saying to them give me something for the nausea the ridiculous story about to die but I think it would pineapple I'm like Eve or like Snow White or like Alan Turing and then I was like you're about to die in your lost or basically pretentious come Voltaren for four days just like I've been in the desert for 40 days I had seen that much pressure in their addiction as a bit like that muzio right as like a kind of malfunction right sign that you should get rid of and actually what we need to do is hear it right cuz it will tell us what's wrong with us we can begin to find Solutions on all the places I went to places of solve depression crisis I went to places that sells Addiction crisis screen makes sense you feel these wasteful reasons I went to get down into these these people reasons</div>

thing that they're running from things play comme non-problematic to the person isn't addictive it doesn't damage the help what's going on I'm one of the things that when he blew my mind in the research for chasing the scream was realizing I had deeply misunderstood what addiction is I had misunderstood the thing I thought I have been staying in front of me since I was a kid right so nice people that think about close to me nice people if we stop the next Periwinkles is heroin addiction we've been told this story 400 years has become totally part about our common sense right we think if we took them that we took next 20 people after that and we'll pass the studio and we injectable with Heroin everyday for a month at the end of that month they will be here without Express simple reason that chemical hooks in heroin that that bodies would start to desperately physically need for the chemical inside the right there's some reality to chemical hooks that exist that real but that's actually a very small part of what's going on something wrong with that story we've been told it's always explain to me by lights of doctors in Britain Brown from if you step out into the street and you get hit by a truck and you break your hip to be taken to hospital much better than the shirt you bought on the street cuz it's medically pure it's not contaminated if we think about addiction is right but it's just caused by exposure to the drug what should be happening to all these people in British hospitals have been given lights go on the streets right but she never happens right I want to learn that I just seems so weird to me I thought I couldn't possibly betray right how could it be you got someone in the hospital bad he's taking loads of really posting her and they don't become addicted and in the alleyway outside you got someone is using the drug he becomes okay by Matt's amazing man Alexander you didn't experiment that's really transformed how we think about Dick Shinola the weather to new way of thinking and loads of new evidence so explain to me earlier in the 20th century little bit shity today right and give it to water bottles just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine remember in the 1990s as a famous partnership for Drug Free America add the shows this experiment and the right in this cage starts to drink that has killed itself addition problems alone in an empty cage they got nothing that makes life meaningful rats right what would happen if we did this differently which is basically like having a rights right they got like two friends but if you don't know what's in them but I like the Waterbury much none of them when that lives of shity none when they have the things that make like me connection we have to ask yourself what are the context in which people become addicted to some contacts what people find these drugs extremely addictive and there are some contacts so they don't become addicted this something the drug plays a role Chemical X real the Vietnam war in Vietnam American troops be using heroin raspberries it's got out that it actually insane Crackdown on cannabis and so people to move to Ireland custom if the dogs can detect (maze cannabis when is Warrens we can have you know if million Aeronautics on the streets of the United States there's a really good study that followed these B's Mannheim and it found that the vast majority of them just stopped right didn't go inside then go to rehab most of them didn't go inside the New Evidence about addiction I go through chasing the scream it makes it makes perfect sense right you me everyone in this area if I took any of us and put us in a horrific pestilential jungle where we don't want to pay and I made you kill a lot of people and potentially die any moment you would find heroin much more appealing than you do now right if we want to understand why people turn to painkillers we go to understand why they're in pain right chord addiction slavery I learned from these amazing the core of addiction is about not wanting to be present in your life because your life is too painful a plane today and once you understand that you can see why what we've been doing is such a disaster right humiliated understand me behind that inflict pain on them to give them incentive to stop right I want you to understand the pain is if you can see why some people say that doesn't work. It's much worse right that makes addiction was those women I went out with and spent all that time with you you know that prison come back from being on the Chain Gang where they have to sometimes I have to dig grave they went to another day I was there they have to collect garbage today I was one of the days I was that but we come back normally with prisons terrified with Michael the whole Rye is the solar trip log and so I said to the gods you show me the Halo Shirley Center places she could cat to human Recreation of the cages that guaranteed addiction and rats right and this is what we doing thinking it will stop these women being addicted perspective on what places are incredible results I love that rat experiment one because that always been parroted as this is the proof positive that these drugs are so terrible for you but once they figured out that if you take those rats and put them in a wonderful place and they don't have addiction it really does make you step back and go okay what is exactly going on here obviously there's chemical hooks they are real life people that are on sustained prolonged use of opiates especially people with back in please have an incredibly difficult time kicking up even really positive people don't necessarily have awful lives but it's it's one of those things that gets in your head and then you sort of parotid you you've heard it you repeat it but the reason why I asked you the question like what what is what is the cause for most people you believe it's an unfulfilled life or a painful life or painful self-image or remorse for your past or like what is it that they do have like primary reasons or primary attributes that we attached to these people that are drug-addicted what my more recent book connections uncovering the real causes of depression in the unexpected Solutions is is about of Court addiction is it's about trying to deal with pain right but the causes of human pain obviously huge annoying causes a deep despair right now. Depression in the densely interconnected at most of the facts is not biology that finances in the way we live for love connection evidence do human beings have natural psychological names right you need to feel you belong meaning and purpose you need to fill the people see you and value you you need to be a future that makes sense and this culture with Bill is good at lots of things that I'm really glad to be alive today</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> hello Yuan to myself that says talk slow talk American because all I spent about half the year hitwe British people because a reorientation where you suddenly realized IHOP in Cactus Arizona and I was saying to the women right like I'll have some time do you speak English people f****** invented it right but I really love Arizona there's great Parts like Phoenix is amazing Tucson's great place to but it's a wild west sort of a state it's one of those weird holdover states that have a lot of weird old school laws like like I think you could just walk around with a gun experience in Phoenix was was going out with a group of women who would like to come out on a chain gang wearing t-shirt saying I was a drug addict when members of the public could have been Jared The Rock has written this book about the war on drugs and 150000 degrees I have to walk somewhere and I could see on the map it was like a mile away so I'll just walk is fine I got like halfway there people and you are because the only reason anyone ever work in Phoenix I never have a nice color like I'm either this albino, or Red Run and never has no rich brown Hue none of my ancestors the Scottish and swiss flight never saw the sun right now my friend Jamie was over my house once and he's not his friend Jamie different Jamie who's the British as well and my daughter who is at the time I think she was like 10 or something like that she goes she goes to while my watch with Mommy he's so white and she and she goes yeah she was like he's white like paper Jamie White like paper things to very gullible Americans were there who makes you feel like you're more sophisticated well-read and more aware of the world I know there's a mixed Americans like the Russia Britain because we constantly looking at the United States right we're constantly staring three most in American culture I think we feel very American right has been talk to you here and then you come up with these deep cultural differences all the time but I have literally never heard of European ass right nice crusty right when passing coming at Mar-A-Lago or kidding West Baltimore and you can say what's your story and now having a weird being a police interrogation do you suck on the bus in Mississippi and sitting next to a woman and within 5 minutes to chat until she told me about like a two miscarriages have a mother hated her and I thought if we was twist where my dad's from you wouldn't tell me this until we got married and maybe not even that storytelling very different about this place than a year of anywhere in Europe now when you talk to people in England you guys don't have the same level of social not social media but of reality television you have some like big brother but you don't have it to the extent that we have it here right yeah I haven't really been taking over show host president used to describe myself and I was hosting Fear Factor they like you hosted reality show my sort of it's a game show it's just a f*****-up game show it's like Trump was hosting a gameshow essentially right it was a contest it wasn't like keeping up with the Kardashian that's a true reality show because there's literally nothing going on other than these people's lives and whatever orchestrated bulshit they put in to make it more interesting because I think that's part of the thing I was getting to about Americans always wanted to give you their narrative there was one to give you the story of their life so when someone says what's your story there to have it ready you know because it's almost like we feel like we're in some sort of a small television show all the time or some sort of small production it's like almost part of Are Who We Are realize you're just the extra right on the corner of the ShopRite and British people or certain kind of self-deprecation examples London Brandon Murder by 50 people two weeks later another group jihadis try to do the same thing but I haven't built very well so they go down into the subway and disallow bang but it doesn't connect with the dead tonight remember rightly 3 the escape on the Escaping The Giant in the story chases after them Pages chasing after the guy for ages what everyone else is running the f*** away and the guy any Frozen to the ground and we said to him was that the attempted suicide rude man right it's like it's impolite right way to a better example which is true he was reported time definitely was done during the riots we had in 2011 in London it was one place where they break into a luxury good store and they could only make extra strong window so they could only make a hole in the corner of the window and it was caught on the security cameras that the riot is formed the line to go in and loot the store right that's how deep beautiful me right then that door ready go and people pile through all Humanity gets tossed aside Financial desperation but it's also the competitive nature of those things we trying to grab the few remaining items are 25% off and I've been saving for this TV for 6 months and there it is right in front of you and you charge people are fighting left and right it's awful

I think that connects to this information Theory kind of thing so if we're just sort of a conglomerate of these actions and words like blowing the factions through our body and unique ways I mean do you accept his theory on Free Will or conventional theory of determinism that a lot of people are embracing and I think there's definitely some Merit to it however you and I both know that you choose whether or not you decide to do something right you choose whether or not you like someone says someone says something to you that's kind of shity and you choose whether you decide to email them back some shity like you have the initial impulse so I can Will hey man f*** you you have an initial impulse you think on it you sleep on it but why are you thinking on it sleeping on it are you doing that because of determinism are you doing that because you're trying to better person and are you trying to be a better person because of all the factors that played out in your life like environment genes life experience all those things it's really good it's a really good discussion so do you own the words that you're saying right now the question form right here just discussions going to be licensed and you yeah I think your Licensing in a certain way okay so it will you have the ability to license it however you want you could say hey anyone can take this and cut it up and remix it or you could say now that's locked down but he helped create this whole licensing array of like six different licenses one says you can do absolutely anything you want with this another says you can share it but you can make money off of it and so the free-will stuff is connected to Howard dealing with information and like if you cuz if you if you think realistic we don't own what we're saying we're a part of it running where conduit word unique conduit so I don't think it aligns with How the Universe Works to really be a locking down information it makes sense probably in certain short-term business but you know I think we have to open it up so what's really going on what do you mean like a lockdown information looks like source code like classified files like our content like music like video how does a how does this connect to determinism and whether or not you have free will because it is a r r creator of your information will you are certainly if you put into work like what say you decide to write a book I mean you put hundreds and hundreds of hours in this book and edit this book and then you release the book and someone says no you didn't you didn't create that you are you're a product of determination and I'm going to just steal your book that's intellectual theft intellectual theft is real it's it's certainly real in terms of a creation of content right if you are a stand-up to me and someone takes your countless hours of work and steals it that's intellectual set for sure and if they try to pawn it off as their own to their own selfish needs selfish means that's why I tribution is the key part of the Creative Commons license you are always saying if you come up with a joke you know it came from here but what if it's a profit like say if you wrote a book and I say hey this is a great book written by Bill ottman give me five bucks for it and put it on my thought you two would walk that I mean here's the thing I I don't somebody makes all the money off of your book cuz they have a better platform to sell your book and they don't give it to you at all and you wrote the book you spent all the time you did all the work I would for certain content that I create completely Give It Away. Sounds like I was never in the book ever in the book I mean but see if you were I'm not saying people should be forced to do this. I'm just saying that this I think is how creativity happens and I just don't people deserve to make money on their content and you deserve to own your stuff but I don't think that that's actually How the Universe works I don't think it's acceptable to say I own your content but that's why I'm struggling to see how they're connected because if you're not the originator then you're not the owner puts a weird argument cuz you are the original Stephen King wrote All Steven you are here the unique conduit you are the originator of that specific configuration of information and you deserve to be able to everything you're saying with it I'm just saying that I don't know if it's complex it is complex if you're saying that all human beings essentially all of your actions have been determined by a lot of factors that are outside of your control what is genetics again life experience education all the different factors your environment is that what's causing you to put out f****** brilliant record it's part of it right but you I maybe you have 50 maybe you have 50% everything else has 50% are there I don't know what the percentage is but if you're a musician and someone like Spotify comes along to his boot DD make that dude so we're just going to put it on Spotify and make millions and give you pennies that's not what I'm advocating I'm saying and uses the Blues. yeah Israel plagiarism so but that doesn't that doesn't mean that those aren't great Rock herself the true it is true. You know I found out this Bill Burr called me up and left this really Disturbed message he was like really bummed out when he watching bills a musician he's a drummer and when he saw videos of Led Zeppelin music played and the band that used to open for Led Zep we played on the podcast we like holyshit like they just stole stuff they just stole giant chunks and riffs and you know when we make it better I guess but yeah but that's a different thing than Stephen King's book by Stephen King had to spend countless hours in front of his laptop trying to go over each and every sentence in each and every paragraph in work cuz he stole stuff dude they sold certain phrases but you think he didn't use a single phrase anywhere in any of his books that he didn't pull from Summer certainly I don't think it's the same though I think it's similar to get it to the level of Awesomeness that would hurt Jasmine didn't pay those people yeah if you no matter what you should be attributing you're taking ideas put in the footnotes why does it hurt it doesn't make your art worse because then they adopt admit they stole the Riff for Stairway to Heaven from their opening band and then people would go a lot and then they would see it and they would look at Led Zeppelin differently but you know human beings are severely flawed I don't know if I buy that with this this idea that you're saying and turns of Life author creating content I'm not trying to sell something know I know but if they are I don't think so much appeal to copy their stuff and sell it I don't think they should either but what do you think I'll get you should be able to view the content creators you are who you are and who you are at this moment versus who you are a decade ago or two decades ago it's it's all very weird you know I mean you go back and think about stuff from high school and you like Jesus Whatley am I really even that person like I think about still like I talk to my sister about stuff that happened when we were in high school oh yeah crazy like I ran into a guy for my high-school like a couple weeks ago it was weird was so weird you know he remembered some strange story from English class and I was like wow you remember that like how weird and while he was talking is that even really me about me because I don't have any connection to the stuff that he sang and I understand that he has his two vague distant ghost-like memory in his mind of some some I like how weird and while he's talking about is that even really me because even really talking about me because I don't have any connection to the stuff that he sang and I understand that he has his two vague distant ghost-like memory in his mind of some some slide images that he's piece together that he recognizes as a past interaction I mean it's f****** strange</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> before they turn anywhere you looking at you know when I hear about something I almost always before I even Google it I almost always go to Twitter and check Twitter and you know and see what's going on and see if there's. Go at DuckDuckGo AR that one know what's up a privacy Focus search engine it's like pretty much the only privacy alternative to Google like this idea that we say I'll just Google it I mean our whole process has been to proprietary surveillance tools from our company and I've been trying to get myself like getting off Facebook getting off Twitter getting off Instagram it's just like they're so abusive to everybody in in like just billion people work there I mean Instagram they're all gigantic businesses yeah and they're all the same because none of them share their source code and they all spine everybody and they don't show you what is happening behind the scenes interview with the codes doing so like in that in the note I wrote you the other day it's like it's a comparative like food transparency you know 50 years ago nobody thought about that and then 20 years ago everyone's like I want to know what's in my food wible when you want to know what's in your apps do you know I mean it's super sketchy what they're doing but how so look what what superstar don't know but we know that they're spying on everyone in tracking you everywhere you go there targeting things that you based on physical location browser history even when you're not on those websites some of their falling around where you're going in the internet and so some people accept that for this free search engine with free email and things along those lines except except the fact that percentage of what they're doing is not going to be private or at least their searches are not going to probably save you Circle you thinking about buying a Jeep and you search jeeps you look at in a 2019 Jeep and then all the sudden all your Google ads or about Jeeps feel like we know I don't think that that makes people want to spend more time on Google and Facebook if it does it's more than that yeah and so there's all different layers of like what we use with your browsers your apps your operating system your food your government your energy like all of this technology has code running is associated with it so when you open up your computer when you sign into a browser when you open up an app you are empowering that out that's how the apps of the world become huge monsters corporations is because we all use them everyday so if you switch from you know a lot Macos to like the New Lenox for like Debbie and her bun to if you use braver Firefox if you you know.. Oz actually proprietary which is annoying but they are very privacy-focused and then there's there's all sorts out there that we can potentially accelerate with there's really cool new interesting protocols like that and ipfs that are like more torrent style back-end so there's actually no servers in a giant Warehouse like Facebook and Google it's more it's fully peer-to-peer and we're trying to balance it because not like decentralisation equals good and centralization equals bad but like you know in order to get a suite app like Instagram style uni servers to like process video and so the tech is still sort of immature in the fully peer-to-peer like you know Bitcoin style internet but we're definitely getting there and I just think it's important for people to use things that are transparent to them and respecting our freedom I think one of the problems with these giant companies is that once they become big you kind of use them as a default and it's very difficult to get people to communicate with you off of them you know it's it's a hard to say hey man I'm I'm launching this new social media app I would imagine you could speak to this I'm watching this new social media app and I want you to join it before I put them ready on f****** Facebook I'm ready on Google I'm already on Instagram I don't want to do that man too much extra and we making a million times harder for ourselves because we're not scooping into people's contacts and you know taking all the information you are not we're not snow, so like when you give your address book to a who does that GameStop's number when you say oh I want to find my friends around this app and you share your contacts we not supposed to that you're not supposed to do that yeah but most people do you know your friends didn't give you permission to give Facebook their phone number you do that I probably used to like seven eight years ago if I don't do it anymore I always say the same thing when it pops up kids that's all I know what you're doing Facebook is weird one man it's so it's such a sneaky one in Alpha Facebook and you know like all this Congressional hearings and the inner workings of it all and they're the fact that it profits off of outrage so it wants people to argue like the the AI the computer learning specifically wants people to have like contentious debate pentius debates about things cuz it keeps our eyes focused on the website and if your eyes are focused on Facebook you know then those Facebook ads very valuable it's really fascinating that I think the outrage is unavoidable on any network it's more you know are you going to are you going to take down there taking down at rage so I'm so and it just seems so inconsistent and subjective</div>

show that so it's almost like they're making this up as they go along yeah Kyle kulinski sent me this today I'm going to send this to you right now Jamie hang on one second hold on I'm very quiet unfortunately is an audio show but in July there yes not that are okay Facebook suspended in the now tweets page at the behest of CNN in the US government funded think tanks says we had almost 4 million subscribers did not violate Facebook rules were given no warning and Facebook isn't responding to us so yeah what was the what it would actually started this off I mean who knows they don't communicate with anyone they've been Banning legit accounts for years they won't you cannot even stand to minds.com link through Facebook Messenger right now it's blocked what if you were in the news feed it says careful this could be an unsecured website oh just clicked on a link from TMZ the same thing for on Twitter Twitter so just might be malicious they're spam there could be from mines keep you from going to TMZ about it lawyer said to you know that actually proves that you sent them something some sort of diligence but there's just no recourse they're lost so explain so someone is trying to say on Facebook Messenger hey you should go check out minds.com it won't let you post that link and what is their excuse they don't tell you how to get into I don't know you don't know I'm not going to say that I know that it does unsecured and I'm pretty sure that Facebook got hacked you know they compromised everybody stayed I like you want to talk about unsecured there's no more unsecure site that exists it is kind of funny I mean after those hearings and after all the stuff yeah it's his kind of funny called somebody else on secure their insecure Mark Zuckerberg is very insecure he he seems like he's too rich like you f***** up like he's there sipping water like a robot trying to figure out what the f*** is doing with his life I think that they're scared because they know they've betrayed everybody and so it's hard to get them to to speak annoys interesting with with Dorothy hair because I speaking but the fact is that he's not answering the question well he's bringing somebody else into answer the questions the next go-round and so that should be very nice think he actually didn't know the answer those questions I think he probably doesn't know all the specifics because he's a CEO of not one but two different corporations he's busy s*** and also true but I think that when we look at the policy that exists on his networks like he is in control of the policy two great there's a boar I don't know if that's the decision making process but he has a large voice okay I don't know how large is voices I assume that's probably true but one of things we did detail on the last podcast with Tim pool was how he wasn't the CEO for quite a long time fired then rehired as there's some issues and you know there's a lot of money involved in these things I think that plays a giant part and how they decide to make decisions and but do you think that an Advertiser reality doesn't like say you're an Advertiser and you want to advertise your computer okay and there's a video on YouTube that is about something controversial does it actually make sense for that Advertiser to not show their product on that controversial video don't they want to sell computers well it depends I mean if the controversial videos are about Jews are evil and you have this video about Jews being evil and then you know they like Razer computers come on the right but do you think that people actually I can understand not wanting to support certain types of content and maybe advertisers feel like they're supporting that content by advertising next to it but I also don't think that people when they're watching a controversial video on the internet say oh my gosh you know this Advertiser is completely out of line for being next to this controversial thing well that's one way to look at it another way to look at it is if you are a giant company that sells things let's say your Toyota and you selling Tundras you don't want your Tundra's to be associated in any way with something that you might think is negative is their prerogative they're paying for advertising they can kind of decide this is one of the things that's leading YouTube and specific and I've had a ton of conversations about this it's leading them specifically to try to demonetize things that could be considered distasteful or insensitive or controversial and it's very frustrating to content creators when you talk to them they're essentially saying that they need to do better and that their tools are very blunt that they don't really have the correct Computer Learning tools to figure out what is offencive and why and then there's a human review system which is very weird and we've run into that many times we're like we'll have like a Castle they say Tom Papa who's an uncontroversial fantastic stand up comedian and it's like demonetized and there were like why what happened and then we go with the f****** we talk about we didn't talk about anything crazy and it's really damaging for Brands when it gets domantas right away cuz it's that initial time. That generates the most Revenue so when you have to go back and do it I mean so I agree with that but so we built a tool that's like a peer-to-peer advertising tool so it's not there's two options you can you earn crypto for your contributions and then which cryptos do you support we have an aetherium base token but we're going to support all of them aetherium base tokens so it's an erc20 token what does that mean it means that we basically reward people for all of their activities of Jamie's posted on mines and people love his posts he gets rewarded in some yeah how much how much is well and will give you a wasn't Impressions so you were not focused on like oh you're going to make money from this one token will give you a thousand depression you or you get a thousand persons from you get a token from 1000 pressions want when you use a token to advertise online you get a thousand Impressions when you boost your post with it so intimate if you use the crypto you use a token you guaranteed views yeah that's weird and then why well you guaranteeing people see something well we when you boosted it gets fed to people's Newsfeed chronologically so there's a backlog Instagram sponsored posts</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Distributing and I'm going to use the big are quotes hate speech that's when it gets slippery to me because who's to decide what's hate speech and what's not hate speech may have seen people make some ridiculous f****** statements about all sorts of people that are inaccurate and they do that in order to categorize them and pigeonhole them and in an easily definable and dismissible characterization you know you just decide hey that bill ottman guy that guy's of this oh he's a radical that and he believes in this call Kim and like okay f*** him sweeping right and then cancel culture comes in like going to cancel the allotment when I listen to him anymore do you know he lied to us about a source or whatever the f*** you doing have you heard of Daryl Davis no I have not once I forgot today was your boy and he got them all to leave you got to believe 200 members after he was like to talk to you you would never see the W kamau Bell's Show when he visited with those white supremacists not that specific one it's really good cuz he's such a nice guy he's so like easy to get along with that they were like sort of they let their guard down around them and you only get to see these people kind of confused they like this guy you know that's why I think initiating human contact right via the social networks like that's really important but to play Devil's Advocate it's one of the worst ways for people to express themselves in a way where you consider other human beings experiences and feelings and the way they're going to receive what you're saying cuz there's no social cues you not interacting with them not looking at them in the eyes it's one of the weirder forms of communication between human beings and one that I would we have not really necessarily successfully navigated it yet I agree I was actually saying that I think we should use social media more to get people to get together in real life do you know who Megan Phelps is she was with the Westboro Baptist Church you know the the famous one that the protests those soldiers funerals and you know anything gay and ruthlessly viciously fundamental Christians were real that they do a lot of protesting at funerals and do a lot of stuff to try to get shoes with them forever for the longest time and then got on Twitter and through communicating with your immune meet her you would never believe it in a million years that she was ever his fundamentalist that she was ever some mean person sending hateful messages to people because their son was gay or whatever it was now she's completely cure she says no contact with the church anymore she's married as a kid she's completely outside of it she does podcast now and give TED talks and speaks about radicalization in about how she was kind of indoctrinated in grew up in this family and her her grandfather Fred Phelps was this you know it's like it's a f****** mean guy like a really mean Vicki's the godhatesfags guy you know those signs at soldiers funerals troop Twitter to her communicating with people on Twitter specifically her now husband like cure like you just with rational discourse and communication at your school will change and so that's why I mean Ace of like Megan Phelps that's a real thing right she really did change another example is Christian P cleaning to know is he was a white supremacist KKK member died who's been on Sam Harris podcast is also done to Ted Talks who now speaks out against it and talks about how was indoctrinated and talks about how lost he was and then he was brought into this ideology there are there's many people like that all over the world maajid Nawaz another perfect example he was an islamist I mean he was you know trying to form a caliphate was literally thinking about radical Islamic terrorism is being some sort of a solution now he's the opposite now he's trying to get people to leave and is trying to get people to be more reasonable and secular and it would happen to him they got punched in the street yeah yeah some guy called him a f****** Paki I guess and punched him in the head and f***** his head up and he's got this giant cut on his head from a ring and his face is swollen up and apparently they have the guy on video and you know they think they're going to be able to arrest the guy on the show is a super nice guy the hard thing is that I guess we see the Transformations take place and makes us feel warm inside and yes people people can change but at the same time what are people have to shoot should people have to go apologize to Twitter oh I'm sorry like can I come back I mean that's not like sometimes people I think completely differently than you and you'd have to deal with it and that should be okay we we shouldn't force people to come in to our way of thinking in order to have discourse know that's a good point that's a very good point in like who is to decide what this path to Redemption is whether or not you've completed it right who's to side like maybe you are at like a hyper radical ft and maybe Jamie's point of you and yours are just never going to line up so you like f*** him and for life with a lot of people have been banned for life and when you look at some of the infractions they've been banned for it like boy I don't know about that one that is really makes it almost none of the high-profile Banning cases make much sense no it's like a short-term Solution that's creating a long-term problem that's really what it is so I just think that we have to talk about it more it's like why can't we just get everyone to talk about it at the same time I mean it's like we're just wasting time here well sort of but I also think we're figuring it out as we go along with a bunch of different competing ideologies you know you have yours which like you dude you look like a hacker unlike house of cards already guy you call in to break into the Mainframe server or not. Honestly I can I hang out on it lab check out cobit I I cannot I cannot code Clinic I'm not claiming to be a developer another level is incredible I understand I think though that you your ideology is going to be your at your point of view and perspective is going to be very different than maybe someone who's like a radical Marxist and I shouldn't they be a lot of Pope posting site to someone is like an extreme socialist someone like AOC you know someone someone who thinks that we should give money to people who are unwilling to work someone who thinks that we should try to engineer society and tax the top X percent in a 70-something percent of their income is a lot of those different people and we have to how to to make it so that we have to figure out a way to make it so all the ideas can compete in the marketplace of ideas right all these different ideas can compete we can find out which one is better and we can find out which one is better and you don't always find out which one is better the right you find out which one is the most I mean that's what happened with Hitler you find out what what's got more Jews behind it to to make it so that well we'd have to figure out a way to make it so all the ideas can compete in the marketplace of ideas right all these different ideas can compete we can find out which one is better and we can find out which one is better and he don't always find out which one is better the right you find out which one is with Hitler you find out what what's got more Jews behind it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> there's bottlenecks for Progress that are going to be there we're going to run into and I think ultimately information is one of the big ones and information also in a lot of ways is money you know I mean when we think of money we were thinking of ones and zeros are being moved around on bank accounts its data I mean it's attributed to different people and you get to do more things because you have are these numbers more of these things but what is it really it's not gold based anymore it's not a physical material material object that you're coveting now it's some weird thing and it's kind of like information on a database and what if we get to a certain point in time and I sort of feel like in this weird vague abstract way we're moving towards this with all its one of things that I want to really step back and wonder about this trend toward socialism and and Social Democratic thinking wonder what that is and I honestly think that we're moving towards this idea that hey and we've got a lot of f****** problems that could be cured if you move some of that money around and but but should you be able to move some of that money around and when what happens if that money becomes something different than what if people start developing social currency instead of financial currency it would have your ability to do things was based on how much put into me were assuming right we assume that the way we do things now where if you want to buy a car you have to have $35,000 that's how much a Mustang cost and you got to bring it to the bank and just not alone but what if we get to a time in the future where it's not these pieces of paper that give you material objects but rather your own actions and deeds provide you a social currency that allows you to go on vacations or allows you to eat at restaurants or allows you to do things and there's a running tally that's not outside of the realm of possibility now I think it reward systems within everything that were using are going to are going to rise up I mean that that's what we're already kind of doing I mean we reward tokens for now for activity we're good we're going to see that rise up in more things that we're doing what I'm saying is if it's a social currency and that your own personal Behavior allows you to access more or more Goods or more things it would encourage positive behavior and community-based behavior because that would be the only way to advance mean obviously there's a long time down the line but when the first caveman you know traded the first f****** Shiny Rock for the first spearhead in a whatever it was that they did that started this whole inevitable Trend towards money this is not something that has to be this way forever you know and I wonder when we're the distribution of information which is arguably not argue Play It's never never been like what we have today there's never been a time in human history where everyone had so much access information they used to have to pay for these have to go to school see if they used to have to earn your way to the position where you could open the very books that had all this information in it night get it off your phone it's instant and this is a whole different way of interfacing with information I think this is going to affect Ireland and this is a whole different way of interfacing with information I think this is going to affect Higher Learning institutes I think it's going to affect a lot of different things but I wonder if this all can be applied ultimately someday maybe not in our generation but some day to money that people start using social currency and that social currency is going to be almost like we have some sort of a database of social currency in this country</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> last couple years, he's been interested as lot of people that are fans of Donald Trump. People that aren't fans of Donald Trump and I think it's Petty for you to be upset with anybody cuz they chose to vote for whoever they chose to vote for I think it's stupid s*** but I will say this past election was interested in the sense that a lot of people were upset black people upset last election when were upset gay people upset but white people were really upset like white people where the pancreas and white people did not produce they voted black people is like black lives matter why people like we'll see about that in the morning and whenever you hear someone says we'll see about that in the morning it's going to be some change it's going to be some change comedy I don't think, should be a place with people exercise anger or be angry in what way like being mad like when Donald Trump first got elected you know personally like it was very interesting and I seen a lot of comments they could just go up there and be like you can find a way to say f*** Donald Trump or anybody but it doesn't have to be filled with any anger you don't say it doesn't have to be filled like f*** you like that why you say that people should be angry about how do you feel about without being angry make great points but even anybody on both sides could laugh at it yeah yeah the thing about Trump that it's interesting it's like the job shouldn't exist the job of what president yes it's a ridiculous idea to have 300 million people under the guidance of one that's insane and that one that one wins in a popularity contest that's insane it doesn't make sense great idea back when they were pilgrims it was a small colony and they just came over on a boat bracket it forget about the rest of this s*** so when you let a guy like that like try to be present know you're not going to be happy not going to be happy is that the first time you saw Ted Danson I'm not talk about you about Trump before that that people enjoyed it was not a lot of rap lyrics he was like the old like people would probably still be if he was a rapper you thought you knew a person you thought you knew even when he got elected up in a lot of people thought they knew him right they thought they knew him they thought the image like the billion-dollar Playboy what you thought you knew but then when you got to know him but maybe I didn't know him when you got to see him as president even now we got to let the people upset about it but I think a lot of people Somebody Loves You know what maybe all of that s*** was just to get elected maybe that energy was get elected and if that was the case that he mastered it he mask how to get connect with his base he messed it he mastered how to get not everybody to fuk with you but just the right amount of people it was a popularity contest was also do like these people got hit in it and he figured that out where did I don't get some point Joe people would like pie run is over now let's see who you really are and I think it's so many examples of when you felt like he could have showed people example example that he saw everybody Brian opposing just as base he gives the impression that you know I only care about these people that elected me you one right but you have a responsibility to everybody and it just don't have that feeling even on my social media I don't go hard I keep it kind of neutral but I said something and somebody said well the last time I checked on L the economy was doing well and I said you can't confuse the economy with humanity and that's the thing and that's what people don't feel good about you can't out all the numbers you can talk all the numbers you want black unemployment numbers all the numbers but how do people feel and I'm saying then that representative they don't feel don't they don't feel represented don't they don't feel like I can rock it either way but Democrat Republican views of Republicans like yo that's right up my alley I get it but it's same time it may not sound right to log people but it's the human factor of it you don't sound like you want to feel good so many people don't know the economy is doing well cuz they don't feel good I believe when Obama ran by his campaign was changed Donald Trump make America great again either one of them could Randolph each other's campaign slogan do you know after Bush Obama could have said make America great again and it would have electrified the bass the same as change true they said the same f****** thing that would be a great thing for Obama I do it's salting or get people upset is like you keep pushing a narrative makeamericagreatagain makeamericagreatagain you keep pushing it as if America was so f***** up before you took office and that's not the case right like when Obama took it from brush he was making America great again you talk about a shitshow and the thing that people if you took it respect it was never nothing Lacewood and it was never it wasn't no you do you see this mess bush left me it was never like this m*********** it was never no mention to see that new movie about Bush this year I didn't see it either what's it called Jamie is it out of the one with the thing about Bush and Cheney is like that movie kind of makes it seem like Cheney was the guy pulling the strings and Bush was like simple happy-go-lucky guy who just roped into being president because he was the son of a president like all The Crazy Ones yet to come from no bid contracts it worth billions of dollars to get the refills if I sound crazy if I had to have a pic of who I would have wanted to be the Republican candidate it was on the Republican side was on I like Jeb Bush I didn't really get to know him at all that's if there was something that I don't know I just thought that he had he was like a Cadillac mama's boy I think he probably out of all the kids I probably think that he probably was the one that thought a little outside of what their normal has a successful businessman Trump put all the motherfuking taste like how you got your nickname yeah yeah yeah yeah like $5 donations if you were he was when we went and Obama's running that he was the first person to use Facebook the way he did really a man to have so many every goddamn day it was Obama asked but he wouldn't ask for like Millions he would just like like a dude in the hood let me hold $5 right now bx4 f****** $20 and then here I start it again and then it got so bad that Michelle was send me an email but he just he nickeled and dimed America and that's what support his campaign and the fact that he was right at the turn of of of a of a form of media that you could use to your advantage he was the Facebook guy he Reach people Facebook Donald Trump doing the same thing to Twitter I can reach people he was

		<div class="paragraph"> right to be stunned I give you can get to see the exact engagement in a good article in the New York Times on the front page versus one of Donald Trump's tweets 101 the most interesting tweeters out there people have mixed feelings about it. Right now I don't know how much of that is two things one Obama called the jackass that's the way on youth that's a little bit you know and then Obama when Obama is gone Trump takes office Trump is willing to let him talk Trump trump will charm him out with that said like when I do white clothes black clubs whatever do all type of Club but the thing is you Kanye West has a voice not to me as much as black people or Tylenol we don't have to be places that everybody is waiting to hear whether whatever comes out he has a voice I believe they Kanye West is trying to say something I just don't know what the f*** is trying to say because I'm not fluent in easy I barely know Swahili I could do that if there was some type of interpreter Kanye West's of the Indian Dave Chappelle and his concert interpreter that would be hilarious the phone but where to take from studying them to pay attention cuz we're supposed to eventually do a podcast one day is I think he's he's thinks different he connects. Different and it's one of the reasons why he's so prolific with music that's what I'm some people that think like that they don't know how to get it out it's like this speaker did this was funny to make that kind of like Father Figure to me like when I was younger I thought you three hit me with the horrific you know father was in the in the shootout a drive-by and this was f****** up bro he said yeah when I was younger my parents separated at a young age first off you had Parents you already winning motherfuker none of my niggas up to the whole thing is I'm pretty sure at some point Kanye West will be able to speak a language that everybody can understand until then it's only a handful of people just speak and understand it and also right but here's my problem with all this and I've been thinking about this a lot they want to medicate him right look how effective he is makes it people love handle voice creates clothes okay he's married his wife and dialogue to his wife makes hundreds of millions of dollars they're insanely wealthy insanely successful if you want to talk about overall success there together they have children they're super wealthy incredible art that's loved worldwide and they want to medicate them to stop and think about how effective they want to medicate him to operate at what level Frank about how effective he is and yet they wanted medication off when he's off medication he said himself he's as most creative stop and think about how creative he's been how successful is how well-received happy and all these other elements in this life but yet they want him to act the way they want him to act the black we wasn't mad cuz he would have had that was bad cuz it wasn't a city that is looking for a new era if that was a new era they would have been more accepting of it back we just don't want Dad but it's red and white now that that's a problem anything with red with white letters scamming and punch you she had a make America great again and look like he had the original why you know how you got it you know how you got a Boston fan to you like you only you know and I went up to him and I get a picture with you and I took the picture was a video I was like yeah motherfuker y'all see if that he started laughing and we had a good moment it wasn't no I wasn't angry him I'm not going to let think it's hard to get away from it but I think what Kanye with the hat he likes the idea of how it gets people flustered is it on Prairie in a lot of yeah and I was talking to I heard him like this he's triggered and I wasn't I wasn't trying about it but I was trick what I've been triggered by is how you make me feel with that hot know.. You know remind me with the hat on with some f*****-up energy and I can feel it but the energy he gave me was like I know this may sound crazy was like yo you're funny motherfuker with the head on your leg okay I didn't give a f*** cuz I couldn't let him I couldn't let him make me feel like if that's what his intent was he's going to be so uncomfortable I couldn't do it seemed I was trying to make you feel energy he gave me was like I know this may sound crazy was like yo you'll funny motherfuker with the hat on your leg okay I didn't give a f*** right cuz I couldn't let him I couldn't let him make me feel like if that's what his intent was he's going to be so uncomfortable couldn't do it seem like you was trying to make you feel like you really that's who it was</div>

knowledge as you are but wasn't on Christopher Reeve trying to promote it more stem cell research I'm sure he was so I had that spinal cord injury from your horse horse accident he was doing those horse jumps yeah babies till I get to stem cells for section 12 all Races backgrounds together to do the thing that we all have in common and that's the lap and also to not push the button with touch on Rachel stuff without having a angry undertone and that's what's so f***** up about American then whenever you talk about race it feels like one side somebody has to be tense and I know things are intense but we have to be able left her people laughed you can talk about whatever you want and then even if a person is not in agreement or have the same thoughts at the end of the day you should be able to respect that person and I think those same people should be able to share laugh yeah and there was a fun silly non-aggressive quality to the way you guys put together sketches that got the point across and everybody laughs you would think I'm going to draw Sartorius because I'm black which out you know which I am and I do but it's where I can go to places and it's straight up like Dave called the muddy boot motherfukers you don't say it like the money book motherfukers muddy boots that got John Deere right to talk to me you know do John Deere is know all that s*** I have those people and I have heard people but it's just interest when you can look out and this one that showed it when you can look on the order and you say you have all of America in there it was the best sketch comedy show in the history of Television I think I think In Living Color is very very very overlooked people forget how goddamn breaking and groundbreaking every 10 years or 15 years come to town with the artist want something different border down same way when In Living Color Stay with Def Comedy Jam came out you know you didn't see a lot of black stand-up on TV but they had these underground circuit that was bubbling that was wobbling and it was never the right time when they pulled out the Right Time In Living Color comes around it's the right time they Chappelle show comes around and it caught on it the right time yeah it in terms of like groundbreaking sketch comedy shows though like that that that KKK bit where he had the the Blind and came off so hardcore the first night it's hard to beat your heart as it comes when when when we asked why why after all these years because she's a Niger lover used to do I was a woman comedian for Chappelle Show so whenever you saw Chappelle Show episode if you noticed that whenever I came on stream then I'm not being cocky people to go nuts old s*** in the reason was because I was a guy that wanted the orders before Dave came out I knew if I go get the room at the beginning people don't like people don't even didn't nobody knew I wasn't there if I rip that at the beginning Simeon screens can be like it's going to be big your hearts and that show man it was just like it was just a lot of things happen that show people like the Rick James sketch the day we play that doing the wraparound man I should hit so hard I was like this s*** is crazy here's the funny Charlie Murphy was funny in it and I watched we ran that s*** just to let you know the directional people think I wasn't should sick time and every time every time you heard Dave's like I'm Rick James b**** it was good it was God's son the schedule is getting kids to spend it in school right now may not see it that's the problem with working with Executives to write it's like their Visions different than your vision is like the shape you in a certain way and you know it and I know Dave ran into problems with them wanted them to change language and it said they could get more sponsors I think that that wasn't an issue and to be quite honest I don't know exactly what happened everything is speculation you never talk to the reason why I never talked about it I didn't need to talk to him about it even saying that show was great for me there's a great play platform for me and then out it was more important my friendship and how he felt away from that was more important then so why'd you leave where'd you go as long as you okay cited and I was just like you know whatever it was we had a moment we made history and people go on people going to do other things you just keep it moving well that show was really people always say Daniel if it wasn't for the Chappelle show this to that Chappelle Show gave me a platform for people to see what I've been doing for years and you know you see Thomas in the club now you see him up for this good of shape but s*** but will they get the right platform for the world to you given everything and can separate you see Windows go from one level to Next Level who has the right platforms to Showcase a talent show did that for me and with that said I gave that show everything every time I had a second on camera every time like if you look at two and a half years on that show if you had an editor breakdown how many times I spoke it would probably be a total of 4 minutes I'll get a word here I get a phrase here but I told myself ebony turn a motherfuking camera I'm going for it like even if I'm not talkin I'm going to make my body so expressive that your iPod drawers to with no tell me what time he said cuz I always will cuz I'll come up with a line or something throwing it and we were doing it Rick James sketch and I didn't have a bike I was Sam and Neil said how to say anything I was like f*** so I told myself when he smacks this m*********** cuz if you look at that scene when he smacks I said what the f*** I was like a like a Washington Square Park mine that you talk to me when you need to act like anything the best thing to do is figure out a way to get on a set you get on a set your YouTube background you learn you get opportunities you got to be around it you got to get a

Thank you and I both know very well you know what we've all seen it and thankfully the people that seem to be the best for whatever reason are the some of the best hand like Dave doesn't show any of that but there's some people to do and that narcissism is weird that that wanted it to be all about them and then was how do sneaky s*** like fake an attack like that's that's a symptom of that same kind of thinking it just it just got desperate and went in some crazy way it was officer a reason because you have people like when we first went down you have people that normal people do look at okay that's my friend or whoever you started having side eyes and that's just it's just it's so messed up also is messed up as much as people wrote for him when they thought that it was an injustice everything nobody's really talked about it nobody is addressed Me Like You Do This is Our Moment these are things that we would try to progress toward but this was an isolated incident and just say how awful it was you but you know the beautiful thing is that people weigh more tolerant than they ever have been before. So beautiful things attack didn't happen one more atrocious thing that people have done to another person for no reason that's good and it's also good that you get to see where that kind of stuff heads we are always looking to be a victim to the point where you realize there's like some sort of currency and being a victim so people fake being a victim so they can get all this f****** attention it's good for us it's good for us to see they said it makes you start second-guessing thing and that's another thing that was awful about the whole thing when all the smoke he's getting right now and he deserved cuz I've been tearing his ass up on Instagram on everything he deserves every bit of his daughter but making her sit in the backyard by a tree and then he went out there and an hour later and she was gone and they suspect that coyotes God I remember thinking that story going man that just does not sound real that does not sound real just seems weird yeah you got left a baby in the backyard and coyotes got it like weed doesn't sound real sometimes stories don't sound real I thought it was a situation where Lee Daniels and ingesting set down in the writers room and Lee Daniels lay anybody got any ideas for any new episodes I believe that I believe that part ID within the whole story and Lead are you said to nobody's going to believe it just got upset and told them told me then we'll see I'm going to shoot myself and he walked to self into that that whole scenario and it's just that's entirely possible that's what it sounds like a lot of people were being very sarcastic that's entirely possible that's what it sounds like that like that you going to stay there was a fan of Empire which I know a lot of people that's listening were being very sarcastic when I say that they going to be like second-guessing the storyline of so many don't show the storyline of everybody who ever said that they were done wrong or anything that's awful thing about this is going to be ready a quick to just second-guess everything that you say</div>

with much of the similar functionality think about how how much further the world be if everyone was building on top of more common but you're looking at it in terms of your own personal benefit you're looking in terms of Mines personal benefit me created this thing it's not just pure for altruistic reasons it's business right so if they had establishes open source Network that was Facebook and you just came along a built yours without yeah that would be great for you but why would that be great for them and they're obviously in a business the problem with the business is this business is the business of Distributing information and then we have to decide okay at what point in time do we allow these are quotes overlords to dictate what can and cannot be distributed and how did this happen because in the beginning I bet it didn't happen I bet in the beginning you can just put on whatever the f*** you wanted and then they had to deal with that and they had to figure out after 100K maybe we shouldn't have this on like hey if we're going to sell advertising really should maximize the amount of clicks okay how do we do that when we put things in people's feeds they want to see we put things that people want a debate about an argue about and political things all sorts of different things that excite them and get them to be engaged with the platform that's that's their business to businesses I mean it's no different in a lot of ways and Amazon or than any other business that wants to grow like how did how do they grow up while they grow by maximizing their profits and by maximizing the amount of eyes that get to their advertising so they four clicks more people get engaged that's what their businesses you are deciding by saying if they were open source look how much further on the world would be what would be further along to I don't know if they would agree with that I don't know what they're worth f****** cajillions of dollars so they figured it out while it just depends on whether or not you think that people have a right to know what is going on it's I mean it's like food transparency we're interfacing with this and it's affecting us I fully agree with what you're saying I'm playing Devil's Advocate by saying that in their position they have a business and their business is to make money and they're going to lose because of what they're doing because it is insane up even after losing active users a long time for us to build it up as we do all of these different organizations and companies working together but Linux for instance is doctoring system that most banks it is the most popular operating system the world it's everywhere it got there because of Facebook but they are all using free and open source software in there Jack's they're just not sharing their products with everybody else they're benefiting from it but not giving back and I almost feel like I shouldn't even be saying that they should just pivot because you know that's their only chance to survive so this is based on your estimation to the Future yeah it just seems like things are becoming more open and if guess I'll have the similar ideas you just have to look what's happening with Bitcoin I don't know what's happening with Bitcoin it's becoming a Bitcoin and ethereum and you know lots of other blockchains are are are growing really fast maybe the you know the prices separate the development energy the number of people who are building apps on top of Bitcoin and ethereum is growing massively there's there's it's a whole new infrastructure that's like a common protocol that people can build on so that is growing rapidly the prices secondary that's not even what Bitcoin and ethereum are really about it's it's it's a decentralized database so this is just where the internet the internet is meant to be decentralized start out that way and then we moved into this like web to Stylo system with like just these massive companies that are controlling everything but it's going to it's going to keep waving okay again to play Devil's Advocate a vast amount of users are not using those platforms Avast money users are using these control platforms like Facebook and Instagram and Twitter like if that's if you're if you're talking about I'm just guessing but if you talkin about the the the gross number of human beings that are interacting with each other on social media they're mostly uncontrolled Networks you're saying this is not going to last but there's no evidence that it isn't going through tons of evidence what is the evidence Wikipedia what happened at in-car remember that disc you put in your computer that was your encyclopedia where is that no one uses it it's okay that's that's different this is not a social media Network social media networks of people using or almost all controlled I would say 10 years and what do you think is going to be the Catalyst like was going to cause these people to make this route the open-source I think we have to be we have responsibilities to be competitive functionally like Minds does we do we're getting we're moving there fast like we just hired a ton of new developers and it's going to take time we're not there yet but once we have functionally competitive products that you wouldn't even know the difference and there's enough people there then it's basically the decision of you know am I going to choose the one that respects my first in Freedom or the one that doesn't mean people are kids don't like Facebook right now everyone is sick of it we're just drug addicts is that what it is they're just sucked into this thing where U console want to check and see who's riding what and monopolies Google almost everything then you let go know if I'll be good right by everything and you know he's talking about Bitcoin like this important new internet money simultaneous which is he knows the infrastructure is open but then his platforms are the opposite why is he so inconsistent it's like there's just hypocritical to the maximum I think it's partly because it's a giant business you know I think when you have an obligation to your share intermax my profits when you trying to maximize profits too and there's the Des Universal growth model or every year just has to get a little bit bigger otherwise you're f****** up as a CEO like do you don't have to experience that with mines or when the co-founders how many people are involved like 15 of us now and do you have like a board we sit around we make critical decisions such principles how we're doing things so we're not in a position where we would ever change that that that's for us to do that would just be a total waste of time so we're making it harder for ourselves to make money in the beginning we're making it harder for a cell to grow because we are not going to compromise people's privacy in order to do those things and so we're just going to build up slowly steadily change that that that's for us to do that would just be a total waste of time so we're making it harder for ourselves to make money in the beginning we're making it harder for ourselves to grow because we are not going to compromise people's privacy in order to do those things and so we're just going to build up slowly steadily just get there when we get there</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> on that one and a lot of it has to do with social media and a lot of it has to do with the impact that it has and young people do you know you are not really designed for this and you might be able to handle it if you're 32 year-old man or a 35 year-old woman or whatever you are but if you're a fifteen-year-old girl this might be overwhelming I mean and The Angst and anxiety and you know want to go see about the depression you know they see if they're not at a party for their stuff not getting liked that has an impact on them and ultimately I think the networks need to be helping educate people how to you know whether it's disinfo educate people how to research I did see that YouTube is starting to do like how you been on this for too long type thing really yeah a life you f*** yeah they tell you that I want to build stuff like that. That's really important helping people get off Tubidy kicking me off I have it's easy you know it was I sent Eddie Bravo The Thing from the guardian about the upsurge people believe in a flat Earth and all of it because of YouTube videos and that apparently now YouTube is they want to censor those they want to leave they they feel like Flat Earth videos and I think another one check the check this if I'm wrong about this I think they also want to lean on those anti-vaccination videos I think there's a concern with those I think they're worried about a bunch of different things along those lines you know like they feel like there's disinformation and outright lies being spread how do we combat it we on this platform what do we do with it feel like to have a responsibility I think there is responsibility but able what is the responsibility if there's a debate I think it's more to educate people have to research as opposed to say this is or is not true because who's deciding that well I believe the Earth is round but I also believe it's such a stupid conspiracy that you should have it you should be allowed and it should be something you should show your friends like dude I need to go look at this this has 37,000 thumbs up and they really believe that the fucken Earth is flat they really believe this nice wall outside Antarctica they really believe that Sky doesn't move that it's that the you know that we're in some sort of a I think it's like projected images or something like there's a bunch of like really really wacky theories like I think those are okay of course but I think Freedom of Information sort of transcends a lot of these little debates so if there was more Freedom of Information so we actually knew everything the government knew about all of the different conspiracies and I think Freedom of Information sort of transcends a lot of these little debates so if there was more Freedom of Information so we actually knew everything the government knew about all of the different conspiracies and black projects the black budget you know more information is going to get both side the ability to understand what is happening that is true of the reality is we don't know what's happening and there is lots of secret stuff</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> urgent cares about privacy which maybe it doesn't turn CERN overthinks the FBI I don't know exactly what but we don't know what the Apple phones are doing an apple is all locked down closed source and additionally there was a creepy speech that Tim Cook just just gave creepy did you see it let's listen to a speech you might get in trouble for that so again it's good intentions like people who want less hate speech we all want we want to be able to get along better but this idea that I don't want to give it too much way but you know he's acting as if they are going to be the moral Authority about the types of content of can exist on the App Store so I just don't know that's scalable yeah what does that mean like a CEO Tim Cook Banning hate division is the right thing to do 12-3-2018 is that it December okay let's hear Tim volume please the most important is how we honor a teaching that can be found in Judaism but it shared across all faiths and traditions it's a lesson that was carried forward by the laid Elie Wiesel may his memory be a blessing it's a lesson put into practice by America's Muslim Community who raised thousands for the victims of the tree of life killing loti mode aldim reactor do not be indifferent to the Bloodshed of your fellow man do not be indifferent this mandate moves us to speak up for immigrants and for those who seek opportunity in the United States we do it not only because their individual dignity creativity and Ingenuity have the to make this country and even better place but because our own Humanity commands us to welcome those who need need welcome it moves us to speak up for the lgbtq community for those whose differences can make them a target for violent Sandstorm we do so not only because these unique and uncommon perspectives can open our eyes to new ways of but because our own dignity loses to see the dignity and others perhaps most importantly it drives us not to be bystanders bystanders at hate tries to make its headquarters in the digital world and apple we believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on this challenge there was no time to get tied up in that's why we only have one message for those who seek to push hate Division and violence you have no place on our platforms you have no home here from the earliest is the bike chains to Apple music today we have always prohibited music with a message of white supremacy hold on so you really think they're signaling here I go they signaling that they're about to start censoring things like what it where are they are they are they probably shouldn't put white supremacy music on but there's a lot to like really violent stuff you can get on iTunes right I mean go back to the old NWA albums there's some that's available right and then they have how about the film's you can get on the iTunes Store there is a lot of very very very violent films like extremely violent there's a lot of films that like is it that they're making distinctions between something that's fiction that though it may be disturbing you understand this is a movie and this is something someone wrote versus someone ART versus versus someone with commentary there commentaries it and then the other thing when he was saying hate and division they won't promote division but that's a weird one that mean people who disagree with you and what is division she's not allowing the conversation to take play so this is in direct conflict with the Darrell Davis's with confronting these issues so but but I think wouldn't when they're when he saying you have no place on our platform they probably feel like you can go somewhere else he's building a wall me but this is what I'm saying like everybody kind of feels like you can go somewhere else happens that way until things get more radicalized and everybody goes tab so I don't know what the conversation needs to take place people in the lab he's acting like he's speaking for all lgbtq people you know not there's a lots of people on the left and lgbtq people aren't always on the left and not all of them want that there's division in lbgt and Q there's a big issue right now with Martina Navratilova that was going on about her discussing the reality of trans women competing against biological women and that she opposes it and she thinks is there some fundamental advantages which is leading to a lot of weightlifting World Records being broken by trans women she's like this is f****** Preposterous including trans women with penises now they're attacking her for being transphobic so there's not even a United United opinion in the lbgt shoe Community for sure and that's why that Megan Murphy I think she is I go to this restaurant in Bridgeport Connecticut called bloodroot which is like sort of an old-school feminist like vegetarian vegan spot and Bridgeport in Bridgeport Wild For The Comedy Club so so the only guy with a shoe there and I'll be the guy in the face with shoe pull the shoe off in Smyrna de mean I was 24 I know what the f*** was going on so anyway though that restaurant do you know they get called what is it turf turf trans exclusionary radical look you know we're not against your your battle Riley we're not against trans rights, who would be angry grandson but they're just saying that's not our think so again there's diversity in there trying to calm everyone together in the whole intersectional world and people want to band together to suppress groups want to ban together they should but like it's not that simple well there's always going to be a differing opinions and especially when you have something like trans women competing against biological women and you know you have someone like Martina Navratilova that made her her life's work and her career competing as a biological woman she's going to have some opposition to that and then the idea that everyone supposed to be lumped in together with some mandate that no one is really openly discussed your supposed to agree and it fluctuates and moves like the tide you know like what is an is it moves like the tide it should changes it's like this court of public opinion it's it's constantly rendering new verdicts and you have to keep up and catch up things that were acceptable just a few years ago or totally unacceptable it mean comedy is is the key area to is not what what's happening on social media now not sustainable for comedy because it's fine pressure like believe me there's a lot of blowback and believe me there's a lot of debate and discussion but also believe me when someone does do some Politically Incorrect really good stand-up people go f****** Bonkers they love it it's going it's like one of the best times ever right now to do stand-up people go f****** a bottle yeah I know it's incredible material but I'm just saying for you know Comics that are running into issues with getting banned I mean who's running issues with getting banned I mean I think you know 101 yeah yeah yeah and you know you can make some arguments and not doing so well right now but he's also developing his following because the fact is people that don't agree with him being banned he's he's a very specific example other people that are being banned do you know about other what other stand-up comedians in a bunch of them Exxon haven't been fully been friends with me but they've had their performances shutdown who's that one guy who's at fault but that was at a college see the same thing yes but universities have been bad for that for a long time and now they're the most sensitive of all audiences and they're the ones who are the most they believe them they're going to change the world and that their ideals are their ideal to rock-solid and that you have to push back against anything that opposes them re was temporarily banned for that was an accident sorry thing was he was joking around and they thought he was making legitimate death threat all the time has to be a new approach completely it can't just be all wet them back on and and just keep doing what they're doing like we need to completely re-approach how moderation is happening the whole policies situation the transparency situation is not just a matter of going to the overlords and saying can I can I please come back that's not that's not suitable for the communique structure of the planet Earth suitable is that Commerce should not dictate how human beings are allowed openly communicate with each other and one things that Jack said it's kind of contrary to his company's actions was that he believed that the ability communicate as a fundamental right like the ability to get electricity because you're in the KKK you can still order electricity you know so should you be able to just distribute information if people say no then you have to say Okay well who's to decide what company's actions was it he believes that the ability to communicate as a fundamental right like the ability to get electricity because you're in the KKK you could still order electricity you know so should you be able to just distribute information if people say no then you have to say Okay well who's to decide what can and cannot be distributed and then who's to decide if they can go somewhere else and then what happens if you tell a person they can't go anywhere then things get really weird</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is just essential like the big networks there's no excuse for them not to be sharing a software Bryant's like when you're a public forum on that scale the community just has a right to know what the algorithms are doing so you think that they're not sharing their software because their software is encoded and designed to spy on you extract information and sell that information partially when Jamie gives up your contacts &amp; Sons up for a nap yes you can get access to all my contacts there's a lot of reason and they don't want people to compete with them like anyone can actually take all of our code and make their own social networking compete with us they could start set up on their own servers and we encourage that that's what like the Federer verse is called that's with Elon Musk does with Tesla all of his electric patents for electric cars I think that he open up the pants I don't think if he open-sourced all the the code of the car right he's definitely moving in the right direction of wants to build the market yes and he also wants to save the world to me and you legitimately has any also has a shitload of money and kind of funny is more Community run and evolved wouldn't that be the network that you would think Humanity want to stick with in the long-term like a good movie yes and no for the average person what are they losing when they get on Facebook or Google what is it when was bad would happen on that or legs are going down everybody's lights are going down and that makes everyone very sad we mean for the algorithms you're only reaching 5% of your own followers organically on Facebook now and they're starting to change the chronological feed on Instagram too and they no did this cause depression and they're still doing it because they know that the you know they're they think they're better at showing you what you want to see then you are and they want to make money from it what do you mean by they know that this causes depression they've done studies about mental health in relation to actually Facebook got exposed like 5 years ago for doing a secret study on like a few million users where they were injecting both positive and content into the newsfeed and they proved they could affect people's moods this was with Princeton there's a huge backup they're like oh sorry looks right but this isn't injecting negative or positive content this is just moving these images are these posts around so that lets people see them there's two different topics are the basic newsfeed on Facebook is now a mysterious conglomeration of thousands of variables and but additionally like a few years ago they were exposed for having been experimenting with people's brains that's right I remember that now I remember that now that that's right yeah I remember thinking like wow that's kind of creepy to make it better do you think that they're really that's a factor that it act it actually cut mean how does it cause depression if they're just if your images are your posts are not being seen by as many people have you talked to kids posting on social media and their reactions to how many likes they're getting they get very very concerned that seems like more of a problem with that it is both is that it is being addicted to blacks or some sort of you know the weirdo give me yeah it's not healthy and we need to learn to not care about that but I think that the core purpose of a social network is to subscribe to someone and see their stuff and when people subscribe to you so when you spend years building up a following on social media and say you are in a hundred thousand now your friends can't do that anymore that's not cool and end even like Twitter's default news feed is no longer chronological you have to click it to go chronological and then it defaults back to their weird algorithm think so we're saying look hundred percent organic chronological raw forever as default and then if you want to trade you know algorithms or have recommended stuff come in as an alternative fine but that is the core social media is to connect with people that follow you and Delaware what do you think the purpose is like why do you think Facebook would decide to have things not in chronological order and only be seen by 5% of your followers like what will be the benefit and that for them revenue revenue how so how's that generate Revenue they just know that they can keep you on the out better if you had left likes know your stuff seen by less people to make sense that's a good point it sort of works both ways I think that they think they know the people that you're going to react to the most so as a consumer when you're getting that content you know that our lives are showing you what you typically like if you noticed that I'm really not paying as much attention but I believe you so yeah for Creator it's hurting creators people who post are getting hurt people who are sitting there rolling they're the ones who are really getting addicted more so with the algorithms so how are the people that are posting getting hurt they're going to hurt because their stuff is being seen by last people because it's not chronological and it's not organic cuz it's curated huh but aren't they doing it because they think it's going to be a better and an experience it's more conducive to your life that's what they say what do you think they're doing it for then they're doing it because they have studied through look the date on how to keep people on the app more right and that way is to give them I saved by Google or if I look at muscle cars on Instagram now if I go to my search it's all muscle car stuff so that's what it is they say all he likes that so we can get him a lot of that and I think that's okay as an alternative feed or to put that somewhere I just think the corfid always needs to stay pure because otherwise you're just down the slippery slope again and Care Bear injecting things into your head that you didn't ask for right and they're doing it because they want to keep you around yeah that makes sense how many different companies are worth subscribing to that is it seems like all the big ones were saying or curating and moving things around and all the big ones have an algorithm this designed to keep you on board right and that's okay to pursue I think there's a really cool things you can do with AI and machine learning and beneficial but it's just taking away people's reach when they have worked years and years to achieve it it's not okay do you think that this is this marriage between something that is this social media Network that's designed to allow people to communicate with each other and then Commerce like this business like how do we maximize this business how do I get more profit out of this business how do we get these people to engage more and then they start monkeying with the code and screwing with what you see and what you don't say what's happening yeah but in the short-term it's probably working but no longer arms are betraying everybody's trust has to be more of a consent-based system so you know at least give people walk at should be opt out by default and find give me messages to opt-in so that you can show me certain things but this whole Force forcing people into surveillance is it just has to stop it's super scary how's the super scary to you it's just too much power yeah it's too much power for something that supposed to be silly right like what was Facebook supposed to be supposed to be some silly thing that you just can't communicate with friends it was but from the beginning all of these none of these networks have ever really been about the people of the network it's always been closed Source since Inception so but then you look it open that works out there if Wikipedia totally open source Community Ron granted they have their issues with moderation fine but it's a top 10 website in the world is totally open source Creative Commons content incredible human achievement Bitcoin open source money WordPress even is an open source CMS system that is like powering 25% of the internet so why wouldn't that happen with social media it should I mean this where am I taking out so we should all sort of collectively even own it we did an equity crowdfunding around 2,000 members of our community actually on the site how many people are on lawns registered quarter million active but the weird thing is that even though we're fraction the size especially smaller Creator to come get better reach on Minds than they do on Facebook and Twitter because we have this reward incentive system sort of like gamified where you earn reach and you earn more of a voice for contributing so you could have an account on Twitter for 10 years and post thousands and thousands of tweets and you never hit that Viral nerve and you just never never really get much exposure so we're trying to help people be heard and so you'll find a small Creator who on other networks has no followers have thousands and thousands of hours a month and what do you think you would like to do with mines in the future how many will do yet engineer the control out of ourselves so that we aren't even in a position to really you know take people stuff down or what if someone posts your house and your information where you could go to school I think that on the central servers obviously yes we're always going to moderate and if it's legal Dave's not legal it can't but a decentralized social network is definitely where we have to go because and yeah yeah okay it's it's scary and you know you talked about this like things are getting more transparent Our Lives sort of like the inevitable evolution of technology I mean how many hours a day do you stream a couple you know 25 years ago would you thought you'd be sharing you know 20% of your life live streaming to a million people like your our lives are becoming more transparent just inevitably to the pulling us so you know Bitcoin crypto. Torrent torrent type architecture that is just where we're going because it more resilient it's less censorship prone there's just benefits of it I think that we can bounce it to like maybe when you post you have a do you want to be able to delete this at any point all right fine then you can post a central server do you want this to get Unleashed yeah it's scary because another scary stuff on the internet it's already like that but getting into censorship more does censorship even solve the problem or does it make it worse what problem the problem of crazy content illegal content station and it definitely when you censor people it just makes them aware that there's plot against them to write it's like a lot of conservatism Twitter find that 70s Sam Harris actually just sent me an article that was detailing the bias against conservatives on Twitter that they actually done you know like some real studying it and it's pretty demonstrate herbal demonstrable it affects both the left and the right yeah I'm saying it wrong but it's it affects the left and right for sure I watch that video that he did and he seems to be getting targeted and so he's been censored on FaceTime what kind of games the right to be there and I mean look at this is not YouTube's fault but remember the YouTube shooter I mean she thought she was getting censored on YouTube and she went and brought a gun to the YouTube headquarters like people get pissed when they gets answered it affects you right but in her case you talk about a crazy person but she just thought this wasn't she just wasn't getting promoted the way she wanted to do it when I don't think anybody was actively doing anything at her not saying their stuff with Tim saying that the soft censorship of the algorithms people getting demonetized this has an impact on psychology okay so I'm not saying they were deliberately targeting her and it's a horrible would happen but yeah so what you're saying is that these algorithms that they use in order to Max the revenue and give people things they like but actually takes away from things being posted chronologically keep certain things from being seen by as many people so keeps him from being as viral so keep the whole thing for being organic yeah you know make sense yeah it's it gets to that point where we're realizing that all of these things all the social media things are really recent we going to have them for a few years and we don't necessarily know what the rules show you shouldn't be so it's good that means one reason why I want to have you on I wanted to find out where these upstarts were these new people are there coming into the game like Minds like where you're coming into the game from and what what is your position of what's wrong with the current state of affairs is messed up stuff on social media like I'm not we'll get pigeonholed into like artists musicians filmmakers activist journalists just trying to get their contact out there is a very tiny minority of like actually you know crazy content but when you said crazy content what you mean you all right yeah I mean I'm not even going to make decisions on what is and isn't crazy that's not that's not my place but the it's been proven that censorship is not the answer I mean make decisions on what is and isn't crazy that's not that's not my place but the it's been proven that censorship is not the answer I mean look at the history of prohibition digital content its substances it's it's anything in 4 people want information they want the ability to make the decision for themselves</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> all of the stuff I wanted to know what time school shootings right it's like the topic of the day I don't have a solution for it but I know it's not going to be overnight it'll be generational in nature just like it crept in generational denature I think a lot of these problems people look for a light switch solution where the solution in and of itself is the exact opposite of that yeah I think you're right I don't see any solution to that either and I think there's a lot of positions that people feel like they're supposed to take and if you're on the left a position that you're supposed to take his gun control get rid of the guns the guns are the problem look at all these people shooting people with guns guns guns guns and all the mass shootings what they have in common guns they all have guns in common they want to take away guns and then there's the people on the right and lucky you know I never done anything wrong with my gun not taking my f****** gun and then there's this f****** Unstoppable battle between these two sides and that there's a lot of factors like what it what happens to a women that lead them to get to the state of mine with her able to go into a school and shoot it up like what is that what what what what could possibly be going on how do we stop that from ever taking place these people have to be in some sort of insane pain there has to be something unbelievably wrong with their life that they're capable of doing this how do we stop that how do we look at that is like this is our our Global community of is our national Community how do we stop this from happening in our national can I don't know what the answer that is I think there's an answer to stopping school shootings and not oversimplify anything there I would say there's a couple key issues one of them is location the other one is motivation you can solve the location issue but if we as a country were legitimately interested in stopping school shootings how many have ever occurred at a school where the president's children go zero why because it's defended bright they actually take a proactive approach to it they're going to have layers of security defense-in-depth I probably can have somebody looking out the front door or system looking at the front door controlled actually points entry and exit points you have a metal detector you can have security staff on site so you can control the location aspect and I go to every time I'm at my kids school unfortunately or fortunately everything I've ever been and I'm doing it from a pseudo tactical perspective Italy so I'll go walk around my kid and there's issues that I see from a perspective of somebody who would want to exploit that From aggressors perspective and they could all be solved but that doesn't solve the second aspect of that the motivation because I have absolutely no answer as to why a seventeen-year-old kid with sink but a solution of any kind would be to kill their classmates I don't understand that at all and although people like at every shooting surprisingly enough there's two things a gun and a shooter and vast majority the time I hear people talking about the gun I think we got to balance a conversation and talk about the motivation 100% And then also psych medications you know you got to talk about that there was a rise in Psych medication Scott to be correlated with the rise of school shootings I mean that the amount of people that are on psych medication and I understand that correlation does not equal causation it's not necessarily that the medication Sportsman do this but this guy I don't know what study has been done on what is what is the effect and in is there some sort of a connection at other than the fact that they're all on medication is there some sort of a connection between taking certain types of Psych medication with certain biological makeup that allows you to have this diffusion of reality like this this is just some weird thing happens to them with a capable of horrific things and horrific actions like how much of that is monkeying with human your Chemistry I don't know that's why I think the location portion it's not that it's an easy solution but it's it is solvable there's no problem funding like there's no money for to pay for teachers who don't have money to look secure schools it depends on how seriously want to take it if it's if we really wanted to stop at what I'm saying is there are two ways that can stop and I'm not saying those ways or easy I'm not saying that those ways are cheap but there are concrete things just looking at a structure from being vulnerable assault there are things that could be done but that doesn't solve the school shooting problem run changes the address because the individual that would want to go do that at a school if you make a Target hard that doesn't remove the motivation I'm saying this location motivation and obviously a lot of other factors the location one if you saw that you still got to talk about the shooter run and I mean that's where I bought my head up again I don't I would actually like to see this country have a conversation instead of entrenched position either the left or the right all guns should be banned come get them with your coat my cold dead hands which I don't again I find myself in the middle of that I don't agree with either of those positions because it's more nuanced than just the gun in the shooters the combination of all those things but I don't even feel like we're having a conversation in this country I feel like a lot of people are talking I don't think anybody is listening and I you know I go to the in the neighborhood where you know where my kids go to school I don't see a single change that they have made a hundred percent correct in that there doesn't seem to be any real there's no real plans to stop this stuff and I don't think anybody has a real answer and it's one of the reasons why it's so confusing to people because you could dwell on it and roll it over in your head all day long and there's nothing that stands out as obvious there's a fire go put water on it that's obvious there's no there's no solution in the low hanging fruit the metaphor for the school shooting to be there so Gun Kelly on the water on that but the more nuanced and complex problem is actually the human being behind it and I see people they just LSU difficult so I'm going to throw my hands up and give up yeah I think it's important point out that actually it is thankfully it's incredibly rare that it actually happens and it's funny because you look at the stats start digging into where the Stats come from in two groups of people and I'm sure you see this across a variety of topics will take the same study and drive two different sets of numbers there school shootings and then there's shootings that happened at schools and you can make one number look bigger in one number look smaller like if you wanted to include the number of people who commit suicide in the school parking lot which at the national level is considered a school shooting because it occurred at a school you can inflate and conflate the number of times in the frequency with which a if you strip that information out it gives you a much more accurate perspective of how often is happening same thing is when you remove suicides from gun violence in the total number of deaths so it but again that takes over find a new one person that's willing to actually look at it as opposed to just repeating what their bumper sticker says yeah I saw that when Ted Nugent debated Piers Morgan on television was talking to him about gun violence the actual numbers and he was saying well this is these are the real statistics and this is why the numbers are so high please when you're including gun violence how many of these people are like criminals are being shot in the act by police officers how many of them are people defending their home from a break and how many of them are suicides how many once you get through that you get to the end of it then you get to gang violence how many how many of them are responsible how many deaths are attributed to gang violence how many deaths are attributed to you know there's a lot of different factors then you get to these mass shootings so that the match it's it it's a relatively small percentage but that doesn't give anybody any comfort for anybody that suffered course it does it again it's it it doesn't excuse it it's just thankful leave it happens in freaking I wish the number 104 no I think the answer to getting it 2-0 will be generational cuz it grew generationally I think it will go away generationally but how does it go to what what fundamental changes have to happen in the way human beings exist that we stopped any anything that right now with all the different than it would be a terrible world we said hey we're just going to have to accept the people are never going to evolve socially emotionally what whatever it is it's causing people to lash out the way they do what a horrible world it would be if we say no that people just to be like this forever we're not just flawed but flawed and listen cruel and violent and awful in Dutchess away people are forever I mean I think there's Improvement you can make on both sides right so there's a there's a gun and there's a shooter there are I couldn't be a more vehement support of the Second Amendment like I completely and utterly supported but I'm anti irresponsibility and there's a lot of things that we could do as a nation that would improve safety via responsibility I mean look at this the stats on the percentage of America animals that don't own a safe it's over 50% which is speaks to access and what sucks about any improvements that we make you'll never know about it because you're never going to know about the school shooting that you stopped really you know I mean it because he doesn't make the news but that doesn't mean I'm on my default position as we can do better there's ways that we could I think that the reasonable gun legislation that already exists there's ways that we could improve communication interagency like the Aurora shooter example take a pistol and killed five people the day he got fired and injured by police officers he should have had the gun he was a convicted felon is felony did not show up when they have via background check for his job but it did show up for the background check I believe for his concealed weapons permit but often times I see where there's a disconnect between agencies not sharing information very much like the military civilian military infrastructure prior to 9/11 agency didn't want to talk to the FBI and NSA because budget see you this is mine and that's yours and this is my wife will get the fuk with me and I want to share information I think we could do better on the regulations are in place I'm not saying add anymore but maybe let's figure out a way we can share information or at least make sure we're living up to the letter of the intent and the letter of the law on that side of the house and then on the other side of the house I you had a pin tweet for a long time and I'm going to totally murder this when it comes to exactly what this morning or not we don't have a gun we have a mental health crisis so we have a mental health crisis disguises a gun crisis or a mental health problems has a gun problem in just like we can do better on the firearm side of the house we can do better on the mental health side of the house and I just see people throwing their hands up and attacking a little hanging fruit because I think the mental health side of the house is a more difficult issue than the firearm issue has the most difficult issue you know I think everyone that I know including myself is had bad moments in their life and has struggled and the struggle especially mental health struggle struggle with depression or being unhappy or anger or any of the things that keep you off of a healthy Baseline those those those moments in life are they vary wildly in how people experience them what at what level people experience them what impact they have on them and whether or not they're can recover from these things and for some people they feel like there is recovery in the only way out is to just go out with a bang like literally and that's this is a lot of what you're seeing any school shootings is suicide by cop getting this this is one of the things that people want that they want to go out in a blaze of glory and what what the f*** is going on where we let people get to that point without stepping in and trying to help and do they have anybody that even notices do they have anyone around them that knows their this f***** up in this far gone and we all like to think that that could never have so we can never get to a point where we're so despondent and filled with anger and hate and fear and and self-loathing that we want to do something horrific but every person who does something horrific is a human being right and the difference between you and them might be genetic it might be environmental it might be life experience but they are a human being just like anyone I and something horrific Lee went wrong in their life to the point where they are in this position where they open Netflix school shooting in Illinois just couple days ago some guy got fired went back to to work and just shot everybody up like what the f*** that guy worked there for 15 years like what is it that it gets when someone gets to a point where this is this is what flashes in their mind is a solution go back with a gun make everybody pay I felt it myself that feeling overseas when I lose close friends first absolute feeling you have isn't as an anger that I don't have the vocabulary to describe an all you want to do is burn the world to the ground but it was fleeting and I didn't do it and I just don't know how we provide the barrier for people if they can and it when it comes to mental health I mean somebody with more horsepower between the years than me and he is going to need to solve that problem cuz I don't understand it but I do understand that feeling but what I needed was time and I don't know how to provide but you also had character and discipline and a lot of things that many people lack in your ability to mitigate these horrific feelings and this severe depression and anger some people don't have those mental health tools they don't have those tools in your area seal-rite you're at a guy who's endured more than most human beings will ever in terms of physically and emotionally and how to get through that hump to become one of the elite op Pearson's country. Just having that as a baseline like having that as a you you have the tool set to endure more than most some people just not capable of handling any real adversity anything bad that comes down the pipe for them they just fall apart and I think for many people there's a real extreme feeling of a lack of purpose in life does an extreme doing over a lack of a lack of meaning that nothing they do matters that they don't matter but no one cares about them with their there they're gone people either mock them or disregard them all together and they they want people to know who they are and that's one of the reasons why they do these things I can see that for sure but again if I'm being objectively honest about myself I did have those tools and probably the only thing that prevented me from I can see that for sure again if I'm being objectively honest about myself I did have those tools and probably the only thing that prevented me from acting out in that moment is that I didn't have access to the individuals that I wanted to act out against and I mean it's like I said I understand it I don't have a solution for that all but I understand it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how much climbing I was a week climber up until the point where I don't have to use of my ankle anymore cuz of the nerve injury and it's funny as I'm actually I don't like heights I do free solo at all as long as I wasn't more like than 3 feet off the ground yes I'm totally comfortable free sewing and moving laterally but not vertically away from the ground cuz I want my gosh Honnold I want three times in a row and I know he was on your podcast I listen to it seems I realize I was sitting there white-knuckling my recliner but my hands are sweating and I know he lives but it's still freaked me the f*** out wow that guy about climbing as you get the more exposure you have the less it bothers you like I solely climbing is interesting especially if you are placing your protection as you go if it is his drilled and bolstering League or lead lead well I'm broke as a lead climber you are probably setting the ropes at least a mile job you're setting the ropes for the people we're going to follow them try most the time when you see people what not most the time but one of the disciplines would be theirs bolted routes that go up a rock so you can just bring you know carabiners and put the Carabiner through that and you Loop the Rope through it and you're good to go another aspect would be as you don't use the bolted in stuff and you basically carry on your climbing harness a rack of gear so as you're holding onto the Rocks York the wedge a block or a stopper in or a cam system that it rotates to be smaller than as you release it opens up and if you pull against it it locks itself in the Rock so you're setting your own protection and that was the point like this is the perfect piece of gear and of course you only like 6 feet off the ground when the perfect piece of gear and then you'll get multi-pitch is up in the air should be to 300 feet up in the air and your lead climber so there's nobody above when you're setting your own Pro and you're starting to get emotionally involved in the situation that you're in and you said a piece of pro and it's it's rattling around a little bit so I don't know where we don't know how good that one's going to be able to keep climbing and the next piece of pro you said not the most awesome piece because you're worried about the one beneath you and you don't fall so you get it in there and then you just keep climbing so sometimes it's awesome and sometimes it's terrifying and then you go to think that if you do fall all that Force if one pops and then the Pop's your you've got a lot of distance will you think it's double the distance if you're 10 feet above the last piece of protection you put in Eufaula 10 feet to the protection then the 10ft pasta protection clink clink clink and then it pulls on the that you are above it it's not I've been probably more scared out of my mind actually the scariest scares I've ever been is a you would lived in a boulder right now Kleiner called the Bastille crack that it's in one of the national parks and I was there with his buddy and it's just me and him and a world-class climber and I was at at the East Coast command of the time so budget with no option I had the newest shiniest Optima taking plastic off of climbing gear to go climb this rock this guy pulls up in a van with a Marlboro hanging out and tennis shoes that have laces probably on one of the one of the shoes in it old pair of pants and he's climbed like every mountain ever since me and my buddy were climber way up I'm leading this pitch so you switch one guy will climb he set an anchor the other person comes up and they pick all the protection out so you can just switch in the other person leads the way on the next one so I'm like halfway up this pitch and I can't move cuz I'm losing my s*** I'm like 15 feet above the last piece of protection that I just put in I'm convinced that I feel my feet slipping off of The Rock I'm holding I have my hand jammed into the Rock and then you make a fist to like you know prevent it from falling out you can actually see Alex doing that in free solo as he's climbing up those slide their hand in and then they'll manipulate the shape so it pulls and as I my world is collapsing on me and I'm just sitting there I've got the full sewing machine leg just sitting there just shaking I hear a voice just over my shoulders I came in just put the Pizza Pro right there and I look over and this professional climber is right next to me with no rope in his f****** tennis shoes smoking a cigarette which is what he was using the point to where I should have placed the next piece of protection cool, collected and I almost fell off the rock is he scared me so bad I was so freaked out of what he was doing that I almost feel like you need to get away from me immediately. In tennis shoes monkey he just when you're around world-class climber they can hang on an edge there's like a couple pieces of paper and this in the Bastille crack is not a difficult route so I'm sure there was one right next to it and he just as I'm freaking out he just inherited hey buddy and I didn't know he was there I literally almost fell off because he talked to me oil states where it's like to get a structure better at it you just yeah after a week of climbing you will not feel bad about walking up to the edge and just standing there Alex Honnold was telling us the story about one time use free soloing he's halfway up and well in the middle of this journey up this f****** Mountain realize you didn't bring the powder sodium a chalk with him who his hands are sweating and he's just climbing within it with no Powder so he met a guy halfway up these guys that were using ropes now they were doing it the right way and he's doing it with no ropes and he goes hey man can I borrow your truck and a guy gives him a chalk bag and does I'll leave for you at the top of the mountain so he takes the truck back past these guys Sia just keeps going and then leaves the back for the guy at the top of the hill and like what in the f*** man how could you start something like that like apparently said that once you start climbing you are committed to climbing you're not ready to climb down enough yeah there's not enough money in the world give me a temp the stuff that he does and if I was a climber that had Olaf I was like you know you don't like them chicken ass on the income and sweaty and he was like hey do you mind if I borrow your truck chock I would finish that climb and never climb again I would realize that I am a complete and utter b**** in comparison to what he is possible you're also built wrong for it you know I think the thin wiry guys it's the way to go he also has like Feast thrilling its mass fingers man his fingers just used his grabbing but he also said that he had gone through a series of injuries for the first time in his life like recently over the last few years of his discs and then a really bad strain on his ankle and he was going to take six months off so we just started climbing in a cast search it's a different kind of human I mean he also lives out of a van that means world famous guys living in a van traveling around just f****** climbing rocks did you have him on after he had completed that climb like they were probably editing the project I had them on earlier like years ago and then again recently for who is capturing all that he's up there with him right that's the thing I would want to talk about it a little bit more so in the promos for the film but the how sketched out he was to actually be involved in sit there and film and how much of a burden he felt to like stay out of the periphery and not engage get engage in the headspace and make Alex do something different because the cameras were there that would have cost him his wife I can't imagine the pressure of doing that or just I wouldn't do it like a buddy of mine was like a Wii U come fill me in a freezer I would say no because I would be so afraid of just watching them peel off imagine if you were up there filming and you want to go and fall they'll be rough ER of course good friends and sky he's got a bunch of stuff to see his foot his left foot and then he's going to secure down there he's got that Carabiner he's got one going to his harness he's actually got two ropes going to his harness is kind of Angleton there's like a triangle but he's a world-class climber in themself that basically ascenders that will lie to push it up and then they lock on the Rope so he's got one leg in there and one arm and he's kind of Jamari is as a lot of the times as well but he's a world-class climber in and of himself. The kind of think you'd have to be right in order to be able to capture that yeah yeah the team that I think they put together was like 5 to 7 world but there's a movie of him called me know thanks. I'll be focusing on the urine streaming down my leg oh my God soaking your socks but I could go to the edge of that cliff and zip up my suit absolutely no problem send that off there and I bet you he would want no piece of that it's so bizarre add a team of like five to seven people they had so they had long lens they had people up there they have remote cameras I mean it's a whole they obviously had drones flying around you know what there was a film that you know besides this film the recent documentary which I think is called solo right before that there was also a late-night one of those new shows like ABC World News Tonight or some like that they did a whole piece on him and they had this one guy who has a you know what rock climber it said it's not a matter of if a matter of when he falls every innovator in the wingsuit world is dead no it's doing it and I would suspect having never talk to the guy that he would rather meet his end like that then at 80 years old as a geriatric yeah yeah what does news the burden on the people around him and that's the that's the piece that was the toughest for me when it came to the wingsuit base jumping him there it's insane is wrong with that man let me know he's such a nice guy when you talk to Alex in real life he's a sweetheart root for him to quit that's the piece that was the toughest for me when it came to the wingsuit base jumping him there it's insane is wrong with that man let me know he's such a nice guy when you talk to Alex in real life he's a sweetheart you just use your root for him to quit stop</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> set of Syria yep when you see you know the debate about that or actions possible actions against North Korea and all this kind of stuff like hot how do you do do you view this mean obviously you view this as a guy who has served its been overseas but do you do look at things like these are potential issues that are coming up and thinks you need to be concerned with the Syria and I'm able to serial one there are guys from the community over there they 2 billion gauge Iraq itsfunneh the news reported for a long time we withdrawing from Iraq all US troops out of Iraq no they weren't we've always had a presence there since we invaded in 2003 so a man and I can go tit-for-tat on a lot of issues where the news gets it wrong which is why I don't necessarily look at it for me to inform my opinion serious certainly any area where we allow a place for and the only word I have for it is evil to grow it's going to happen the problem with the strategy that I see it is is that actually so we started in Afghanistan and again this is my opinion that the military Penny I can only speak for myself weed into Afghanistan we were incredibly effective so we cut the head off of that snake but it's pain to more you going to Iraq you can argue whether or not we were effective but then all of a sudden we started seeing foreign coming in from all these different countries and the tactics that we started seeing used in Iraq like my first appointment to Afghanistan in 2003 or 2002 it was not uncommon to drive around and vehicles that were not ballistic they were not resistant to mines Tacoma a thin-skinned, the boat was it right through fast forward to Afghanistan in 2008 and they're starting to see Vehicles being detonated by bombs that we first saw in Iraq we're coming across the border into Syria where they were had the ability to allow again for lack of a better turn that evil to grow to learn to come across the border to engage American forces them to flee into a Sovereign Nation we couldn't do a thing about then we started seeing that in Afghanistan but we got infective anytime that these people would get together and have a large group we get effective either capturing them were killing them so they realize they need to be disaggregate so now we've spread this I think the last app that I saw this is in 64 countries in the problem that I see with the US military that were very very good at going in and cutting the head off the snake but we're not good at creating and holding infrastructure and the timeline required to hold that infrastructure is well beyond the pallet I think of most Americans in the best example I can point to is South Korea we still have bases with American presence in South Korea that war ended decades ago we still have bases in Germany bases in Italy now we're not necessarily using for the same purposes but if we really want to control that area we have to be prepared to stay there for that long and I don't think the US military one has enough Personnel to do that and I don't think the American populace has the palate to allow that to happen do you think that's necessary that in order to protect people from with it whether it's Isis or whatever comes after Isis mean to get robbed Israeli recent right Wentzville cat at Isis Nishant yet I sold all that young whatever could be nice so you feel like we have to maintain presence in that part of the world. I think we should use the military as a measure of Last Resort I think that war should be a measure of absolutely Last Resort and I would love to see it evolve to a point where we use it less and less and less I described it as you're standing at a damn and you can see a little spout coming out do you put your finger in the spout knowing that it's not going to fix the problem but it was going to buy you time to hopefully have somebody come and fix the damn right that's the option I would go for versus just leaving it as it is and allowing it to continue to weaken the damn or another Sprout come out my theory that the military is really well served to provide that space to put that finger in that Sprouts oh yes I think if we find an area where these ideologies are free we have to do what is necessary to remove that ideology and hopefully destroy it not not resettle it somewhere else but actually destroy it so yes that the short answer is absolutely if we find areas where we can squash this down we have to go but I just hope that there's people smarter than me that have a much longer-term strategy because all we're doing in my opinion is the finger in the dam is there a longer-term strategy the global conflicts I mean is there a time that we get mean it's it's a it sounds insane to say that there's never going to be a time with his nowar it sounds like an insane thing to say I don't know if there's ever been a time at least globally not that the US was involved but I don't know if there's ever been a time where there hasn't been a war I don't think I don't think there can be because we talked about this the first day I met you there's X people and there's why people they're not going to get along it doesn't matter what your belief is you have an access somewhere that has another belief and he go to the reminder that belief that individual may be willing to take action against you violent action against you for your belief and there's no I don't think there's a way around that because humans are just too diverse what is it possible that one day we'll move past this I mean is there any plans at all to try to facilitate some sort of a peaceful World Civilization where you know all nations, get along and some sort of a mutually agreeable way when does anybody have some sort of hundred year plan is that hilarious that's a funny thing to say I mean human beings are always going to shoot and kill each other we're always going to have war is not f***** since the Inception of human beings it seems like at least some level and it thankfully it's microscopic in comparison to the overall total but it's happening I think it's happened since man has been walking on earth and the only way that we feel today that we can protect ourselves is to have the more dominant more powerful military to make sure that we're the ones that get to dictate where they're not evil flourishes I would want maybe a I want the the dominant ability of our military to continue to grow but I'd like to see and I think it started moving this direction smaller more surgical uses of it I just the military in my opinion is not good at building infrastructure and holding to rain for a long. Of time it is not were designed to do but it's not the design of the military for that matter what what is the overall view about getting out of Syria depends on the people that you asked what about people that you talked to both sides of the coin I will get answers from I think we're making a difference to wasting your time and I got that the initial invasion of Iraq initial invasion of Afghanistan there is one of the things that I enjoyed about the community I came from his that critical thinking was it's rewarded it's not there's no attempt in people think about this new you watch Full Metal Jacket you know choke yourself with my hand and you get told what to do and how to do and how much time you have to do it people think that critical thinking has no place in the military but where I came from that's what we're looking for is people were able to critically think so they would be we would have political arguments religious arguments philosophical arguments in the team room and then come together and go do exactly what it is that our nation expected us to do so you're going to get both you got who are conservative and liberal Republican and Democrat and everything in between so I wish I could give you a like a very precise answer but I have heard every spectrum of answer from this is awesome to this is stupid you know what confuses me I've heard different opinions on a sod with her Assad is evil with Aries gassed his is Citizens or whether or not he's a victim of propaganda Sam a smear campaign like whoa oh this is way past my paygrade I've heard the same thing and it's beyond mine as well to it's frustrating cuz you know don't know whether or not this is some propaganda or this is a real threat or whether you know heat or whether it's something like the Saddam Hussein situation where yes he wasn't evil dictator but also removing him might create a power vacuum like Lydia had a power vacuum them Khadafi with Libya I mean Libya's horrific example that right yeah and I don't I don't know the long-term solution to those problems it's like I said I I spend enough my waking hours truly questioning whether or not anything that I was involved in made my family or your family or Jamie's family safer did I did I did my actions you rode with the rest of the world thinks about the United States of America and I mean I I throw back and forth I think it had an impact in the moment I think it had an impact stopping the water coming out of the damn I think it was essential that it needed to be done family safer did I did I did my actions you rode with the rest of the world thinks about the United States of America and I mean I eat I throw back and forth I think it had an impact in the moment I think it had an impact stopping the water coming out of the damn I think it was essential that it needed to be done but I don't know if any of that has an impact beyond that that time. It occurred</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the fact that almost everything in them is an accurate almost everything biggest sing the drive me f****** crazy is when grenades create a fireball really what yet cuz it happens in like every movie they throw a grenade in a 55-gallon drum of gasoline explodes where people go flying backwards and cars flipped over Heathrow Grenada goes pop and it put some dust up in the air and you're waiting for the fireball you're going to be there for the rest of your natural life don't get me wrong but they're not that effective I did not know they don't like create a fireball know I've never seen a grenade go off I was here I'm sure Jamie can pull any punches with its dust is all of this scene 1 in a video then for a moment like a momentary explosion there's a flash but other than that it's really just dust flying up in the air what what is the best military movie that's the most accurate or the police defensive Navy Seals turn Charlie Sheen really no not at all almost fell down that's f****** guy probably full of more people into coming to the SEAL Teams that anybody else really oh my god really yeah skylights with MP5 and handlebar mustaches you know this is snipers calling himself God I can't see anything I'm switching to Starlight blasting people through a concrete wall they're doing free fall jump sir in submarines did you take that expectation you come to the teams like I'm going to board right now so is that the war areas that is Vietnam O'Charley now exit of going psychotic partier and so apparently apparently so they came to the blood compound and did a little bit of training with the guys and I guess there was some bathroom breaks and they'd just like a really old but I want to believe it's true well you know who I hear trains diligently and really hard and it like takes it super seriously and is like one of the most humble guy Jeremy's Keanu Reeves that doesn't surprise me me neither but I heard some people that have had interacted with him when he was training for John Wick yeah including my jiu-jitsu instructor John Jacque Machado Manny machado's contract brother and a bunch of other he worked out with a bunch of the machado's in fact I think Carlos is well but you know he really wanted to learn actual Jiu-Jitsu so he wasn't playing with them yeah he did real tactical courses and his tactical proficiency shows in that movie and so to get back to it bothers me it's the 72 round pistol magazine latent errors in the movie the guy pointing a gun is it was supposed to be a CIA agent he's pointing a gun out the windshield and you can see that the bullet to the rifle is lock to the rear armor onset handed it to him you'll clear and safe and he just went and they filmed it and nobody caught it and I saw that movie on my turn that s*** off of course ruins it for me stuff like that you would think that you're making a movie about military or about guns like yeah I didn't catch it the other day it's so fast it probably up there for three seconds but if you know I mean you look at a gun and like you just if it was your primary tool for years you're going to you're looking for certain things all the way up here we go look for someone who doesn't know that looks super serious that's why they're still watching the movie I had son obviously an empty magazine yeah he's silly so nobody nuts yes drives me nuts like if I see someone like supposed to be some pool Hustler and I see still day of a b******* bridge and their grip enough that you can see things in movies like my friends who smoke cigarettes say they can tell when someone doesn't smoke oh for sure when you smoke there's just a like a casual real relaxed way that you're holding the cigarette and the way you're drawn up but when someone's like never smoked before and yeah can you tell it cuz I smoke it's like another thing that bugs me is you watch it any tactical scene where they like moving down hallway and it's like why is your gun pointed at your buddies face like that's not cool why are you aiming ASRock like and then the way that they make entry into rooms it's like awesome I like to play Russian roulette with my life as well as Absolute Zero Dark Thirty that movie f****** sucks what sucks about you know what you owe me crazy does that lady and do we have the redhead lady with his yelling at all those trained Killers I was like how they did listen to her there are some creative Liberties that are taken in that movie from Soup To Nuts I mean like was that person the lady who yelled at those guys of the one of the woman was in charge without a real human in real life is based off of a real human for sure like a lot of things in that movie were based real events however if you're trying to get tickets to get people seats in their butts in seats you got to glamorize stuff so a lot of people cuz in that movie know the the source drives up in the vehicle and detonates himself that actually happen that killed a bunch of people and cows as long as you look at it as entertainment that movies okay if you look at it with a refined I like are they doing this correctly know they're hung yeah I mean it's it just we would need another four hours to literally go down a list of things but it's just things are compressed things that would never happen happen for the sake of creating a and then an intoxicating awarded emotional scene on camera and it's tough to watch cuz I'm sitting on my kid out the door get out the door unless you want to know how many different things f***** up about that movie Only the things that were after the opening scene Lone Survivor they're all based around certain things that have been enhanced to make it more entertaining yes can I get it there to make money they're not there to tell historically accurate you know Marcus I do not know Mark as well but I do know Marcus I know him I don't know how he felt you know it must be for him to deal with on a daily level I would bet he wasn't very I would almost rather them if that was me I think I would almost rather say you know what just make the movie that you want to make because I don't want to sit here and explain exactly what happened and recreate the scenes and talk about how this person died over here at like I've just go to town is there any movie that you've ever seen about war where you go. That makes sense first 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is unbelievable not for accuracy for capturing the s of what it feels like and the switch between utter fear to excitement to Joy anger in the matter of a second another movie that does a good aspect or a good job with cashier and capturing some of those aspects I would say is also Black Hawk Down not for accuracy but to capture the chaos that have how a plan can come unraveled and how just how chaotic and being as how sometimes you can feel so helpless but you're only salute is the drive into the problem instead of moving away from it so those does capture the essence of it well from a technical perspective I honestly cannot think of a single movie that doesn't Justice wow it would have to be like a 50-hour movie though because of course I mean Black Hawk Down I think was a multiple-day incident in that movies 90 minutes or so they get rid of all the other boring BS stuff that is actually what you do the vast majority of job if I look at my career probably greater than 95% of my career I spent training and 5% this been in combat really yep that's average that would say there are people who are maybe a little bit higher and people who are a little bit lower but you're not going to spend more than it most maybe 10% of your career in, even if your job is directly tied to combat did you had a train you got to plan the missions are normal planning cycle is 24. sitting in front of PowerPoint considering whether or not I should hang myself or blow my brains out because we're arguing over the font that were using to submit for Mission approval you're studying the weather you're studying the terrain I've had slide in Mission briefs sent back not be approved because I didn't worry into helicopter the correct direction on the slide through like a you need to fix this and then resubmit it like if you wanted to shut down the average day military it wouldn't be through a kinetic act you need to put some type code into Microsoft Office and we're done because we operate on Microsoft PowerPoint Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office we sit there and plan and we would Breathe me to submit for approval S 3 days then you go do an objective it would last for 10 hours repeat the cycle on 284th at the insertion plan the route planning you would never really be what we're going to do inside of the objective because that's kind of the super Nazi train for at all times like that's everything is to get there and then okay that's actually our job that we focus on all the things then primary secondary tertiary plan for each one of those things phase lines for each one of those things in any movie doesn't show up in any movies is vast majority of time the intelligence is bad and you hit with called dry hole you go to a building you approach the structure you breach the door in the sea what doesn't show up in any movies is vast majority of time the intelligence is bad and you hit with call the dry hole you go to a building you approach to structure you breach the door and this is the intelligence is wrong it's either empty or it's the wrong person that happen all the time that doesn't it's not exciting though so we pay the people money they fix their door and we go back and we try to find a person again none of that shows up in any of the mediums it's to their to compressed</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and your knowledge of what the real world in these combat environment is like what do you how do you feel when you hear people talk about defunding the military or decreasing a military or that we don't need it or that we we shouldn't have the kind of budget that we have right now the people that don't understand the real threats that are out there and that if you do not have a well-trained self-funded experienced military that really understands these things you've got real danger at your door. I'm glad that they live in a place where they have enough space to develop those thoughts because they're not under pressure because the military is doing the job that they should be doing there are like I said so many misconceptions about what the military does what we do proceed how many countries we are in overseas how deep we are into some of these countries have forecasted and how forward-looking the military is looking for emerging threats as opposed to just responding and all of that creates space so people can exercise their right to voice their first amendment you know right of saying those things does it frustrate you though that they don't have a real understanding I'm grateful that they live in a place where they don't have that great understanding cuz like I said have the space to be confused they're not pushed under thumb they're not being told you have to say this or it's going to be your f****** head in the square right it is frustrating for me at times but I balance that with that's that's what this country is supposed to be about you supposed to be able to voice your descent right and I and I believe that the system will correct in it it does correct Brits out there are people that believe that but I think the most the majority of people against silent mode vs extreme minority I think those people are in the extreme minority but they're very vocal I think most people are incredibly appreciative of what the military does but having said that if you've never served in the military and you've never been in a combat occupation and then you've never applied that occupation for real there's going to be a gap and there's going to be a gap in understanding and that's okay it's frustrating yes but I'm glad that it exists and I'm glad they are not in this country is not in a position where they are getting drafted and forced into that position I'm glad it was me that did that and had to Bear any weight or burn that came with that to allow them to have whatever Penny they want that's a great perspective that's a very healthy way of looking at it and I probably think it's probably the only manageable way of looking at it I think it would go crazy otherwise what you going to do go to a rally and hold up another place like what anger but eventually give me a little time and that you know hopefully relatively staying head is going to Prevail and I had you know again that that night I got hurt it change the way that I thought about things if I'd never gotten hurt and it and and I never thought about my own mortality and I never thought about I got to spend a lot of time thinking about whether or not what I did in the military has it had any impact .0001 I don't know if I would have thought about that if all I ever done was due any occupation that I did I did that lifting of my head to have that perspective I did I don't think all people do but I needed that how long to write in some ways helps me how the perspective I have now with those people how how long is the average career of someone is a seal well if you want to retire you got to do 20 years in a wake-up and they should change it to wake up wake up the next day you got a 20 years old you have to do 20 years to the day so wake up the day after your 20th please help me have the perspective I have now with those people how how long is the average career of someone is a seal if you want to retire you got to do 20 years in a wake-up and they should change it to wake up wake up the next day you got a twenty-year-old you have to do 20 years to the day so wake up the day after your 20th but they need to change the term also retirement pay in the military should be in Thai pinion at least replaced with money that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> can you put a wingsuit on and it's that one stung a bit so it's on pause potentially forever as far as base jumping goes I'll still skydive but it said it's a? On base jump inside the house incredibly low so that you're the main parachute and Reserve parachute I don't think there has been a true double failure meaning your main parachute malfunctions you cut it away properly and deploy your reserve parachute and have that also fail in 20 some years people die skydiving all the time will not all the time cuz I guess you know the population of people that do it is not huge but I would say the vast majority of people who die skydiving they kill themselves they make a poor decision and most people who died skydiving died under perfectly functioning equipment that you're flying the wing over your head and the smaller it is the faster it goes the faster it descends but also quite frankly the more fun it is but with funders consequence so there are canopies that you can initiate a turn in if you initiate the turn to low you can pull the canopy out of the turn you would impact the ground at a high rate of speed regardless of what you do and if you get under that canopy with not enough experience obviously your odds of making a bad decision are going to go through the roof the most injuries and fatalities at least from the stuff I have seen is from people making a poor decisions under good equipment or choosing to execute an emergency procedure which should be cutting away your main parachute and playing deserve either out of sequence or doing it to lower the reserve parachute doesn't have time open to me that's not a failure system failure the individual who is driving that parachute system so if you have a main parachute and you jump out and hit the main parachute and there's a malfunction how do you cut it off to put to get the other one plus one on each side the right hand side you literally need to do this in the correct order even though people have killed himself by going backwards so you pull to form extension it's literally just a pillow with velcro that has two cables and the cables are was actually holding the parachute on your shoulders if you pull that out a 3-ring release system which is basically just a load reduction system unwind itself into her she's gone and you're going back into free-fall and you just pull the other pill it sounds worse than it is and before I had my first cutaway it was terrifying and then after you have for 5 like okay I got the main parachutes fail I think I'm at about 7 I started jumping in 99 statistically I'm actually I think under I think it's like one in every 888 jumps you'll have a malfunction or gear failure it's honestly like it's your first one is an emotional experience I would imagine what was the first one deploying parachute and just sitting there looking at it as it's because they want to open and you can I can tell now it was in an instant of try to deploy my parachute wasn't asking to open or not just by looking at the shape buy sometimes listening to it and just seeing how it opens sometimes I made some packing parachute people think is really difficult if you can fold a t-shirt you can pack parachute sometimes though you know you just got off of the jump and you only have 10 minutes to make the next jump so you skip a few steps are you rush through few steps is that what happened with you potentially I may have skipped all of the non-essential steps in a few of the essential steps to get the parachute princess stuff in the thing in there and when I try to deploy the parachute it just it was asymmetrical so sometimes it'll still open and it'll start spinning and then you're flying with your back to the ticket that would be considered an exciting moment I would say so what happened with you what exactly went wrong I just came out asymmetrically the parachute wasn't opening we spinning no I wasn't I actually was able to recognize just buy it should come out it looks like a rectangle but if you look like a rectangle with its Twisted there's no way to fix that so just get rid of it and that's what I did I looked up and I said okay that's not going to work reach pole reach pull and your reserve open so fast like by the time I felt like by the time I had pulled the reserve handle cuz I had to handle that by the time I had moved my arm to 3/4 extension and it fired off to the difference in you're asking of the difference like why is risk skydiving lower it is because you have time thousands of feet whereas base jumping you might have hundreds or if you're really pushing the envelope you might have stepped NC cuz you're flying close to the ground as fast you can go get your friend Alex who died did he die base jumping or guide wingsuit base jumping something that I was at me he was my main base jumping part of what is the difference between wingsuit base jumping in regular base jump a quick deploy parachute right so you have one parachute system when you base jump instead of two because there is not time for a reserve to open so that is just taken out of the Frank so you pack your primary or only parachute very similar to a reserve it's designed open rapidly is designed to take a lot of load but so base-jumping is just jumping off of a static object Bae stands for building antennas fan or so four types of object the addition of the wingsuit is really the only difference which allows you to lie for myself personally I'm not a huge fan of jumping off buildings in Cliffs without a wingsuit because I do being from me that flag when a parachute opens cuz if it doesn't open exactly in the direction you wanted to you better be johnny-on-the-spot or you're going to f****** problem so it's to me if you have enough altitude you put a wingsuit on in two or three seconds the suit is mocking for it so then you're hundreds if not thousands of feet away from the object then you Paris you can open up however you wanted to have they made any improvements in the technology of the stuff since you first started jumping huge improvements in the first wingsuits were literally just fabric that had like a little thumb Loops you'll find on like cold weather long sleeve shirt sometimes seriously like Patrick come out and use their entire musculature to sail this is far out as they could get and then shooting our unbelievable so each Wing like the wind between your legs and the wing between each of your arm so there's three of them they're totally independent they have a ram air opening so the air rushes into that and makes the wings semi-rigid so it reduces the stress on your body and they fly characteristics are insane you can go you can get the suit flying faster you can fly that flatter you can float everything about it is improved except for the decision-making process of the monkey who's actually jumping it that's the original one Jamie that guy's dead for sure it says Nikki Morgan where he is that ridiculous who who is the first f****** psycho the thought that this was something that they should try it could potentially I know one of these guys died going off the Eiffel Tower in an exhibitionist is a 1940 Ram 1500 what in the strong you know what man if you were living in 1900 you probably look listen inventor Earl Stein he died the first attempt to Jesus Christ he died in the first attempt on her to a modern hero alright settle down but here's the thing Joe there's like 60 some people who are associated with the modern-day wingsuit and testing and evaluating to get it to this point they're all dead and the difference between that and where we are now it's night and day but everyone involved in the creation of these wingsuits died in a wingsuit yep f*** man that is not good I doing be a whole lot of black belts in Jiu-Jitsu with everyone and got to a certain point died and I'm saying it's hard to justify or rationalize the behavior for sure I'll be the first person to like what is it about so the dog the dogs fault the dog I believe is that looks like Switzerland crazy a****** f****** owner so Dean wasn't insane right he's a world-class rock climb he's also dead from jumping wingsuit he died in Yosemite it's like I said the technology advances I am not I was not there the day the dean. I've talked to people who've look at it as to the conditions that led up to it and not one thing people generally don't want to do place the responsibility of the individual making the choice but what from everything that I have seen he made a choice to jump at a time when you should not have been jumping to the visual conditions so even though the suits are amazing really the only thing that doesn't seem to be evolving is the person that's that's jumping it most of the time just like skydiving it's just a human being making a very poor choice to include Alex what is it about people I mean people like yourself that love these the rails like what are you getting at what are you getting out of the other than this mad adrenaline rush and what is it like what motivates you to keep doing that so I look back at it objectively yeah I think when I initially started pushing hard down that path I was trying to replicate a headspace or a feeling or Sensation that I had in my old job so if you want to talk about Clarity of thought thinking of you want to talk about this the very first time that we sat down stripping away all ancillary bulshit that has absolutely no meeting but for me at least spend I spend 99% of my time worrying about things that have no impact whatsoever Ryan helicopter pick the battlespace at your in a five-minute warning and you really stop worrying about whether or not you have enough money in your checking account to cover your mortgage and then you get a 3-minute warning and any kind of stop worrying about whether not you just had an argument with your wife or you just sent off snarky email then you get a one-minute warning in a 30-second warning in the closer and closer and closer you get everything is gone and it is still to this day the the sensation and state that I have been in that is by far I had no question about my purpose and I have the utmost Clarity that I've ever experienced in my life and you get used to operating in that headspace of just being in the moment the first one. Nothing Else Matters I'm going to solve this problem and move on to the next one this problem and move on to the next one will then I lost that ability to do that and it sucked because I like operating in a headspace because it it help me deal with all the other b******* in my life could it be set for me my what matters and what doesn't matter ratio as a little get rid of like I've described it just the white noise in my head or go another way I'll describe it is like Jamie's got a bunch of levers that you can push up I think in this in this I think most people are pegged out at 10 almost all the time they're f****** white knuckling through life but if you can get into that state where you have that Clarity of purpose Clarity Focus I felt like it pulled everything back to its 3 and so that state help me in things had nothing to do with that activity and it lasted for a long time so when you base jumping and you standing on a cliff and you're scared out of your mind and you can't talk as your mouth is so dry and you have a pee ring on your suit which is why you always get dark people can't see your feet ring and every alarm Bell on your body is telling you don't jump and I had the same experience I wasn't worried about checking account wasn't worried about was going on in life I was just living in that moment and it helped me be a better dad it help me be a better husband help me be better at any business decision that I need to make it allow me to pull all of those stereo levers back down so it's less for me and I can only speak for it's less about a thrill-seeking cuz I get that all the time like you're an adrenaline junkie I enjoy adrenaline Enthusiast I certainly enjoy that but I actually like what I get from the activity more than the activity of so what do you think is going on where people are pegged at 10 all the time with nonsense and that's something that's life threatening can bring it back to a three and offer Clarity I mean it has to be something that you've discussed or thought about in-depth I just think it helps you control alt delete your hard drive a little bit helps by not having leg when I'm standing on a cliff right before I get ready to jump there is absolutely nothing that I am thinking about other than where I want to be in the next 3 seconds and by being able to focus on something so singular and maybe I don't I don't meditate but I've heard people talking about the baby able to clear your mind and help them deal with everything else I think there might be some connection there but I just I just think that the removal of the noise that bombards everybody all day long even for a little bit helps you it says you have headphones for sure right you're listening to it you listen to the same volume level two then it just doesn't seem to be as loud so what are you do you click it up a notch and then you get used to that volume level then you click it up a notch receptor downgrades and on your body gets used to it so it adapts to it but you pull that stimulus out and leave it at that high volume but listen to it like 2 weeks later going to blow your ears out it'll seem louder much louder than it would if you slowly just incrementally started adding that volume so it's there's something in there that is allowing me and I'd not recommending that anybody pursue therapy via the directions that I do but there's something in there that's allowing me to so it's there's something in there that is allowing me and I'd not recommending that anybody pursue therapy via the directions that I do but there's something in there that's allowing me to instead of add an add an add an ad that activity allows me to detach and then when I come back to it I realized it just it just feels different for me but I don't know if that's a good description of the mechanism but that's the best that I can probably describe</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I don't want to say there's a rash of suicides in the Seal team specifically obviously the number 22 is thrown out of light when it comes to veteran suicide but that's what is it 22% 22 veterans a day but the number that is often touted I am hesitant to say that number is accurate because if you look at how it was derived it wasn't they could have done a better job of getting that number and it and I don't want to say inside of the SEAL Teams that there's a sewer issue even though I do know a few people that have committed suicide and they were the ones that I would least expect it from but they were also the ones who had quite a bit of high operational Tempo and the one thing that I don't think especially in the military medicine will they understand what was traumatic brain injury of the impact it has long-term and how easy it can be cuz you know this already talked about it before you have to get knocked out to get a brain injury and I know countless times where I either did something dumb or was just standing in the wrong place or had a hard parachute opening and I crack my head against the metal risers and your head hurts the rest the day yeah and it's I've seen the change in behavior and some people and I don't know the stuff that's tied to Duvall the low hormones all that stuff there that is happening I think at the highest levels in the military probably military why but specifically those people who were kind of moron the front Leading Edge combat operations and I think as a country where in what a total unknown area because we're in a sustained. Of War longer we ever been as a nation and nobody knows the outcome of that and people who I would have never guessed would make the decision to take her own life I'll get a text and pay you know someone so just went out into the woods and no other external injury no other marker than obviously something happened in the gym tree between their ears that cause them to make that decision and I suspect it's from the repeated exposure to the brain injury yeah it's something that people are just starting to understand over the last couple of decades mean obviously there was a focus back concussion movie and you know I don't know if you saw that Bob Costas was actually pulled from football and they told him that he crossed the line the announcer they pulled him they pulled him from doing what what event was it was it from the Super Bowl because he was talking about traumatic brain injury and their the realities of it and they said you crossed the line he's like a cross the line by talking about reality but it honest and open. That's not cool that's what he does mean that is Bob Costas is entire hook but mean he's he's a brilliant guy but this this problem was so poorly understood just two decades ago so everyone's is hurt coming to this realization that I mean according to dr. Mark Gordon who have I've had on works with the warrior Angel Foundation Andrew Mars set up where they're helping all these veterans and have traumatic brain injuries and I've had mr. Gordon on several times he he says that you can get traumatic brain injuries from things that don't even remotely knock you out like people get them from doing Moguls when they ski they get them from your brain just rattle I get them from jet skis bouncing around on jet skis and then you can get it from a minor car accident you can have a traumatic brain injury and four guys like me that guy in the head for years who knows what the f*** is going on in there you know in for professional fighters it's you know it's almost inevitable for football players it's even worse in a pro football players they did some crazy study and I know we quoted it and I don't remember what the numbers was but it's the same number like in the high 80% of people from high school on through college and into the professionals have TBI or CTE or the some signs of traumatic I'd be surprised if they didn't give a nerd f****** crazy it gets it is interesting to like I was saying so when I got medically retired they sent me to a medical facility called nyko which is attached to Walter Reed and is the best care that I ever received because it's a civilian facility it's called the national Intrepid center of excellence we did a lot of work with them back in the day for the UFC the UFC raised a bunch of money for that really yeah well the money was well spent because I went there and I probably would not have been retired had I not because I left with Lily 150 page dossier it but it's interesting Tanya back to TBI because I spent a lot of time as a requirement talking to psychologists and psychiatrists and the TBI PTs in the military gets interesting because it seems like they're treated is different issues and I'm probably misquoting number little bit I think there's 13 recognize symptoms of both but there's an overlay of like 11 so I can't remember off the top of my head but you could describe one and it apply both to TBI and post-traumatic stress so it gets even more muddled on how are you treating somebody for a brain injury or you treating somebody for a post-traumatic stress are you wanting everybody together it just cuz I see a lot of people and specifically a lot of veterans getting stuck in that world where they it's a lot of focus on PTS but the reality is it could just be from the trauma received over career working out nearly two decades for most people to make it to retirement it's real Patel Ki blasts or big one right like blowing down doors and think you just step away and you brace yourself the impact of just the are the concussive force of it is just devastating for your brain that you would the human brain apparently just so much more delicate and sensitive than anyone could have ever guessed concussive blast or telephone cuz they travel so they are internally in a building and you find a door to the end of the hallway even if you go all the way down to the end of the hallway and around the corner the blast can still get you cuz it will come down off the door reflect off of the hallway and still Rock You Jesus I thought I had a good hiding spot more than once did not have more than one occasion or you're working with a bunch of assholes to take all the good hiding spots there's not really much you can do about that right I mean if you have to blow down that door someone has to be there to detonate you haven't be close enough for it to activate right now they're doing a wirelessly they might be doing it wirelessly now when I was in its called monel and it basically it's a or shocktube so you put a charge wherever adult a door and you basically have to attach an initiator to it cuz it charges I'm going to go off by itself do you need a highly reactive charge to set off an explosive that is less reactive you keep them separate obviously for safety except for the main breacher he probably has at least one hooked up so he can be really fast but then you just extend that flash tube and its they come in Long Wheels I mean that you can get 30 40 50 feet and each charged mathematically we do math on it to determine the minimum safe distance of every charge and it's written on the charge so you know how far you can get away but sometimes you're in the city and we're like I said that you think you got an awesome hiding spot and the guy lays out the flash to when he's getting ready to fire off and you realize that you're staring directly at the charge you have nowhere to hide and they're not going to wait on you so it's turn around cover up into a ball and eat it is there a best way to eat it open your mouth and cover your ears immediately yeah open your mouth instead of overloading like your sinus cavities and your your ear canals we can here's know if your mouth that helps what I was going to go off really close to you open your mouth and cover your ears what would what's the difference in opening and closing the mouth the effect of the wave my understanding that contain pressure inside of your body as opposed to giving it a an Avenue to escape Jesus Christ things are realizing apparently about concussions is that even just getting hit in the chest can give you a concussion from the just getting hit in the chest makes your head snap and makes your brain switched around inside your head and then that's what gives you an injury I just remember earlier on I mean like the mid-2000s it wasn't the only question is does your head hurt like that has the beginning of whether or not you might have sustained a concussion and then obviously learning much more now and we're rats like yeah you may not have even had any sensation in your head but you know it's kind of crazy about how long people have been studying the human body and it is much more now and we're rats like yet you may not have even had any sensation in your head but you know it's kind of crazy when you think about how long people been studying the human body and this is just something they've really got a real understanding of in the last couple of decades I don't even know if I would characterize it as a real understanding I think they're farther along than they were to two decades ago but I think the amount we know versus the amount that we don't know is much more weight on the amount we don't</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> living in the country in the vocal minority just hasn't much larger megaphone or microphone in the non vocal majority I think most people do that but I don't think the people that do that waste their time posting about it or taking up the filling the narrative so it looks like there's only two positions that's a good point I would love to see some return to moderation just get extremism in any shape I filled her in Comfort with people who go to any lengths like that we're getting more and more upset at it and I think it's people recognize it's more more Preposterous they're getting more and more this more more push back and resistance you know what's really interesting with progressivism is that people getting in trouble now for things that seem like there's there's something we like Martina Navratilova just got a bunch of s*** from people calling her transphobic cuz she was saying that she didn't think that biological male should be cheating with biological females and that there are people who identify as transgender who keep their penis and compete as a man and you know her but her position was like that or compete as a woman rather ship it her position was like that listen that's not that's not a woman that's a man and they have an advantage and she was reciting all these instances and so she got all this s*** from people so then she said I'm going to step back and I'm going to research this so she stepped and researched it and then came back and said no add looked at all the data now I came back harder she did come back harder and now they're attacking her and calling her transphobic listed this is not transphobia this is a real thing that you're going to have to address me to talk about physical activities when someone identify if you want to identify as a woman or identify as a male I think we should all support people doing whatever they want to do as long as it's not hurting anybody totally agree when you're talking about competition and you're talking about someone identify if you identify as a giraffe if you compete in an apple picking competition with a giraffe you going to f****** lose your not a giraffe stupid right now this is just a minute and extreme version of it but that's nonsense that doesn't make any sense it if you decide that you're a woman and you want to enter into a f****** weightlifting competition and you weigh 220 lb and you're beating All the Other Women by like f****** insane numbers like there was world champion weightlifting winners better women that are actually biologically male the other winning weightlifting competitions just like what the f*** are you talking about like this is great this is not a matter of whether or not someone should identify with something but it's you talking about making it there for actual biological women like there's a reason why women don't compete with men is because physically they're not as strong so and obviously there's some exceptions are some weak men and some strong women in their son service when you find yourself somewhere on it but if you're allowing biological males to compete with biological females and just say oh he identifies as a woman let him in yay we're all being very Progressive and then you look at the results of your way just broke all the world records first time in the current never was like yeah it's amazing what a wonderful woman girl power wheel girl power you're monkeying with Biology here this is this is crazy so what's the route no doubt of that like what is that meaning upset and time time being time you know of these instances enough of these things happen enough discussion or enough of the actual reality of the facts and the data are shoved in everyone's face enough that the new generation come to some sort of a rational understanding about what is and is not fair as opposed to where people are now we're just no matter what they're scared to not push this Progressive Jazz and they're scared of the blowback of Martina Navratilova who is an lbgt hero right there she's a f****** hero she was a lesbian woman was a world champion tennis player and now they're at the left attacking her so they're at they're eating their own in a spectacular fashion we have these trans people who don't want to look at reality and then people that support the trans people because they don't want to be considered in any way shape or form anything other than the most Progressive a progressive and it's not navigate to Lova who is an lbgt hero right there she's a f****** hero she was a lesbian woman was a world champion tennis player and now they're the left attacking her so they're at they're eating their own in a spectacular fashion where you have these trans people who don't want to look at reality and then people that support the trans people because they don't want to be considered in any way shape or form anything other than the most Progressive a progressive and it's not</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> here's one that people say they'll say to a martial arts person like to see someone like a Jon Jones like a pause Jon Jones I just f****** kick everybody's ass like no you wouldn't know you wouldn't okay just knowing all the problems of Jon Jones has been in one thing she notices never been in a fight there's no street fights out there with Jon Jones you know means I would bet his least the least likely person to engage in that activity I bet you're right cuz he doesn't want to do it cuz you knows exactly the consequences let alone the legal consequences but when you look at it from someone who has zero understanding they like all about that guy be kicking everybody's ass but no you wouldn't because they like violence people don't just accept violence you don't just hit someone get away with it they think about that s*** forever and they try to get you back and you there hire someone to get you back or they get you back on the Rhone or the wait for you to not remember it and then they they come around the corner and f****** brainy with a baseball bat this is what people do people don't like getting f***** up you kick someone's ass they're going to remember it. this idea that you going to be able to suppress people bye-bye attack Nimitz hitting them with bike locks and you know and not letting them speak at universities that you know you're you're you're protesting at it's it's Madness and it's it's it's so confusing because it's not indicative of what I always thought of when I thought about left-wing people I thought they were peace-loving people were well-educated and instead you're getting these people that from their f****** computer they're calling for violence but you don't know what violence is nothing is too from what I've seen it didn't start with the bike locks write it started with no shot this person down and then it's like fist fights and they're throwing rocks and then it's bike locks and now I hear people you know get your guns and starts to rise to that level I'm like okay yeah you people need to come down because the theory of revolution is country like this pump the brakes homeboy this is more important than anything we need to be calm with each other you know this this idea that yelling people down stops anything you just going to make people yell louder on the other side that did that s*** does not work that's not all human beings operate when it with you want human beings to appreciate your perspective find the things that you agree on and and work towards a better Humanity work towards a better more loving way of interacting with each other this is possible while disagreeing and this is one of the most things I think that we could ever Express in terms of how to communicate with each other you don't have to shout people down like that the best way to do it is to try to figure out the points that you can agree on find out what you disagree on and find out why you disagree on it and you're always going to get Bad actors right you was going to get people that are in there that they don't care they're not reasonable to just want to win and we'll do this a giant problem with that kind of communicating cuz it's so absolute it's my way or the highway that's that's where violence comes from that's where that's where real If This Were Real physical conflicts that's where they come from when there's no way to negotiate is no way to communicate outside of that I just think it's bizarre is not the right where I think it's sad that the vast majority from again my opinion but I see his people who are identifying with s*** you can see on the street sign like left or right like you're telling me that is a species that is nuances we can get you want to completely defined El Senor Audiology in your beliefs by something little you can see just driving your car turn left turn right I don't understand it I don't it's the exact opposite World it to go back to ignore getting out of military and just kind of entering into the world like what's going on makes no sense to me and makes me extremely uncomfortable I hate hearing people calling for violence especially calling for violence was not necessary against you when you were you had to deal with in the military the most intense form of a conflict that's available on planet Earth the most intense form of conflict is war that's the real conflict that's real consequences you've suffered them physically you've seen countless friends up with him physically that's the real s*** so when you see people from universities from these coddled environments and these these these people with it really and completely ignorant perspective as to what the actual consequences of violence are calling for it is his bananas on one hand I'm glad that they haven't experienced it because I can tell that they haven't just by the way that they're acting him I'm glad that they didn't have to do that but I'm the other one it's a tough pill to swallow because I just don't understand war war is a it's about as high consequence as you can get for sure likes it reset your it reset your perspective in the last think that I would ever want to see you is that here on the streets of the US like I just I can't even imagine how destructive what would it would destroy our country for sure but I also don't I can't figure out and the route out of where we are people are calling for violence right other countries trying to incite a get grouped together what's a navigate Route out of that mushrooms okay head when I said that route I'm hoping the things don't have to come to a head I'm hoping that we don't have a Kent State or some some horrible event in this country were you know protesters and and the people that oppose them get into some horrible deadly violent encounter cuz so far other than Charlottesville that time that guy ran over that woman be a car what we're seeing most of this violence being at least somewhat contain to fisticuffs right and don't know that the professor to hit that guy with a bike lock and weather instances of people getting knocked out punched and hit with sticks we haven't seen mass shootings and murder but God damn it that's s***'s close its Lloyd especially loves you and rallies and people are like you know let's do it open carry rally operator Chic apparel with I look at the pictures of that I'm like okay you have a lot of stuff for stuff that's on f****** backwards you know like I'm looking like okay you have all the tools but you obviously you don't practice with them the danger of just you know what's the next step first we're just going to let you know we're going to we're all of our stuff all right well if it started Fist and then went by clocks and then went show up with your Civil War gear right what's the next step after that shooting yeah I mean I don't know I don't want to get involved in that I mean well you picked a good spot where you're at in Montana where I live does not suck ya hang out there and move in once the first few rounds fired the dust starts to settle I just as I would want to come off at the house of course the problem is is that happens and I'm not I guarantee you I'm not the only one that feels like that I'm going to get involved then it's going to be a serious problem for those individuals because I'd get my military career see across-the-board average absolutely nothing spectacular about my career I've done more than some way less than others but I've sacrificed enough that I'm knocking allow those people to tear but it's the last thing on earth I want to do but they put me in that position I know that myself and many other people in that same boat are going to get involved and I don't know if that's going to help the problem but it's going to get ugly pretty fast I just don't remember a time where the country spend so divided in terms of I mean I don't know whether it's because of social media and because of the Russian influence on social media compounded with having Trump as a president compounded with any people that feel like they're disenfranchised and they they don't feel like they're like that you know you hear about this all the time in regards to income inequality yet it will feel disenfranchised they feel like the system has failed them and that's why so many young kids are favoring socialism and why so many young kids are moving towards that day I think that anything's got to be better than watching these rich cats with all this money control in the world and that the only way to get out of that has Revolution but damn you're you know like there's a lot of people that are not those fat Ridge KY your positioning yourself against appears normal regular American who happen to be conservative you know when conservative does not always have to equal racist it doesn't always have to equal white supremacy it doesn't always have to equal all the negative connotations you know religious fanaticism and all these different things that people always attached towards conservatism doesn't have to mean that it can it could just mean people who are prudent with their finances who are you know they're they're cautious with the way I think they've been more conservative in their values and their ideals if this is that's not a bad thing necessarily but we've got it lumped into these two groups left vs right and is very little gray area with the tyranny of or you know it's as if there's only two choices either left or right yeah where's the end where is the trend to the left and you also have some values that are associated with the right this is that's not a bad thing necessarily but we've got it lumped into these two groups left vs right and is very little gray area with the tyranny of or you know it's as if there's only two choices either left or right yeah where's the end where is the trend to the left and you also have some values that

Do you think that there's a way that you could use like his methods and get through that with less pain potentially even though you know all of the skills that I used in Kodiak I did not ever use a single one of them operationally I use his breathing method in the cryotank that makes tomorrow therapy that makes sense but that orc does Arctic conditions I don't know at least in the modern theaters of War were in gay I don't know where the applicability would be so it might be a little bit of a benefit versus time expended to teach the guys that stuff you know because unless it's were talking like Korea probably farther in the northern you know latitude that mean it's amazing like I said I didn't use a single bit of it what you're going to do a 20 km hike into the backcountry and snowshoes there is no end state to this there's no target you're going to do anything on your just going to go out there and you're going to do it you're going to survive out there and it's going to suck for 3 days and I'm going to come back you just embrace the suck or you learn how to pack your backpack better you know or you learn how to move better over that terrain are you on how to navigate in that environment is always an essence of it but it just happens to be that there's usually a pain component with it as well a lot of military training is like that pain compliance in in the actual learning technique as well Ernie technique I mean it is really you're learning a technique to manage your mind under sucky conditions and bread that is a technique as well right so I was like having a conversation with somebody about this recently I'm of the opinion that really the only thing that I learned how to do when I was a seal was to enhance my ability to learn other things it's your selecting for people in to get to that point you got to maintain control your emotions whether you're in pain or you're hot or cold today is that at that essence of self-control but then they require so many different skill-sets and so many different things that the selection process is looking for and then at the end of it teaching people how to become better Learners and then you just refine that over and over and over again over career it's the ability to learn is probably the biggest takeaway that I have time in service I think that's the best thing you could ever really learn is learning how to learn Gaelic learning how to learn correctly learning how to actually pay attention to what someone teaching you and absorb it and follow the steps rather than f*** it up with your own ego and your own insecurities or whatever it is it's going to trip you up if you can get good at something you know you can you can apply that to almost anything if you really focus yeah and and then they would pair it with will surround you buy Pokemon make you better at shooting so weird parent with will surround you buy Pokemon make you better at shooting so we are going to go find world champion pistol carbine Shooters go apply your ability to learn with them and then we do it 4 weeks okay now you're going to specialize you're going to be appointment so you need to be able to navigate and climb so we're going to send you out to Joshua Tree for 2 weeks with world-class climbers go apply your ability to learn with them and then jumping and then diving and then tactics and then fill in the blank over a career</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and he's making $50,000 a year and you tell him that automation is going to take away his job but good news were going to give you $12,000 a year that's a substantial loss and income and yeah it also leaves them with this feeling of uselessness or hopelessness that they're not contributing and I think one of the things that people enjoy is earning their own way you know they people don't it sounds counterintuitive people don't like free money they like a feeling of satisfaction of a job well done that they've created something they've done something yeah you're hundred percent right it's one reason why we call this the freedom dividend we say look it's not money for nothing you're an owner and shareholder of the richest country in the history of the world just like when I buy Verizon or Microsoft they send me a dividend like I don't complain about that like you are now a shareholder in this great nation and you get a dividend but when I was with Dennis the trucker Amazon trucking company in Iowa the the role that job playing in truckers wives is vital and again I'm a very data-driven Guy where men deal with joblessness very very poorly by the Numbers we spend between 40 and 75% of our time on the computer playing video games or doing other things we are substance abuse goes up are volunteering in the community down even though we have more time and we generally spiral into antisocial and self-destructive behaviors now this is not something that's experienced by women in the same levels like women and joblessness women actually more adaptable they're more likely to go back to school and volunteer they don't spend all the time on the computer is the way that we do so there's a real problem and the purpose of universal basic income is not meant to be a job replacement truckers because right now those truckers and when I talked to the truck driver so I've been campaigning for president now for a number of months so I spent a lot of time in Iowa which is a really huge Trucking Hub and you go to them and say hey guys you worried about robot trucks taking our jobs feel like there's no way I could take my job like that that's like totally matter-of-fact like this is not something that they worry about their attitude has transitioned from that someone to we should make robot trucks illegal or we should know it's about a robot truck and not displacing shift because a year ago there were like it's impossible the idea that American would say we should make a robot job illegal like it's the we should have some laws that keep you from being free to use robots for your business instead of person like you should be forced to highly mandatory unionization or something that sounds pretty ridiculous well that's where a lot of them are Joe so only 13% of truckers are unionized so 87% are like Dennis where there is small independent firms and a lot of them actually bought at least their own trucks so they took out tens of thousands of dollars and equal in my mortgage to get this truck and so we have to compete against the robot truck that doesn't stop not like you know that's existential level stuff and right now truck drivers have time use Galatians where they cannot drive more than 14 hours a day so you can't you literally cannot compete for him because the robot trucks just going to keep going our 15-16-17 etcetera so these guys make some of the make really good money like some that make 70 75 80 thousand dollars is one of the higher paying jobs for men without a college degree and so if you look at what they're facing it's not so crazy that they're like hey you need to make the room illegal because for them what is the next best economic alternative if the robot trucks take over that job like when they can I go from here it's not crazy for them but it's a crazy idea to tell company that they can't do something it's more efficient safer and probably economically more viable from automating truck driving or estimated to be 168 billion dollars per year and not just labor savings but also equipment utilization cuz a truck never stop fuel efficiency do the trucks can daisy chain together so there's less wind resistance you were accidents cuz right now truck accidents kill about 4,000 people a year so you probably save lives is a very very powerful argument for the fact that we should be trying to automate this stuff but on the other side you have literally three and a half million truckers for their livelihood to support their family and there's going to be a lot of passion a lot of resistance to this anyone who thinks the truck drivers are just going to shrug and be like all right I guess I had a good run I'm just going to go home and figure it out that's not going to be their response it's going to be much more likely that they say you need to make these robot trucks illegal or they just going to park their trucks across the highway get their guns out cuz a lot of these guys are ex-military and just be like hey like I'm not moving my truck until you know I get my job back and they'll be a lot of truckers in the same situation you really think that would happen well I did was blocked the highway for their job back that's less efficient killed more people so I was with these truckers in the truck stop in Altoona Iowa and Joe they have really really difficult jobs I mean I don't know you knew truckers where you were but they they have this 14-hour window where they allowed to drive their truck and they drive most of that so they have these other 10 hours and they sleep in their truck or trucks have a bed they going to the truck stop they take a shower and there's a laundry and they're like plugged into this machine of this truck of an end the industry you know they spend days and times weeks on the road a lot of them listen to podcast probably a lot of them listening right now a lot of them listen to podcast and they're doing it primarily because it's a more lucrative opportunity than the other jobs that are available to them a lot of them have families that like you know like supporting their families and so if you say hey guys like you know times up for for this way of life most of them I think we like I actually I look at how much they frankly they'd like injure there so much Insurance baked into a job that I think most of them will be like some of the guys you and I know where they're much more likely to like implode or like you know do something where where it's self-destructive then they would be to take the truck and you know park it across the highway a population of hundreds of thousands including many small-business owners and small business owners have a mentality very often like I've been an entrepreneur I'm a Serial entrepreneur for like last 20 years like you're an entrepreneur and if you saw this happen you might say hey I'm adaptable I'll figure it out or you might say hey I think I can do something about this like if I park my truck this way like that's going to cause such Havoc that it's like hundreds of millions of dollars worth of economic harm very very fast and if you look at the inductor Revolution which people cite as the precursor to what we're going through there were Mass riots in the industrial revolution that killed dozens of people cause billions of dollars worth of damage Labor Day is a holiday today because of those riots and then we implemented Universal High School in 1911 in part as a response to these riots so according to the estimates this is called the fourth Industrial Revolution and we're going to displace jobs at three to four times the rate of that Industrial Revolution implementing Universal High School in 1911 in part as a response to these riots so according to the estimates this is called the fourth Industrial Revolution and we're going to displace jobs at three to four times the rate of that Industrial Revolution and that Industrial Revolution included Matt Ryan's so thinking that this one will not strikes me as really really optimistic and perhaps unrealistic</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> thanks for having me my pleasure Sam Harris sends his regards yeah Sam's a beautiful man he is I love that guy and he's one of the reasons why you're here so Universal basic income this is what this is all about yes that's what my campaign for president is all about that's an interesting like focus of a campaign and very unusual and I mean four years ago you never even thought that would have a chance at all but this is a subject that has been momentum and it made it I made a big shift cuz I had my friend Eddie Wong on once and he was the first person to bring it up and I my initial knee-jerk reaction was to get the f*** out here like Universal basic income just going to give you the money to just going to be lazy nothing that's a terrible idea and then I started paying attention to the rise of AI and Automation and how many jobs are going to get taken away and then once you see the actual numbers it's pretty staggering JoJo like I spent the last seven years running an organization that I'd started called Venture for America and we helped create about 3,000 jobs in Detroit Cleveland St Louis Birmingham New Orleans other cities around the country and I saw that we're pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom and that for every 5 10-50 jobs that my Runners are going to create we're going to lose 5-10 50,000 jobs it's not something that people intuitively suspect could be a real issue you either it's it's one of the ones we kind of have to let go Shake people like a look at this this is coming there's a clip we're going towards this Cliff it is darker still in that so when I was digging into the numbers I found that it's not this Cliff that we're heading towards it's actually more of a curve that were on a what I've been telling people is that were in the third inning now we're one of the main reasons why Donald Trump won in 2016 is that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs that were based Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio Wisconsin Missouri Iowa all the swing states needed to win in the center of the country and a lot of that was just manufacturing work and if you go to a factory you'll see it's a giant robot arms as far as the eye can see no not just that you have artificial intelligence on the horizon it's that we've been eating away at the most common jobs in the US economy for almost 20 years now and it's just now hitting a point where it's pushing more and more unskilled men in particular out of the workforce now are there other Alternatives that you considered other than just Universal basic income like educating people about this being real issue and perhaps pushing them or directing them towards other occupations is a little bit more people have a sense of it I was just with a bunch of truck drivers in Iowa last week and there's a guy Dennis mcgaskey that gave me a ride from Altoona Grinnell in Iowa where I've been campaigning and the truth of it Joe is that there are three and a half million truck drivers in this country right now is most common job in 29 States and the average trucker is a 49 year old guy with a high school education maybe ex-military like Dennis was not making like $50,000 a year so then if you say hey I'm going to retrain half-a-million truck drivers for what exactly is like issue number one of these guys didn't love school years ago it's not like driving a truck is made them really excited about the idea and then the new job you're training them for I looked into the data as to how good we were at retraining let's a displaced manufacturing workers in the midwest when we started decimating their jobs and we're terrible at like according to independent studies government-funded retraining programs had a success rate of between 0 and 15% in real life like this is what actually happened to the workers of Michigan and Indiana and Ohio and so if you say we're going to return these people than you also have to come up with a way for us to become amazing at something that right now we're really really bad at and if you were an employer which you are would you rather employee a fifty-year-old former truck driver with health problems who got some certificate program but would you rather hire a twenty-five-year-old Kenny went to Community College is probably cheaper has lower expectations and his skills are natively going to be a little fresher I mean if you were unemployed probably choose number 2 I agree but I'm trying to look at this through rose-colored glasses I guess if there's a way that these people can adapt you know I mean some will for sure you can retrain and reschedule some people but if you look at even the conversations were having around this where people legitimately talk about retraining coal miners to be software Engineers stuff that on the face of it makes no sense but the reason why we're stretching for that is because we're looking for some kind of retraining RI it solution when the numbers show that that's just not going to be the recipe for actual success this is where this whole learn-to-code controversies coming out online we're at people actually getting banned for riding learn-to-code it's really a hot subject on Twitter and it's very confusing to and I haven't really got an explanation for why that's such an offencive thing to say but people are getting banned for even joking around saying learn-to-code of its read very weird but the idea behind it is that it's kind of preposterous to ask someone who doesn't have an education to do something that's as difficult as code computer language and unfortunately we're going to get to a point where a I can do some basic coding at a certain level so if you think about the impulse to say learn-to-code what is really saying is you need to do something at the market values it's like being a truck driver the market value that much and 1/2 trucks are drying themselves next 5 to 10 years so what does the market value and then people are like well coding and stem and and Engineering skills and so there's a drive to try and push people in those directions but if you look at the numbers about 8% of American jobs right now are in stem Fields like in technology engineering math Etc to talk about 92% of the population that is not in those fields and it's unrealistic to expect that 92% to somehow shift into the 8% Right End even beat places for them. That's your two perfectly seamlessly transition there's too many people for those jobs Universal basic income in part because I've been looking at the numbers the five most common jobs in the United States right now are administrative and clerical work retail and sales food service and food prep truck driving and transportation and Manufacturing those five jobs comprise about half of All American jobs only 32% of Americans graduate from so the average American High School got doing one of these five jobs and if you look at it Technologies already doing a number on each of these jobs like the first administrative and clerical include call center workers and they eyes in the process of taking over that job retail and sales 30% of malls are closing in the next four years so that the danger here is to think of it as artificial intelligence is coming it's actually already eating up the most common jobs in our economy and it's driving Americans got into distress in various ways in the numbers now when you talkin about Universal basic income to just two questions to come up how much money and where is it coming from ya so first I want to say that if you look at the heritage of universal basic income it's a deeply American idea where Thomas Paine was bored at the founding of the country and then Martin Luther King was for it Milton Friedman The Godfather of conservative Economist was for it and one state has had it in effect for 37 years where everyone in that state gets $2,000 a year no questions asked Miss Alaska around telling people is that technology the oil of the 21st century so I know you spoke to another guest about hey how do you get let's say approximately 3 trillion dollars a year to find Universal basic income and the great thing is that it's the first thing is it's not actually three trillion and the reason why it's not 3 trillion is that if you look at what we're currently doing we have we're spending 1.5 trillion right now on 126 welfare programs in Social Security and so if you show up to someone's door and say hey here's a dividend of $1,000 a month but if you're already getting more than $1,000 and stuff we're not just going to stack it on top you know we're going just going to say you're guaranteed a thousand and if you're already getting more than this doesn't touch you you can keep your current stuff if you're getting 700 in food stamps and what not then you can just get 300 on top so that 3 trillion actually a lot very fast because of the fact that about half of Americans are already getting various income support from the government so the real price tag is closer to about 1.8 trillion if you say everyone who's 18 and up now for context the entire US economy is in a 20 trillion up five times in the last 12 years and the federal budgets for trillion so you looking at 1.8 trillion it's a lot of money but it's actually manageable and one of the things I haven't heard discussed here with you is that when you put money into people's hand the money doesn't disappear like if I gave you a thousand bucks a month they probably would not make a big difference in the economy cuz we're just going to your account somewhere and you know nothing would happen but we all know that right now most Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck 57% of Americans can afford an unexpected $500 bill so you put $1,000 a month in their hands it's going to go right back in the economy they're going to spend it on childcare car repair than putting off the occasional night out and then all of those businesses end up hiring more people and then we end up getting some of the money back as tax revenues so other 1.8 trillion you were going to get back let's call it 400 billion in new tax receipts because everyone's going to be spending more money we're going to save 1 to 200 billion on things like incarceration and homelessness services and emergency room health I was in New Hampshire last month in a prison guard centimeters a prison guard he said we should pay people to stay out of jail because we waste so much money when they're in jail like you see is all the waste in the system so if you imagine a society where everyone is getting a thousand bucks a month that's like a it's a great incentive to try and stay out of jail because if you end up in jail because when you come out of jail you're less inclined to commit a crime and head back in how much crime you think you'd actually prevent them but giving people $1,000 a month I mean think most of the people that are doing crime whether it's Steve thievery or assault they're not thinking this out you know this is this is just either a way of life for them either the you know their real mental issues or a pattern of behavior that they can't break I really don't think that $1,000 a month going to fix any of that Usher and we'll still have jails that's not like you no Silver Bullet but at the margins would it keep like that person who's falling through the cracks and feel like they have no place in society and maybe that you know it's like the people around them are also like hey you know you don't have any value in like a thousand bucks a month maybe like it keeps them off at the margins and everything we're talking about is at the margins mean everything is like this statistical curve and you're taking the people who are let's call like the last 10. 8% but if you reduce are incarcerated population by 10 to 20% mean that's billions and billions of dollars So you you're saving money on a bunch of things we spend like it about a trillion dollars on right now like healthcare incarceration homeless services and then the the magic is that if you have a thousand bucks a month and you're a parent so you feel this that Studies have shown that your kids are healthier better nourished more likely to go Freedom High School and get further education mental health improves relationships and prove domestic violence goes down hospital visits go down and your worker productivity goes up me and you're an entrepreneur and CEO so you know when you run a company you say I'm going to invest in my people I'm going to like treat them well and try and train them and give them resources cuz you know that'll increase your productivity as an organization and the public sector we have the opposite approach we're like if I can just avoid spending money on you I'm going to somehow save money when we end up spending that money and very very dark costly counterproductive ways in the back end cuz they wind up you know in our institutions institutions to spend a truckload of money so if you look at the cost savings and a value games and economic growth that actually get you back about a trillion dollars of the 1.8 this is like the trickle-up economy cuz none of the money it goes right back into the economy and the way you get the last eight hundred billion or so is related to what we think is happening with AI in all these Advanced Technologies cuz if you look at who's going to win with a i and self-driving cars and trucks the savings from robot trucks are estimated to be 168 billion dollars a year just from that one thing so the problem is that the American public is going to see very little of that money because the dollar better grade it does not paying a lot of taxes they'll move it through Ireland Amazon will say didn't make any money this quarter no reason to pay taxes and see what we need to do is we need to put in a new tax that actually get the American public a slice of every robot truck mile Amazon transaction Facebook ad and every other industrialized country already has this text called value-added tax and because our economy is so Vast at 20 trillion of value-added taxes even have the European level generates about a hundred billion in new revenue and that gets you all the way there so this is much more achievable and affordable than most people think when they start unpacking how the numbers work out so essentially would be the biggest corporations the the companies that gain or that have the largest revenue they're going to be paying most of this buy more stuff that's true for all of the big companies what I say to CEOs and I've spoken to groups of dozens of CEOs what's really bad for business is when people don't have money to spend on your business is when they do so they're going to give up some money at the top end with things going to end up getting it back when they're consumers end up spending a bit more than actually flushed out like they had the real numbers or the projections of how much they're going to get back rejected would create two million new jobs and grow the economy by 8 to 10% and then you can model out what that means to each business because in that climate they're going to see a similar up taking Revenue did they factor in all the jobs that are going to be lost so that one of the things that's a misconception about Universal basic income is that it somehow will like facilitate job lost both of job losses do is the reason for Universal basic income in the first place like right now we're sitting here together the labor force participation rate in the United States is 63% which is the same levels is El Salvador in the Dominican Republic that's right now like 94 million or so Americans have left of Workforce over the last number of years now a lot of that natural demographics a lot of that people in school but about five million of it is unskilled man who got pushed out of the workforce so so again this is not like no we're going to solve a problem it's coming down the pike like we're actually in the middle of this problem so if you put a thousand bucks a month in the people's hands that actually grows the economy and create jobs because of more economic activity now when you say a problem is coming down the pike what what are the projections in terms of Life a timeline so there are a lot of the projections are actually pretty consistent with each other which means they're probably right so beans as you're looking at between 20 and 30% of job subject to automation by 2030 which is pretty soon take 11 years in that Mackenzie says about 25 per-cent the Obama White House Little Italy Fair last day in office they issued a report saying hey guys we can automate away all the jobs and then like to know turn the lights off they said 83% of jobs that make less than $20 an hour will be subject to automation by 2030 and Mighty Is saying the same thing jobs and then like to know turn the lights off they said 83% of jobs that make less than $20 an hour will be subject to automation by 2030 and Mighty Is saying the same thing and so we have 11 years to try and accelerate meaningful Solutions and this 11 years is that like it all happens on 2030 it's going to happen between now and then progressively according to all of the major institutions that have looked at this</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> base layer in the week was your concern about you sweating while you're pulling all that weight especially initially when it's 375 lb yeah it so one of the famous lines that you know people who have been in the polar environments will say is if you sweat you die and you know it's maybe a little bit of hyperbole but it's not far from the truth which is you start sweating and you stop for even 30 seconds your clothes are literally freezing to your body so it was this crazy kind of kind of balance of being able to pull this get your heart rate elevated enough to keep your body warm but not too warm that you were sweating and so any second I would start sweating I would strip layers off so There Was X specially when there's no wind it still be ambient temperature - 20 - 25 but I would just have like a thin Gore-Tex jacket on and one base layer that's it I mean no really good for me I'm a little bit allergic to synthetic fabric still stay warm GSMArena I honestly Marino's amazing fabric for that reason I'm a fortunate for me like I said it just irritated skin that you could suffer through all that we can't have itchy clothes on the Norwegian about being in the pool and so they've designed a really good jacket and pant that's actually really breathable really got a nice suit sewed a fur Ruff on to the edge so I will a wolf a wolf for a rough on the outer side of the hood thing is Wolf Wolf exactly sell the base layer is a synthetic what what is the material that it's made out of the base layer is yet it's a synthetic like a poly polypropylene quickly and then of course I needed to eat and drink every whatever 30 minutes or whatever actually more like every hour or so I'd stop so I'd stop in the front of my sweat I had a huge I'll be down jacket like a massive like Michelin Man huge puffy down jacket so even if you're stopping for a minute to drink water before even trying to do that boom put the big jacket on to know cold your how cold you can get immediately from stopping and it's just so much colder than one pulling the sled your heart rate stays up and keeps you pretty warm I would imagine you like your your hands and your feet to they'll be a real issue write a small digits yeah I mean fuel frostbites real for sure hands outside of gloves that's why some of the stuff I was doing the training of get my hands with a deck where do you know you have the tile these knots with big gloves mittens on you can't take your clothes off for any size Wheel.

		<div class="paragraph"> education that edible marijuana as we talked about before I think you were in the bathroom the 11 hydroxy metabolite as it's processed by the liver to radically different truck radically different in its really a psychedelic and for me personally edible marijuana and flotation tanks I might as well be taking a f****** bucket of a cell being paranoid and I know this sounds crazy but I think with me gives me and I think I live a pretty blessed life and I like I like the feeling of paranoid because it allows me to explore maybe some are like maybe maybe in abundance of confidence maybe I have too much right maybe I'm too successful what I like about the paranoia that comes with edible marijuana is it allows me to check myself allows put myself examined all of my behavior in the darkest recesses of my mind my thoughts and gives me a profession that makes me a nicer person just a little tiny and then like Joe said I think it makes you reflect sometimes better and more objectively mean that like you don't give you had encounter with someone early in the day and then you know it's late at night and you took up a bit and like all men should have done things a little bit differently you know like that happens to people all all the time to reflect in a different state and sometimes when you reflect in that state you come up with box that that you just want to come up with before my patience say to me all the time like it just kind of brakes this like negative state that I have I'm just able to to to break out of a negative State and think logically your items people say that to me all the time but it's how can I be a better person what am I doing wrong in my life it's not my wife is poisoning me where they shoot me yes different thing and that's why that's why some people or those people need to get the f****** s*** together where that's possible to each other side of the psychotic symptoms you can actually reduce the incidence of violence I was going to mention earlier to bring up genetics because we are teasing out genetics for people and we are discovering that certain people do have certain genetics that dude predispose them to certain cannabis disorders right so I'm involved with it with a company that's doing that right now we're trying to create canvas genetic test for people right and there's three genes that we identified so far no more moons than any pk14 genotyping that has been shown to be associated with a deficit in brain Dawn when to use cannabis and I missed two other genes that apt1 and a c a d and into genotype for both of those have also been shown to be associated with cannabis but again you know how many people have them Jimmy pk14 it's roughly about 8% is what Racine one is around 4% and the cadm to as rounds about 5% so if we can identify I love that stuff lines me if we can identify you know that the people who are at risk then we can Mabley potentially you know you use the medicine in a way where only the people who don't have DVDs genetics are using the medicine and will for the people who do have an Internet Explorer they stick mostly to CBD I just think you do. That's a better approach thing no just just kind of prohibiting cannabis or saying that and we shouldn't we shouldn't use it at all or saying that it's not medicine I think that it should be held to the same standard as any other medicine and I think that if we had an incredible medicine that work for some people and it didn't work for others than what we would do is we try to figure out why and you know I've been doing that my company's been doing that it's called an ant life you want full disclosure I am on the board electric.com and it will let me use these different things different strategies then we can actually reduce the overall harm and that should be another thing that we can add into the mix because I'm sure those people who are definitely more predisposed to mentalism definitely more predisposed to a to psychosis</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> paranoia just normal paranoia is hypersensitivity and Hyper awareness and awareness to a lot of things that you're putting off in the back your head because in order to function as a normal person get through this life you can't really be aware of everything otherwise you'll be lucky space okay we are on a gigantic ball it's spinning curling through Infinity everything was flying around in our solar system by the way the best 85 years and then the last 15 to talk s*** so there there's only so much you really can't think about in some of what paranoia is is this hyper awareness of all these variables that you really haven't haven't considered and then also we were talking about before things that can be beneficial to the hyper awareness of how you communicate with people and maybe you could have done a better job of that maybe you you came in hot maybe you were upset about something else and you ran into them you already at 7 and they brought you to a tenant was told their nests are within a normal situation you would have only been a tattoo that have those things real and sometimes marijuana helps highlight all the errors in your way I think you can be a tool but my description of it is like any other tool like a hammer you can build a house with a hammer or you can just hit yourself in the dick of your f****** crazy and this this is something that I think that we should consider when we're discussing almost any psychedelic medicine and I think that I really do believe that marijuana psychedelic and I don't even think it's especially when it's an edible form at all people that are coming to my office for example in like just what I meet them like after one or two minutes I've just got to decide my head this person's not using THC like this this person is anxious if they had any type of change in their in their psyche they're going to see that as bad as I do know right and like you got it when you're using cannabis you you have to be so on and who who knows that okay I didn't get a little bit of maybe paranoia now or at least my psyche is going to change a little bit I am using a psychoactive substance and not be able to freak out right but some people you know I know that if if they use a little bit of THC they probably were if you use little bit of THC they probably would have a freak out they probably would have a bad experience with people who are very very fearful now the other side of that coin though is that if you CBD and like we discussed earlier that can decrease learned fear right so so that's that's something that that's really helpful for those patients but I do agree that we have to be careful about using highchair and in certain groups of people for sure</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it changes how you your body and your brain deal with with opiates I think the Tim Ferriss is actually talked about that before but I've seen in my practice and there are medical study so I don't think that we should throw out the fact that you'll cannabis can can help the opioid crisis and then also to you you want to look at it from a clinical perspective right so we know that opioids can kill people right cuz the axon the brains then where it was cannabis doesn't so you know what you might be saying you just substituting one for the other and you'll sometimes that is true but if you're using a less harmful substance you it's me that's like a huge Wing right so if someone you don't have to drink 12 Beers a night versus smoking like one joint man that's that's awesome I mean you look at all these clinics like you look at like methadone clinic to me what are they doing. They're trying to get people off one substance to you what's up is little bit less harmful and I think that when you when you use cannabis you know it can be effective at 4 for opioid it can also be effective for it for benzodiazepines and four other medicines as well so you don't need to be awesome if everyone would just you'll feel happy great all the time by just exercising in a nutrition and your that's what I advocate and that's what I try to do personally and that's what I try to do is say to a patient's all the time but I understand all that you know sometimes life is hard sometimes know things hit you know you have yet crisis in your life you have your personal crisis that can throw off your mental health and then you have you get into a car accident to you and you could be in really severe pain in in in those times will sometimes diet exercise meditation doing all the right things just isn't quite enough and you know I think that it's great that we have cannabis for those situations because it does seem to be very effective I've left side effects compared to some of the other medicines are compared to some of the other medicines that we have to Jason Lee used and you know even though you ain't talkin about opiates and death here we can also talk about NSAIDs right like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug so these drugs can also in a wreck havoc on the GI system I start one study Akshay to love. Rhonda Patrick to that said that if you use instead it was really short I got to look it up again but was like two weeks it can decrease your your gonadotropin which can stimulate your testosterone level by 25% and on that note to we should talk about I can't believe this but opiates can drastically inhibit your your testosterone production right which is a huge thing for depression cuz I've had guys come in to me before that I think you'll really really depressed just give him a small amount of testosterone a man throughout the range of depressants of the Off to the Races they're doing so you are we creating a lot of people who are who are depressed because they're using opiates and a testosterone levels are low and your fermented mean having low testosterone horrible you and your libido goes you know you're going to have low motivation and you're not going to feel as well you're not going to do things so if you're giving someone a medicine that that but Nails their their testosterone levels down that's going to really you know wreak havoc on their mental health I just want to make a note is Ben Greenfield to again I really respect I like that guy lot you always talking a little bit with you about testosterone and and cannabis and how can drop it so I think there was three studies I saw done on humans and two of them know that no statistical difference and then drop into sausage rolls and one study the other study noted a small statistical difference so I think that you added me drop in testosterone levels a little bit but it's not going to hit you will substantially drop them so just so people people don't know that because I know that comes up all the time you know I think the issue of whether campus is a gateway drug one argument in exactly pro-legalization argument is one reason it's a Gateway is that if it's illegal you got to buy it from your friendly neighborhood dealer he might have access to heroin or cocaine and other drugs and So eventually maybe you decide to try one of those other drugs legalized they wanted to create an Avenue for people to use cannabis that wasn't connected to Other Drugs okay using an addictive intoxicating substance giving you might want to try other objective intoxicating substances and it might prime your brain and then the third possibility really is that they're just some people Risk Takers out there right they use they're going to use cannabis they're going to gamble they're going to cannabis a little bit easier to access then other drugs so they're probably going to try cannabis first so it's not really that that cannabis drives that use it's just a cannabis is first Portuguese people in your book know so this committee couldn't find sufficient data demonstrating association between cannabis and Michigan opioid use they found no compelling evidence to support the gateway drug Theory so if you're buying from somebody who's got an access other illegal drugs maybe try those drugs at the same time getting high feels good and maybe want to try other drugs and at the same time you're just a risk-taker okay what is what nobody seriously ever said until about the last five years is that cannabis could be an off-ramp for opioids okay and there's a lot of reason to believe it's a really bad idea call the mild pain reliever is not strong of your dying from cancer cannabis probably is not the pain reliever that you need you need opioids okay and again the state-level data is not as good if you want to really figure out what's happening to an individual the best way to do that is to follow that individual and there's a really good paper that came out in 2017 after the name reports they didn't have it that shows that people who used cannabis in 2001 is based on a large National study do you ask were three times as likely to be using opioids three years later okay and that just intuitively make sense to me any other thing that people on the legalization side don't ever talk about is who are the two countries that have the most cannabis use in the west the u.s. and Canada where are the two who are the two countries that have by far the worst opioid epidemic the US and Canada okay but there's a real issue with that because the United States is also the only country other than that allows Pharmaceutical and there's a there's doesn't the amount of opiates prescribed the United States is f****** Preposterous particularly the piano if you ever saw the documentary The Oxycontin Express but the way Florida used to be structured where they didn't have a database yet maybe you could just literally go from yeah yeah yeah cannabis is not part of that over-prescribing problem are deluding themselves and what do you think that so we can repeat the question again I agree with that cannabis is another example of us looking for a drug to solve our problem but what I'm okay again just from a clinical perspective I can't just rely on on diet and exercise for all my patients I have to use other tools and a game like everyone here in this room like we're all pretty healthy I don't have a bad back or you know I don't have a mental health diagnosis there anything going on so cat pictures that are coming to me right so the way I see it is that when we just mention to a bunch of other drugs do antidepressants amphetamines always such a things you'll cannabis and again you know I'm going to separate the chief Zee and CBD it's incredible medicine and it doesn't kill people right so as a clinician you know that that's so comforting for me to know that every single night I go to bed I killed zero people I know that right so if that's really really come from also I feel you were just talking about amphetamines were just talking about ssris I feel that cannabis in particular the CBD component can actually be more effective you know that's what I've seen a lot in my practice and other people have seen that as well so I think that we need to need to take that into consideration when were using all these dogs in and out to Summer things that you're saying you know they're quite him out of wool and and in a lot of things like researchers say you know are quite adorable as l&amp;n your day they feel that they can you tell commissions you give him really good advice but they're not the ones in the trenches they're not the ones in front of the people they're not the ones that the half to have to chat with patients you know I have an obligation to do something for my patients to make them better I really feel and we just listed a bunch of drugs that cannabis is a really really effective tool and it doesn't kill anybody so it will because of that you're I am I going to using it but like I said I'm always looking for other jobs I'm always looking for other your alternates that to also help my patients but I think that you know using cannabis it is is really effective tool for a lot of clinicians and it's helped a lot of patience so I don't feel that hydraulic I do feel that you know one of the two things that you mentioned earlier is that your some people kind of had this personality where they're like the worst damage right and they they yet they just want I want to try something so the fact is that alcohol and cannabis just get introduced first most of the time most people you know don't do no Coke or LSD and then he may say hey man let's try some some cannabis right that the very first one there so if we you can say anything that that that was easier access if there was some new drug that you know did something similar to alcohol or similar to Canvas that was introduced in in our society may be calling back to gateway drug and I do feel and I do believe that they don't feel that that cannabis is a gateway drug either and then again they said that they found no compelling evidence to support the Gateway Theory and they gave him these are the people that you are Cory and in your book out right as I let minutes go a little bit further they said in a retrospective cohort study and they it from ATL and 2016 exam the transition from cannabis use to the use of other illicit drug they found that the probability of ignition other electric drugs African did not differ significantly probability of stuff starting with other illicit drugs so it's just that cannabis is there first it's definitely not a gateway drug in any stretch of the imagination via it illegally tends to open you up illegal stop for legalization but I do want to throw one thing out there you know I don't know how many of your viewers have teenage kids are in Spicer probably more likely to be teenager has a gateway to THC vaping so you can first one gets people it gets kids teenagers used to inhaling you know this illicit substance and you can actually retrofit a juul pod with THC they don't sell them but you can easily go online and look up how to do it and I think it really worries me and I've heard from a lot of parents in the last month that there is an epidemic of nicotine vaping and THC vaping going on right now and that I think and I were talking about 15 16 that there is an epidemic of nicotine vaping and THC vaping going on right now and that I think and I were talking about 15 16 17 year old inhaling pure THC the most dangerous form of this drug and I think unfortunately it's not going to take long before the mental health consequences of that become a parent and and I really do hope that the book gives parents some tools to talk to their kids about that nothing else</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> in the first chapter of book which I guess you haven't read and I really should have a copy for me stupid of me I got to copy my back run by British doctors and with these doctors really as early as like the late 1850s and 1860s noticed was that allow the people who showed up in these hospitals were showing up with cannabis what they called ganja actually it is called ganja or bong which is very weak preparation of of of basically Indian hemp just serve low grade cannabis and so we're coming to asylums we're heavy cannabis users and that was way more than alcohol with more than opium and its really fascinating doctor named George Francis William you'uns wrote a book in 1908 and he looked at the evidence and it is amazing to hear how he described schizophrenia how we describe cannabis how he describes the cases of violence around cannabis it's like it's like any psychiatrist today everything in the book Woodring completely true and it was so fascinating to me to stumble on this and realize this is something people were talking about for more than a hundred years so could we agree that there are some people where cannabis is not a good idea absolutely agree that some people can't eat peanuts let's kill you that's it's more dangerous so these the FM 600 years people die from correlation for homicide in schizophrenia studies that refute that has multiple studies you'll marijuana laws are not associated with with any type of violence psychosis and schizophrenia which are correlated with murder so we're saying they're not clearly their trigger Staffing absolute fact of the paranoia and delusions and you think that comes out to get you and they're not advocacy groups hate talking about this way they talk about it obviously because it stigmatizes people with mental illness so what they say and this is true is if you have a diagnosis but you're taking your antipsychotics even though the side effect might be unpleasant you're in treatment you're you're you're not using recreational drugs you risk for violence isn't that high it's not that much higher than a healthy person okay and you know fortunately healthy people don't commit murder that often the problem is if you if you think about the math for half a second if there's this one group of people who don't have a very high risk for Murder World Series violence who because they're not using because they're on antipsychotics it means that the excess risk in the people who are using and whose untruth psychosis is untreated it must be spectacular Lehigh and the numbers bear that out so so there's a really good study from last year 2018 Switzerland is it safe country is a low base crime rate but 50% of the people who were using cannabis and had psychosis over a three-year period committed violence in that group of people that's mostly 20 something that is a study here and I just sent it to you Jamie and it's it's titled risk factors for violence in psychosis a systemic review and meta-analysis of 110 studies so it's it's quite a few studies okay just just read part of it out of to Cervantes strongly a source with the history of polysubstance abuse during suicide with diagnosis of culminated substance use disorder and recent substance misuse and Marley so sweet with a history of alcohol since he's a history of substance misuse recent alcohol misuse recent drug misuse and a history of drug misuse it was unclear if there was an association between violence and history of cannabis masseuse so again 110 studies are they very carefully looked at all of the different risk factors as what could trigger bosses let me finish Alex and what they said again it was unclear if there was an association between balance and a history of cannabis misuse write 110 studies so exactly so I did everything else was found to have significant statistically and I have not been I'm just a minor without looking at it I can't push back as hard as I would like but I can tell you is that I have many studies in the book that show the cannabis use is associated with violence in people with psychosis okay and more broadly is associated with violence in the general pop mission in large studies in studies of high school students and bullying in studies of people who were vacationing in Ibiza in in in studies of young man in China and the UK there are big studies out there that show cannabis use is associated with violence Ibiza Ibiza yeah it's supposed to give you some dignitary Royal person had a lisp right isn't that how it all started true words directly affected by this one person apparently but so this this correlation between people that have schizophrenia and using cannabis how do you is schizophrenia a diagnosis is purely based on Behavior basically yes yes there's no blood test to brain scan it's basically how you behave and what you tell the doctor about how you write because you're asking someone different than depression really I'm just asking someone serious questions and then you were based upon that which is very subjective then you're going to make me laugh where's when it's like a blood test like if someone passes a certain amount of hemoglobin A1c or the payment which chart you're looking at then you're going to call that person pre-diabetic and diabetic but unfortunately just don't have those objective measurements and again that's why y'all out to saying earlier that that you will be at they couldn't really figure out and how many people in the United States had had schizophrenia and I understand that but at the same time to I mean it's okay to to adjust the way that you diagnose someone over the course of the years and you learn things because you're you can easily say that almost everyone has some type of mental illness and we need people should understand that with her seven different basic human emotions going to talk to his fourth there's there's anger discontent discuss the sphere sad and surprised and happiness at 7 so depending on which way surprise goes I mean six out of those seven or negative will wire to a basically detect threats so you know we're making are the all these diagnoses I think we have to be careful because it was some people call themselves to process healthier, selves anxious when really you know they're just not dealing with basic human emotions that they need to understand and I need to deal with like people are getting angry about being angry or like depressed about being depressed because you fear one of these emotions just kind of sit with it and just kind of reflect on it and I think you own at the much much better way to kind of kind of tea do things up button you want to come back to my original point I think that you're more people are understanding that we don't just need to give out a pill for everything in that you're Evelyn shouldn't just be labeled as having a mental health diagnosis because if they just keep going the way they are you know what what the bite by 24 it's going to be like fifty percent of people are going to have like a mental health disorder like you just need to understand that life is hard you got to do with these emotions sometimes it's not that big that's right. Jordan Peterson beer than he's ever been in his life and that is it it was another it was massively controversial subject a little bit comparison between cannabis subsequent violent Behavior new research published online in advance of print of a journalist like psychological medicine concludes the continued use of cannabis causes violent behavior is a direct result of changes in brain function that are caused by smoking weed over many years researchers have long debated a possible link between the use of marijuana and violent crime and contrast alcohol math and many other illegal drugs the mellowing effects of cannabis seemed unsuited to promoting violent behavior however ample previous research has linked marijuana use to increase violent Behavior the sticky problem in such studies of the medi confounding factors co-founding factors involved in interpreting this correlation or instead the two Associated or instead the torsos to some other factors such as socioeconomic status personality traits from A other variables that are related to the propensity to use marijuana in London 97% of which were Caucasian and all of them are raised in two-parent households so sexier terrible idea play fall asleep at night now that's obviously not a healthy way to use alcohol but it doesn't make them violent but we know on a population basis that alcohol causes violence it causes drunk driving it causes problems and it said that in the study that that I put her earlier but it said that alcohol again they they didn't either soy canvas they weren't sure cannabis for a lot of people yeah they can just smoke it and its people in how many people tweeted at me the only thing I attacked was a bowl of nachos right and so and so that's true for some people that can be sent with alcohol as well as so many studies that say that that the cannabis laws of actually decrease crime cannabis isn't going to cause violence that doesn't mean it can't cause violence in some people especially or at least could be a fact would least could be a factor especially with a kind of violence that I am talking about and then I write about in the book which is again so alcohol it may be makes argument into a bra and makes a bra into something or somebody picks up a stick it makes that into something where somebody pulls out of Nike it escalates where cannabis is different cannabis causes paranoia and psychosis and it certainly temporarily even if it doesn't cause them permanently sword in reality that could lead to doing something terrible and it's usually to somebody you're not actually fighting with it's a family member that the worst cases that I've really seen a lot of these cases are basically innocent family members who are just in the way when somebody loses touch with reality and literally things like this my 85 your grandmother is going to kill me so I better stabbed her to death first that happens it happens a lot and if you look at the amount of violence that people with psychosis commit on a population level basis it looks like people with schizophrenia come in about 6 to 10% of all the murders in this country and it looks like people through water to more broadly defined psychosis again bipolar with psychosis other psychotic conditions temporary psychosis they might be responsible for as much as 20% of the violent crime in the United States that's a lot of violent crime and where I am it is quite clear that drug use mediates that violent crime another if you're not using you can keep your impulses in check but when you do use you become dangerous so when we're talkin about biological variability if we factor in schizophrenia essentially what you're saying is that there are people that have schizophrenia that don't commit violence but that they're much more likely to commit violence if you add some sort of Psych medication whether it's marijuana weather is something else if perturbs real play for them particularly marijuana products bring down the recreational cannabis and a stimulant because they Bow by cocaine terrible story from Connecticut yet we don't know whether or not he would have become a schizophrenic and an exhibit do symptoms without the marijuana we really don't know but we do know he did with it that's that's correct and in what I would also say is that for somebody like that and this is quite clear on a population level basis with people with schizophrenia from using hurricane people some people on the right say where you can't prove that global warming caused that one hurricane that would have happened anyway any and they're right you can't prove it and you can't prove that any one case of psychosis was caused by marijuana but when you look at the big studies at the population level data the association is really clear and everything went the same way and the synthetic cannabinoids K2 and spice those can clearly produce psychosis in people and people with psychosis tend to slip back into it if they use some point you got to start to say to yourself why does everything go the same way I also personal friend and I really didn't think about this guy but there's another personal friend that I know that is a martial arts instructor that had a psychotic break he became schizophrenic and he's a regular marijuana user and the people around him Associated that with that and in fact people that are regular cannabis users were trying to get him to stop using marijuana if you're close to being on the edge and use a little bit of a cannabis for sure it can I was not on the edge when I knew him when I knew him he was very rational or irrational but something happened somewhere along the line was he who did he become a pretty heavy smoker overtime I do not know because we don't live in the same area anymore but he got really heavily really heavily medicated and did some really crazy s*** and want to being hospitalized you and this was not the case before I mean whatever it was that triggered him I mean it when I was around him when he was younger I would have total normal guy and I would have never saw that coming he was a heavy marijuana user heavy heavy why don't I don't know how he's doing now I hope he's okay but we're in a we have mutual friends and he became a schizophrenic and and you know you will see in cases like that but you're when you do look at a lot of the larger data on on cannabis and violence I mean it's just it's just not there like there's lots of data that suggests that you will medical marijuana laws for example of can actually how to decrease in overall Emil's restaurant in Vegas study that says it gives no Comfort to the people who lose their children because of these psychotic breaks I think I think we all agree that marijuana use by itself with people that aren't schizophrenic probably doesn't induce violent crime but with people that are schizophrenic or people wear a trigger schizophrenia it could potentially induced by on cry my friend did not get violence although he did do a violent thing wasn't to a person I think I think we have to be really careful because there's no dislike with diet just like with the food and you don't like allergies all these damn variability when it comes to human beings I think we have to be really really careful about lumping all people together when it comes to how they get affected by various compounds if you look at 2013 and you compare that to 2017 murders in Agra salts violent crimes are up substantially in those States and substantially more than in the US can I stop you that but is there a possibility there's a correlation between organized crime doesn't want two things about selling marijuana is the people that have always been selling marijuana been criminals when you make things legal in a state the people that were selling it illegal flock to that stay in that that's been proven to be true that there's a there is a direct correlation between people being robbed that is there was also a significant problem with credit cards and Banks where everyone was having to do all the transactions with cash there was a lot of violence as was associated with marijuana in regards to that and also massive increase in population have medical marijuana laws that especially the states that are that that that are border state that the crimes going to drop drops out tremendously and it has dropped baby did a study last year and it dropped over such a Colorado to drop 7% in Arizona and then a game you'll Benjamin Jansen in Washington is because there's a large income gap they say it washing has a 10th largest income gap in the United States and how did that change out of that corresponds to the murder inquiry question to him so I didn't get to speak with Benjamin about this increase mental illness how's the income gap shifted that directly correlates to the legalization of marijuana because Jeremy saved because during the same. The income gap particularly in Washington and increase elk so he feels that corresponding number right so he feels that that it's it's likely more to that I mean I understand but I mean you have to respect this guy when he violent crime in those four states increased more rapidly than in the US. Between 2013 and 2017 no credible that exists it supports a significant association between increase violent crime and marijuana legalization furthermore study suggests that so far violent crime decreases and states with legalized medical marijuana until New research credibly suggest otherwise they claim that a demonstrative Bowl link between the two exist will remain class okay so that's just not true okay I know it's Snopes okay and I know we trust Snopes I don't trust him that my okay thank you there 30,000 axle. Okay 2017 Oregon Washington Colorado Alaska their 620 murders in those four states as an almost 40% increase their 38,000 Angus off that's a 25% increase if you adjust for population you still get big increases in Denver 2018 almost 70 murders that were about 35 2013 Seattle 27th 2018 there were 30 or 35 murders they were I think 19 in 2013 these increases are real okay now can we say that marijuana legalization caused those increases we cannot yet there are other possibilities Andrew what are those small population increase is also possible that these States imported violent crime that you got a population of transients coming in in part because marijuana was legal and those people are likely to commit violent crime organized crime people that are selling absolutely there may have been some people who are exporting to to Nebraska to Minnesota to another state there's crime associated with that but what I am saying is unequivocally unequivocally the people who said legalization is going to decrease my like crime and people did say that and Cory Booker and 2017 set it he said that it actually had decreased demand states that legalized legalize marijuana on the federal level those people are wrong and they need to stop saying it I know and by the way that we're going to, misused he used the wrong data set for his charts okay he used I used the wheel numbers okay the FBI homicide numbers he use numbers that include justifiable homicide nohely but I'm not right that the murder rate went up 1% from 2015 to 2016 6% between 2016 and 2017 the numbers are clear okay I use my reading them right now 2016 release of FBI uniform crime reports from Oregon . too so you have to take those four states where marijuana is legalized is sort of cherry-picking data Primark murder and assault robbery and rape rapist Oregon sideways the last year's robberies arcsafe gone down its murders in a bag of salt that are interpersonal violent crime okay just to go back to this organ accounts because this maddens me he used data set that is not the standard data set to report murder rate is the difference in my house you come in I shoot you and kill you the police don't charge me with anything Police Homicide likely to be impacted by cannabis use cops are not smoking when they're on patrol Live Hope and if you are using your very unlikely to have your murder viewed as justifiable homicide the fair comparison is the base murder rate in the US and that's the number that I used and I am telling you I mean I know these numbers I wake up with these numbers cannabis the for cannabis legal states on a per-capita basis crime murders rose 31% on a per-capita basis in those four states over the 2013-2017. Maybe I'm sorry I said 29% so maybe that's the Gap and I am not saying that I know that cannabis legalization cause like that what I'm saying is people need to stop claiming that cannabis legalization reduces violent crime rate increased in those identical more in Washington cyclomatic affect another to psychosis causing effect because cannabis doesn't cause psychosis right away people break down but if it's causing heavy use and some of those people are sliding into in a paranoia and psychosis you sort of expect the Gap to increase over time and that's what happened okay so I'm going to go back again to the Netherlands okay because they've had no cannabis legalized forever and they have one fifth of the homicide rate that the United States but they also have a lower cannabis use that's Route 110 Long and accepted history of people are accustomed to it so I think things kind of even out I think one of the things that we're dealing with with the United States as people that have just they don't they don't have a long history of experience it becomes legal and then they use it and maybe some of them like we're talkin about don't have a tolerance for it have too much and I was talking about my friend who's like this really continent that the one who had an edible and became suicidal and just f***** up for weeks. Is very confident very articulate very until is not a not a weirdo not a. Transient extreme extremely successful you know I think there are there are variables that we need to take into consideration there's certain human beings that exhibit a pattern of behavior that is directly correlated to a cannabis use that I don't experience so if I could save my own personal biases that that's b******* that's nothing it doesn't do anything I've been smoking for years. You probably don't have one of those three genes that we were talking about probably also to you don't don't overuse or you have some type of you no legitimacy as as to why you are you are using it and you're the one I want to keep going with this but at the end of the show I think that we should make some type of like recommendations for people just because I hate when you only have this big 3 Hour podcast and then at the end of it if it's just like hey guys just be safe when you think back through your you know through your life you've thought of somebody who was affected that several people I'll bet I'll bet if you think about it you'll think of more people maybe but those are the big ones and like I said my friend who's a martial arts instructor was a pretty significant issue with a lot of our friends were trying to figure out what was wrong with him beforehand he was sending me these videos that didn't make any sense and I was like what in the f*** is this like I explained you more often are above so I don't have to go out this guy but what was all a lot of people that were close to him we're really seriously concerned and now it is it something that would have happened anyway I don't know don't know how was he how old you know for sure they have done so he's like blow 18 is worse glow15 is worth your 18 like the younger you go the worse and feelings be fine now that's good I don't know if it's because of this that we go through so basically your adolescence you're going to drop off some some week Euro connections to come pick up some stronger once you know it's the best way to kind of explain it when you use canvas you can potentially accelerate the process and then because you accelerate that process you don't get those good neural connections and then you'll people unfortunately into belt things like like psychosis and schizophrenia so you know that's kind of where it where they were the issue lies so you're one thing that I am very happy that were talking about 900 miles to be too is that we want to discuss the benefits and in this podcast make sure that people understand that you know I believe that marijuana is excellent medicine. The other thing about you is we do want to mitigate the risks because there are we real rest out there so you know I'd I do appreciate you know I was talking about Adolescent and making sure that they do stay away from cannabis disadvantaged backgrounds anyway but you know they're using by 11 and it's 16 they put it in and put a gun to somebody's head and pull the trigger and we got to do everything we can to stuff the problem is I like if you if you smoke pot in junior high fix a 789 like you're probably going to smoke pot in high that's what I saw it when I was going up and you know what even when I was home for Christmas for it for a few days like yeah my friends even talked about you some people that we knew you'll smoke ton of pot and High School in like now like their there they're crazier than not really doing too too much you know so if you do have to be careful with that a lot of ignorance ignorance biological variability we don't really understand how a lot of these different things affect people including like just diet and what what what causes depression like what how much what we constitute or what we decided depression is inflammation of poor gut health there's a lot of variables is it a lot of them marijuana is absolutely one of those variables and again I don't have an issue with it I like it I love the stuff but it doesn't it doesn't f*** with me but I'm also honest and so I see these people were it's pretty obvious to me that something's going on and that marijuana is not a good idea for them and I just think you don't like I said in the past I'm I myself have been guilty of using this is the sort of a blanket description of it as being a positive influence and then it's a good thing for people I don't think it's a good thing for everybody know it's definitely not a good thing for everybody and stuffing out a good thing for the people who have that those genetic that I discussed earlier and you're also to like know if you eat you need to have some type of itself when it's like the people who know don't do well with cannabis you know you shouldn't have to eat to have your friend tell that you came in but you're not going to work right you should be Eldorado got your stuff like that's hard for people that's one of the most difficult things for people do self self assess don't think I'd be comfortable using high THC cannabis now knowing what I know but anyways to the people the people the most got some right here I'm paranoid I'm going to smoke through it I'm going to smoke so much that I'm almost comfortable being paranoid and I think that's a dangerous thing to do to your mind your step back from that and stop using that's a silly looking at it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> read my Twitter feed. f*** these people I don't lie I don't read it if I don't put my glasses I don't know what the f*** they're saying over the last few years with myself it I think I don't think marijuana is the safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident about f****** muscular handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep in for 2 weeks is that was for his a different guy nothing I was talking to a different guy he took it in the experience Suicidal Thoughts human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement with good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been a responsible saying that work for alcohol friends I've got some friends to get those gerbil eyes you ever see when she gets shark eyes they just gone and then they start talking crazy and like whoa you know who doesn't use but then in the tolerant user you can use 200 mg in a day that's 80 drinks near drug and then there's the issue of eating it when your body produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite it's far more psychoactive so I think I think the legalization Community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upside the cops will boss smokers will be tax revenue always people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately I think you're right and I think the issue that people are from what I've read or having with your book or people that are marijuana Advocates to think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored positive aspects of THC in terms of like we was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative and I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty to that myself cuz I think that I've only been discussing the positive and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people. viewpoints is exam in my own positions and try to figure out am I coming at this from a truly bound position or am I trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another backup my own work or backup my own my own statements and end insert a prop them up instead of being really honest and objective it's very difficult to do think that that book is going to be up compendium of the pros and cons about I want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons any did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth ain't in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you do a little bit deceiving and deceptive in some way it's right you want to tell Witcher 3 tell the whole truth he gave the whole story and then people can actually make you do good informed decisions based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make it in an informed decision based upon all of the parts come in because of that people are going to make some very poor choices in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's almost nobody I never said there's a God damn good people don't smoke marijuana I think this is a personal choice okay especially for Adam yeah okay and you can make bad personal choices you go by playboi carti love to play poker I'm sad that on this trip to La I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of log into flight show me the tears left and more dangerous for that device in your hand where you can bet on with the next pitch is going to be in Granby borsuk yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the Commerce and play there and 100% or 98% THC that an 18 year old babes is a lot more dangerous than a 5% you know CBD 15% THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses Once a Night to go to separate but that that's the message that we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be no include in the Bucking like your book you in some way since made me rethink the way that I write you all because my first book was co-opted with Jeremy Carson call Friendly Fire my second book them ready now it's called came it's for ptg so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that in nearly all know example of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in your life and some people have used to come to that stress and they've gone down the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage of me by actually become better because of it and CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you do when you're looking at someone like like a battering for example you're the Hallmark of someone with his PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I seen a my office a lot of time so we need no home like 5 to 10 days a month right so when you getting CBD and this is really important people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside the home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the Francis only got like so will those type of people that I see my Praxis DVD is really asking for that they only look at you know what do you thin nighttime component THC again its accent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug noblin again I don't really use now blowing very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in in the Entourage effect in using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she came to do tonight and you're if you have you have if you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD in again this is this comes from my commissions point of view they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like the parents of of of of kids with seizures all day nobody wants to see that you're enlightened like Alex you if your kids new ever started getting getting seizures which I hope I hope they don't because it's terrible in what what it can do but won't your weight when if that ever happens you know I would hope that you would consider your CBD as potential at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizure yeah one of my good friends his son has develop seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it till the timer is very recently cuz they get used to it you your tolerance develops builds up but we know what every year we do this thing called sober October we don't do any no drinking no no pod and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced I guess I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy s*** like I don't even know what I'm talking about mid-sentence and I'm just bullets Creed whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke night I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I'll give you a hint of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position what in the f*** is going on cuz the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you're dealing with a lot of daily users and for those people are my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him given this other comedian how many milligrams of stars of death I think I think there's a real argument to be made its particular with him is going to make two two points on that so definitely came develop a tolerance and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for 4 weeks generally all your sectors returned and will be like you've never use cannons before people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these two were you using I'm pretty sure it was like clothes like 7 joints a day without a really heavy users and Snoop Dogg's a good example that smokes all day and he just like he's always high and you know you're like what will you do when you're not always like what it does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easy-going guys no problem you can be high all day and live his life in his obviously wildly successful with this strategy pain that you some cheap C and sometimes you need a little bit more soon sometime to sleep you will be used to see into work and then I'll stop working with cvd to we haven't seen that meaning like the people who get get seizure control January they don't need to increase your dose like the girl I was talking about earlier described I think when she was 20 she was biting 2225 now she's never increase your dose now she's just use the same amount of CBD for The Last 5 Years I think we should really stop talking about CBD I just didn't want to make a note on the on the intolerance of the N1 I just want to make a note that CB2 doesn't appear to be tolerant so such a significant impact when it when it comes to especially edible THC state of mind and it's not always good that's just a fact I think we should really stop talking about CBD I just hadn't wanted to make a note on the on the intolerance of EM1 I just want to make a note that CB2 doesn't appear to be tolerant and it's not always good</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> alcohol reduces blood pressure okay alcohol in generally tends to reduce cardiovascular events for people and during prohibition you could actually get a doctor's note for alcohol as a medicine rain today and I think for the most part the medical profession has come down on the side saying let's not do that there's too many non-cardiac negative side effects with alcohol just don't let no throw Alex in Canada right now I know the safe alcohol drinking guidelines are 14 drinks a week for mange 9 drinks a week for women's night for women that's fine like that's a totally reasonable way to think about alcohol but we're not saying people is this is a medicine and I think that's where the confusion around really run high THC cannabis lies and and again I don't mean to say that your friend's child is not benefiting if you say he or she is benefiting I believe you what I'm saying is that that's not good enough for science we need randomized controlled trials and when those crops have been done and a lot of them haven't done a lot of them have been done they've almost unequivocally showing a cannabis doesn't work as a medicine the only actual place where Beyond these are very limited conditions like a chemotherapy Associated nausea which obviously is terrible for people have it but he's in isn't that common or gently to work as a pain reliever Wesley Dunnigan Placebo not against opioid or against NSAIDs like ibuprofen and there was a very big study for cannabis use in chronic pain over a multi-year. In Australia that came out last year that showed that people who use cannabis had a head more pain and use more opiates at the end of four years than people who didn't so that's what medicine is study though a lot of Applause in it and the other thing is that you need to look at someone who is already using cannabis versus someone who is just using opiates so if someone is just using opioids and they wanted to come off cannabis the others multi they don't have access to medical marijuana during that whole during the whole time report it and they were getting it from your recreational sources they weren't getting it from that's a big that's a big distinction though Alex like they weren't getting it from a doctor who prescribes it to them they were there with this is a self-reported study and people are getting cannabis that you know they didn't really know what they were getting it wasn't they weren't given any information from a doctor and that's why it's a medicine out because you can when you can tell the patient to take snow a certain amount of CBD every single day and when you take a certain out every single day it can reduce your symptoms and sometimes you increase that and sometimes you need to decrease that all medical marijuana psychoactive version of it and this is where it where you're saying it's negative you're not you're not really arguing titrating a patient he's monitoring them he's not writing them an authorization it's an come back in a year when it when it's up he's he's he's being a physician and you know and I think marijuana is medicine we want people like him so you admit it's medicine no no no it was really interesting to me and this came up in the book to sit your clinician you seasick people and it was one of my twin boys to doctor to choose a psychiatrist that's how my wife is a forensic psychiatrist less than the clinician these days her job is to evaluate people not so much to treat people your job is to treat people you seasick people you want to help them feel better and you don't want to tell them there's nothing I can do for you there's nothing there's no hope for your pain you want to help them and I totally get that but if you're an epidemiologist or researcher who's returning guide that you know that the views on the medical practice of hundreds of thousands of doctors that's not good enough so you need to step back and I think I think this epidemiologist in Britain who I talk to and Alex Young one thing that was mentioned in your book know is that we often you often say at the national academies of Science and Engineering right but Ziva Cooper and she's a member of that committee I mean she put out on honor Twitter mean you can go to it is from January 9th 2019 she says a response in the recent year times editorial on canvas and as a Committee Member but can't right but this is the summon you saying you said it to the report and she's a member I'll bet on that okay so she said a response to the recent you were times editorial on Candace's a Committee Member on Nason which is that committee and cannot move to Port we did not conclude that cannabis causes schizophrenia then the drug Alliance policy also said the report did not reach that conclusion so in both are pretty too authoritative fuel sources that they're saying that you're in your book you didn't like the research properly right and then also they're saying that you left locked out right they said that they have found an association between marijuana use and improved carted outcomes and individuals with psychotic disorders that straight from the same report and you failed to mention that right so I think that you will the writing box or it when we giving out information and you want to do it from a balanced approach adjust select with a small amount of a material that just going to support your study you know we want to be truthful Herrin Jose shows all done very truthful and Joe said right where the beginning he doesn't think that that that cannabis is perfect for everyone and I don't think that either end in Canada in a weird really strict guidelines to follow basically no one prescribes cheap seed anyone under the age of 25 and you're all the conferences and stuff that go to know we don't really have too many discussions about that like the doctors don't really have me much of a backlash about that so hot why is the distinction age of 25 for the decide that age so 25 basically is when your your brain fully developed and when you do look at the studies that do show human association between between cannabis and in psychosis it's almost all in adolescence and I think that Alex only has one study is any sport that shows an extremely weak correlation between an adult using cannabis and then developing any type of mental illness later so 25 is it's a it's a good age but it's definitely am kind of a conservative ish ish age but now it's it's something that that we fall and I think that we've done well with that in Canada Toronto by Committee of 16 researchers Ziva Cooper isn't the one who's publicly said the report said this but I think that we should have emphasized that it also said this okay what I what I wrote in that New York Times op-ed what I wrote In the book is the plain language of the report and plain language is this cannabis use is associated with the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses. how to use the greater the risk I may have a word or two wrong and I cuz I'm doing it from memory but that's what it said and by the way the committee was very clear they separated depression they said they're we don't see is nearly as high risk for depression and psychosis even though by the way today just today Jama Psychiatry the Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry put out a meta-analysis associated with depression and suicide thinking and actually suicide attempts at a three and a half to one right this is this literally was released today at 4 to go back to Ziva is one of 16 members of that committee so if you're going to talk up you're going to say that I miss quoted the report which I didn't I quoted entirely accurately you need to say well why aren't the other fifteen members of that committee saying that I miss quoted why is one person who works for the Cannabis research initiative at UCLA which takes money from Cannabis investors and users she's the one who said that quoted it maybe she maybe we should ask why the other members that committee are not speaking out against my book I think that she was just one of the 16 members that that came out but you know you can't really expect all the other members to potentially you will come out with that who do research actually you're not into social media at all like I don't think you were at all before you had your book work on that committee are going to social media it just happens to be on the phone about this and then she said that yeah you know I I don't that she agrees with everything that was in the report but she doesn't agree with your can go back to what are quoted from the report but you're only quoting but you're only quoting the part that I bet site a sore that back your your opinions you not quoting the entire park that you left like why did you leave out the part that they have found an association between marijuana use and prove carded outcomes and individuals with psychotic disorder right so you're leaving out that parcel watch a movie idea for somebody with an active psychotic disorder. This is a big issue that we have not heard about at all and the reason that we haven't heard about it have a lot to do with the advocacy community and the way they presented this data for 25 years I wrote a book that is trying to break through a lot of noise so but would still like to get a balanced approach did you decide that you were only going to see if you're only going to write about things that confirm your belief that you held when you were writing this and what you were trying to push in the title of the book and then in the conclusion of the I think it's a really great question in the introduction the book this book is not balanced there's not a lot of evidence in there about how indica and sativa strains are different than I didn't come at this and I say this in the introduction of the book 2 as an auntie cannabis Crusader interact with my wife said to me and she said to me over and over again in 20 Unit 14 and 15 and 16 of the cases that I'm seeing these are the terrible things that people are doing after cannabis use we're seeing a slice of the population that it's not representative why is it that I should believe this it sounds like Reefer Madness to me and you're ultimately my wife who's the one who went to ignore to actually she grew up in Newfoundland to she went to the Memorial University of Newfoundland medical school and she went to Harvard and Columbia for her postgraduate training tired of me because when I read the studies I could not believe the strength of the evidence Joe but you still even saying that you're still seeing positive result that you're you're excluding there's this one there's this one sentence but there are a few sentences about how it may be that cannabis helps people as positive it helps it help cognition in people with psychosis maybe maybe not no it wouldn't be approved as medicine if it's causing to have other psychotic episode of people have psychotic breaks and an improved cognitive function and people psychotic breaks so so it would not be something that you would prescribe it snowing and through some sort of clinical trials if it is improving your IQ two points I think we have not sure if it's looking to have to look at that I'm not sure what you guys out comes up and maybe you can help me out was that it's the exact same number that you find the general population so essentially 1% of the general population has schizophrenia which is one out of a hundred people and when you have marijuana users you see is essential that same number mirrored and so they're saying a small number and I'll throw in a small number of people with their saying essentially what I read was that marijuana use was associated with the onset of schizophrenia when they were disputing this in the study because they were saying because then same number is mirrored in the general population correlation does not equal causation right all right I think you got to tell him that's not true so tell me what that mean traditionally yes when we look at the Statue will see that you want the people who use camera source of the people who don't use cannabis have very similar rates but you're getting to be exact rate you know it's so any us they say that the range for schizophrenia is between 0.25 to 0.64% globally they say is 0.33 to 0.75% so you're right there it's currently lower in in the US and the USA's is has the highest percentage of cannabis consumption in the world and the US also has a lot of people that are using High potency THC so you know I think that you'll really need to be be careful about throwing up in the stocks like that because you're when you do look at the stuff that we had it shows that even though there's a lot of cannabis use in the United States schizophrenia rates have remained the same this is one of the great mess of legal is it okay no one knows what the schizophrenia or psychosis rate in the he's in the US different diagnosis at different times we have we have bad Health Care in this country and we have a lot of protections around mental health in fact in 2017 the National Institute of Mental Health suddenly changed its estimate for the percentage of people with schizophrenia in the US from 1.1% to 0.3 they did with no public notice and then this researcher said hey this is a miracle they just cure two million people with schizophrenia and the and then it was sponsored that the director of the NIMH said well we don't know how many people in the United States nobody knows nobody knows that the rate is increasing nobody knows if it's decreasing the only countries where they can count noses on this with any accuracy are Northern Europe because I have good Healthcare cuz I'm slightly you know less protections around their individual privacy and mint Health privacy and so they are able to count cases and in Denmark and Finland with her which of the two places where they actually done this research in the last 20 years they've shown increasing rates of schizophrenia between about 1995 in about 2010 and that goes side-by-side with increasing rates of cannabis use in the 90s so the people who are saying that there's no evidence of population when increases in psychosis are just wrong factors is a bunch of other different thing we actually don't have the evidence at this point to say that cannabis use in the u.s. is causing a population level increase in psychosis and schizophrenia which are oh by the way those are two different illnesses and we can we can talk about that too so we don't have the evidence to say there's a definite increase but what I'm saying is that what you have been told that there is no increase in schizophrenia or psychosis rates in the US that's we do know if that's true or not we just do me ask you this there has been proven that there's an increase in marijuana use is that correct yes when did the increase begin and how what how what percentage is increasing so there was there was an increase in the 90s and increase in use and a potency user to bottomed out around 1991 and then there was her the corresponding increase in schizophrenia if there was any sort of correlation hold on let me just let me walk you through 2000-2006 in the last 3-4 years and that potency in the last 15 years in those other countries that schizophrenia and psychosis has gone up and there's for the first time in 2017 there's data showing that serious mental illness which is not the same as psychosis or schizophrenia in the u.s. double between 2008 and 2017 in the end the people aged 18 to 25 and knows the people who are most likely to be using it for the first time there's actually evidence of what you're talking about we just a population-wide increase I'm not going to get you to clarify it shows a serious mental help with those there's a study, National survey on drug use and how it's done every year and people federal government funds through the best data source we have on all this stuff it showed that and they're not counting cases either no did you have depression so bad that you couldn't get out of bed did you in a were you hospitalized this year for Psychotherapy for any inpatient psychiatric reason and and if you look at those numbers in 2008 3.7% and 3.8% of Americans 18 to 25 reported at least one symptom so they were categorized as having serious mental illness that year in 2000 17 that number was 7.5% so that's a double so again I am not going to say that proves that the increase in cannabis use has caused this this population level but something bad has happened and if you look at kids 12 to 17 interesting ly they over that time for you didn't have a big increase in cannabis use in general teenagers actually or pretty healthy now although Jewel and vaping maybe on doing that and those kids have a population level increase in serious mental illness can stop you for a second there because there's other factors in one of the big one is Yuval Noah Harari has a great book 21 lessons for the 21st instead of social media are Jonathan hate talked about that as well and that the onset of social media is actually more hate and then karate but the Jonathan hate talks about it with young people the media and the persons are social media have led an incredible amount of young people to serious mental distress and you know serious anxiety serious depression and suicide amongst young girls has increased some 50% according to hate over the. Of 2007 to I think mm and whenever his book was written and I think they're directly correlating that to the pressures of social media and to you know anonymous online bullying and all these different fact protecting kids yet so I think that that could be considered of a far more significant new form of distress to children and young people then even marijuana are they it does it to fold cuz I think that you know what makes people really depressed maybe more so than ages but definitely both is that when you compare yourself to someone else and no people obviously that we've done that you're all all humans have done that but now everything is online you can compare your life to everyone and if people are doing all the time and even worse than that in your we should talk about this too is that the income gap is getting its getting water so it's like peoples live not only are they getting you better than other people's lies but it's what it now it's on it's on display so everyone can see it where is before you'll maybe you what you into seeing it because it wasn't on social media but now it's on social media she had this huge income gap getting bigger and bigger and bigger and then you have people going on social media and we're comparing themselves and you're absolutely right especially in that in that age population people on your under the age of 30 you know what they're definitely know what they're being bullied online like I see everyday in my office like literally everyday people are being bullied online and that's yo some of that I never had you want to deal with a growing up here and you a lot of kids do have to have to deal with that just one more Note 2 on since Colorado has has has legalized cannabis this important for for this this the subject was topic they've actually seen marijuana weights decrease so it's important for people to know that so in Colorado we have seen a decrease in gas because of the lack of either because it's not illegal it's not as exciting to them part of it for sure you know and I mean part of it is like a one-way I had you haven't looked into the estatisticas yet cuz you know when when you're going up in when you're in high school you know if you want to be part of the cool crowd go to say what you usually drink or you smoke pot you know that's what the people do I hope that that doesn't change because pot seen as medicine I hope that you know people don't don't move on to do something you'll Harsha because they don't see pot as at school anymore 12217 those kids are healthier than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago they drink less they smoke less they have sex later if you abortion they are healthier okay and their mental health doesn't seem to have changed that much based on the nsduh data the data shows a big change in kids 18 to 25 they go to college if something goes wrong for a lot of those kids at least in the last few years now but we suicide rate especially with young girls who are apparently more affected by social media they have gone up significantly since the rise of social media that Izzy big fat people almost more so than counting these young girls are committing suicide. To fit your statistics or to fit your conclusions know what I'm saying is that's a tiny tiny number because it's a 50% increase is not a tiny amount on the podcast if you discussed it with the increasing use of social media sure but I'm pushing back against is the idea that kids 12 to 17 generally are less healthy than they were 10 or 20 years ago or less healthy you just said there more help ever going to ask charging hates work is like very well-respected what what I'm saying to you is that there's a clear increase in psychological distress in kids and young adult 18 to 25 okay there's a clear increase and those are the people who are most likely be using cannabis enough said in the beginning the program that I think the marijuana with some people is not beneficial in fact could be negative but I don't understand why you're not willing to admit that social media has a significant and unprecedented impact on young people that we've never seen by War I would totally agree with that but I don't think that you can say based on the population level dated that the impact is all negative it maybe let me hear it let me give me example when you were fifteen or I was fifteen maybe you got really drunk right and wound up in a bathtub like maybe kids today or less likely to do that because of social media because they know it's going to be on Instagram forever I don't think that's a true I don't think that's proven and I don't think there's anything that would point to that what I can tell you is proven is that kids today teens 12 and 17 have less psychological distress by all these measures either actual behaviors are better or a better or worse at the moral judgment but they're healthier than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago they're less likely to have sex there less when they're 14 which I think they're less likely to be drinking less and less suicide very difficult things to measure right 1019 75 and it's a little bit over four in 2015 that's not that's one case per 100,000 girls yeah I don't know what that I don't know what the actual facts are I'm looking at this right now and suicide rates for teens 15 to 19 years. Is this something we have to study to have this discussion making people the suicide crisis is it is unfortunate crisis of age I would agree with that I think will we we actually talked about that yesterday with Andrew Yang but suicide amongst men in their 50s and then they start to feel useless yeah especially if they lose their jobs but what Jonathan hate is pointing to is a direct correlation between social media use depression suicide amongst young girls thank you for finding what is it it's been in 40 years is social media to blame released Thursday by the atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide rates among 15 to 19 year old girl double between 2007 and 2015 reaching a 40-year high I would say that's significant working girls in 2015 5 committed suicide that's not a very high number but I mean that's also someone was pushed to the extreme taking their life how many girls are experiencing severe depression but don't commit suicide that's the real Factor because this is what hate directly connect to social media again the 50% increase your talking about a relatively small number because not as many girls commit suicide as men but still this could you're talking about you were talking about the Press and you were talked about the significant factors that would lead people to have poor mental health this could be a huge factor in this right and I think that to it leads people to know suicidal ideations and depression and anxiety right here were just looking at the worst and Porter possible that is very rare months girls. stop because you know again suicide is is the aim that is the worst thing that could possibly happen so what about you know all the all the things leading up to it your other people who are you don't commit suicide but if suffer from terrible depression suffer from terrible anxiety suffer from terrible insomnia and those people are not accounted for in that grass teams notwithstanding we've seen a large degradation in the number of the social outcomes and now just today we have a Jama Psychiatry paper that looked at a bunch of other studies that said cannabis use in teenagers is associated with depression suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in people once they get to 18230 okay under using cannabis friends died from opioid overdose is a lot of potential we are conceding the fact that you know you just said again that study was done on adolescent no Joe and I have both concede it multiple times that you do we do not think high THC cannabis is good for people in that age category but you know just a just a backup just a little bit of game you know I don't like I said earlier that you I don't prescribe GC Jenna to anyone 25 most of the doctors and can we don't I think that we should be prescribing CBD to these kids like a lot of those kids you know who have suicidal ideations depression and you know you could never do a study on it but how many of those kids wouldn't have committed suicide or wouldn't be feeling this way if they were using CBD because we know SSRI selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors which are the most commonly prescribed medication for depression anxiety even in in in adolescence they can increase suicidal ideation that's been shown I mean it's written right on right on the package so again like as the clinician you have to your treat your patients if you're just treating people with something that's not effective other there that has the horrible side effects you're going to look at other alternative treatments a lot of people have have shown are so have had accent results with CBD in that age category you know I've had had it I've done in my practice and lots of other positions to have done end in their practice so it's really important that when were talking about teenagers when you're talking about that study your talk about high potency THC in adolescence that's where your Joe and I both can see that your THC is is not a good medicine or some other cannabinoids and non-intoxicating cannabinoid and depression and get it approved for that that be great we need we need all the treatments for depression and for boy do we need treatment for psychosis that we can get I totally agree with it and I'm really glad to hear you say you don't think that adolescents should be using High potency or anyone</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> 215 ladies gentlemen or gentleman 32 ladies gentlemen listening but YouTube unless you have some non-binary handle that you enjoy it's a new world please introduce yourself in st. John's Newfoundland now I'm residing in London Ontario and I'm a family doctor and years and use her Alex Berenson I used to be a New York Times Reporter then I became a spy novelist and most recently I wrote the book tell your children the truth about marijuana mental illness and violence which came out last month and has not endeared me to the Cannabis advocacy Community I'd say have they attacked you mercilessly for this book encapsulates there their families problems in the last couple years I suspect my my real thoughts here before we even get started that we're going to find that the truth is somewhere in the middle here I don't think marijuana is a hundred percent safe honestly for everybody I really don't I know too many people that have had experiences where they took too much for tickly Edibles and I don't I want to say I know anybody psychotic breaks but I know some people that freaked out for weeks you know in fact we just had a comedian here from Brazil a couple days ago Rafi bastos who said he took a couple hits of a vape pen with high for 14 days went to a psychiatrist and and he's a big guys like 6ft 566 you know and you know they told him to keep taking it cuz it you know he's like you're so big just keep smoking and so he doesn't smoke she just kept hitting his vape pen I was high for f****** two weeks you need to do it properly write you need to be held to the same standard as any other medicines I need to identify that there's risks and there's benefits to it and some people are definitely you know going to be more susceptible to those risks we need to know what he's out those people and make sure that those people don't put themselves at risk I do believe I believe absolutely there are great benefits to it I think there's great benefits in terms of relieving pressure ocular pressure for people that have glaucoma people with AIDS were medication people with cancer they're going through chemotherapy find great benefit in terms of helping them and then is also some people with Autism I know people that their children of autism in they give them small amounts of edible marijuana and stop seizures it's incredibly benefits in the form of CBD for a lot of different ailments but I think with all things and this is a stance that I've kind of like really come to accept over the last few years with all things that affect the mind they affect everyone slightly differently absolutely yeah if you want to say something you had me on heart you're having me on because you know a bill more he won't have me on he's afraid to talk to me about this why would he said he had an interview scheduled with me an hour-long segment and they canceled it they said we don't believe in the conclusion to the book have me on and that's why I'm so happy that you're not afraid to have me on that we can have a conversation that we can have a conversation come at me with any questions you want about the science I'll stay right after I don't think marijuana is medicine it has a few medical uses that have been your CBD has been shown to reduce seizures in kids that's great THC has been shown to reduce the nausea associated with chemotherapy Brandeis but for the most part people use THC in cannabis is recreational intoxicants they using to get high the same way they use alcohol same way they use other drugs and the sooner we we accept that reality the better off we'll all be that this is a drug and it has risks and benefits and the risks and benefits are different than alcohol they're different than other drugs but I don't think if you look Savannah population level bases there less than alcohol I don't think you can even say that I don't I really strongly disagree with that and I mean you just have to look at the death rate right more people die from alcohol than you know almost all drugs combined but when we're looking at cannabis there is zero deaths attributed to of the use of cannabis itself sure you could say you know someone could use cannabis and jump off a cliff or something like that but we're talking about the lethal dose you cannot die from Cannabis and just based upon the bat alone it makes it much much safer than alcohol good question the normal number that use for us deaths from alcohol about 90,000 now about 30 to 40,000 of those deaths or deaths from the physical effects of alcohol right essentially liver damage either chronic liver damage you get cirrhosis you died in some cases you can drink so much that you kill yourself in a night so that's about 30 to 40,000 desk the other deaths are generally associated with alcohol meaning somebody drinks exactly and all those numbers are basically based on studies from the 90s and before where you know people looked at traffic accidents and there were certain number of those accidents were people had a blood alcohol content of higher than 0.1 that's an alcohol Associated death that's a fine way to count as far as I'm concerned nobody has ever done that count for cannabis and I can tell you based on the on the tox screens that I've seen from Colorado or people had cannabis in their blood and committed side view my cannabis in their art I should take THC and their blood and and got it to the Fatal confrontation with police officers if if if and when we do this number for cannabis which we need to do as soon as possible the numbers could be a lot higher than zero I suspect it will be in the 10 to 20,000 we won't know till we actually do alcohol let's eliminate all things like violence and what's eliminate suicide let's assume those people have committed violence and commit suicide without you're still looking at a giant number of people who drink themselves to death and thousands and thousands of people every year versus zero with marijuana and you are aware I'm sure that correlation does not equal causation and that especially in a place like Colorado will you dealing with cannabis something that stays in the system for many many weeks if you're testing people and they test positive for marijuana and they wind up committing suicide or they wind up committing violence they don't even necessarily have to have been under influence of it is you know there's when you test the blood you can test the book the active metabolite and the inactive metabolite THC so so the test when you do a blood test on somebody who's sophisticated enough to tease that out so there's a lot of people who have the active metabolite in their blood alcohol was also just morbidity associated with alcohol I mean ruins people's lives at ruins marriages that leads to weight gain at least to a lot of metabolic is perfect for some people with marijuana to I think you could say some people especially weight gain and some people smoke a lot of pot and they get lazy and start eating Cheetos all day and and you can also say that with some people you know the waking bakers that you know seem to be wasting their lives away and that's like the stereotypical negative you can absolutely said that could ruin relationships you can absolutely said that would ruin your job you could but again to know we're using the term marijuana and really we should be using THC or high THC when we were saying that because you know people who use a high-cbd everyday as we know our most will listen this place CBD is non-psychoactive cannot get you high be careful using canvas versus using your THC if you guys needed the THC that can do the interior haploid you know it but do you say that you so you can cause the munchies and of course that's your not good for someone who doesn't want to gain weight and just you know so people know the way that it does do that it's when she attached to the CB1 receptor an increase in hormone called growling and growling can actually induce hunger and that's why people get get the munchies what is not a bad thing if you're someone who has cancer or if you're someone you know who's wasting away from from from a terrible illness you have to sometimes you don't having having the munchies is is definitely a good thing and I know you do a lot of people have said to me oh it's not available to should probably not talk about as much but there is another cannabinoid call thcv so you know there's there's over hunter cannabinoids in cannabis THC in CBD only two of them those are the main ones about so cheap CB has been shown to actually reduce appetite so if we can get that out there in the market you'll let me have with with CBD then we can almost feel eliminate or potentially in substantially reduce the problems people have with with that with THC by using it with the thcv so it's like if they didn't need to go to him to get in toxic so people so you're seeing a population that is genuinely interested in the health benefits hopsolutely because it mean if an amino I'm glad that that has legalized in Canada because it does make my job a little easier because the exact basically everyone who's coming to me now I know that they want to use it medically because if they want you to recreationally I mean they just go to the store right kind of a pain to get in to see me come in and have the discussion all that type of stuff so you other people see me now you're the real using it medically and then you don't have to answer your question though Alex almost all my patients as soon as they come in to say I don't want to get high I don't want to get high like that's almost what everyone says so you know I think the word is out there that you'll CBD is non-psychoactive it doesn't get you high and I think that a lot of people are really interested in that compound and you know if if if the people didn't have it at the success they've had over the past few years it wouldn't be as is it is so you'll I think that when we do need to look at the scientific evidence but we do need to listen to others in The Anatole Evans is it was something that fight with that we should consider because it is so strong Alex let me ask you this why don't you consider it medicine when it has proven medical benefits food as medicine have really essentially deceived voters about the process right so you go to a you go to a pot doctor you get an authorization that authorization essentially enables you to buy as much cannabis as you want for the next year most of the time and reality these doctors are not giving you a real medical examination they're saying to you hate you have pain and you have anxiety here's your authorization I don't think you should speak for every single doctor at my clinic know that Yolanda clinics in Canada anyway we definitely do not do that and provide a lot of education at my clinic in his other clinics in Canada also provide large occasionally in the US this was supposed to advocate for the book my doctor said what he pot I said I get headaches said when you get headaches I said whenever I think about the fact that pots illegal in Sunnyvale going to prescription why you saying don't pretend because there's many medicine today riffic side effects from the medicine THC in regards to Children's autism is pretty significant and well-documented epilepsy autism those are two huge things that happen with children that they've been shown to severely mitigate with with edible marijuana so I have to push back on your little bit CBD has been shown to reduce seizures in children with epilepsy maybe anecdotal but I have a good friend who has a child who he uses it on and he's show it's an evening it's been a game-changer like I had a patient for 5 years ago and she was 20 years old she couldn't drive a car because she had seizures right so you can imagine being 20 years old not being able to drive a car all your friends are driving around so she uses a little bit of CBD not even every day she's never had seizure safe driver car and the way you know whether medicine works on a chemical compound the best way to know is you give it to two groups of are you give you give the listen to one group of people and you give a placebo to the other group and you see the changes in those two groups over time and you find out whether or not your theory about whether this works on a population level basis is real or not that's how that is at the core of Medical Science and we basically thrown that rule out for THC well that's not entirely correct you do know that there is were studies that were run during the Nixon Administration that showed the efficacy of marijuana in the safety of it and those were all squash and you also I'm sure your we're talking about marijuana you talk about something is federally illegal it's not something that's easy to run these FDA studies on I think we should drop that I think anybody's got a legitimate interest in researching heater TCR cameras or any other compounds for up for a medical condition let them run Phase 1 phase to phase 3 trials let's see if this if this if this plant is it is find benefit in it so you think they're getting it from just to CBD the minimum amount of CBD and in marijuana do I think again there's been a lot of research done on THC and cannabis at to see whether or not those weather THC is a compound in weather smoke cannabis can treat these conditions and for the most part the studies have been negative again there's negative okay what what what were the conclusions the studies when you're saying that they're not positive that they again that they didn't work that the drug didn't work on what on cancer on Alzheimer's disease on irritable bowel syndrome on a few different things out there and I appreciate the fact that we can't be going around you or saying things like you know cannabis cures cancer right but you know I know and I've done videos missing like recently but if you look at the research I mean it specifically if you look at specific answers there are Studies have shown that cheap C and CBD can help the gate Escape were talking about breast cancer I did a video on this recently you know if you are her2 positive and use cheats in CBD it came in fact reduce tumor size and it can reduce to a growth now if you have one of them talk tonight and what does that mean who's this different types of breast cancer and that's just one subset of up breast cancer so there are other breast cancers which do not express cannabinoid receptors in your I've seen one study at least again it's only one study that show that when they gave Tri-C and bat animal now and actually cause a proliferation of up to her so it works them so I do agree with you out in the fact that you may have to be careful about using terms like that but that just doesn't mean that we can't say that cannabis is no good for cancer at all even in the National academies of Science and Engineering report what they said that was great for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting right so you know it's definitely a really good medicine for him a lot of different things and we were talking about cheatcc I said earlier question we need to be careful about out THC but it definitely is still a medicine and you know what your point with regards to its and not being a medicine safe for something like PTSD home from it from commissions point of view so I'm not a researcher so I need to make sure that my patients are getting better it's very frustrating for me just to say to someone or there's nothing I can do for you there's nothing I can do for it you know it's so and I understand that you're doing something sometimes it's not going to be beneficial just because you doing something you have to do something that actually works but you don't we do have epidemiological studies and we have other studies of the shown that you're impatient forgiving icanvas the can reduce the symptoms of PTSD is also another study and I don't use this drug too often called can a bloating nablo is just pure THC noblin was shown to reduce nightmares in people who have PTSD so it's just saying just suggest because it doesn't mean that not a medicine and just to keep on the topic of of PTSD in addition to that we've identified mechanisms of action I know I don't know study I think Matt Hill was on the West Was Won the office that study and he noticed that hit people with PTSD there is nowhere 50% decrease in and levels of annoying am I so and then you can get that through through exercise which is one excellent way to do it and you don't and that's part of the the high that you bet you can't wait after you exercise but the other way you can get it is by using so when you can cheat she attaches those tubular seppi's and get a release of an animite and cannabidiol can actually increase in NY by another mechanism of action as well do it through this different ways we can raise the level of of deficiency so it to me as a clinician you if I have someone who is not doing very well you know they've been under a bunch of different medications I've identified that you would have PTSD we have mechanism of action we have studies and then again to your don't discount my clinical experience right I've been working for over 5 years in without with just with just with cannabis I mean I do other medicines prescribed other medicines as well but I've been doing cannabis medicine for over 5 years and you know there's a lot that that I've learned right so as much as I've learned you know through Reading studies and if they're going to conferences and things like that you know for sure that the best resource as a clinician is run from your patience and and hear what your patients tell me and you are the things that my patients tell me is that THC is really effective for the sleep at night and a lot of my patients especially my bed and patients had done really really well with with that and just just one for the point to you know if there was I know it was 2015 I believe it was Thursday and that announce done I can pull it up if we need to that indicated that will allow them medicines that are being used now for PTSD or just simply in affected I think she was that was never been in medicine made specifically for PTSD so all the medicines that people are using her for anxiety or their for depression or the for insomnia to present present for something else you know but when you look at I like like a study that says people with PTSD have a lower level of an annualized and if you can increase that a level of an animite you know that's a good way to treat someone it doesn't matter whether to bitamin whether to or motive long as you are correcting a day a deficiency you Jerry going to get so all the medicines that people are using her for anxiety or there for depression or the for insomnia to present present for something else you know but when we look at I like a study that says people with PTSD have a lower level of an annualized and if you can increase that a level of an animite you know that's a good way to treat someone it doesn't matter whether it's a vitamin weather to hormone a few long as you are correcting a day a deficiency you Jerry going to get excellent clinical results</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> to this presidential candidates kind of warning people about the upcoming technological apocalypse as it were how did you make that transition and what was your motivation to get involved in this the point we actually running for president on this platform so so sell the company in 2009 and that was a financial crisis like want you to crash the economy and I had personally taught these kids would worked at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in and Mackenzie and I was like smart kids to do something other than just head to Wall Street Silicon Valley we need to have them go to Detroit St Louis Baltimore and won't start businesses so I quit my job I donated low six-figures to start start the new organization and then we trained hundreds of entrepreneurs and helped create several thousand jobs so that was like my wholesome give back I was like hey I'm like you know the guy who just believe because just like you I freaking love entrepreneurs and I was like unhappy lawyer for 5 months and so what would I tell people's I give you a clueless ambitious twenty-two-year-old who came out of college and you said your parents having to go to law school they're going to say that's great it's really easy to find the law school cuz it's there just apply to it and the government will give you $100,000 loan no questions asked and then if you say to your parents and want to be an entrepreneur your parents will think that's stupid it's hard to find and don't give you a hug so we have this cute oversupply of indebted law school graduates and a huge undersupply of our Spinners was my thinking and so I was like okay how do you fix that so I started this organization Venture for America to try and fix that and so imagine being this guy getting medals and awards for helping create jobs around the country and then realizing that automations coming like a tidal wave and that your efforts that you're getting applauded for a really not going to do the trick and the Donald Trump win the election 2016 and for whatever reason in my opinion the media is not being honest about all the economic drivers they're blaming racism Russia Facebook the FBI and if you look at the voter District date on a district-by-district basis there's a straight line up between the adoption of industrial robots in that voting district and the movement towards Trump like the it's a straight economic story where we blasted away for a million manufacturing jobs in the swing States Donald Trump is our president so imagine being me and then seeing that and being like okay I get it this is an economic technological story and then I went to people in Washington DC I was like hey guys what do you do when the third inning of the greatest economic and technological transformation in the history of our country and 1/3 any has brought us Donald Trump the 4th 5th 6th and they're going to be horrific what are we going to do and it answers I got were somewhere between winning in horrifying wherever you go to mainstream politicians going like what are we going to do the answers I got were literally number one we cannot talk about that number to we should study that we cannot talk about that was that's probative really yeah and why were they saying that because it seems alarmists like anti-progress or like you know that you're like you know throwing stones at it like like big tech companies number one is the number one was can't talk about it number two is need to study it and the number three was the point you made it originally which was we must educate and retrain Americans for the jobs of the future and then when I was like Hey we're terrible at that by the Numbers then they'd Lily be like well I guess we'll learn to get better at it then and then so I came back to to my home in New York City and I was like oh my gosh like we are so backward and far gone as I as it certainly has a government and so then I was grappling and I'm a parent like you are and I looked at my kids and I was like am I really going to bring them up in this s*** show like how would you actually solve this problem if you if you had to do so and so then I said okay Universal basic income rebranded the freedom dividend after we did a bunch of tests that test much better as the freedom dividend than Universal basic income and and then try and make the rules the economy work better for more people fast as we can before this automation wave really Crescendo what do you mean by that will to me let you know what I'm saying is like retail and truck driving are the two major major obvious sectors that are going to get displaced being a retail worker is the most common job in the United States right now so that the average retail workers a 39 year-old woman with a high school education making between 11 and $12 an hour so what do those workers do in 30% of the malls and stores close in the next 5 years and now and then Tucker the next in line by the five to 10-year Mark feels like we have to get our act together before these populations end up getting displaced and we know American don't have a ton of savings to fall back on it's not like they'll be like oh like you know let me take a month off till I think of Americans live in 2017 where I'm like doing the data research and saying like Okay like what plan and then when I went to various politicians I was like there is no appetite for making this case there's no appetite for anyone even talking about this so the only thing I can see that would have a realistic chance of accelerating meaningful solutions to this automation waving at 5 to 10 your time frame is if I run for president and I either win which is very doable I can win or I mainstream this set of considerations to a point where other politicians are will talking about this so the only thing I can see that would have a realistic chance of accelerating meaningful solutions to this automation waving at 5 to 10 your time frame is if I run for president and I either win which is very doable I can win or I mainstream this set of considerations to a point where other politicians are willing to tackle something like Universal basic income and make it a reality in that time</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> probably need about 40 to 50 Thousand Islands to get on board so you say hey do do I think I can be present United States the threshold question is this can I get 40 to 50 Thousand Islands on board with the idea that them and their family members getting $1,000 a month is a good idea. That would actually help improve their lives I'm sure it would help improve their lives and I'm sure they would agree with you the question is one of the other thing receipt I don't think most people are aware that this is coming and I think do educating people and explaining all the statistics and seen the forecast for tickly from your position as a serial entrepreneur who has a deep background in business and you have a deep understanding of this you're helping in a tremendous Way by educating people but I think most people have maybe a logically but they have different concerns so how do you address these other concerns like I bet if you pulled people what are the issues what are the issues in this upcoming 2020 presidential race that you know who's going to beat Donald Trump how do you do it this is like on the Democratic side the ideas I get anyone but Trump right yeah this is me they would be so happy if fill-in-the-blank Tulsi gabbard you whoever on the Republican side obviously Trump unless someone comes along or goes to jail but if those are the two possibilities one of the other issues and that you feel that people are really concerned about that you can provide shed some unique light on sure so that the three big policies I'm running on R1 the freedom dividend cuz a lot of Americans are seeing their paychecks not keep up with their expenses number two is we need to get Healthcare off the backs of businesses and families and move towards a single-payer system medicare-for-all because as an entrepreneur it makes it harder to hire people when you do hire people you want to make them contractors not full-time employees makes it harder for people to start businesses cuz concerned about keeping their health care for their families so we got to get Healthcare off the backs of businesses and families in and trying to make the economy more Dynamic and we spent twice as much on Healthcare in other countries do to worst results like it's right now we're in like the worst of all worlds and the third thing is and I reference my wife and I talked about this though my wife is at home with our two boys 6 and 3 one of them is Autistic and when I say is like what is her work valued at in GDP and then people think about and I like I do 0 GDP like doesn't consider that actual economic contribution and then I say we have to do is we have to actually evolved from GDP as a measuring stick because it actually doesn't work for us it's almost a hundred years old we made it up during the Great Depression self-driving trucks are going to drive GDP way up but it's going to be very very bad for many people and communities so we have to actually change the measuring sticks to something that would actually make our economy work for us make make it so that instead of always being input to the market because of where Olympics the market we lose robots and AI man down and it's not like it doesn't matter if you were like a really conscientious hard-working truck driver or like a really lazy floppy what does it matter if you were like a really diligent radiologist or like a doesn't matter so we have to shift the market emphasis actually few will our well-being and change from GDP which is against archaic measurement we made up to two things that would actually respond to how we're doing things like Health childhood success rates environmental in the way that would be translatable to the average voter and again if you look at our numbers right now you'd see it's like what like how many people live in Fresno that America's life expectancy has declined the last three years you know what that to me would be like a pretty important measurement of a suicide because of drug overdose is it because of obesity diet what is it that the two causes that people point to the most are that drug overdoses and suicides have overtaken vehicular deaths as as the most frequent deaths in the United States I didn't know that suicide was on Atlas I knew that drug overdose but I'm not sure about it I'm sorry I meant carsense used to be number one suicides are higher than car accidents now so suicides drug overdoses and then car accidents or suicides and Drug overdoses like drug overdose number one number one and then suicides number to Wow and so that's why life expectancy has declined for the one you think that the sewage very much likely there's at least some of the number of the suicides are related to asperity oh yeah I mean if you look at the suicide rate in it's particularly pronounced in 52 fifty-year-old 52-54 year old white Americans which are the population of a new resemble that that's me which resemble the population that right now is just reaching a point where they like hey my job skills don't have any like utility the marketplace and then they go home and they just like you know like what am I doing primitive is punishing and and we put our citizens in the situation where we all see ourselves as economic inputs what the market says we're worth is what we're worth and if we're worth less then it's our fault and so the next move is to say okay I guess you know this place there's no place for me here I don't mean to sound skeptical but I just don't believe that $1,000 a month is going to fix that it seems like that would be a good thing certainly not moving in the wrong direction certainly moving in the right direction but it seems that there needs to be some sort of a massive rethinking of civilization itself if you're going to have that many things are going to be automated and that many people are going to be out of jobs and feeling that the world that they prepared for no longer exist yes it seems like we need a step further another move 100% brother and that's one reason why the freedom dividend not like a light doesn't solve the problem the problem is fundamentally one of reconstituting means of structure purpose and fulfillment in people's lives particularly in men's lives right how do we do that right so one important aspect of that is to actually start measuring how we are doing as a society and saying that's actually where we're trying to go so instead of using GDP using some sort of other quantifiable method of mesh health and happiness and fulfillment yes levels of Engagement with work mental health I mean you can we have measurements for that we are sophisticated enough to do that and then if we say that has present I'm going to be up there in 2021 being like over here is the state of the union here like the data and then when you say you don't want to try and do not try and move those measurements in the right direction so let's try and get drug overdoses down by 50% in two years let's try and get her Mental Health little bit like an Indies ways and then make it so that that person who's at home being like okay like you know I like there's not a job for me I'm getting a thousand bucks a month that does not solve all my problems it takes the edge off but then we can hopefully start reconstituting what that person's purposes in their community in their neighborhood and so one of the things that I'm going to point out is that if you pump a thousand bucks a month into that neighborhood it is a creating a whole new run with opportunities for the people in that Community like some of that money goes to you know like you fleas and churches and nonprofits Increase jobs right there in that Community one of the examples I use is like if you're in a town in Missouri with 50,000 people and let's say you really like to bake but starting a bakery that dumb idea because people just do not have money in that town to buy your baked goods but then I pump 16 million where is a year into that economy and a lot of that just circulates right there in that town then if I start a bakery it's a good idea and I know if my bakery fails I'm not going to die I can least go home and get my dividend and then if I go to other people and say hey you want to like help me out with this than they also think is a better idea than they would have so the money is not the solution the money helped set the stage for the solutions so does the measurements so does if you cuz right now it's like you don't eat show that your life expectancy is declining that's kind of hard to solve that problem so if you say look this is actually how we measure how we're doing and then you go in and say okay like local government and Geo entrepreneur cuz right now I'm working on trying to make that dude life better realistic but it did at least we can start moving ourselves in that general direction if we start cuz as of a CEO you know that you make what you measure measuring at you have no chance if you start measuring it you at least start to open up the chance but what you're saying is the most profound which is like we need to reconstitute meaning for many many Americans and that's what to me the most destructive aspect of the show again like that. authenticators in like the suicides in the rest of it is like there's a real loss of meaning for many many people here in this country on a large-scale but if you go back to the time before trucks and truck drivers that was not a viable occupation and wasn't something people did but yet they still found a way to occupy their time do you think that there needs to be some sort of an education and some some sort of a method of explaining to young people and protect that you have to think of something to do because most of the things you think you can do won't exist so we have to think of what are the other possibilities and be creative and do something with your life that only a human being can do which is a really weird way to think about it because most of the things you used to be able to think that a human being could do for a living are now going to be done by robots but I don't think that I think there's a 2 things you used to be able to think that a human being could do for a living are now going to be done by robots but I don't think that I think there's a giant gap between the understanding that you have and you're saying that the average person has and this could be a real problem and trying to expand this platform but we have to inform you that when I say this to people there like that makes perfect perfect</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when did the average person has in this could be a real problem and trying to expand this platform but we have informed I gotta tell you that when I say this to people there like that makes perfect yeah it does make perfect with you in any way shape or form for young kids for young kids education system has a lot to be desired and one of the things I'm saying is like is it's making all these kids think that college is the end-all-be-all and it is not and so that's one issue is that we need to try and prepare kids for different kinds of pads instead of saying College College college yeah because they're going to college there getting loaded up with record levels a debt, just got in two and a half times more expensive even though it has not gone two and a half times better and the reason why it's so expensive is because they just like gotten really bloated administratively and what would you do like you know Bernie Sanders wants to have some sort of a free college free University wants to do it across the board of education to be a hundred percent free I love that on paper I want two things that I hate is talking to my friends about college debt without friends that are in their 30s and 40s those around them around yeah I just it just stays with him like a wet blanket that you can never get out of I used to call my school loans my Miss cuz I was writing a check to like another family another town I was like I hope they're enjoying themselves like $900 a month to my loans and if something devastating happens to you in any other form you can file for bankruptcy but you never Escape your student loans no matter what happens to you that was just a lobbying on the part of the the financial Catholicism and Islam to hurry up out of it that is dirty that's really dirty when you think about how many people that run corporations that have racked up I mean just think about what happened with the Savings and Loan crisis completely man and those guys skated the vast majority have their carrying around zero zero burden from that vast majority know what the jail have a few people or in a really anybody but that's about it they did this and got away with it in and profited in redistributed all this money into their own personal accountant and out butthole sideways but heaven forbid you take out a bunch of school loans and then things go south I just can't get out of it I mean I know a guy who's in his 50s who's an ophthalmologist who's deeply in debt still so amazing starting businesses starting families buying homes it hurts it possible to fix for sure so that the first thing you do is you go to the people that are currently in debt and say look we're going to give you a pass out and their ways to do it you know you can have a payment plan with nothing cuz I'm proposing is like a ten-by-ten where if you commit 10% of your wages for 10 years and you did free and that means like if you're not making a lot of money and then you can save a whole lot and the schools at this point have long since forgotten about this because they got paid off already just these Financial companies that are sold in the loans that was important for people to understand because people think will love you don't pay them the college is going to go away and now now so if you are the government you can be like a loan at loan company guess what likes good news rental like take this out and stimulus cuz like you said we've done a lot of things that were supposed to be a stimulus like give for trillion dollars the bank's be like metal stimulate the economy nothing's going to stimulate the economy better than getting student loans off the back of the freaking young people you know actually do what they're supposed to do which is actually if you know what money economy big chance to take chances are businesses in the rest of it mean one of the reasons why our business formation rates are at multi-decade Lowe's that we are up to 1.5 trillion dollars in school debt like 38k ahead that was like a hundred billion in my 1999 f-15x since then and it's crippling us is like saying anyone who thinks that that's not burning the economy I mean people we're going to forgive some of the student loan debt does have that stuff was generated in Morley anyway a lot of those two schools you know lying about the second thing you do is you go to the schools and say hey guys quality change and the reason is that big pile of administrative faculty it is not going to facilities it has gone to just administrative access and then say okay you can do whatever you want but if you want access to Federal loans which they all rely upon for their lifeblood like without it they die if you want your students have access to Federal loans you have to bring your administrator to student ratio in line with what it was like in the 1990s and then the schools would scream bloody murder they be like I can't do that it's impossible what type of student experience at all like and I understand because I've run a large nonprofit organization I've started and you're very natural tendency is it the higher excellent people and then before you know it you're like have excellent people like you know by scenes of everything but then over time that ends up building a very large cost structure that gets passed along to the public so you'd bring the cost down now what you said before Bernie's like free college for everyone the problem with that solution is it pretends that college solves the employment young people and anyone who coming out of college knows that that's not real the underemployment rate for recent college graduates today it's 44% so you got like a 50/50 shot if you come out of college you doing a job doesn't really require a degree and 94% of new jobs created right now our gig temporary or contractor jobs that don't have real passport or Healthcare benefits in the rest of it people actually it might have been in that Yuval Noah Harari 21st Century 21 lessons for the 21st century how many people plan on not being in the same job in 10 years because that job won't exist anymore versus what it used to be used to be the people would think that they were going to get a job and they would stay with it and now they're planning they're going to have to move that they're not going to be able to keep the same job and as automation kicks in this is obviously going to bottleneck going to get even going to give him worse yeah yeah completely so the idea is that you end up training young people to be really really adaptable and and have low cost structures and just be able to become entrepreneurs and I spent seven years trying to train young people to do just that but one of the things I've discovered is that where overemphasizing college and what were under emphasizing is technical Vo-Tech call an apprenticeship work because a lot of that work believe or not it's actually really hard to automate like you know you're not going to automate in air conditioning repair person on Plummer anytime soon and for sure Craftsman people who build things and it's good for your mental health percent of American High School students are in Technical vocational training and Jeremy that's 59% give you a sense of what the the Gap can do what we're doing is worth over prescribing College it's not really working that well and then we're still treating people who are working in trades and everything is somehow you know like not in great careers when they actually really awesome and they pay great and they people enjoy them they're persistent so right now we're going to automate away it's a lot easier to automate away a lot of repetitive cognitive work then it is non-repetitive manual work because like actual robot digits you know it's like you can imagine take a robot plumber like I'm at your house I mean that stuff's really really tricky because a lot of fine motor work Apple icons group pipes and like stuff that stuff's not going to get automated for a long time you know what is going to get on mated a lot of like entry-level cognitive task is a lot of Journalism tasks a lot of bookkeeping lot of stuff that college graduates think they're going to get a job in one of those jobs are going to disappear I was a corporate attorney for those five on Happy month and my friends are working on basically do work law school then like load up with another under 20K in debt and then like the legal jobs are not going to be there for him and it's often the problem of the parents giving them pressure to go into college as well because they don't want the kid to become a loser and if the kid you know like where I grew up in Boston if you went into the trades if you abandoned like the idea of going to college and just went right into like learning to be a carpenter or something like to have people look at you like you sold yourself short but there's so many people that I know that went to school that just got University degrees and then they got out and they were f***** is so common it's so common that they thought there was going to be this path and this path just didn't exist once I got out or it was it was far far more difficult than was then they were led to believe like hey I've got another 20% I could get into college like right now the College completion rate in 6 years about 59% so like for a 10 people who start college or not graduating and 6 years A lot of them are just not going to finish ever so late. The people that have other pads available to move to build those pads up and this is one reason why I'm So Into the freedom dividend instead of something like free college cuz why would you subsidize something they don't get top third of the population is going to use you don't and it's a highly inefficient costly system anyway like you have money into that you're much better off putting a thousand bucks a month of every 18 year olds hands didn't they go to college great palace parsley paid for it they go to trade school great trade schools parsley paid for they start their own business and do something creative like they want to do something to help that's great to like you can actually start building more varied pads make it to that people don't feel like I need to get into this institution or else my life going to be over</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> jobs going to be automated and then Universal basic income is going to supplement their in going to give them some money $1,000 a month but where do they go from there I mean how do people exist on $12,000 a year like what do they do like how do they adapt this new world right so the first thing you have to do is you have to look at what lies ahead if we do nothing but so does the way it's going to play out is that self-driving trucks are slowly going to start hitting the highways Amazon testing them out right now and the first stage is going to be that there's a human driver just sitting there is a failsafe and the trucks going to drive us out now my friends in Silicon Valley or working until operators which is so the trucks have right now like a 98% accuracy level which is not very high because you cannot 2% semi trucks like running into things where which means that trucker patella operator in Nevada or Arizona will be into the truck in to feel to see out the front like a video game like let you know take drone operating but instead of the truck and you being in and then you just scare the truck until the computer is like I got up here and then you came out that's what they're working on a try and get catch that last bit of uncertainty so you got that much money so in the absence of anyone doing anything the robot trucks will start reducing shifts of various truckers I would say 6 to 10 years from now and so then they'll be a bunch of reactions Trucking firms already have massive shortages they can't find enough people that's one reason why they're trying to automate this job as fast as they are because they're literally like you know they're short like a couple hundred thousand is right now and people don't want to go into this field for a variety of reasons the main thing being it's like extraordinary brutal on you physically very very bad for your family life too cuz you're away all the time something like 88% of truckers have an early marker for chronic disease like diabetes high blood pressure so if you play out what hap is when the robot truck start reducing shifts then they'll be people trying to flee the field of trucking and then if it becomes really dramatic where the robot start driving let's say between Western Pennsylvania and Nevada and then human beings get in in those States and then take it the rest of the way because the robots won't be reliable enough to drive in urban areas they'll be reliable enough to drive on an interstate but it's have to make a few decisions then they'll be a massive to bleach oh truck driving opportunities and then in my mind a lot of suicides a lot of self-destruction and I don't say that lightly I say that based upon the fact that that's what happened to manufacturing workers wear if you unpack what happened to the manufacturing workers of Michigan Ohio Indiana suicide rates liked to a point where now our life expectancy of the country has declined for the last three years because of suicide and Drug overdoses it's the first time that's happened since then flu pandemic of 1918 like we are actually coming apart as a country by the numbers so what happened to the manufacturers will that happen to the trucker is but at a even more dramatic scale so you'll see truckers going home in and drink themselves to death or doing drugs and overdosing or killing themselves and then eventually they'll be an outbreak of violence because some truckers was saying to myself how about I go bust up a robot truck and there are already truckers that are doing things like blocking Tesla recharging stations at electronic vehicle battery stations because I don't like electronic truck sure those are pickup trucks so those are assholes this is not like people doing it because they they think that these Tesla recharge stations are taking jobs away they're just being dick heads exactly Joe so if you're going to be a dick head even though it really had nothing to do with you Brian imagine when you actually think your livelihood being threatened then you can see it getting revved up I know till like a much higher level so so I'm running for president in large part because I think we need to get in front of the set of problems we have to say look if we're going to save 168 billion dollars a year maybe some of that should go to the truckers and give them a soft Landing maybe we should have this Universal basic income where everyone feels like they're getting a thousand bucks a month which is not at work replacement it's not going to make their lives easy they still need to work but at least take the edge off it takes like the existential threat off and also their kids getting it so they feel like okay my kid actually has some kind of path to the Future and it's not like if I lose his trucking job not only am I going to you know the struggle and suffer but my kid will too so my plan as president is to install a trucker transitions are and say look it is your job to try and manage this transition for the three and a half million truckers in Joe we haven't even talked about the five American to work at truck stops motels diners retail establishments all the places where the trucker's stop everyday just to get out eat a meal and you know like live a life mean if you imagine those communities when the trucks don't stop there's going to be a drying up of economic Vitality on a level that's unprecedented many of these communities this is something that I'm just becoming aware over the last year or two how when you when you are out on the campaign Trail and you know you're talking to media and you're discussing this with people how many people have no idea that this is coming what would I say to people Joey's I say had you noticed stores closing in your Main Street and they say yes and I asked them why is that and then they reflect for a minute and then they say Amazon and like is that going to get better or worse cuz it's so some people say it's like half the robots like we're about two years away and then you're like no it's not robots actually like walking around your neighborhood I mean of course that's unlikely but Amazon soaking up the business that used to go to your mall if you go to their fulfillment center it's robots as far as the eye can see if you go to their their warehouse you know it's also robots as far as far as the eye can see so when you ask how aware are people at this is happy it's one of those truths that as soon as you pointed out there like oh yeah like I knew that was what was up it just for whatever reason I'm like the only person just laying out the facts and being like guys it's not your imagination like we actually are getting rid of the most common jobs in the US economy field by high school graduates and then replacing them with a handful of jobs for hire skilled people in different places and then we're pretending that the first population is somehow going to access the new opportunities when the odds of them getting up in like moving to Seattle or one not becoming a web designer or like Logistics manager or big data scientist or something like essentially near zero and so this is what gave rise to a lot of the anger that got Donald Trump elected because they looked around their communities and we're like a I used to work in this manufacturing plants manufacturing plant no longer exists for whatever reason like I'm being told that it's somehow like my fault. you know I didn't somehow become a coder or something ridiculous that have to say Joe in this is like something that I've picked up from Dennis and parts on with the trucker in Iowa and he says to me he says like I don't think that Democrats care about people like me and he says that to me while I'm his truck and I'm just like I can understand why he feels that way but that's incredibly destructive because there is a point which Democratic party used to be very very heavily aligned with working-class Americans and there's now is some kind of pathology that if the person who suffering is a white man of a certain background than the suffering somehow is like somehow like diminished a trucker and that's something that I find really destructive it's like we have to start acknowledging the source of the prom one thing I'm saying that people take a look at that immigrants are taking these jobs away like just fax it does not immigrants it is the fact that technology is pushing our economy in a direction that makes it harder and harder for many Americans to get buy based upon this current I trade my time for money model now truckers seem to be the big one right yeah cashier's or another one one of the other job jobs that are going to be killed by automation so the obvious one is call center workers were there two and a half million call center workers still in the United States generally high school graduates and make about $14 an hour now when you and I call a company we're like pounding Keys trying to get a human because the pay is so annoying indistinguishable from a person and so that two and a half million call center populations going to shrink a ton because after you get AI software that's better than one of them you know we can beat most all of them you know that's not like 5,000 job that's potentially 500,000 I was at a conference of CEOs and how many of them are looking at having a I replace back office workers like berries clerical functions every single hand went up there's going to be a lot of clerical piping systems talk to each other that's going to disappear and one CIO type of like a major Bank said that his estimate was that about 30% of the bank's workers fall into that category she looking at call center workers you're looking at back office workers you looking at Insurance Brokers insurance is a very highly automated l'industrie cuz it's a lot of information getting passed back and forth cashiers as you said truck drivers delivery driver to Uber drivers even as far as medical procedures there was a recent automated medical procedure where they did surgery on a grape has already had just complete automated Dental implantation cuz China actually has a real shortage of surgeons and so their incentives to try and automate this are very very high now that interesting thing here Joe is that I made a robot right now the economic incentive still are not necessarily for everyone to use my robot surgeon because the regulations aren't there yet in the US and so Healthcare the really interesting one another one that's very clearly going to get taken up by AI is radiology and looking at tumors on a film because it turns out that a I can see Shades of Gray that a human eye cannot and it can reference millions of films where the most experienced doctor can probably reference thousands and so Radiology I'll tell you students are running from Radiology as fast they can cuz they know that's going to get taken out by AI forecast it's very strange when we stop and think about all the different things that human beings find Value in as far as their occupation like hey I'm of this, that is what I do and if the idea that these things are all going to go away is very it's kind of streaming things that are all time at Holt Alzheimer multi-decade highs right now in United States of America suicide drug overdoses anxiety and depression mental problems Financial insecurity people being unable to pay their bills all of these things are at record highs and one thing I know you've talked about in the past and I think you'd really find fascinating so there's been there been studies as to what happens to your mind when you can't pay your bills and when you can pay your bills you're like stressing out so I can buy pay this I can't pay that and there's like always the time money trade-off it's like oh if I spend extra time commuting me back in Sayville a couple bucks and see what it does is it actually constrains your bandwidth to a point that you're functional IQ goes down by 13 points or one standard deviation so just if you say to someone hey here's a bill you can't pay and then you give them my IQ tested their score actually goes down by 13 points along now Joe is we're actually making our population less rational left reasonable more impulsive more subject to bad ideas nastier more subject to things like racism and misogyny to because it turns out what happens with most of us as you need Executive functioning to resist like racism massage misogynistic impulses and so if I make you cash-strapped and make it so you can't pay your bills you actually more likely to be like yeah what we're talking about again it's not the speculative future it's that we've been doing this for years and it's actually pushing our population into a mindset of scarcity of nastiness and that's why Universal basic income is so crucial because it gets the boot off of people's throats and it replaces the mindset of scarcity with the mindset of abundance and rationality and optimism and capacity like I'm an entrepreneur you're an entrepreneur I'll tell you very very few entrepreneurs start businesses out of scarcity my bills I guess I'm not like start a new company like most of them enough money for most people to pay for the rent will the great thing is $1,000 is yours no matter what so right now let's saying you're you're doing a normal job so if you make $1000000 a year you still get $1,000 a month yes yes you do in so you could opt in and and take it which most Americans would because it's Boogie greedy yeah thousand dollars to get my nails done yeah you know they felt like it yeah yeah but this so those are the things that are at like all-time highs like all these negative social indicators hear things that are All Time Low's getting married starting a business having a kid moving for a new job all of those things are at historic lows in United States of America having record low birth rates right now and it's largely because people feel too strapped to have kids I mean that's literally where we are when you say record low by like what percentage you can look up right now Jamie I want to look this up but the stories have come out of this last year saying that Americans are now at the lowest rate of childbirth that is been the case and a decade or ever yeah that's a conversation to have with people whenever they say that they're worried about population of the population is growing so Andover pop heroes 1.80 births per woman 2016 what does it mean 1972 u.s. birth dipped a 30-year low fertility rate sink further below replacement level and so you think but the thought is that this is because of education and this is because of people are waiting longer to have children and that this is a byproduct of industrialization and modern world and that the more educated and Athlon people get the less likely they are to have children that it's not the same as far as everything I've read about it is that it's not a symptom of people doing poorly symptom of people doing well you know they're there are definitely cases were richer countries is Happy were kids at school cuz they comes during their careers right now the idea but the darker parted is Joe is that right now if you're an oncology hated person in the United States the odds of your ever getting married less than 50% now for the first time ever and then people are having fewer kids to play Devil's Advocate the marriage thing might be people looking at go, parents got divorced my brother got divorced everybody else got divorce what the f*** am I doing there a lot of good reason for it is just you don't need as a happily married man by me as well I was hoping he'll do it I tell people to do it's just it's too risky so you can look at to me certainly to me getting married having kids like an active like Prosperity or optimism their reasons why it's going down otherwise but if you look at things like starting a new business I mean that multi-day kilos is like no positive spin on that people moving between states is now at multi-decade Lowe's people moving for a new job multi-decade Lowe's like you think this is the product of automation or it's a product of a bunch of different factors like internet but purchasing and marketing and think people buy most of their goods and it's a range of factors but one of the big problems and keep in mind I spent seven years helping entrepreneurs grow businesses in 18 cities around the country between 2011-2017 that's like to my job my job was to be the job Creator guy and so when you go out these places you see that the dynamism is getting sucked up by certain markets to a level that's unprecedented in our history like that that the disparities between Cleveland San Francisco or St Louis and LA are much much higher than they've been in any other historic . both by the numbers and like after you actually go to the places you like me I like this is not flourishing that the way that you do you feel like an economic Paul Revere in a certain sense like that the robots are coming I do if the United States economy is like an elephant parable of like the people liking a blind people in a truck in the elephant so I sold do a public company that was a National Education company is based in New York what is the parable blind people touching an elephant so what happens is there are like seven Blind Men and they they get asked like what is the what is an elephant look like and then one of them touching the trunk and it's like an elephant looks like a snake and another one's touching his leg looks like a tree trunk economy looks like older a National Education company to a public company I live by Coastal between New York and San Francisco for the last 5 years I've operated in 18 cities around the country I was I was going to point the unit in the Obama Administration in DC so I've actually seen the elephant if you know what I mean like I hold out ya like I'm I'm like hanging out with the tech wizards of Silicon Valley and I'm like not bad people it's like a it's my job to like made it home for dinner and if you gave me a choice between making things work better and creating abundant opportunities for the other people I would choose that but I do not have that choice I have a job to do you know this is my job and what I tell people is like whose responsibility than is it to go tell the people look ITS Technologies transform the economy of fundamental ways and we need to make it so that everyone benefits and it's not just that this like hyper concentrated set of winners and then dislike it's technology that transform the economy in fundamental ways and we need to make it so that everyone benefits and it's not just that this like hyper concentrated set of winners and then dislike huge Army of a relative losers and if the government job but at this point we've given up on our government as anything like it can't really do anything and so now with no one's job and so somehow Joe it has become my job and it blows my mind to sometimes</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> can my physical expression of this inspired other people to innovate create and do amazing things in the world and in another modalities and canvases that's one of the weird things about people doing extraordinary things like what you did is that you absolutely will give other people fuel to accomplish things in their life inspiration is so critical for human being so mean I draw upon it from so many different sources from David Goggins and a bunch of my other friend at my friend Cameron Hanes and a lot of other people that are endurance athletes and different interviewed on this podcast but there's something that happens when you realize that people can do extraordinary things that makes you believe in the potential not just in that person but also in yourself Absalom and you know dog is great example that I've never met anybody from black I mean what he says about the 40% what are those limits 40% of 40% you know people quit that I can't boys comes up and he's proven it so as many other people of actually when you say I can actually when you don't stop you get stronger and from me in my own story of my own journey I think that final day that finally final 32-hour push proves it three days before that you're not videotaping all this time trying to capture as much content Bill to share with people this crazy weird place that's an article by yourself in like day 14 and a 40ft like I'm literally crying into my GoPro be in like I'm running out of food I'm exhausted I don't know if I can keep doing this I'm just like works right but sure enough I don't say I can't you know it's that for it was at 40% was at 50% at that moment when I wanted to quit I should have quit but then the strongest most amazing moment of my entire athletic credits been decades happened three days later because I kept pushing it's not like I rested for 3 days and pull that off like I never took a rest day in 54 days I pull my sled 13 hours every single day and on the last day it was the strongest as possible so I think it proved if we can push through that I can't moment no it's not going to work that you can get there and unfortunately you know we talked about 40% with Goggins I actually think a lot of people quit at 1% they're sitting behind the troposphere like you know one day I want to travel overseas or you know I hate this job you know what I've got this great business idea but I'm like but I can't like my first world record in 2016 I thought with Jenna in my house one bedroom apartment with a whiteboard more like I'm going to see if I can set the world record for the Explorers Grand Slam so mean fewer than 50 people in the world have ever done and I want to be the fastest climb Everest, Denali climb Kilimanjaro North Pole South Pole back-to-back I declined a bunch of mountain be pretty easy to say I can't oh and by the way we have no money to do this we have no platform I like 200 Instagram followers like nothing what's the first step to that we literally get out our laptops and I'm like going at like big media campaign with lots of people follow and get press like we do nothing about with no background this week Google what's the difference between marketing and PR I mean we are literally asking Google a website how does one build a website and it goes on and on like this how long ago did you start this journey so that that was 2424 world record was 25 years ago yes and see if I could set the world record for something called the Explorers Grand Slams that's coming tallest mountain on each of the 7 continents 7 Summits and before that have you done anything like that or it just been Athletics so I grew up in Portland so I grew up like in the outdoors but like I need to go climb Everest the Denali store break world record not just do it smell like B the fastest person to ever complete it you know I guess I'd ended up being a hunter in 39 days straight through to climb all those mountains didn't know his butt but yeah it mean to do to do all of that it started from this place of not up of a believing I can and then you know it's plug and it's fun to talk about the epic adventure baby it's me it's actually fun to talk about what happened behind the scenes of that because what actually happened like people applaud R6 now this is me this is you wallgren walking across the ladder that's the about 300-foot Jolla crevasse on the other side of it that you have to go through two on your way up to the Mount Everest climbing route it so your crampons are clicking on the cooking them on the ladder as you walk across and if you fall you die yes Walking the Tightrope on let me hear it listen that click folks I employ you to go to the Instagram page so you get the full freak out Grandpa knows they're tied together to those ladders $50 I've lost cheer and every f****** time I got a couple of times it's a very dangerous section of the mountain but yeah what about 50 of those ladders so when you went through Everest did you see the bodies so I personally didn't see anybody's up there around with your unfortunate fortunately I mean I mean I'm not like trying to see that on the day that I saw Monday night so it to set the timing for me as major setbacks it was the eighth of nine Expeditions in this sequence I done a hundred days of other Expeditions leading up to Everest through this explorers Grand Slam world record I'm trying to climb Everest I'm exhausted from a hundred days I just completed North Pole before that Kilimanjaro before they know Albert's all these other Mountain can I make my Summit push whenever I'm not come with a guide or anything it's just myself and one Sherpa who I met coming in the part of your previous one training for this and so it's just the two of us we climb up an account for Cyrus has Unifour cancer face camping in those camps progressively higher in the mountains you can get your body acclimatize and we get up into camp for have you read the book Into Thin Air by Jon krakauer and invited to a kitten is a famous book that's written about 11 people died in the Right In This Moment's called the death zone where you enter above 26000 ft the human body has basely can't survive for long even with supplemental oxygen and this massive snowstorm in wind storm blows in my kind of out of nowhere and we're trying to push the summit it take two and a half hours just to set up our tent and get inside and we know like it's over like we're not we're not going to Summit Everest like in this storm there's no way so we just survive the night wake up the next morning still getting pounded by this weather not yet the climb back down the mountain to climb back down the mountain all the way to Camp to in there like another well that's probably it like you don't usually like to spend the night out in the death zone in like make a second attempt and you've already tried all these other mountains your hundred plus days in the tourney and I was like man I want to see if I can get back up there like and this other guy who I met on another team some supplemental oxygen side to use the my supplement auction some I put supply stores are limited now as well and so he he said to me hey I'm not going to go up I'm sick but if you get back up to Camp four there's a couple bottles of oxygen that you could use of mine if you need if you somehow get back up there so sure enough the same boat as same as trip I was kind with amazing climber himself we get back up to Camp four in the death zone and we decide we're going to go for the summit we call back down to Basecamp what's the weather forecast and I like well it's the exact same Casper told you before it might hold in which case we'll be fine or it might turn into what you guys just survive and if you're not near your tent and you're up on the Summit Ridge of Everest like it's going to get like pretty bad and so we can I go back and forth should we go for it shouldn't we go for at least decide to go for it but this crazy thing happens which is you may have read about this or heard of this if you know much about Everest but basically no one claimed ever since 2014 or 15 cuz I shoot Avalanche killed 16 short person 2014 the mountain was closed in 2015 was a huge earthquake in Nepal that shut the climbing even climb the mountain in 2 years but all the sudden because he's weather delays I end up there and it's a hundred people going for the summit on the exact same day so basically traffic jam on the worst possible and I would go okay let's figure out how to climb this thing can we leave Camp you know the photo that I took for leaving camp there's all these lights going up the side of the mountain and it's because there's one rope that everyone works to put inside ones using the same rope and all the sudden we're behind a hundred people if you stand there wind chill -40° like we're going to get frostbite like we're going to not be able to make it and Super Saiyan Goten I look neater Miguel let's on clip from the rope and so we actually decide to unclip from the Rope climb up all the way to the balcony from the the South call the deathstone area was mentioning before up to about 28,000 feet on rope because we actually think it's more dangerous to climb rope next all the behind all the people than it is to risk of fall no those people don't know what they're like people are on Everest at 20,000 feet if people are walking to meet one step per minute sometimes mean it's it is brutal it's on me I'm walking maybe two steps every 30 seconds but I'm like Usain Bolt like to Steve it's too dangerous for us to be on clip from the railpenny longer we're like we're just going to have to clip in and settle in behind you know we passed like 50 or 60 people so we're much better place than ever I still have this one big puffy coax the same puffy could I use in Antarctica a big like Michelin Manco and I'm like we're going to slow down I better put this big jacket on and so I take my jacket off I undo my gloves real quick to put this big jacket on over me to warm myself up and I looked down and my right hand is Black by just Black is Black can be and I'm like holy s*** like tell tale sign of frostbite like oh my God like the same thing we got school coming along got family fun the whole thing and I'm like oh my God like I'm going to lose my right hand is Jenna still going to love me you know what my family going to think and then I don't say nothing at the same boat yet my hand back in this big gloves and I go okay and I don't recommend to stop process but I go well I'm going to lose my hand anyways would it be cooler to lose my hand but also have summited Everest how black was it I mean it was black like black black but goes like I'm going to lose my hand about 30 minutes Bluemound and should be a beautiful little kid I dream like summiting Everest would be like the greatest accomplish my life on my God and I'm thinking like this dark place but also haven't taken a single photo basically I'm like why I got to get like a photo or a video of the famous Mount Everest summit so I pull up my GoPro to shoot a video I shoot a short little video what kind of shows has crazy exposure that I'm on one side 5000 feet down into China on one side 5052 Palma style of knife-edge Ridge and of course I have to adjust my gloves again and I pull my I pull my GoPro out at the mess with my gloves put it back in and I look at my hand I start my way to Mom's near go put my hands back what are you doing glove warmers and the charcoal and the copper filings of the chemical hand warmers was completely fine oh so yeah this could. You play from the top is me reaching the summit that's perfect booty right there but mindset which is one of my favorite topics in like just like we said you can convince yourself that the salt man is fixing your foot like I'm on Everest I'm at 28,000 ft my brains not working very well I know that the weather is coming in bad that people are going to get maybe frostbite based on the forecast and I look down and see my hands black where's my mind goes like it's not like let me think about this but I'm on Everest my hands black that means you know in my brain like I have frostbite Otis like it's a weird thing where you can take your mind like there's a lot of stuff to the positivity with my mom went to the negative immediately like your hands gone is frozen off like the end of the day on the Rope yeah so unfortunately that day the weather actually did get pretty bad later in the day so fortunate I was able to get down before the weather got too bad but the people that died that day one slipped and fell down these around lhotse which is the adjacent Mountain but someone sharing some of the same ropes on the same route and then two people die from altitude sickness so basically either running out of oxygen are there not be able to get back down and their tent I think those people actually did get carried back down there tents that night and then died in the tent that night some called cerebral edema which is basically your brain fills with fluid from being at the High Altitude and not getting enough oxygen and it's a it's a killer up there and you don't want that crazy things about being up there as you know you read about it but you really can't rescue somebody silly up there I mean take to carry a human body down it's a rescue them is is nearly impossible and I kind of always thought in my mind you know if I saw somebody lying on the ground like I would be no summon the energy to pick them up and I was actually coming back from the summit and I was on the South Summit so just below the average seminar at 28800 feet or something like that and this Brazilian woman who had met in Basecamp entice who I become friends with your in Nepal for a couple months you start talking to people getting friends with other climbers whatever and you're lying on the ground with her head like lean back in her oxygen mask off to the side and I'm like oh my God like this is the moment that I most feared like somebody who I know is lying here on the side of the mountain and I think to myself I've got to pick her up I've got to pick her up and somehow that carry her down this mountain and I leaned over to grab her and I try with all my might to do anything and I realized I can't move her 6in like I'm completely exhausted muscles not working brains not working so I did the only thing I can think to do is I just wrap her in my arms and I say ice like you can hear me it's calling you need to get up you need to get your oxygen mask on you need to start moving like please get up please get up no response she was kind with a sherpa another guide right next to her and they were like look like we're having trouble with rocks to math but we're going to fix it like it's going there right now it's like just kind of going through this intense moaning like what do I do how can I help and it says weirdest I'm not proud of it. Sorry to say but like there was nothing I could do like I was just the most help with feeling in the world where you want to help the common person you find the percent be a friend but if any human being is lying on the ground in the snow you're like I want to help this person get down this mountain and I was just on so closed on my limit up there the summit there's nothing I could do fortunately she was not one of the people that passed away that to her team did get her oxygen mask on her and she actually made it to the summit and back down safely whole crazy part of that story but it was an interesting lesson for me in like you know you hear these stories you can't move bodies up there there's nothing do the rescuing people have been criticized for not you know doing these crazy rescues when things have gone wrong up there but it really hit home for me like how hard it would be to move somebody down that mountain from that altitude and so when you're up there you know unlike you know Antarctica I was actually alone and Everest like I said was pretty crowded day like you're essentially alone up there like if you can't keep putting one foot in front of the other up in the deathstone there's not a not a whole lot that you can do to the three people that died after they leave their I'm not sure do specific people cuz sometimes they what you can get like a large team of people to slowly lower people down and you know in a weird way it's actually easier to lower a dead body than it is to lower a live person cuz it said party don't have to worry about breaking bones and rocks and things like that so I actually believed those bodies are no longer there but there are quite a few bodies to know still on the mountain in particular the north side the Chinese so you can climb it from two sides to Nepal side is more commonly clymore I climb by the Tibet side the Tibet side is known for have a lot more the body still actually on the climbing route for sure so for me I'm not doing that day in a crazy way continues on because I got back down to camp for and I'm thinking I'm going to sleep for the night rest and come back down the mountain use it takes a few days to get back down the mountain at this point and I've only got one more mountain to climb to come finish my world record the Explorers Grand Slam and I was about two months ahead of schedule so if I climb Denali in the next 2 months North America's tallest mountain up in Alaska I was going to set this world this world it was and so I called back home to Jenna and I was like I made it like I made it and earlier in the day when my hands have gotten Frozen I had actually had a heated boot warmers and so I turned the heat in my boot warmers up as hot as possible to look at my hand is prosper and what would my feet look like sweater crank those up as hot as possible so Jenna's like hay like how you doing like you all right we've heard some reports over social media that's been a really hard day up there like I'm alright like no frostbite like I'm good and I was like well actually I burned my feet and she's like oh frostbite like how bad is it not like no not frostbite I actually burned to like silver dollar Circle in bottom took both of my feet from starting my boot warmers up too much is like wait let me get this straight like you climb Everest you don't get frostbite but you burn yourself so you're in your tent right you took your boots off and everything you're curled up in her and like yeah she's like well actually need you to put your boots back on and I'm like excuse me like I just like she's like yeah so we've been doing some calculating back home and it just so happened but if you can get to the summit of Denali in the next week you can set not one but two world records and I was like well that sounds nice but like I'm on the summit of below the summit of Everest how the hell is that going to work she's like okay back on down now come all the way back to base camp there's no time for you to sleep a tent and a helicopter is going to take you to Kathmandu no time for a hotel no time for a shower but an evening flight to take you to Dubai to Seattle to Anchorage and instead of having three weeks to climb Denali fuel 3 days but you can do all of that you'll see another world record like ready go do I was in disbelief but knowing better than to disobey not only my amazing wife but that that planner and Logistics expert in running the background all this I sure enough put my boots back on wipe the Slate clean and found myself and I'll just a hundred hours after standing on the summit of Everest I found myself over in Alaska trying to push up to the summit to to start at the two world records and I'll just the one</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> this is impossible me how many guys do you know there's like one day I'm going to this cool thing that I've never do it right and so actually going after that and sharing it away with like you might not want to walk across Antarctica but like you probably have some hope or some dream or some goal that you want to accomplish in your life like f****** going through it like you and so for me doing this it's funny I've started to think of myself less as an athlete and actually more of an artist and my canvas really is just Endurance Sports but creating these art projects in the world that I can create and share with people through storytelling hopefully Inspire them what was I thinking in that first hour was Idaho I don't want my art project to blow up right in my face but more so there was this was bigger than myself and that's really what kept me going forward just like I can't let these kids and their driving inspiration from this hopefully like I want to do this for this larger purpose and honestly that's what that's what really kept me going forward through the really hard time so that that that connection to a larger purpose of what I want to put out in the world that ripple effect of positivity. commandant of course you have a joint team that prepared and help you know let them down into that can do that starting line of having that. But I think I mean one level with also it's a human element CV easy for me to come in here and tell the story like you know what Joe like I'm the biggest badass in the world no one's walked across Antarctica and like I did it even though these people died trying over like those are the facts of the situation but the truth is man like I'm human like I have the way human emotions I figured out how to tap into my mind in a way to do these things but like I still experience fear I steered still experience doubt I still experience the ups and downs but I have a way of actually being able to repost purpose of refocus that energy into positive forward momentum I think that's what the difference is but I believe all of us all of us humans have the capacity to do this like you're looking at me like a pretty like regular like size regular looking guy but I think you know the muscle between my ears is what separates a difference in a allow me to do this more than anything to have the darkness that I usually see in people that do things like this do you know I'm saying I had a bunch of people have done some f*****-up thing and they all have some weird Darkness yeah you know I hear what you say I think for me there's a lot of history and come from the dark moment in my life you know right after college I was traveling around the world at United no money as a kid growing up you know work working-class background painted houses every summer but always dreamed of traveling the world so I was like wow play I'm going to travel the world so I can finish college buddies of mine are getting like real jobs and whatever Wall Street and things like that and I was like you know I saved up $10,000 over the past 6 years I'm going to take a surfboard in a backpack and like go see the world with my life savings and so now when do that I'm 21 years old and go to Fiji i surf thru Australia hitchhiker New Zealand I end up in Thailand and you're going to time over there so I'm going to beach in Rhode Island and I decide to jump his flaming jump rope and unfortunately it goes terribly wrong for me the Rope wraps around my legs and ignites my entire body body on fire to my neck and yelling in instant my life change in a fortunately for me the water's edge of the ocean with ten steps away so kind of instinct takes over and I dive into the ocean which extinguish the Flames my body is on fire my neck but not before about 25% of my body is severely severely burned clothes were on fire but mostly we got severely burned was my legs and feet and so I'm in a place I want to beat there's there's no hospital on this and I'm an island there's no hospital instead of an ambulance ride on the back of a moped driving down a dirt path you know I'm in a one-room nursing cytolytic assize the room were sitting in there like this is our sort of hospitals like one bed and I'm just completely devastated and so that they put me under eight surgeries over the next week in the middle of nowhere World Thailand surgery yeah and the basically there's a cat running around my bed every time I come out of their Conoco ICU there's a cat running around my bed and across my chest and a doctors are literally saying to me you know when they're in the broken you know English either saying hey you'll probably never walk again normally like you're probably never going to walk again normally yeah there there's a photo of that I think of you click over on on that to the second one actually shows you know they're there is what the lake looks like so that's actually eight weeks after I was burned that believe it or not that's like it's starting to look a little bit better all things considered there so as you can probably imagine I mean just the darkest time of my life I've been neon after I swam through college and I thought of myself as a physically active person and here I am like doctors and hate you. 22 year old kid like you'll never walk again normally and to me like there's their hero in the story which is maybe why you don't see the darkness in my eyes and it's more the light but no my mother is really that the hair his tail which is she she arrived to my bedside around day 5 no flies all the way over tile and finds me you are you paranoid you have kids I don't have kids yet but I can only imagine as a parent what it's like to walk into a mental hospital room and see your kid Halfway Around the World in this state nothing you can do and she admits now that she was crying in the hallways no pleading with the doctors for good news like he's going to be all right right he's going to walk she's crying but every time she walked into my hospital room she walked in with a smile on her face in this is are positivity being like okay, I'm like this is bad like what do you want to do when you get out of here like let's set a goal like let's get out of here and do something positive and I'm like Mom you crazy crazy like the doctor said I'm never going to walk again normally like my life as I know it is over you know just in this really dark place in my mind but she just kept at me day after day with this positivity this and I finally like close my eyes and picture like what what am I going to be when I close my eyes I had this visualization of myself crossing a triathlon Finish Line never buy to run competitively nothing but I was like you know what the able-bodied me sometime in the future is going to be not only walking again but doing a triathlon race until I said it's worth it Michaels erase a try for Monday and it said her looking at me going like I said set a goal but maybe something but doesn't require you to be running she was like great let's learn about it pulls out her computer just literally start treating me like something I thought you maybe wanted to do and so that's what I focus I literally have this photo of me with that eye doctor I'm on my legs are bandage to my waist the tie doctors like looking like crazy but I'm lifting these like 10 lb barbells and I had gone I'm training for a triathlon in a hospital and I'm telling you you know I mean I'm in a wheelchair I got carried on and off the flight back to Portland Oregon land back home and you know still still bandaged up and my mom you know says my wake up the first morning back of my parents house my mother's kitchen the house I grew up in and she looks at me and she goes all right, now I know you've got this big Triathlon goal but today your goal is to take your very first step and so she actually grabs a chair from our kitchen table and place that one step in front of my wheelchair and she says today need to somehow figure out how to get out of that wheelchair take one step and step in the chair in front of you and I'm looking at it like I don't know if this is possible but three hours later for us but I'm still staring at this chair and I finally worked up the courage and strength to get out of his wheelchair take the one step and getting it at chair in front of me and is the problem because of the burnt skin it's not flexible you can't move it and bend it now it's a good question so basically what happened with the burn is it burn me so deep that two things happened one is there is ligament damage so ligament damage to my ankles and knee joints and then the way did the Hitler scarring in the skin is healing essentially over these mobile joint they don't think I'm going to regain full flexibility at full range of motion essentially in my legs so they're not saying You'll Never Walk at then you won't be able to stand up at all although that was like extremely painful but they didn't think you know Bea imagine walking around helping on the bend your knees are ankle feeling full Mobility so just was like you're not going to be able to have that back basically so sure enough I take that first step in that chair the next day my mom doesn't take it easy on me move the chair 5668 10-step to let you know every day a few more steps of it and not to go on and on but basically 18 months after you know getting released from the hospital I find myself in Chicago I finally you know took a job in finance to try to get out of my parents basement like get all of my life appointment is all like yeah I got to get like a real job. My parents basement you do move to Chicago take a job in finance and try to get my s*** together basically and I honor that goes if you know what I'm going to sign up for the Chicago Triathlon I live here now a local gym you nothing about the sports Dylan like asking random guys at the gym like anybody here race a triathlon like I'm in a spin class like how do you like how do you take your shoes off and run ended up racing across the finish line and semi complete another surprise I didn't just finished the race but actually won the entire Chicago traffic on PA thousand of people coming first place what wow what kind of training did you do to prepare yourself for that I mean like I said I am but then you know the biking and running was completely new to me Cosmic strike met a guy and he was like oh I've done one Triathlon before and he's like I can do so he took me on a couple like fries with his buddies I had this like steel frame bike I didn't know all these a carbon wheels and Aero helmet all these fancy like Triathlon type of things I didn't know much about it and literally for summer just kind of like asked people some questions this and what's funny about traffic on I don't know how familiar with this sport but more than 4,000 at the same time you actually have to start in waves like a hundred people every 5 minutes and I was the 39th wave of 53 and so I dive into Lake Michigan and there's people that already started like two hours before me and there's people starting 2 hours after me and so when I finish the race you know I swam I buy Chiron was Olympic distance Triathlon so is a mile swim 25 mile bike 6.2 mile run across the Finish Line I don't still know I won the race because like people started before me people started after me and they take the cumulative time at the end like my grandma's there cuz she lives in Chicago like gives me a big hug and I'm so proud of you you were able to walk again and here you are finished a triathlon let's go get lunch and so I can go grab my wetsuit my bike my grandma and I sat down to have lunch and I were walking back to the car she's like you want to see like what place you came in your age group and I was like sure like that would be cool like let's go see how I did we Wander over like the scores table and the guys like you don't try to figure out a place or what your name is like we've been calling your name over the loudspeaker for like 20 minutes why did I like do something wrong and I like you want like like my age group me like no you want like the whole race is for real the real moment in my life I mean it was it was wild but it real for me we do in that moment but it was more so at least of my journey was I was like wow like this is a sliding doors moment like what had happened at my mom not you know common with that are positive reinforcement is that the tangible go like I'm certain my life would be nowhere where it was today but then it's not I wasn't like oh wow I'm superhuman free that can do things I was like well humans all of us we all have these reservoirs of untapped potential inside of us and can achieve extraordinary things when we set our minds to it and see what it did for me it's just sparked this curiosity like what what else can I do if I set my mind to it so sure enough it was a Sunday when I racist Chicago Triathlon coincidentally Matt who it became a huge Mentor an influence my life that afternoon a guy named Brian gelber who ended up being my first sponsor and he said to me you won the Chicago Triathlon today to make you should maybe do something about that smells like gas but I've got a job and I don't have any money like these boxes like I'll be your first sponsor if it's something you want to take seriously and so literally that was on a Sunday Monday morning I walk in and immediately only for the US national team you all over the world for the next six years so it was a story what happened ultimately with the injuries he's sustained from the fire you know all things in there that was so that was January 14th 2008 so it's just over 11 years ago now and I know I ultimately have been pretty all right I mean I've got some stars but it's pretty faint was able to gain back most of the full flexibility in my legs my left foot is where the worst worst Burns or where they rope really just like sat on my foot for a long time most of that's still pretty thick with scar tissue you know when I'm in the mountains when I'm in places you know like climbing Mount Everest like I did like pulling across Antarctic all the things I'd be really aware because my skin regulates heat not in the best way he and cold is still just like not like normal skin is the scar tissue tissue just is it still carries the heat a little bit different for some reason I guess I don't know exactly why exactly in the actually in the early days for the first five years I don't get this so often anymore but in the first literally five years of this if I bumped my legs until I get a table or someone in a bunker chair and Amelia nothing like lightly I would usually get a low-cut there so just super fragile when was like you know class skin kind of the same sort of flexibility that you normally have but no 10 11 years on now I would say it's pretty much a hundred percent I mean two things I've done with my legs and Body in the last 10 years I've been proved at least that the my body is doing all right so I feel weak stream Avenues on now I would say it's pretty much a hundred percent I mean the things I've done with my legs and Body in the last 10 years I've been proved at least that the my body is doing all right so I feel extremely extremely fortunate to have her cover it is as well as I did and you know more than anything I buy test that too of course that the physical ability for my body to recover in the way it did but I think that at least for me started with the Mindstar with that positivity of my mother and and the duration of the many different things I've done done since</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you're looking at your compass and Your Dragon the s*** behind you like the are you doing anything in your mind are you saying songs are you what are you doing there's a couple different things but really what ended up happening is I started to be able to trigger these flowstate so you know as a lifelong professional athlete through different capacities in my life you know I've tapped into that now the swimmer when I was a little kid to swim in laps in a pool sometimes I would like, just happen to this site Timeless space where you may be 30 minutes would go by and in two minutes or something like that but I never really knew how I got there just would sometimes tap into it sometimes not you know the Zone Flow State whatever you want to call that but in Antarctica I went in with the swerve attention about intention of exploring that space in my mind and so as I got more and more into these white out to newbe's Compass in staring at his Compass staring at this expansive landscape I started to find ways to actually trigger that flow state in my mind so I got to the point where I could for several days at a time being this deep estate sale in my day was about 17 hours every day between getting up boiling my water getting out of my tent in those crazy conditions packing my sled dragging it for 13 hours setting my tent Back Up In This Storm but I got in a sort of sequence of being so present with each step each next sequence that ended up being in this really Timeless spaceless place my mind of true high performance that was almost like the most deepest peaceful meditative state that I can possibly imagine it was it was very profound and beautiful not to get there in my mind no you are you boiling this water in your tent like you could refill the snow but a stove with fuel basically the way my tent was you saw the outer layer of the tent there there's actually an inner part that's a tent so that there's a vestibule we're basically there's snow inside the doorway but not outside outside so I wouldn't shovel that snow from inside of the tent vestibule into my pot and Bill to melt that way I drink about 6 L of water every single day when I was out there it's a lot of snow a lot and take a few hours to melt that people don't realize this is actually the largest desert in the world so it's actually very dry doesn't snow very often but when it does of course never melt in the South Pole is at 9300 feet so not only am I but I'm at altitude doing this altitude of Jews like one of those tents to sleep in or yeah so there's this gym at Mike and I trained at it's called Evolution Healthcare and Fitness in Portland actually have an altitude room there so that it's not even a tenth of action of a full of full room where you can you know Scott rowing machines got treadmills it's got all that simulate it up to about 14000 Peaks people are starting to sleep in those tents but black people have a hard time and then I get warm and stuff like that no life Fighters use them as well but but yeah it was pretty cool to have a full room that you can actually you know be in and moving properly for the stimulate some of the high-intensity stuff yeah and so it would take you hours every day to make your water yeah I would say I was boiling water for about 3-4 hours per day so an hour or two in the morning hour or two in the evening take a lot of energy to boil frozen snow when it's that cold out she had a guy to carry a lot that was the other hundreds of hours of fuel so I took about 17 L of fuel so it's worth 6 gallon just mean like that going to be enough beforehand I 2016 added another world record project where I kind of tallest mountain on each of the seven continents the Seven Summits as well as when's the North and South Pole but much smaller polar Expeditions a weak base weave the last degree of latitude and sewing those Expeditions all photos on Everest during that time to nollie excetera all that in 139 days but I did that and that kind of help me get a sense of it but honestly was also best gas based on talking to people different experts in the field you know diving into that but you never know it's going to be enough or too little I only decided to much when you when you finally got to the end how much do you have left so my final push actually I woke up on the morning of Christmas Eve 20 December this past year and it look I was 77 miles from the finish and I've been going at that point the beginning of a trip I was only gone nine 10 miles per day towards the end I started going about 20 25 miles per day so I said you know what like I'm about 3 days out and then I thought to myself maybe if I could push really hard these next two days I could do it in two days like 2:15 plus our days like really get into it and start looking at my fuel and Food Supplies in like they were pretty low had it had enough fuel Feud liters of fuel but I actually had about a day or good food like a real substantial food left until I woke up and I was like all right let's go for this and in the actually deepest talk about Flow State that was the deepest most of my life I woke up in 1 hour and a dates Christmas morning I wake up and I'm just locked in and I just came out you didn't tell anyone back home didn't tell my wife who's tracking me that this GPS tracker they could follow me but I was in my mind I was like you know what not we not three days not 2 days I'm going straight for it and so I did a final 32 hour can you whisper Chante 5477 miles straight dragon by sled all the way to get to the Finish Line in one continuous push no music no nothing just like in my head in this in this crazy Flow State of that are no high performance was a crazy final push to get there but I made it right before the food and fuel ran out and so what do you do when you get to the end you said hey I'm done come get me yeah yeah how long does it take for them to come get you it took me a week to get out of Antarctica totally took actually need four days to get out of there but there's a crazy other component to this which is no one in the world had ever done it before like I said a few really talented people some of the best sport in the world had tried recently one guy died and it just so happened there's a really specific season when you can attempt is but another guy was nothing at the exact same time as me a British British guy who's the equivalent of a Navy SEAL you know British Special Forces the living most experienced guy in Antarctica is actually pulled 3000 plus miles in Antarctica now in various Expeditions until we got dropped off 1 mile away from each other to begin this thing and obviously I was the first I did win this race head-to-head and at the Finish Line I waited for him for a few days cuz I want to congratulate him cuz he did all them Italy finish but you can only imagine back that first hour I was like it's impossible is also like it's impossible and blow the by the way this Navy SEAL dude who knows more about Antarctica to me he's often do you know I wave to him in this weird like passing of the torch moment like I was passing him and then I never saw him again until I finished and I finished about 70 miles ahead of him about two-and-a-half days ahead of my let's go to suck for him I brought home for America man you don't appreciate that we all will appreciate that but still is going to suck for him so I actually even though I finished in the first thing I could have kind of wanted to do I haven't had I haven't had a shower when I have it I actually to save weight so I can get as much food and fuel in my sled how about no extra clothes no extra pair underwear underwear hot basically I describe that best of your situation so one side I cook in if the wind is calm I get out of my tent dig a hole and you know it in the whole baby away but when it's real windy like those storms I just want to take your going to get frostbite if you try to you know bend over pull your pants down when is -80 out of my cooking on but the other side where I'm still inside cover I dig a hole in there now is my morning routine get up at 6 a.m. start blowing in my water one side of my tent and not glamorous had a pretty thing at the veiko action 2 minutes is very cool but also not glamorous within one degree of latitude of the south pole saw the last degree of latitude 89 degrees South poles at 90° spacely 69 miles or 60 nautical miles circumference around the South Pole Antarctica being as pristine as it is they have all these laws about Environmental Conservation which to me is amazing being someone who just loves and disgrace to rid of the land they actually said you can't even leave your human waste in holes hearing there's nobody out there like we want this to completely protected area and so yes usually my sled was getting lighter most the time cuz I was eating food everyday and burning fuel but in that last degree of latitude of the South Pole and Crossing it I was sitting in a bag wrapping it up and put it in my sled and I would carry it with me so golden cares if I take a s*** up there where I grew up in that going out in the outdoors in this is leave no Trace principles that I am I really love and in particular Antarctica 1 things about Antarctica at one of those places where imagine you traveled far and wide in your life and there's been a few place at least in my mind where you just can't put it into words until you've stepped off there and for me is my second time in Antarctica on both times you know this big cargo ship basically lands on the continent getting a smaller plane to get dropped off to where I needed to start the edge of the continent but both time stepping plain I'm just s*** eating grin ear-to-ear on my face because I just didn't like what what is this place even the second time seeing and I felt like my cheeks were sore because I was just smiling so big that while Christine Beauty the blank canvas the onion you look at an Atlanta human Footprints haven't touched 98% of the continent something like that I mean it's untouched and so it in a bag of I to do that to do my part 2 I mean it untouched and so it in a bag of had to do that to do my part to that way how many bags of s*** did you drag the end it was about why you reuse the bags one per day for that section is about 120 miles around the 30th and 40th Day</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> 21 Brightwood life what's up man what's up dude it's hilarious posed to have to tell you this I did a podcast earlier today and he said why is your second for the day he was impressive endurance do you know how f****** ridiculous that is for you to say this is a guy who walked across Antarctica how many days until you 54 days by yourself by myself just real endurance weed I'm just sitting down talking to people oh my God you talked already for 2 hours how do you do it two more hours here we go yeah where you doing just just getting back actually still still practically have a snow on my shoes I got back about a month ago 54 day Journey first person in history to cross the entire continent solo unsupported Sono resupplies throughout the thing no no a no-win kites nothing just me dragon 375 lb across Antarctica I can't believe it only took you 54 days yeah map how long do you think it would take you to walk across America will usually look at have a diagonal across to the center and then back to the other ice shelf what does a flat earthers think about your you're traversing this this area like this is what you did this is how you do it exactly I've got guys going like I was doing the speech the other day people are super nice come up in the Q&amp;A afterward want to shake my hand take a picture whatever and this guy walks up in his real Earnest look on his face is like so I really wanted to ask you how is the whole house like excuse me it was like you know the hole at the center and I was like he was like you know like when you got to the edge and I was like oh man like you're really asking we are talking about that didn't quite know where to go with it I was like yeah there's actually at least I didn't see the edge and then the curvature kept going and I'm such a strange thing to believe but people do that the people think people are trolling about that actually started out another 4chan thing you know it's well I'm sure there's somebody believed it before that but it started off people trolling on 4chan that eventually people just started actually going I bet it is flat and they start believing it and videos YouTube video to opt out of YouTube video Someone linked to me that I had a I thought I had like I thought I'd like a few hundred years with 28,000 calling proves that there's not a wall like the wall like it would be a Game of Thrones at the edge of the world father alone completely by myself but I want to share the whole story to my Instagram like share the journey with people Inspire others to do whatever they want to do and accepting like when he's not out there alone he's taking pictures was like the film crew as I guys have you never heard of tripod start so basically food and fuel with the main the main weights people I called my project The Impossible first that's what I named the project because several people at the right right there and you're dragging this big ass heavy sled yeah yeah dude people some people try this year's saying if it was possible and then the last year some really experienced polar explorers have given it a shot and one guy actually died less than a hundred miles from the fine because of lack of nutrition and then some challenges with the weather and things like that but people called it in a few after that way like it's impossible the reason people thought it was impossible because you can't get resupplies meaning if you feel your sled with food in a certain amount you actually can't drag the slide anymore so the whole math equation really was figuring out just how much food and fuel I could put in a sled the fuel melts the water to melt the ice into water essentially and that equal to 375 lbs and 2 truth I could pull it first day like I one hour into getting dropped off I'm dropped off completely alone out there in Antarctica plan this project for a year you know and I get dropped off and after about one hour pulling through 275 lb slide through the snow to -25 degrees out I'm crying I'm literally crying and the tears in my goggles are starting to freeze and I'm like oh my God so I pick up my satellite phone I call home to my wife Jenna who also creates and plans all these projects with me and I'm like babe I think we named the project the right thing The Impossible verse yep it looks like it might be an hour into a Thousand Mile Journey pulling a sled told everyone I'm going to do this and I'm already having those doubts pull out but you'll fortunately I was able to get a little bit further that day and 54 days later made it to the end but how far did you get the first today will it's funny cuz we show just show the map actually starts on ice shelf which is basically the Frozen sea ice and there's an edge of that that's sick with a continent starts inside of a waypoint on my GPS that marks that to the plane that drops me off actually I'm out on the ice shelf before the continents start to my first Waypoint was kind of like the actual start until 1 hour and I haven't even hit the real start it when I call her on the phone she's like cuz she knows the rap she's like what how far are you from the first Waypoint which is where the actual started like it's .63 more like get to the first Waypoint you know she was like okay okay so I got to the first Waypoint and I finally got him at 10 night and I took a deep breath I think I was just overwhelmed by the magnitude of it I mean imagine being a speck in the middle of Antarctica alone he's crazy temperatures in all the excitement but fears of the journey ahead and 375 lb of my back when the sleds you know when the snow is deep to a loose snow makes 375 lb even even heavier than if it's like light Fino icier Consolidated so yeah it was it was a rough start to say the least did you do any sort of test run pulling the sled anywhere else yasso the training none of it was pretty cool so I just what I actually said a few other world records previous to this in the mountains and things we could talk about if you want but the the last year's I really committed to this project I decided to obviously start training specifically for this I need to put on about 20 lb of muscle I'm usually 6ft 165 pretty Leonid racetrack lawn professionally for number years and realize I needed to be a bit bigger cuz I was going to lose so much weight and I found an amazing coach in Portland Oregon where I live the sky Mike mccastle I don't know if you've ever heard of him but I know you've had you got David Goggins on your show take it so Mike actually surpassed David's pull up record Mike did 5804 pull ups in 20 hours I think August about 4,000 what you're both insane to me cuz I can do like another thousand and he was a 30 pound weight vest to 5000 f****** chin-ups with a weight vest on to that Bailey to do 10 all right there with you like iOS or not I've got some other physicals Drake's but the pull up department is not not my strong suit across Death Valley oh my God you got the guy found the guy was like this is the guy you feel like such a p**** I do it so anyways my training he would he was the guy went to him train out of this gym in Portland where where he trains out of and he just he got me bigger he got me stronger but he also did all sorts of badass crazy stuff I mean this a physical challenge but it's more of a mental Challenge and everything so he had me you know my hands in ice buckets doing planks to get my heart rate jacked up and then maybe I can get out of the water when I pull my hands out of the ice buckets do you not be a seated squat against the wall but then he would hand me Legos and so my hands my feet are in ice buckets down a plank my heartrate ca-190 he's like put this Lego set together so the dexterity of my fingers the mental acuity dependent. he's the man but like this crazy training he came up with for me that was like the ice though the water the mental acuity all of this was like he was like yo you're going to be in Antarctica if your tent blows away when you're boiling it up your debt like the stakes are that high 50 60 mile-per-hour winds absolutely crazy is out 50 mile per hour winds it's pretty gnarly but yeah I mean there was one time when the 10 almost a blow if maybe there's this one there's one other one this is me getting into tent looking like an absolute disaster what I get help with audio but that's me that's me so hard to get the tent up I didn't know if I was going to go to get up or I was going to have to keep walking so it is about -25 - 30 in Antarctica like I said when the wind jacks up the other cook meat Center because you had to see that it's you know it's about Kimmy about - 80 outside which it's hard to wrap your mind around that but I try to put it in perspective by saying I can take a cup of boiling water and throw it in there and immediately turns ice like that's that's that's what temperature would dealing with yeah this is me trying to keep the temple together usually have someone else to hold on to it but I'm alone I'm completely alone out there so this is me struggling with my tent just trying to keep it up I've got it you know tied down to my sled there I'm just battling battling the winds in the state like I said the stakes are high fat boys I don't have a spare time I've got no extra weight in my at my sled to hold their stuff so it's it's it's do-or-die quite literally in a moment like that of a patch kit I had a couple things are kind of sewing kit a patch kit stuff like that but if it 10 itself or the temples you no more pretty-much the flat-earth room group near the ice-wall know it was basically I had to keep the batteries were my kingdom right against my skin so I keep the batteries right against my skin my body weight would keep it warm in the second I want to take it out I pulled out real quick hit play and then it would be no usually last a minute or third enough to get a little clip or something like that you couldn't just let it run but then it would be no completely freeze even a full battery would be 120 battery by pretty quickly using solar panels to charge it cool thing about Antarctica at that time of year is it's 24 hours of daylight and so the Sun never sets so even when I might in the middle the night I'm asked your plugs a kind of pretend like it's night time but 24 hours a day lights do solar panels keeping everything charge cameras phone batteries all that and are you traveling with are you using GPS yeah so I had some way points of the GPS waypoints that kind of LED my path to the South Pole excetera but most actually using a compass so I'd look at my GPS maybe once every week or I like that because of bearing the juice fracture is actually it's easier to be so high they actually had like a harness on front of me that would have my GPS or my my compass kind of off my chest when I left because someone Cooks we saw the sun's out but actually more than half of the time the clouds would come in so be just complete and utter whiteout I couldn't even see one step in front of me and so I actually have to just stare down at my compass keep it on this bearing and so imagine you can't see anything can't see one step in front of you I'm pulling a 300-pound sled 1213 Verde not listening to anything really dead silence and just staring at this Compass bearing all day long so I mean the mental side of it was by far the most interesting side of it for me and I have a lifelong endurance athlete but really kind of an exploration into the mind is what it was for me and why was curious about it so spending all this time and silence I've done are you familiar with the pasta meditation PCS exactly but really kind of an exploration into the mind is what it was for me and why was curious about it so spending all this time in silence I've done are you familiar with the Apostle meditation UPS so I've done a couple of these 10 day silent meditation Retreats before this which is 10 days no reading no writing no eye contact kind of drove into that piece of it but 54 days a hundred Antarctica and complete silence was was next level of that for sure</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I have like a country that has 12 million people following that's a lot of people following me my Brasilia sorghum I got like 1.5 million people people people are very active social media to connect with people personally have to look at you m*********** I guess I got a story on the New York Times then crazy New York Times magazine seeing you the most influential person on Twitter that's incredible and what were they saying you're the most influential what were you what were you doing that was influencing people I have no idea I was surprised Monday 2nd Place the Dalai Lama strength in Brazil because people like to connect you have you have everything in the top of this page is just something that is there so I lost a lot of power in Brazil but one thing that is happening right now is our new president and we have a new president now that is a right-wing guy was just elected and he got stabbed he was like it was like 2 months ago maybe she's trying to do with reader with Trump did well he's doing here like run instead of going to press conferences and then everything you just going through there and see what he wants in the way people just use it to insult people and still angry it's so angry like if you just only if you didn't know anything about people and you just looked on Twitter and just like this so how we like when people must be fighting in the streets it must be just a bloodbath out there if you really thought that people interacted in the real world the way they do on Twitter he would think that everywhere is his weapons and clubs and finish it running people over cars and wishing everyone dies but I think then there's a difference and I think they have to Lawless that there's a difference between your behavior on the web and outside of them sometimes you don't realize that it was always it's a distorted lens that you could see humans through not how people really are and it's also it's not a healthy way to communicate because you don't worry about what the person thinks about what you're saying you're saying things that you don't necessarily even really mean cuz you're trying to be inflammatory you know just to catch some of things everything to me someone say something shity to me I'll go to their page and I see they're just saying shity things all day long like kind of life is this man since lucky terrible life what I'm doing right now I have the series that I'm the one instagram where I just I get like the guy cursing me or sing some s*** about me and I just show his face and it's enough and it's funny because it's it's funny Indiana football team roles and then told his face it's enough for you to see all that you don't have to take things too serious because if you take a look up their wives it's you can see why they are so mad yeah there's there's a lot of that most of them have private accounts like you can't look at their pictures they're hiding their hiding who they are they just talk s*** in the comments I should I am bro chance Electro blindshot reporting crimes reporting corruption it's just a new thing and this what we were talking about earlier with social media being so recent in human history there's never been anything where you could just talk to the whole world and do it from your phone while you're sitting at a red light you could say something there's a story about this woman was named Justine Sacco without the woman's name who grew who said something racist and went to a plane gas LOL so she was f***** up on Ambi and she was or Xanax or Ambien I forget what it was she was she was on some sort of Psych medication and something that affects your brain and drank too she had a couple of drinks just thought she was being funny and then wakes up 16 hours later in African or life is over people just jumped on that tweet and the thing about it too is that they don't want you to recover from something like that they want that's that's you that rest of your life that's what I felt that's what I felt I'm the baby f*****</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's completely different service can I ask when you're doing interviews at the end of fights and somehow no no no no no that I hope the fighters realize is that what I'm trying to do is only get them to express themselves I want them to shine I really genuinely want them they won this big fight I want I want them to express themselves I want them to maximize their marketing the marketability and dislike tell the world how they feel but that's a credibly unusual experience to win a big fight in the cage on pay-per-view in front of millions of people but my goal is only to try to get them to communicate better and to let them know that I'm there to support them that's all I'm ever trying to do you know ya before before we start what they do for a living which is the way of speaking they come from one other state which is very hard to understand what they saying from Curitiba right people waiting for you to understand that much but I think he got some some injuries and she was like getting knocked out with flaps that's the scariest thing is when you see their chin go when their ability to take apart with craziest Shogun seems to be making a Resurgence crazy amazing the first one talented is Gaius but if he was. He will kick his ass so he just that's the way they do it in the shoebox they like to fight what sugar is like learning you can see that he's like improving steam Peruvian like I think it's like $36 for his last fight you look Sensational I mean you look like a f****** killer to fight some tough fights but his last fight he looked as good as he's looking years it's it's sad for me when I see like I don't know why spider getting his ass speak to Quick his fight with son and that was that was he was physically capable the same way in and out that you're unbelievably talented it when he when he got on top of Voice new Smash and I most like oh yeah sorry to watch but that's the life I chose you just got knocked out by Tito Ortiz if that was hard to watch do knockout loss is one of things it's very becomes a parent is their balance looks off and their movement doesn't look the same like their neurology there they don't nobody doesn't move his other way I can look the same but I react the same right tough fight for him at any point is career cuz stylebender is just fantastic super technical but Anderson looked like he was a step behind Anderson of old like the Anderson that knocked out Vitor the Anderson that you know you go back to the early days Anderson that knocked out Chael Sonnen and that Anderson was a f****** he was just an assassin he was so good he just knew what to do and when to do it and when the stylebender fight just looked like he was a little off but he's also 46 ultimate Beastmaster which is a million Netflix Terry Crews do we do we do like all holes from different countries and we meet and it's like American Ninja Warrior for Netflix and they have like hoes from different countries and we have the Brazilians than the Italians and the French guys in there and I didn't show it and they're so he's a sweet guy he's great God I mean he's one of the all-time greats I mean I had the honor of calling a lot of his fights and it's crazy because yeah and it's crazy when you're talkin about the got the guys getting older I remember I thought talk with me no Toro give me any money so just let me lose the fight or two and get some money at the end of every year because I deserve that he was going there to win but it's like I want to take the risk in Japan thousand dollars and now that the game is like bringing you so much when I'm going to retire let me just do a couple more Not only was he a Pioneer and one of the great MMA heavyweights of all time but he's so important for MMA because he showed that heavyweights can fight off their back and then heavy ways to win by triangle Equity triangle Mark Holman and was tapping guys with iron bars and he beat Bob Sapp 375-pound Bob Sapp minotauro only if I weigh 230 and he want a penny with an armbar his head would still apparently f**** wasn't his date his neck was f***** up printer because of that yes I didn't know that 375 lb guy who doesn't even look like a human he looks like a like a comic book you have they smashed his head and Minotaur old recovered and I mean he was one of the toughest guys of all together but she was history of sport and then I think Fabricio took it to another level cuz Fabricio Werdum probably has the best guard in the history of the sport is for history the heavyweight division mean when you caught fade or when he had him in his triangle and have them locked up like that you don't get away with that guy like you you might get out of some people's guard not Fabricio that m*********** locked people up Baker Brothers and now he's a great guy and that's what I want. That's why I asked you is it you kind of feel threatened because when people get there and when you go over there to talk to me when you can see a wrong thing at the wrong I don't know that you can make mistakes you sure but my intention is always to just to make them look good that's all I'm trying to do is just get them to express themselves and also make mistakes you sure blew my mind tension is always to just to make them look good. That's all I'm trying to hook up I'm trying to do is just get them to express themselves and end and also put some emotion to how great their performance was perfect but it's a weird job you know to also be a comedian you know it's a strange combination</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we doing stand-up and you started to get in some trouble for Ferb it's a lot of trouble a lot of your how much travel a lot of money I spend a lot of money lost a lot of you know I got this really in trouble it was because of a singer it was she was a singer and that kind of career comedians can say and what they cannot say are you allowed to feel fandon and now there's like law schools talks about the lawsuit that I had law school discussion discussion without casualties yet because he was a shity joke play I will send you something just like you with meeting anymore if you wanted the greatest comedians ever if they called there's Doctor Dolittle my friend asked know she's pregnant and do you think she's still hot then I said she was so hot that I was booked her in her baby and so that was this whole thing the TV show Lost sponsors and they want to suspend me from the TV show because of a job that I did she didn't tell they didn't tell me to apologize but he suspended me so I quit the show didn't know so you just apologize and I decided not to apologize because I felt it was important for me to life with my feet if we stop back right now what am I what am I going to do in like 2 years just for all of us so I lost lawsuit Alice movies it's okay to sue you to go to walk to lose a lawsuit is that the problem I lost like $150,000 or $350,000 I sold if you're a lawyer and get $10,000 a month you get 10,000 yeah I have also because of these like a rape joke and I got like this women movement like trying to break break into my bar and break my the daughter of my comedy club and there was like that was that was that was huge in Brazil is it the same way we have the First Amendment do you have something that we do we don't have that we don't have that I had Mike Ward on in Canada do you know his story yeah I know he's a guy he made a joke about a sick boy that the boy was still alive you know what the other I thought it was just a bad joke about this guy still being alive and can he get his money back cuz like cuz they donated money is it supposed to be inappropriate and that's the art form he got sued and he's still in the process of it right now there's another case in Vancouver where these women were heckling they were yelling things out during the show and then the comedian went on stage and berated the women and then the women sued and won cuz they were lesbians and he made some lesbian jokes about them at their own expense and so then they took him to court and they want and they want what they want some judgment or he had to pay them I wanted to what was it I want to say is somewhere in the neighborhood of $30,000 30000 gentleman this comedian I think that was a lot of money I do 40 to $42,000 and that's a lot of money for opening comedian famous guy so you know that might be two years work I feel when I do comedy here and I feel that's people get uncomfortable about a joke or two that's when I get stressed like you have the free space yes I have this drug that I say it is about the n-word maybe I have to change my do wolves live in the other day follow the way of giving it away and yeah it's crazy you a lot and I see a lot of people here this guy didn't want to be with you and he did show in a college and a joke and people took him out play Tony and colleges though today and I'm going to call them children they do not understand the danger in suppressing free speech and so they think that what they're doing is by suppressing free speech and changing the way people communicate what they're doing is making the world a better place they think they're they're signaling The Virtue and making the world a better place at the same time but it's just ignorant so just don't understand but you can't you can't necessarily you can't troll people and to think that by just getting upset and silencing someone in removing them from the stated that ends the conversation it doesn't it reinforces their position it says okay look I was right about you f****** Snowflake and eat it you little babies like you you can't even understand when things are uncomfortable but it doesn't necessarily mean it's negative and that like you're like try to put yourself in someone's position do what he saying it's actually kind of funny he's very open mind very Progressive he's not in any way of racist and his joke was that people say that being gay is a choice and he said I know it's not a choice cuz I have a friend who's black and gay and is no way he would choose both of those things experienced racism it's very fascinating to see young kids who are growing up in this PC culture bubble and you don't sometimes people say on this podcast we talked about it too much and maybe their correct maybe sometimes it's annoying if you're listening you cubicle and you hear me talking too much about this but it's because it's an issue that's very dear to my heart cuz I understand the dangers of not being able to communicate freely and I also understand what happens when if you suppress free communication the people that you're suppressing they're going to get more and more angry and radical and it just makes their position that they they feel more Justified and perhaps even people who are racist could perhaps be more racist or people who are angry about gay people will become more angry about if you suppress their ability to express himself in a movement what is forbidden weapon case you cannot give them the power that they didn't have I think so and I think this is something that we really just getting to understand now you know I have ever had a few conversations about this recently with the head of Twitter and with an independent journalist Tim pool last week and I think what people are just starting to kind of understand even though everyone's uncomfortable about this is we're still trying to figure this out social media is only 10 plus years old this is an incredibly new experience for us and I don't think everybody knows exactly how to proceed and this idea that you could just ban people and I just ban people for life if they say something that makes people uncomfortable if they say an opinion that you don't agree with ban them for life and we're we're experiencing that right now and we're trying to figure out what to do and how to how to fix this and how to mitigate it without endorsing people harassing people in the door so people you know threatening people and giving out their address and a phone number and things going on so it's it's a process that we're all going through right now brasas for the the whole country but the thing that annoys annoys me a little bit is that I I leave in another country and I see how things are difficult and how much time I spend explaining people what I was doing and for you guys like I was having the same problems that Lenny Bruce because that's the way they build the ward evolved but at the same time he feels old if it was all because you understand the history of it feels old because the media the certainly people that are being effective with it but in stand-up comedies there's blowback and push back but it's not very effective like for the top guys for guys like Dave Chappelle and in a Bill Burr it's actually makes their stand up better cuz people are so tired of all this s*** they're so tired of PC culture they're so tired of being told what they should and shouldn't think is funny and what is acceptable not acceptable and now there's a there's a comedies there's blowback and push back but it's not very effective like for the top guys for guys like Dave Chappelle and in a Bill Burr it's actually makes their stand up better cuz people are so tired of all this s*** there so tired of PC culture so tired of being told what they should and shouldn't think is funny and what is acceptable not acceptable and yeah there's a there's a lot of weird s*** going on right now</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> boom could we have some technical so anyway brother welcome to say it again because the people didn't hear it you you're one of the pioneers of stand-up comedy in Brazil four or five guys and nobody knew about stand-up something that I found out when I came here to leave and play basketball I had a scholarship to play basketball and I watched Jim Gaffigan and Brian Regan we was kind of weird but at the same time it was interesting because I'm not a guy who those characters and I do observe Asians and I ride it was a journalism degree in journalism was interesting for me to see those guys win, tonight I thought we could do the same it's so crazy that it took that long for it to get to Brazil yeah you would think that because everything else usually I took a long time and I don't know why but the image of a comedian speaking like with a Blazer or something with Jerry Seinfeld when we saw there was a lot of people doing all their stuff and you that was like this huge role that we could actually explore that was when become interesting for us so comedy in Brazil they would basically be like like say if I was a Brazilian comedian I would come up with a fake name and I would do it character outfit this is like a popular Fourth of the people stand up I'm not saying that is for everyone not have my Netflix special week is becoming shoes because we have some other options right now with internet everything changed the game Chase completely so we have what is good has is old space right now is Not only was the TV wants you to watch it so the game changed a little for help for all of us so how did you start out did you start out by going to music clubs or USI actually starting a BDSM Club Damian's in a joke sense of irony and sarcasm we wish we was something that people wasn't watching but then he becomes a huge we got chances to go to TV and everything else but at first it was difficult because people do not understand is he character is he playing a Bard so that's why I had and I still have a lot of problems with the law because I can joke I'm so over this over the line but he was like this he does this guy wants people to be rated what what is what is good thinking what is because all those drugs was taken out a countess and put in the newspapers and accused say some s*** out of context and then guide like nothing f****** like millions of klicks on their website they did so they knew that this was a new thing they and then so they would come to see it and then what would they criticizing it before this he was he was cute everybody loved it a Tree hours funny and TV shows and we kind of ran away out 360 order at midnight in Brazil that was my thing I underground some following the middle nowhere but then people prepare for what I was doing at the time what kind of laws do you have in Brazil in terms of like the language you allowed to use on television censorship about what you can say what you cannot say but sponsors and and even TV stations and the media is very sensitive about everything because you're like we have a lot of people that don't understand that all this is, do you want one west west comedy so it was my duty to explain a little bit while we stand up in Conifer open a road for all of us that's how I felt so you and you said three others like three or four guys are so who are these other guys was that a feeling it was a small group of guys that would start building in Brazilian Portuguese such a beautiful language I love it I love it's like a song that's like it's such a cool sound but sometimes sometimes you say it like damn but it's come so that's funny cuz like that's like the word s*** like s*** could be like you could look at some Gosha with a beautiful body what is s*** can also be bad you know like a f*** to like f*** could be good or f****** be bad like you could stop your tongue go f*** or you could even see a girl with a beautiful body</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Civil War but let me clarify like I don't I'm not saying cuz I brought this up before I'm not saying it's going to be like you know eighteen-hundreds to Big battlefields but at the same time when people don't seem to realize when it comes to history is that when you read about World War II we've condensed all the highlights into a very short paragraph or series of paragraphs you do realize the years they were periods where nothing happened right I was in Egypt during the second revolution you could look down and you could see Taqueria Square people screaming laser pointers helicopters Apaches announcing the news we've we've depose the president two blocks away I do is eating a cheeseburger McDonald's watching football match as if nothing's happening so when you look at the street battles the political violence when you look at the bias Bannings you look at the dude there was a guy who fired up around that a police officer in Eugene Oregon then some bombs got planted the police department or somebody planted bombs in a statue in Houston it starts to feel like there's some kind of political violence edit bubbling up that can't be mended at this point comes from the suppression that were talking about people don't feel like they have a voice or that voice is being suppressed by an opposing ideologies you know yes but it is really complicated it's it's I can't claim to know how everything happens but what I will say is I believe social media is responsible for the political violence I believe it's not just about depression it's you look at the systems that were built Facebook right what content can make it to the front page of your Facebook page of your Facebook profile when you're looking Facebook has to build an algorithm to determine what matters most companies then figure out how to manipulate the algorithm to get that content in front of you because you're not most you can see what three posts on Facebook so what happens is early on companies quickly found out that anger drives the most shares any emotion all of a sudden we see a wave of police brutality videos there was one website that posted almost exclusively police brutality content and it was like Alexa 400 in the world some ridiculously high number blew my mind I knew someone claims to the door making six figures writing police brutality articles because it was pure radiate right easily but that content constantly being put in front of somebody breeds and ideology you then tell someone did you know that you know white supremacy is on the rise and there are 11 million white supremacists in the US and they don't like him believe it but that's nonsense it's just not just not the case we believe that there is like that the president is secretly a Nazi and that he's being propped up by the secret cabal or less about ternative influence Network on YouTube where you and me or somehow trying to convince people to either this is ridiculous with the same thing what was it called data and Society be connected with people it's the so schizophrenic the way it's drawn out the little map where one person connected to another person to what I said to her I said Barbara Walters interview Fidel Castro does that make her communist this is a crazy way to look at things like that that's just completely fake it's not my name like my name in the middle right you know me you can call me to tell you that if they don't do it and get them Facebook recently changed their algorithm I don't know what this was awhile ago they may have changed again but it was a huge hit to the incomes of a lot of these companies when all of a sudden news article stop appearing as much because Facebook wanted friends and family to be more connected unless oh news organizations write this viral clickbait and rage content working as much traffic swear that you know that to go crazy you know and so it's a downward spiral of where these journalists to follow each other they start producing I don't I don't think it's a conspiracy to produce the stuff I think they're hired specifically because the content they produce is viral viral for a reason right and so the more they produce at the more they eat their own you know excrement essentially and then it's a game of telephone where they're sitting in a circle constantly telling each other things that gets crazier and crazier but another aspect of it is when they write an article saying you know Trump is racist it goes viral the next day they can't read some article Trump is the most racist the next day after bed to keep one-upping it and it can we talked about this with Forbes articles the term nasty surprise they use it with tech like they'll say the new Galaxy S10 has a nasty surprise the new iPhone 10 has a nasties broadcast keep saying it's hilarious it's almost like there's a form letter and they just whatever Xbox stick it in there now to surprise and it's it's 100% clickbait And it's Forbes and will you telling me that Forbes that was essentially as it's like use your contributions yeah get approved but there's a lot article that just get written about like the new video game today so take a clickbait title yeah it's almost like they have like a pattern that they just accepted is going to work but it's not a conspiracy it's just like minded people who are only ever around each other sharing the same things among each other but leaving all the same things and so you'll notice that certain words emerge specifically among certain groups you know like the left will you certain words and then if like learn-to-code doesn't appear that much and left-wing rhetoric but if the conservatives and the anti data tarian types understand what it is and so justification for Banning someone learn to code regardless of the contacts insane. Since it seems like you got one in particular is almost into Phentermine not almost that's indefensible absolutely like there's been people who are absolutely there was a lot of Venezuelan accounts that were banned and people read critical I saw Abby Martin was with criticizing this cuz they accused him of being government actors cuz they were Pro Venezuelan government but the most the one thing there's some Occupy Wall Street activists to Absolute test me they lie about me I do not like them for doing this they were banned abruptly for literally no reason and this is what more worrisome to me is that no one defended them knowing defended them because conservative certainly won't but neither will the mainstream you know ideological left these are activists for class issues for international issues there on the left squarely and they were accused of being Bots or something just it was just an Abrupt Purge of like 50 accounts and some of them were like Independence just wiped out and with no recourse no recourse now that that's over so yeah I mean at some point you have to realize how important Twitter is when the president is on it could you imagine if there was a physical space where where I was talkin and the president shows up and everyone keeps yelling at them and they're all talking because you had that lawsuit where they said it was a public forum imagine that happens and then a private private individual bars you from hearing with the president has to say right it's a complicated issue you know if you get a lot of people in Alexa and private businesses can do whatever they want that blew my mind because the left was usually about not letting massive multinational billion dollar corporations get away with surprising speech but that was another thing that people get pissed at me about Jack Dorsey and rightly so that he said that it's a human right that the alien kit online is human but the fact that he said it but yet always be poor band so write how would like to take away someone's human right there should be an agreed example mean it should be something quite meaning doxing someone like calling for violence like trying anybody but even then but clearly that's not the case if Kathy Griffin still online hold on you can kill a human being and get 25 years right good point so you can literally strip someone of their of their yes everything and still no be purged this post podcast I would really like to see if there's some sort of a path to Redemption like a you know for example for Milo mean like we talked about yesterday about Christian piccolini who was a white supremacist who realizes error of his ways and then became this activist Against Racism and now he gives me Ted speeches and him you know why I accepted by everyone as being this guy who's achieve Redemption and really understands the air if my husband for Life miles only like 34 years old right how old is Milo around there I hope I didn't make him older than he is probably mad but whatever it is like who's to say that Milo you know in three years from now won't have a change of heart or you know have a f****** acid trip or something to make like a different person but if you're banned for life are we always throwing people away tweet from I'm going to say I think it was Tyler the Creator where's that how is cyberbullying real just you know like close your eyes outside going I'm sorry man you want to ban hate speech I can understand I am no fan of a speech I think it's wrong I think you shouldn't know Target people for specific characteristics we should respect one another at the same time I'm also a human adult who understands sometimes people are mean you ever walked that you're going to let you know Subway in Los Angeles and some guy starts calling you all the names in the book we can do about it nothing that's just life people are mean sometimes I think you shouldn't your target people for for specific characteristics we can respect one another at the same time I'm also a human adult who understands sometimes people are mean you ever walked that you're going to let you know Subway in Los Angeles and some guy starts calling you all the names in the book we can do about it nothing that's just life people are mean sometimes they cross the line</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and then you know what it was a label that was put on the Proud boys almost immediately right at their white supremacist even though there was people of color that were amongst the ranks and what they change the definition of racist know what the hole origin of The Proud boys has to do with him and and Gavin McGinnis Gavin McGinnis came up with it because of a guy that work there and they were doing it as a goof yeah and then it became a move and then became like anybody can join in the people that join they they took it into a radical way and then it became looking to beat up antifa and it's like f*** will Gavin's cross the line you know there is no point for your you mentioned Media Matters in a recent do you know that you're talking about Alex Jones I wouldn't use them as a source for anything that doesn't matter they Gavin McInnes where you can hear him saying these crazy things and your life will he said it right but it turns out some of the clutches like my dogs they make me do you really can't take the contacts out of things and these clips I understand what happens if in my videos I don't quote people anymore because people have taken me reading a newspaper and a tribute to me simply for reading someone else's quote and nobody said it that is a hilarious story and they told him contacts didn't matter so when he leaves the courtroom the reporter says you said this phrase when I'm not going to say and he says it's up to you if contact doesn't matter where I should be arrested too you know so so end up happening is these activist groups they take these quotes out of context but but admittedly I think that's fair to point out a lot of people recognize Gavin if it you can assume they were jokes or not doesn't matter if he said things that were over the borderline the main problem indefensible problem was the call the calling calling for violence and I don't think gallons like he's another one is like a pranksters I got punk rock style prankster and he likes to Burn It To The Ground yep and look I'm a fan of Gavin's interviews on YouTube where you kill he Hoodwinked people and is sitting down and talking to him or I don't even know if they're still out anymore but my life and figuratively if she was a left-wing individual he even though he was he asked you to come on and her friends basically just this about her immediately because she was talking to him because she sounded an unintelligent I don't know if you have this issue but for the longest time it's it's it's substantially harder to interview someone on the ideological left than anyone else right so I recently reached out to a few night I regularly work at people cuz I don't want to drag people but weeks trying to organize a meeting with some of these personality progressives on the left we really even even people who like that message from people saying yeah man I watch herself all the time but hold on let me let me think about it and talk to some people first I'm not saying they're doing it because they are you know skittish or it's just harder it's a lot harder when they're probably more cautious especially if you know what you're where your ideology stand is ambiguous so they're trying to figure it out oh yeah if you know even even David David sometimes people on Twitter calling them all weird or intellectual dark web Jimmy Dore is an interesting character I really like that, he's such an interesting guy he's very smart but he's not he's like he's an angry Lefty but you know like buddy defense rain gear outside of the interview of course really all that surprising and then we start talking and I said how you feel about these people dressed in all black and you know are fighting people and causing problems all that's terrible as I get it you think so really it's actually I'm surprised because often when people wearing you know fully mashed up with communist stuff they're typically in favor of the by any means that you have by any means necessary strategies and he was like no way man that's wrong I don't like you don't then I don't care I don't care if you're whatever as long as I've known for carrying who thinks you have the right to beat other people to instill your ideology on them or use manipulative force or coercion or extortion like so let me let me let me let me talk about what I think what we're seeing with Twitter might be one of the biggest problems ever Twitter YouTube Facebook or where we exist socially politically it's where ideas are exchanged it's where we learn about who we're going to vote for why we won't vote for somebody when you ban somebody you Exile them are we exist socially politically it's where ideas are exchanged it's where we learn about who we're going to vote for a while we won't vote for somebody when you ban somebody you Exile them they're no longer part of that conversation so they're very much so told you are outside city the city walls right you can't come in you can't talk to us there's nothing you can do about it but anyway when you realize the rules are actually bent the other slanted in a certain direction you can then predict where things are going</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yes you do black people people one was very very weird there was looking for a reeny here's the other part of it you know what he ultimately got in trouble air quotes for was him talking about the positive experiences that he had as a young man being molested cuz I think it still on YouTube cuz it was it Breitbart the left fire equip Breitbart you know I see all these journalists saying like Milo is gone Milo is whining and he's no more I'm like dude got like six million followers across his Instagram is YouTube in his Facebook he posts all the time he's on the public conversation as much as he was before because they've got through them I like a Lifeline I'm talking about you but here's my point he's not saying that men should go have sex with younger boys who was basically saying that it could be a positive experience it was for him I don't want to think about what happened in that capacity was if I said when I was 13 a 21 year old girl fondled me do you think I get in trouble if I said it was awesome but I wouldn't know my brother was pointing out cuz of Law &amp; Order SVU is basically on 24/7 like 98% of episodes will never about women never about men being with him sometimes they are but he was like I just realized that and I was like I think it's fairly obvious a lot of people like you mentioned if you said it nobody would care but mine was gay until it becomes you know something for him yes yeah yeah it's some we need some kind of clear guidelines right where are you can operate inside these guidelines and all's Fair it's just I mean to be allowed to operate you don't even think so I'll tell you I'll tell you something after this is over and we'll find out if it's about something but you know it's on there see you in a bit list I don't know exactly when it happened I think Campbell was on The Man Show he dressed like a basketball player and Jimmy Fallon just like Chris Rock Jesus did it I think she addressed it though everybody nobody loses their minds nobody loses their minds over that because they're on the left you think I don't know I don't know honestly I would say that's probably some kind of trouble basketball player emojis and Jimmy Fallon just like Chris Rock Jesus Sarah Silverman did it I think she address it though everybody nobody loses their minds nobody loses their minds over that because they're on the left you think I don't know I don't know honestly I would say to an extent that's probably some kind of trouble by us the high school yearbooks from 55 year old people if you lost the plot of Lost</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> go on on free will makes you much more forgiving of a lot of the stuff you see just everyone is an open system no one offered themselves no one created themselves no one no one can directly regulate the effect of every influence that they had or didn't have it was like it you are the totality of what brought you here the universe is sorta just pushed you to this point in time and the only thing you've got is your brain and its states and that is that is based on your genes and the totality of environmental influences use you as a system have have had working on you up until this moment and so the next words that come out of your mouth are part of that process now some people find this to be a frankly demoralizing picture by the time you're telling me to tell me I'm just a robot but you're a robot that is open continuously open to influence influence of internally based on its own processes and it's like there's top-down control of unity of function in the brain to your your emotional life say and you're continually open to the influences of culture right now the other cultures is assistant that you're interacting within each moment and whatever is getting in can change you in radical ways very quickly there's no telling how much you can change on the basis of one new idea coming your way right I know I would argue that the that process of change and if I say something that changes your view on anything that's not evidence of free will that is evidence of just more causality I mean if I get you to see something that you didn't see before you're not responsible for the fact that you didn't see in a moment before and you're not responsible for the fact that you now see it is just like the Domino's just kept falling right but it does give you this far more patient sense of one just it just have created this odious Behavior in the world right like like you can everything on some level is more of a force of nature then it is something that you need to take personally so I guess there's a hurricane blowing outside we don't respond to it the same way we would respond to you know al-qaida and dropping a bomb on us right through you might in Mike made the same amount of damage but in the latter case where we have an identifiable identifiable agent right we feel like an hour in the presence of Hugh evil and we have to go kill these m************ right now we may have to kill them right because that may be the only way of putting out this this stopping the damage they are committed to causing but and we would kill hurricanes if we could kill them right and we would do you know we would nullify them but the feeling we have in both cases is very different the feeling you have attributing ultimate authorship to a person's behavior is super narrow psychologically and ethically and it's you know the feeling of Vengeance right like like you don't you don't you haven't you this feeling of engine to so natural to get triggered in response to a person it's not natural in response to a wild animal who may have done something terrible writing me like you would like examples of this where people have taken Vengeance on animals and it just looks like a kind of moral turn on the part of the people who did it is a famous picture of a an elephant that got hung from a railroad crane I think back in the twenties right side like a visit to the circus elephant escaped and it ran you know Rampage to the streets and trampled let you know a few people and the and the people in the in the town I don't know where this was as a Baltimore someplace or so outraged that they've decided to Lynch the elephant right like and yet that's there's something uncanny about that to the misappropriation of agencies and what what is it what is a mistreated circus elephant going to do when it gets out and is terrified and trying to get away from people so we have a very different set of books we keep ethically for humans and some of it's understandable some of its inevitable but a lot of it gives us more illusions that we don't need to have and it gives it gives us a kind of just an inability to take stock of all the variables that are actually guide in human behavior and react to them and mitigate them and disincentivize them intelligently and Punishment make sense not because people really really deserve at bottom whatever their punishments are it doesn't make sense in a in a record retributive Paradigm it makes sense if it if it's the best tool to discourage dangerous behavior and it works right so it's like you know over things I can't control well that's stupid right because if you eat as much as you punish them that you're not going to you're not going to moderate the behavior they have to punish the people for things that are actually under voluntary control and it only it only makes sense if it's the only tool to do the job and if the moment you hadn't brought this up last time we spoke about free will but this is really that's what a reductio certain of it where most people are on this topic the moment we really understand human evil at the level the brand Emily understand psychopathy so maybe that's not the totality of evil but certainly Center the bullseye that's governed by genes and environment and we can we can actually intrude at the level the brain to mitigate it to like disease and injuries syndrome right that we can fix unless it's a very simple fix I'll save the pill right besides just a neurotransmitter imbalance in the presence of that breakthrough we will feel very differently about that species of human evil we will not judge it in the same way will it because what will happen is you'll give people the pill and they'll say f*** I can't believe I was that dangerous a****** like thank you for like like I I'm as horrified by who I was before you cured me as you were right and it is so so so suck psychopathy in the presence of a cure for it would look much more like diabetes than it looks like evil in the present case and people aren't imagining what it would like it would be like to be there what it would be like to actually fully understand the under underlined neurophysiology here and actually have something that means there's no guarantee we'll be able to to deal with it in a simple way but it's certainly possible and I mean the classic example is just you like the Charles Whitman example where you have a brain tumor that's causing this aberrant behavior in that case everyone everyone sees okay this is not evil this is a brain tumor. C Tower shooter gas and so but in the same way that a brain to tumors exculpatory there I think a full understanding of the the punchline neurology would be Excel pittore again it doesn't mean you in the meantime before you before we get there we obviously we have to lock up dangerous people if there's no way to to help them but the more we see the causes the more we review this in terms of just sheer bad luck right like there are there people who when they're adults are quintessentially evil who we who and they provoke the Great feeling of Vengeance from us but if you just walk back there timeline you recognize it as they were four years old at one point right they were the four-year-old who was destined to become this terrible person it's an unlucky four-year-old so at what point where is the bright-line that says okay here's the point where it's appropriate to just hate this person to feel no compassion and it on the other side of this line you should just feel compassion because this person unlucky there is no such line and a complete understanding of this life line in in scientific terms would obliterate any line you think you have right it would just be this Cascade of causation and you do adding random this to the picture doesn't help right it's just a random this is Justina somebody's in your brain rolling Dice and influencing your behavior that way well that's that doesn't give you the free will people think they have so there isn't ironically there what seems on some level deflation Arie of the of the the the gravitas of the human spirit for people opens the door to at least in my view a far more ethical and tolerant and patient and understanding view of of human failings and human Frailty have a conversation about what's pragmatic itworks what helps people change like in this this person over here is doing terrible things is there something we can do to make him a better person well if there is let's do that without all the Judgment wouldn't it be amazing if that's how we treated these public shaming events like wouldn't wouldn't it be amazing if we gave someone an opportunity to say this is this is what I did this is how awful I feel about this I would never do that again I'm a different person that was 20 years ago whatever we have and and have everybody join in hey anyone could be you thank you for being honest about who you are now thank you for evolving thank you for expressing yourself in a way that maybe other people who have also committed really just unsavory or just unfortunate things in the past and Fortune axe in the past day can feel relieved by the fact that you grown and evolved to become a better person and that you're at your a different thing now and you are the product of all of your experiences you're not your this one thing you're not stuck in who you were when you were 16 years old what if you were Marky Mark and you hit that guy with a stick whatever you know whatever he did you know you're not stuck in that spot forever these don't Maradona Scarlet Letter it's going to a mark on your forehead that you keep for Life incident which I find so interesting is that there is a case where and what he's revealing about himself is is pretty amazing rise like it it's like he just decided okay we we need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for who I used to be right now and just volunteered this and for me like I like you know I don't actually understand that State of Mind of the many different states of mind that I can understand it's really understand what it's like to want to harm somebody and you notice feel Vengeance and all that but the instrumental violence piece I don't understand I've never felt like okay type of person wronged me or someone close to me so anytime any person of that type will do right like that but that is such a problem the world over in human history that it is it is just fascinating ethically for someone of his stature to reveal that about himself and he put it in terms of of of honor and it was like I wasn't on and this is what bit is what what is so dysfunctional about honor culture see more in the South than anywhere else in the country and is what you see basically everywhere you go in the Middle East is Justin this is what Islam inculcate to a degree that's fairly unmatched in in its Community this notion of honor is does link up with this tendency to find satisfaction in instrumental violin so I can put but when you when you try to run that software on my brain that just looks like Madness are the idea that any other person will do right of a certain type that's just you know I don't read resumes not at all right and so it's just damn interested in the fact that the lesson being taken from this seems to be this is this should be the end of your career for having talked about this in the way is there some part of the story that I've gotten wrong or not missing or missing but it seemed to me that he was always counting this in the horror and amazement appropriate to the to the disclosure like he can't believe he wasn't happening this state of consciousness and you know it's just an amazing thing to reveal about yourself so yeah and I'm sure he regrets every second of it someone with a lot to lose should be able to say you know how ugly a human mind can be this is an experience I had this is who I was and you know how much I have to live for and how much I have to lose we have to talk about this kind of mania they can get humming on a human brain right right we see this 8 every time you open the paper you see someone in the grip of this kind of thing right it even happened to me right I think it's an amazing we have to talk about this kind of mania they can get humming on a human brain right right we see this 8 every time you open the paper you see someone in the grip of this kind of thing right it even happened to me right I think it's an amazing conversation to start in the fact that the result is just you know and an auto defay is is is the problem we're trying to find a way through it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> saying I got in trouble or one of my podcast guess Gavin de Becker security Guru on my podcast talking about the Primacy of of intuition here like our intuitions are actually really good for detecting something that makes us uncomfortable about another person right and this is this becomes Politically Incorrect really fast right because it is like you know if you see a guy on an elevator who makes you uncomfortable in a Gavin's advice and I think I think the real Saint advice is just don't get on but there many people who get on just because they want to prove they're not racist right or they're not getting so I can and I actually know someone who was in a situation like that and didn't work out well and so maybe intuition is bad for so many things we we have terrible intuitions for statistics and probability theory on the side where do I need a hole Sears &amp; Noble prices have been won on you know who people like you know Danny conoman have shown us how is not only that our intuitions are bad for for these judgments but they're reliably bad and we can understand there's a structure to help out there but for judging people who are dangerous to give us the guy who makes make the hair stand up on the back of your neck for reasons we can't understand near where the eye contact was wrong or the or the or that you're still the way they were little you know what I mean just like I was called a witness check you don't like someone comes up to you and engages you and then they will look to they just look to check for Witnesses right now like that people don't wear that that's even a thing right but when they like that body language is very Salient to us and and there are hundreds of things like that that we immediately feel that the prompt you know an intuitive response and that these are intuitions that are from self-defense point of your worth listening to it cuz the worst case scenario is you wind up being a little rude there but people are people are very dogmatically being trained to ignore those kind of those kind of intuition but when you meet someone you go with those person feels dangerous like what is that what's happening gaze detection is a big one we wait and what people do with their eyes as it is a major variable and just how we feel that you know the relationship is going but it's micro Expressions that we notice in people that we're not aware of noticing you know is not well understood and we're bad judges of whether someone is telling the truth and that's what this has been fairly well studied and their people who and even people work for the FBI or not you know much better than chance and detecting whether somebody is lying but there's just we get so much information by being a body language and being in somebody's present and we get it so fast that it's again and what do we understand you're not their evolutionary reasons why this is so I mean if we evolved for anything as social primates we have evolved to detect stuff that just is a precursor to Violent intent in another's right I think it's just gaze or do you think you could send the energy to someone there certain movements that people make when they're thinking about hitting you oh yeah yeah yeah certain like there's a pulled back ring or a bow like a feeling you get around people that are looking to hit people it would get all of that still Vision but there's you know who knows we're detecting pheromones really am detecting people's level of stress and we just have to end up there but this is beyond just physical violence this is just you know detecting Psychopaths who are manipulative men are there ways to spot people lying images to eat another bite their tails like you know too much information you don't like people who are giving you Superfluous is Superfluous information as if overcorrection they're anticipating that you're going to doubt their story and so they're filling in like blanks that you don't even need filled in right and it ended submitted her patterns to choose her to do that but then again we pick up on a lot of stuff without conscious where it was going on we just know that it's like not a person I want to spend any more time with right but you know so there may be more of a literature on this and then I know about but a lot of this is not well understood and we have people like Paul Ekman have done a lot of stuff on my micro Expressions that goes back probably 30 years at this point and you're there are people who are outliers were great at detecting micro-expressions were they really I really just don't understand what's going on but it's not a jaguar in NAIA eventually will be if it is not there already will be much better than we are doing this I'm so scared of that I'm so scared of them getting that wrong because they remind me of microaggressions which is one of the one of the weird or social justice Warrior things like things used to be just flights were similar just like slightly rude not not even / just like where do you come from right are there already will be much better than we are doing this I'm so scared of that I'm so scared of them getting that wrong because they remind me of microaggressions which is one of the one of the weird or social justice Warrior things like things used to be just flights were someone was just like slightly rude not not even slap just like where do you come from right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what do you think about artificial intelligence and water fish intelligence and Automation and the removal of all these jobs is a real concern that a lot of people have and then the the way to mitigate it that's being bandied about is universal basic income that they would give you a certain amount of money and I think the idea that everyone would get it even wealthy people get it and that would be the only way to make it fair but where the f*** is that money coming from and then what do you think about it I don't I don't think it's feasible at least right now I do believe that on a technological level we will eventually reach a Star Trek kind of future where it's not about communism it's literally like we have scarcely is gone like that replicators I want to come to Universal basic income people need to understand some basic economic principles if everybody gets $1,000 okay that's three hundred million thousand dollars right right but it's not everybody's everybody's working age yes does hydroquinone I want a burger shop I need to hire someone to flip Burgers so I say we pay ten bucks an hour it's I thought I saw a lot but we're small business we can't really afford to pay more than a thousand bucks a month you know if if you know that not really will the ideas that the thousand bucks a month so you get you get to keep and then the other one to ten bucks an hour I don't care where I was when I was when I was 17 18 work for American Eagle Airlines I was looking like 50,000 I was getting ten bucks an hour. Know a whole life so I was certainly a shape but if you get if you told me hey you know how you're making less than a thousand bucks a month working full-time after taxes how about we just give you a thousand bucks I bet you know some positives that people will pursue their passions but hold on how many people do you know want to be Comedians and then a funny thing you're not good at how many people are really good at copying carp pro football players how many people are really good at being teachers but want to be a famous actor so what do you think would be some sort of an appropriate response to Automation and artificial intelligence me you can't just have millions and millions of people just have nowhere meow and that's that's it about this kind of stuff with my friends while they were stoned the philosophical consequences of technological innovation it is not the postmaster's fault that he spent 30 years becoming the best of the best and working the post office that technology emerged that is going to displace him and make him and put him in the Poorhouse when I was about 19 years old I was skateboarding down on Chicago and I saw an old black homeless man and I had some leftover food and I was like hey what's up dude you want some food and I was just like I asked you a question homeless and he said you know what man he's like I think it was like 60 something he said I have a job I worked all day everyday at a family eventually you know my my didn't have kids my friend start to get old and move on I lost touch the bottom some of them died and one day I got told that my job wasn't needed anymore and so I can do anything when I'm playing for a little bit but my you know the job I was good at didn't exist right eye camera calculate 14 years ago but he was like so everywhere I went I said y'all I'll do anything I'll do anything but even this small jobs that pay a little bit to flip Burgers weren't enough to cover my rent after a few months I could I got evicted then because I don't have a place to live I couldn't go to the job I did have sorry sleeping outside and I've been here ever since I'm like I said you know and that's that's that's a sad reality what you do I don't know why I believe in some kind of social policy people vote for sure you know if we have a real Community you would help out the people that are in your community if you don't like the violence are libertarian left on like the libertarian left quadrant are pot-smoking hippies live on farms and Arco Vitamix ton of sense when it's you and your buddies working together on a farm sharing responsibilities it doesn't make sense for a community of 300 million people and you have to trade extremely specific resources to make a computer happen right at that point you need to go to quantify the value of specific objects and that's why communism doesn't work for massive on that scale but I will say when artificial intelligence a different conversation you know people who do the opioid crisis I could be wrong I read that there was a connection between unemployment from these factories getting shut down and depressed dudes popping pills there was a masculinity report was published by Harry's the shaving company and they said the over the overwhelming majority of what contributes to a man's happiness is gainful employment like 80% so what happens when a factory shuts down you got a bunch of young dudes who want to do something they want to matter but they can't there's no do something they want to matter but they can't there's no there's nowhere to go any more special in the small town but I know you weren't man Percocets feel real good yeah those drugs I feel fantastic but they'll kill you so that's why I think this contributes to the popularity of Bernie Sanders and Trump they talked about the working-class to talk about these free trade agreements hurting people they talked about getting the factories back together and that means a lot to people who have been popping pills who are depressed or sad and scared that's a lot of people in this country</div>

The kind of talked against Trump re-elected and that's my biggest pet peeves because I think we can do a lot for a public option for expanding Medicaid have a green New Deal at its core to me is fascinating can can the government you know can we allocate tax money to invest in new technologies Fusion nuclear and reduce carbon emissions and do great things can we make high-speed rails but then when you come out and say the unwilling and these other equities things and intersectionality I'm like that's that's not that's not what I'm talking about I can't support that the unwilling is the most Preposterous one the idea that someone's unwilling to work again to provide them with a living as that's Insanity I mean that's the ultimate Progressive Bend but another where it keeps going where the turnout Progressive the next Concept in a socialist or communist Society Society exists where you expect people to undertake the greatest construction project in history a massive train Network that makes all planes obsolete but the same time tell people don't have to work if they want money that's what we're saying is like as these ideologies getting more and more ridiculous they try to out Progressive the next step like it's a fundamental right for you to earn a living and N pew pew research recent Powerball last couple weeks ago Democrat the Democratic party 54% one more moderate policies so I'm I found that bracket but still you still have them on 43 or so more leveling policy so that means the party split and so here's the problem I see if you're going to put me up Interstate image got a boat you have to have to make a choice you've got a moderate conservative who believes things I really don't agree with but he doesn't want to give money to people don't work and he doesn't believe in identitarian politics and race Equity or whatever and then you got the Democrats were so far left to me I can't even see them anymore who do you think you know social liberals and liberals vote for the closest person to them politically will be at that's what scares me you know we had this great future with a potential for a public option for expanding Medicaid for I mean look I really do believe social programs are important we can do more I like a lot of what Bernie has to say I think we need to reform education but I think education could be expanded again I'm interested in your ideas I want to advocate for them but we need to figure out how to do it but my pilot like where I fit politically I'm politically homeless I don't agree with someone judging me based on my race I've been through that hell no never again people vandalizing my home because didn't like that around mom and white dad I don't want to live in that world I don't want you to look me in the eyes and say people look at this way when it comes to Harvard I want you to look into the eyes of a little Asian boy and say honey you can't go to Harvard your Asian you look too much like those people how does that make sense why is it that just because this kid looks similar to this kid you're going to tell him he has a harder standard for Pat for the SATs to get into the school I just I refuse</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> oh yeah Jeff Bezos man crazy is the National Enquirer allegedly we should say allegedly I believe allegedly I want to get sued tried to extort him and it's about the Jamal khashoggi investigation from The Washington Post it to that about it so I'm not as versed like I haven't read if the store I think it's from the week we're running Pharaoh says that they approached him and and you know what pressure on him as well but interesting thing is when I read that story I kind of laughed because I was like Amber Cocker member when it public when they how did Peter Thiel and then yes you know these people Really Brave to go and try and drag them but did they can use this to extort him so that he doesn't he takes the Washington Post or damped attempting to get him to take the Washington Post and remove a legitimate news story about an actual murder I don't trust the Washington Post but you know that's an aside yeah if you know Brands they're scared they're scared so you look at what happens with some of these Twitter accounts that will lead campaigns where they incorrect other followers send emails at sits it's not the same as blackmail by no means but when you know there's an attack Vector like you know what is that wild sardines company they don't want to deal with a brigade from activists you tweeted them your fancy of them and Emily cancel on your show and it doesn't value unless you do something unless you say something less you just about something you know so sounds worse when it wouldn't win a National Enquirer allegedly you know tries to extort Jeff Bezos the crazy thing about it is alleged again allegedly that the investigator I think they miss Becker was entertaining the possibility had a government entity intercepted the texts the nude selfies windows but I did see another journalist tweet that they're not entertaining that they're not pursuing it or just a thought so maybe it's not real undercut screengrabs of her phone it was really interesting when they so sad because he owns the post People for People presume he's their Enemy Bring up to when it comes to like Banning Alex Jones just because someone reporting something doesn't mean they're advocating for it but sometimes they are it's like if you understand the new ones in that you know but yeah I mean could you imagine what would happen if Bezos shut up the Washington Post story just tell their story it's almost impossible to so unrealistic but maybe there's more to it I mean yeah that they're the real the in this is the big conspiracy theory was that you know Trump always calls him Jeff Bozo someone from that side is involved in this yeah I probably should we just shows you how crazy digital media is I've been digital things like sending things through the air and it says that people can get intercepted that's why you know what when I mentioned earlier the title for Civil War I don't know what could look like this could be it could be special interest using information it's the information more people talk about I was thinking about this a while ago it's like men why why did people shoot each other hundred years ago but like they wanted to gain control they wanted they want to centralize power or they wanted to push it on and ideology or government to expand their power you don't need to shoot somebody to that you just need to convince them you're right or you need to get them to fight each other but we've learned through if you trust the reporting and it's hard to know what's real or not that the Russian campaigns were not only promoting Trump supporters but they're promoting black lives matter why the fight recently with this woman let me let me get her name so I can is see if you can find a Jamie to call the information War that's the name of the podcast but they were they were doing all sorts of different things like not just trying to Renee diresta the rest and I'm working on getting her down here soon that they were they also had like Texas culture they had yet men's rights they have even organized Facebook campaigns were they had a pro Texas group and they pro-muslim group meet across the street from each other I mean they're they're sowing seeds of dissent like organizing it and I think I'd be willing to entertain the possibility that but we call the culture War today was seated specifically by special interests potentially Rush up nothing to do about it it's done you know when when people adopt an ideology you can't easily break that and some people refuse to cross that divide yeah but it's just so funny how many different ways they were attacking us they had a blue lives matter group and black lives matter groups and they put people. Each other and one of the big ones they did was they they targeted African-Americans and we're trying to get them to vote for anyone other than Hillary and this is like an engineer campaign to Jill Stein's our vote and like we can't vote for Hillary like Hillary is not supported we can't vote for Hillary and they've made it very tribal the first thing we have to we have to assume that it was effective what we view in the culture war was exacerbated by these campaigns we don't know what we don't know to what extent they had an influence over the us but I will say I think it's fair to point out they play roll and then we can see what happens Charlottesville you know you know where we can see the dramatic escalation where you end up with some crazy guy associated with you know white nationalism Ramen the car into a bunch of protesters people get riled up to a point is a really great video called this video cute angry by cgp grey where he talks about how these groups they argue amongst each other not against each other they make each other angry by posting images of the other there certain subreddits why don't you know but they'll post memes not stop attacking a particular politician they're not arguing with the left or the right there arguing to themselves about what's wrong with the other and so these groups grow and get angry angrier and then when they finally meet in the real world angry by posting images of the other there's certain subreddits why don't you know star Brigade but they'll post memes not stop attacking a particular politician they're not arguing with the left or the right there arguing to themselves about what's wrong with the other until these groups growing angrier and angrier and then when they finally meet in the real world you get extreme violence so it's very possible to see those communities and real people up push these things</div>

Please explain that because that was one of the more most Illuminating aspects of our conversation on the phone yeah it's a publicly known but not talk about a whole lot that needs media organizations mostly these digital new startups don't actually get a lot of views so what they do is it's called traffic assignment there's a company called comscore that tracks the did the viewership the unique music sites have if you're trying to attract investment and you say we get 20 million views per month they're going to say that's cool but this I could 64 they do well there are some sites this is according to variety modern farmer.com what was that I have no idea I've never heard of it but there are many sites would you probably seen where it's like the top 25 celebrities who you know mess up their makeup yes you click the page and I'll show you a photo in order you got to click the next page that's that way turn Hue one person 225 unique views are 25 years I want a unique then accompany likewise for instance will buy the assignment of your traffic and a tribute to themselves so when the comscore numbers come out it will say all of those of yous from those clickbait sites are actually nice right. cuz someone they were buying traffic Simon from was like going through turmoil and shaking and being shaken up and another one of their traffic sign and partners switched to I think I got told NBC or something so what's happening well I can say a little bit there was a company that was a prominent digital news Outlet I knew someone there who was decently High out who told me our company is contemplating whether or not we should engage in traffic assignment to inflate our numbers and I said don't do it like that's wrong you. May said but we need investment so I wonder if it's a fraud but if comscore is is just rubbing the numbers together and I go to you and say according to comscore our Network brings in 60 million I didn't lie that's all true yes it's true so here's what happens these companies get massive investment they don't actually generate enough clicks are enough money then the investment ones out those jobs never existed those were those were padded by investors so kind of squirrelly collapses it seems like fraud that seems like if that was if you were doing that with the some text Doc yep yeah yep into the Securities problem that the mortgage-backed Securities yes. The better now to write about this all of these big companies is Big about the hundreds of millions of dollars $29 investment because they're seeing these numbers but underneath there's nothing there and that is crazy so if you're investing money so if you've got some some cash you've worked your ass off and you've generated a lot of money into the digital space we have a website that has million clicks and we're going to take that and then you find out you just got to f****** hosed how is that not fraud because buyer beware well because there's a law that legalized fraud you know nothing right now can do it and really you're getting modern for me it's f****** crazy Shady I'll tell you what I'll something else too and I say this with the utmost respect for for Shane Smith Vice we've been out for drinks they they flew me I love Shane he's cool dude but he's brilliant absolutely brilliant he's at he's a master of I don't know what you call it but it's a form of community and social engineering is something that I've been you know relatively well-versed in whether he knows it or not really really understand how people think and how to get them to do things so I'll give you an example I left the Voice in 2014 and after I left some of the people I had brought on the recommendation we're still there this buddy of mine says dude good news I'm going to be running I'm going to be helping produce the news program for the cable channel I was like wow congratulations to send me your moving work on the cable channel is it back in 2014 he does Weebly talk to you about we're getting a cable channel I'm going to work on the news channels like dude it was a Rogers deal the cable channels in Canada it wasn't a couple years later they got the US based Channel but what happened was a bunch of my friends work advice didn't know the cable channel that got was based in Canada but they believed they were going to be working on a cable channel in the US that's important because you need people to really want to work there be passionate and Shane was a master of giving you just enough in so that you believed in what you were doing without realizing exactly at that right and I think she ain't fantastic I don't blame him for this but it's whatever you get a bunch of employees who believe they're going to be on this big new American cable channel will she never said American he doesn't cable channel it's your fault for assuming it was going to be in America what that meant a lot to those employees so you're able to boost morale get everybody really excited until they find out in Canada and then they were like wait one he's he's bringing you really isn't your play Civilization the video game no fantastic I love this game I'm playing Civ 6 right now again and you can get they're called great people they're called great people that if you are enough points you'll get look at that you'll get like Galileo he'll appear in your civilisation Museum I firmly believe that in a hundred years the next election 50 you'll be able to earn a great Merchant to Shane Smith because of how like he was able to build this Empire he did it through very clever ways of basement and admittedly I really like the stuff they used to do back in the day guys wow he knows how to do it and then I'll bring them up is because the big story about traffic assignment was vice losing like 17% because of that practice they were doing so he really know how to do the smoke and mirrors you know when you look at the other when you look at how it pays out pans out to all the other news outlets and having it's laid off you have to you don't have to wonder why a thousand jobs I've got lost in the past week it's just investment money and once they reach their Threshold at all you know Came Crashing Down the modern farmer example like the modern farmer what is that I think it's the clicks just the fact that that you can actually buy those clicks and attribute them to something different and then you can tell people in the way all the time. Yeah I don't think this one is on par but make you have one YouTube channel 1000 Subs make 10 more a scholar self subscribe and I've got 10,000 Subs get it people and times and you've got you go around telling people I got 10,000 subscribers when in reality it's just the channels is really clever ways to inflate your numbers and this attract investment it also but more importantly allows leverage in dealing with ad networks what are people doing when they're their Instagram I don't know what I'm going to pull it up I can't show your and I just went to the website buy YouTube views. Com for $2,800 you can have a million views to do it if you want to be a YouTuber if you want to be successful on YouTube and use ensure as you will never make it but look at this way no one do this no one I'm not advocating for another 2 weeks to explain film 10 video best season of The Joe Rogan travel Adventure by a million views on each to be patted out over a month go to A&amp;E launched million views per episode You Are by it wow a million people watching trick your way into getting on TV fake it till you make it it's dirty it's it it's a legal right I was going to go well actually I don't know if they don't think it is fun if I think New York article that Attorney General of ones that may have been New York sad misrepresenting yourself online through fake views collection likes is illegal I think what they were saying is that using other people's images to create bank account is like invasion of privacy or something there was someone that mean article that Attorney General of ones that made the New York sad misrepresenting yourself online through fake views collects and likes is illegal I think what they're saying is that using other people's images to Cricut ounces invasion of privacy or something but we're going to that point but you know there's people who play that game I guess you can really you can really. I've met a lot of people who does a bunch of tricks</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the modern left whatever people call it like the dino capital L tribal left seems to be being indoctrinated not by left-wing policy ideas it's not about necessarily socialism it's about identitarianism it's about policy based on your immutable characteristics and how you know like a going back to the green New Deal like in the bill they talked about racial Equity what is that through the environment what does that mean equality would be like you equal opportunity to people are allowed to try and if 160 graduations Equity would be well let's determine whether or not you are advantage or privileged and then hold you back or push you forward based on these these certain metrics I suppose it's it's the problem I have with it is that it's not quantifiable so this was actually something is really shocking to me I was sitting with my niece and my sister and my niece and my mom and I show this image that people like to share its three people standing up by a baseball offense baseball game it's a really short person who can't see there is a medium sized person who can see a little bit and a very tall person who just stands right above the fence it says this is equality each of them gets one crate while one crate isn't enough for the short guy and the two guys can already see it says this is equity and it shows the short guy getting you know three crates so they can all see now the problem is when it comes to someone's height sure we can understand let's let's let's give the the crates to the short guy so he can see along with us but how do you determine Equity based on the color of someone's skin or are you not like other characteristics that cannot be Quantified right so when Alexandria ocasio-cortez pushes a bill for that supposed to be about the environment but includes racial Equity Clauses are we to assume that her ideology states that if you are not white you are poor by death like it's a guarantee or do we have to assume that each individual has different advantages different cards to play and some are born wealthy some aren't and yes there's historic racism but we can't make those assumptions right I'm having as like a lifelong left-wing individuals who do I vote for write-offs big fan of Bernie Sanders for a while but then Bernie Sanders gets up on stage to the debates and says white people don't know what it's like to be poor that's hilarious tweets that I looked at I said I'll come on man you know this is f***** up yeah he was talking about how much more money white men make than black women then latino man that always different things and what he didn't include was Asian men Asian men make more money but here's what I think a lot of people on the right mess he said Pay Equity not pay equality okay I think perhaps we could stop assuming they don't know what they're saying because a lot of people assume what they're saying is you know the gender earnings Gap is is real but the gender pay Gap is not if a man and a woman are both offered the Punjab Jackson experience in education women tend to get I think it's like 3 to 5% less and many people believe that's because they are less likely to negotiate just why you have like lean and tell him to be more you know trying to be more assertive but it's not this 77% number that's what there is an earnings Gap right the median salaries of men and women are different so when Bernie says white men make ex more than these other demographics he said in his tweet pay Equity not equality don't want Fair pay for I want based on job he's actually saying it doesn't matter what job you have everyone should be paid the same yeah that's nonsense but then you see what Cortez releases on their website if you're unwilling to work that provide Economic Security they actually I believe they took it off the site right but I think when they included in the bill that they want Equity not equality when they put on their website if you're unwilling to pay you and when Bernie says Equity as well I think they're not talking about equality like I don't think you know the average American understand what they're actually saying is you should be paid a flat rate. And when you're talking about the pay Gap being different from men and women we should clarify the what you're saying essentially is that men choose different jobs and they work more hours and that's my reason why they make that much more money worth 77 cents on the Dollar hours worked was almost the 100% of the reason why men and women earn different at a median median salary in some areas women actually earn more than theirs Seven Cities everybody thinks I'm wrong or whatever but I believe it was Seven Cities where women out-earn Man by like seriously High number is like 20% so there's a lot of issues when it comes to the pay Gap and equality but I think what is pay equality is enshrined in law and I decided I cited three examples of where it's illegal discriminate based on gender equality Equity that would imply doesn't matter what job you haven't petroleum Engineers that are in the same as a store clerk at H&amp;M that's Equity that just because you have an advantage because of education does it mean to earn more than somebody else you said I'm saying so the fact that those people that actually believe that that don't believe that the first of all that's going to absolutely discourage people from trying to succeed why would you if you could get the same CEO of Exxon as you can working at 21 Forever Forever 21 or whatever Abercrombie &amp; Fitch why would you why would you try hard why would you exceed why would you succeed why would you excel at some people would social status if there's no real enough to really encourage Innovation and progress there's a lot that people don't get rich because they want money they get rich because they're passionate about something in the money comes after you know they say the money comes after some like that and I point out every every day I take no days off it's been a couple years with me not taking any days off at work literally every day full time right now in producing six YouTube videos everyday only one of them is a real diamond days a week what you doing yourself guy like it's fun. The thing I'm not I'm not doing it because you know I see things for the most part on my main YouTube channel I do one video every day 4 p.m. which tends to be just like a news analysis piece but I'm not perfect sometimes you don't get all hyperbolic and stuff my second channel is me just ranting and not really swearing but still just like heavy opinion stuff done something I want explore it all the time Vici was in all these different countries and all these dangerous places not because I wanted to have a name for myself not because I want to make money I want to watch Revolution I want to know why was happening and want to talk to the people who are experiencing it so I can I can I can relate to people who say money isn't a motivator for sure but I've also talked to people in Scandinavia have told me they sort of give up at a certain point because I can't member which country was it may have been Sweden or Norway but these two women told me after like $77,000 per year to text like 80% of your income so people to stop they literally just another proposition right this is something else has been discussed in terms of anyone who makes more than x amount per year taxing them over 70% agree with progressive tax wholeheartedly I disagree with a number that I what do you think it should be I don't I don't know but I will say we need more Progressive brackets we need to keep going and you know I got to say maybe maybe at 10 million dollars 70% Sunsplash kind of lean towards not really cuz it seems like that's a lot of money that's a lot that's that's that's that's that's ridiculous amount you know I think Steve Bannon said something like a v in front of it or something but I don't know I'm not an economist but I do believe a progressive tax makes the most sense and I can explain it to you if you want to hear it so there's a study $7,000 per year as may have been 10 years ago in order to be middle class median in United States that means if you mix 7000 you'll have vacation you'll have insurance on a car you can raise a family you can send him to school all that stuff but you have nothing left over for savings you have nothing left over for Investments if you make $100,000 a year if you only need $77,000 if you're making 10 million you've got 9919000 that you can invest and to be independently wealthy and be rich forever now I have a problem with being wealthy I have no I've no problem with other people being wealthy and all that but there is a point where you have to realize that the coalescing of power the monopolizing of powers are really dangerous thing for any society too few individuals holding too much power can destabilize an economy can destabilise the country the problem with Communism you snap your fingers and you put a centralized Authority in place at least that's how it's been every single time and then they hold all the cards and they can if they want the problem with laissez-faire capitalism is overtime which is why it's better than in a lot of ways overtime it eventually becomes a centralized copy of a few corporations controlling everything with your kind of seeing now so all the progressive tax can really do is slow that process down which of these is a good thing but ultimately I think just looking at the system eventually you end up kind of where we are we're 6 media companies control everything and then you know some companies are the biggest funders of certain politicians and corporations is that too much power I mean there is a story about how wealthy people have like three or four times more ability to influence a politician than like the majority of the people in the country simply because paying for expensive dinners and lobbying aren't you favors you know this is super Pacs paying you no guaranteeing funding for a position as your favorites so it's you know luck if a million people tell me they want you know X but the people who are paying me running my campaign or paying me more and then once I'm done with my problems South without going out to peccole Ranch I think ultimately a progressive tax can help slow the process down of special-interest acquiring too much power eventually happens anyway over the flat tax you're basically saying at a certain point you can just keep dumping more and more money into different Investments making more money and increasing your power exponentially and other people can't catch up to you and then power becomes too quick right in this country we try to look at success and achievement whatever in striving for it and we don't want to put any restrictions on that we look at capitalism is the reason why everything's going so great over here this is America land of the free home of the brave go out there and kick ass we're not going to settle you down with that but it makes sense that after a while as we're seeing today but I don't mean what is what's the best way to determine socialism is not going to work what what what does work I think a mixed economy or mixer, where we are right now write a portion of income is paid in taxes for nothing and program for defense and things like that I just think we have a big problem correction I think we've got bloat I think we've got government agencies that instead of reforming and breaking them down we just slap more Band-Aids on top of it we got a festering wound we're putting bandages over bandages you know it's like a certain point you got to redo it we also have systems that are in place that I mean in terms of like the way communities have always existed in certain communities there's just poverty and crime and no one does anything to fix it right and it seems to be that will were more than willing to go to other countries and nation-builder audited more than willing to pump money into different countries especially if they have natural resources but in our own country we're not mean to the greatest resources of course human beings and the best way to make America great or stronger would be to have the last losers and what's the best way to have a less losers that more people succeed with the best way to have more people succeed give them more opportunity and chance to not be stuck in a quagmire not trapped in a ghetto this is yasso I believe we should allocate access from other areas to improve the sense I believe in socialism to a certain extent like what I believe in it with with fire departments I believe it with the police department to believe we should spend money that comes out of you know the public pool to fix things right I look at New York there some neighborhoods that are really bad some neighborhoods that are really good well if we take access from the really great neighborhoods and use that to fix roads paper schools in for neighbor crime is one of the biggest correlation for kind of property so if we can get better schools we need to reform the school system straight up if we can get better hospital to get fixed the roads then we're doing a lot to reduce crime and reduce poverty and a rising tide lifts All Ships so that's why you know that's why I like Bernie Sanders although I will admit he is but when we when we were looking at who we had in 2016 I was like yeah is correlation for kind of property so if we can get better schools we need to reform the school system straight up if we can get better hospital so I can fix the roads then we're doing a lot to reduce crime and reduce poverty and a rising tide lifts All Ships so that's why you know although I will I left for me is when we were looking at who we had in 2016 I was like yeah he's my guy</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> talking at the same time there's a bunch of words bouncing around in your head and you just trying to and you think you're saying the right thing when it's that's why intent is so critical yeah and magic words are so f****** dangerous is what I'm going to tell you about later that's all right yeah you know well George Carlin was absolutely amazing I have lived during the time where he was getting arrested Lenny Bruce before him but understand how significant he was when he was doing that seven dirty words you can't say on television like back then people like what the f*** is this guy doing the virus virus I meant we were we were angry and pissed off all the time I grew up like that and an overtime I learned I went to a ton of really important life lessons one of the first and most important was I was a young skateboarder in Chicago really looked up some of these these older guys were really good I went to Catholic school when I was younger and don't be coming this punk rocker guitar playing far-left skin-tight you know skateboarding and greet in no no flags on the wall wheelies cough like I was like like we would you like a Christian or something and he doesn't know and I was like why have a picture of Jesus and it goes I just thought like a story about a dude travel around helping people was kind of cool and I went oh that's a good point wow I wish I was like I was like well maybe I don't really understand maybe maybe this means something different other people that's what it means to me Jesus was an Indian man that you know had wooden beads and you know it was you got we would love him the only be like Shiva or Vishnu we would we would think he's the most amazing thing ever it's the fact that if you look at what Jesus preached and what he was all about mean in Pre are at it's about as spiritual and and loving and it's it's about I mean his whole ideology that the Jesus of the Bible and he was essentially about loving your brother and in treating people as if they're you and but this this for me stop cuz it was kind of a formative moment where all the sudden I realized with my ideology predicated on assumptions was I was I holding his views because other people told me told them that actually understand that there are some positive things on the other side and then I slowly moved over to more of a centre-left opposition and you know now what is I looked I watched that video I tweeted this the video calling hippie liberal far left all that stuff and you probably consider a conservative by today's the way things have been going now they look at you know Kevin Hart is that a bad joke 10 years ago get them out like could you imagine God forbid what would happen with George Carlin's routine is today they wouldn't they would be running all of his old routine saying no you get to ban him from the show he literally called these people why was it that George Carlin Go on stage and talk about how Republicans were gone and how religion is crazy he was clearly on the left whole life early call these people the n-word why was it that George Carlin Go on stage and talk about how Republicans were gone and how religion is crazy he was clearly on the left whole life and he said these things that by today's standards would be considered conservative right and so for me it's a weird thing to go from being on the far left as a young person owes around like 19 or 20 I started to become more moderate and then to see them today being extremely offended like people used to be in the 50s and 60s</div>

free bleeding came right or right idea that for women's rights that they would get away with her mother's get away from this whole idea of you have to control your menstrual cycle you know it's empowering to just bleed all over your crap and so women actually started doing it because it actually if you can f****** if you can get those ideas out there a certain number of Knuckleheads are going to take it by force play some white supremacist we're doing it for sure but you don't you think you looking at bad asses with f****** guns they're playing this little silly game really I think they're a bunch of bros who are dudes at a college they punch each other that's that is a game so how does it go again you you make the okay hand sign I know I'm a 40 year old guys who play Pokemon go on one of my goals is a game that's this f****** thing what is their job what will they do SWAT Team guys people say it's been over you in the P putting it on your leg has always been the punching game or whatever like I do that wonder if you want to make assumptions about what you think their intentions were to tell you I don't have any facts to support that and the only thing I know of is there the game where you put the okay sign on your leg and then you punch somebody and hear some guys bring a case on your leg what evidence do we have anything other than that nothing so I'm not going to go any further than that I'm going to say was it for judgment or hell yeah maybe it but listen you know about what happened in Philly with these marines who got beat up by antifa do not put on by antifa shows up in protests submarines apparently are just walking by because there was a marine event has them and yells are you proud they said he says I'm a marine it said are you a proud boy and he said you know I don't know they give up their rights in several people charged with multiple felonies Marina got beat up they didn't know it probably was so to assume that these guys know anything about what's going on in cultural politics it's it's you know when you're in the know and round when you read news all day you look at the inside they knew what they were doing what these are small like what what's it is guys from even do they watch the news all day do they go on 4chan do they go on vox.com and read notes is about I appreciate your looking at this with a broad perspective but it is entirely possible that they did a possible that within their friend group it means you're buying lunch it can mean a million things you could mean in the cultural context of 2018 when this happened that open the okay symbol doesn't even mean white power it is is it is it is a tribal sign among anti-dentite anti intersectionals and Trump supporters so don't you remember when there was a woman that got in trouble for it she was in court and she had it on her arm she just standing there like that because she was basically like that difference between someone just moving their hands around and doing this and you know making a weird thing on their arm fall on do it the next day though probably on purpose but eventually you start getting off so crazy and you know how many assumptions are going to believe until you believe in the moon landing was faked let me ask you this though don't you think that some people do that and they do it because they're making the symbol for white power some is in what 10 15 20 I don't know I don't know who would even use the emoji would you in public they're not doing it to Signal white power they're doing a signal opposition to the tribal left when they take photos and you see someone like Cassandra Fairbanks who was a trump supporting you know writer she hasn't she is she notable because she stood the podium maybe okay hand sign and then this writer from splinternews which usually called Fusion I work there. Loeser claimed it was a white power hand gesture and she ultimately lost because it's like slander is hard to sue for but she did it because of the Trump sign white power so the people who won't even white supremacists aren't signifying white power they're signaling to other come supporters to write it doesn't mean white power right so just because someone on the left says it means white power that does not mean it means why power within their group so you're saying we all just decide that this means something else like my friend Pakistani got beat up once by his friend where he grew up in Michigan and Michigan as almost like for fun like like if I said hey Parker like if I called you hate f***** like as friends that you would laugh and like what's up dude you know it'd be cool so he would give the bird called the Michigan hello and so the Michigan waiver so his friend he grabbed them through them to the ground because you want to fight motherfuking like what are you talkin about what's going on is that you gave me the bird is your friend was over the guy's house helping them build a greenhouse or something like he was doing some work with the guy and I still thrown to the ground cuz he thought that this was going to be a ton of people you know saying like I'm serious I'm not a big fan of making assumptions about the intentions of other people if you can prove it I'm willing to hear it but people in this country are innocent till proven guilty what do we have we have a photo of some cops doing something dumb do I think it was ill-advised it was wrong To None of course Absolution done it do I think it means no police top screws multimatic cops kick my door and guns drawn I was in Chicago and cops pulled me over me and my buddies is all on video at gunpoint screaming at us that was the craziest fans overhead I am no fan but if you don't have evidence I'm not just going to sit this is the thing about these function you get people who will see all these videos light is experiences no immediately assume the worst about these guys don't know anything about these guys don't know why so I can't really go beyond that I believe their official statement I could be wrong to make assumptions about their character or what they believe simply because they made an okay sign on your leg it's like you can't convince somebody in a quart you know what I mean and I'm I'm a big fan of the presumption of innocence blackstone's formulation and how we decide on the we are on the side of protecting the innocent but I think you got a good point in also in the fact that this is a extremely recent hand gesture that's being associated with white supremacy and clearly came from pranksters you have to assume these guys around 4chan or read these these websites like to work all day to talk about football they go home that's it no lounge chair and have another beer in a slice of pizza or whatever it is they do I don't think these guys people mad at you don't people don't know how to separate their own personal bubble from reality they assume if I know what you must know it right actually something told me he said he doesn't understand why is it that if he can do it you can't write and that's people don't seem to realize you mean by that like he's he said to me I can speak French why can't you like people live in this mindset where they assume of I know it everyone knows it runs like know every I saw an article about that everyone must know what it is like there are some people who don't watch TV there's some people play video games all day there's some people who don't do any of that you know these guys everyday after work they go to a children's shelter and provide soup and they don't watch the news at all, I don't believe it what's going on their lives about what they know who they are and I think you know I'm a firm believer that we have problems with racism in this country I believe institutional to send the racism real real problems need to be solved all that stuff that still doesn't mean you get to just label someone and make assumptions about what they believe who they are because of one thing you know if if if you admit it if you made a joke with what they did it because they were ironically doing it if you made a joke 10 years ago Megan assume you actually believe it may be set silly you know we had this newscaster in New York who accidentally said Martin Luther and Rachel slur for Jewish people in the same way don't care about that one you know so there's a CNN anchor I don't want to say it okay but he was he was using the k word right as long as I'm not calling anybody that's the same thing you quickly himself right and when is this dude you know why or why is it being fired right to assume things about him getting to the point where we're going to look at a photo we don't know the context we don't know what these people are in their names I'm going to be like</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> was Bantu which is you know it's not very clear that like when you think about the fact that they were saying that he had never done anything on their platform that was bannable and then what was the one final thing like any Jack didn't know what it was he got he confronted Oliver Darcy of CNN in DC and for several minutes was yelling at him while they filmed and apparently that's my understanding was the justification for getting him that you surround me journal or something that effect which is in my opinion absurd and Ed wasn't doing it on Twitter I got the post at the perimeter live on Periscope Periscope well that's the same thing I saw it on Twitch but I think it also happened on YouTube they like collectively said if you do something on our platform sorry if you do something on another platform and we see that you can lose your status on our platform to or if you know later that means public also and we see that with with patreon but I want to deviate to patreon we can get to that later but so so in my opinion so it's make that makes a good point how does Alex Jones get banned for giving that guy hard time but Kathy Griffin doesn't get banned for literally calling for these children eating a harassment campaign which night if you're calling on your followers to do something you work your engaging in a campaign by Alex Jones confronting the journalist who advocated for his Banning is a bannable offense Maybe here's the important thing about Jones Oliver Darcy said on CNN it wasn't that Jones broke the rules that got him banned because Darcy says he's been breaking the rules in the past they never cared it was only because of media pressure took action against them okay well we know many other people break the rules we know Fallout accounts have Doc's lawn for we know Kathy Griffin letter-writing campaign there's no media pressure that's one of the big problems Twitter knows conservatives aren't going to be able to level any kind of campaign against their play upon this not scared of it but you know I often wonder why is it that as as as prominent and Powerful as conservative groups can be why they often lose these cultural battles and I'm not going to say this is the primary reason but I will point out do this Twitter believe that you know what happened Sargon of akkad is an example the liberalist anti CW character do they believe he'll lead a group of liberal liberalists and an individualist to Twitter headquarters of crowbars and mouth of cocktails of course not so then what did he get banned from patreon but what happened with his original Twitter thing was that he posted an image of interracial gay p*** at white nationalist so heat won't even he came back to the platform and then got I don't know what happened the second time I think it was ban evasion if I don't have the p*** rules because sometimes always grow into my feed and you'll just see p*** I understand he is not allowed Torrance is not allowed I mean what about pouring I borrowed it is I've heard it isn't definitely there if you go to a pornstars page you'll see p*** on it they don't care maybe there's there's that true Wednesday marked by someone else anus is inappropriate and if enough people that follow pornstar don't think it's inappropriate it doesn't then get flagged in the system I think we may have found the the Switzerland of the culture War p*** no one wants to ban p*** the left and the right in in Portland you had a Bernie voter carrying American flag these are anti-fascist the antifa and put him in the hospital so when I see the ramifications of fire from the left or the right what is what do conservatives do I mean the GOP couldn't even find a yearbook in the Virginia governor race I don't think they're considered to be that big of a cultural threat they react to things they got upset about things that aren't Fair against them but they don't go to the streets with clubs and bricks and smash Windows like antifa and applications of fire from the left or the right what is what do conservatives do I mean the GOP couldn't even find a yearbook in the Virginia governor race I don't think they're considered to be that big of a cultural threat they react to things they got upset about things that aren't Fair against them but they don't go to the streets with clubs and bricks and smash Windows like antifa and other UniFi left us to do well if they do they're considered racist it's always like some sort of a racist mob that was does it's like the label to get put on them</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> background but when you know a person when it's a Laura Loomer or Milo yiannopoulos and it's a public case and then you get this feeling that the say no cuz we decide and those well Joe don't worry because no matter what putter does they're going to be defended by the New York digital journalist Elites who will misrepresent what's going on in an effort to obvious gate or sometimes outright lie about what's going on and this brings me to learn to code send a code so I don't you about this dude I read people getting banned for learn-to-code I'm like what the f*** is that like what is that so when coal miners were getting laid off a bunch of Articles emerge saying teaching minor say code can we teach minors how to code and they're showing videos about it I don't believe it was it wasn't intended to be derogatory or insulting but to a lot of people that came off as this booze won't let them eat cake oh your career has been destroyed your your your 50 year old man with family go to Silicon Valley never even thought about right let's do it came up as a 12 people eyes just silliest right so when these journalists are getting laid off this meme spreads I don't know exactly where it started where they'd say learn-to-code to the journalist won't this thing happens John Levine I think his name from the rap tweets someone from Twitter told me you will you can you can be banned for tweeting learn-to-code La. Journalist conservative start tweeting at far and wide like here we go this is a reporter from the rappers confirm this all the sudden and other journalist can't come outside this is a lie is not true this is fake news conservatives are fighting fake news again and they say we have a new up a new statement from Twitter that said we're only in Banning were only Banning people who are engaging in a harassment campaign when I got a few problems is tweeting Amy met somebody critical of them a harassment campaign is that I mean yeah right but but I check some people Twitter accounts I saw that they were tweeting this and I believe for the most part this is what happened someone tweeted something to a buzzfeed journalist you know you guys believed X y&amp;z yeah whatever #learn-to-code criticizing them suspension has come out and say this is not true it's just people engaging in harassment campaign account he's got one tweet that says learn to code is that him harassing somebody and they said oh but you're taken out of context then John looking from the rap says update Twitter spokes with my source is now saying clarifying it is about the harassment campaign and then another journalist comes out and says he is quotes fake Twitter than I ever saying it because the thing the editor-in-chief of the Daily Caller just a couple dancing couple days ago took a tweet from The Daily Show and it was as if it was a state of the union and he tweeted learn-to-code and quote to the video suspended so it's very clearly not about a harassment campaign but why then we're all of these journalists so ready to jump up and defend Twitter when Twitter you know I said okay if we was claiming they're banning people who are engaging harassment campaign you mean they've confirmed they're banning people for quitting learn-to-code they just considered harassment how was it that learn to code is harassment by Kathy Griffin saying to all of her millions of fans I want these kids name several times or another verified account I'm not going to name is not as famous literally calling after the death of these kids in instructing people to kill them is not a bannable offense it's not harassment campaign a true absolutely he said he's effective put them in a school lock and burn it down and when you see them fire on them this guy still active on Twitter that you don't you do right now they are ant so now we can there's there's so much your dude boys all of them perks from Twitter okay boys band fine why was antifa been a lot of people respond to me and save it to random people who wear masks you don't know that's not true there are branded owls of antifa that have their own merchandise still active some of these groups have published the private information of Law Enforcement Officers still active no action taken against them so you know I don't do this in indicates of heavy left-wing bias I wouldn't necessarily say left-wing I would say intersectional identitarian ideological bias right it's it's it's it's hard to pinpoint what the tribes are in the culture War what Twitter is clearly Act defense of intersectional activism now do you think that this is a mandate do you think this is written somewhere do you think there is people who are in the company that have power that are acting independently it's it's grains of sand to make a keep right you're in you're in Silicon Valley you're in a very blue area the people who get hired can to hold certain views and because they all live in their own bubble they believe they're the majority and bus they think they're acting justly to ban those who are at odds with them engineering bring back into journalism the big problem it's you know for decades I don't know how long journalism has been dominated by self-identified liberals there's the ton of poles I think it's a 2015 poll showing Republicans are like 7% of journalist or some ridiculously small number and the really simple reason for it news organizations are headquartered in big cities the big ones you know Steven Fox News in New York so there's a lot of people who work at Fox News directly liberal New York happens them news breaks you got all these journalists cuz I work with him and I work for vice I worked for fusion and they said around the tables they meet up after work from different offices and they talk about things and they'll tell each other the exact same thing and so this is why you see Covington happen these people follow each other on Twitter so when someone tweets this Maga kid got in the face of Nathan Phillips they only see each other's tweets and just write it they don't do any journalism and it goes for days and then I was even in the New York Times correct the New York Times has talked to me because the second video that came out from Covington you literally watch Nathan Phillips walking up to the king Bill Maher you know what for 5 days later it says the kid got in his face and I'm like how are you saying that is not true but at the same time I'm serious journalism problem and this links back to Twitter and that story in particular really almost like condensed all the problem in the one yeah yeah and what's what's what's fascinating is following the story on iPad I believe it was New York Times said stop Tweeting or said never tweet Brian stelter from CNN then got a statement that I always have believed because I don't have a source of pulled up but someone from Twitter said journalists are the lifeblood of our platform and so that's why I think you got these predominately new york-based Progressive writers there are fresh out of college they get hired for you do moderate salaries to work in a newsroom sit around each other all day sharing the same ideas not exploring anything outside their bubble and Twitter support them because they're the ones who Drive traffic to Twitter they keep the conversation going and I think that's worth would advise partly comes from the other is that clearly you're in San Francisco you're going to have you know your staff the people who are who are you no running content curation and banning people they lean left so why why Kathy Griffin wasn't band probably because she's very famous but then I have to wonder why Alex Jones was partly comes from the other is that clearly you're in San Francisco you're going to have you know your staff the people who are who are we not running content curation and banning people they lean left so why why Kathy Griffin wasn't band probably because you said she's very famous but then I have to wonder why Alex Jones was so you don't let the only real differentiator that I guess it is either mainstream notoriety or ideological tribe</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> drink too much coffee before we get here so if you're up here like cracked out I swear to God I'm not until but then hear it but so we had a nice conversation on the phone about deplatforming and social media and what it was very obvious to me and talking to you was that you're way more schools on this than I am so that's why I wanted to have a conversation with you about his part of what was like I re listen to my podcast with Jack and we had a good criticism of it I agree with a lot of what you said first of all agreed it was kind of boring and It Was I Thinkin many for many reasons it was my fault I don't think I prepared enough for it and I also don't think I understood the magnitude of how other people felt about deplatforming on Twitter and in all social media YouTube knowledge different things and what the ramifications are and how how much this means to people to have very an obvious obvious Free Speech outside of very egregious examples of like threats and doxxing a diuretic that which I think we can all agree right I think this problem might be one of the like where the worst problems we're facing right now politically yes you know that Twitter is where public gets what is happening it's where journalists are and is the problem sourcing a lot of their stories yes so if you have somebody who's completely removed from public discourse that at this Exile you know imagine why some people can't lose their minds and it happens and I think going into that conversation with him well that's what I wanted it to be that's why I don't really interview people any I kind of have conversations with him yet occasionally we have disagreements and we do you know we talked about things and you know but it's not I don't have like a mandate my only, the only thing I wanted to get out of the conversations I want to find out what it was like to start that organization and two have no idea when you were doing it through was going to be essentially like one of the most important distribution at avenues for information Windows smashed Starbucks it's not because they think they're in a cause damage it's because they want to strike a cymbal down of something they feel process them Jack Dorsey is that symbol to a lot of people and you know to see you know what I was saying earlier is I think a lot of people look at you you're a real dude clear your conversations are real you have you not one of these fake news journalist that people are very critical of that field their bias of an agenda so when you sit down Jack Dorsey and doesn't go anywhere people didn't feel like the last person who's not supposed to let down let us down you know what I mean and I noticed that I got you no more hate for that one and probably anything that I've ever done and you know I'm not a guy away from criticism I try to figure out what I did wrong and try to regroup can't figure out how to approach again and in Jax defense you know I think he's very open to talking about anything and also he's also very open for self-criticism and he was openly discussing what they're doing wrong where they need to be clear where they need to get better I don't believe any of it you know I don't trust that guy not at all I mean first of all Twitter he wasn't the CEO for a while they brought him back in or something but it either sounds like we ban People based on their conduct that you literally have a terms of service at band specific content like what do you mean you don't make it wasn't content there is you know the name and some people write Meghan Murphy for example was offended Meghan Murphy is she okay she's that woman that was the whole issue with open Fortune 2008 that was offering him a passive chairman role and Silent board seat 2010 he was Fountain Square square he went rogue okay so something happened just funny as you called an opinion piece but do they I don't know someone set what has to be an opinion piece when someone says was so problematic right mean that's an opinion mean you're a real facts are he was fired and you know you could stay the specific reason that was stated by the company and that would be a non opinion piece but a chance you can flavor it's all opinion a feminist she said she's at so she can call there trans exclusionary I understand this is offensive you know I guess calling someone a trans exclusionary radical feminist I'm assuming defensive it's just used in defense of why I suppose to them to her offensive against against people like her yet so there is intersectional feminist they tend to be trans inclusive meaning that they believe that someone is born mileage biologically male can compete with those by like biologically female if they transition like that can compete compete right like our lifting racing bike biking in Selma that's where I step in about the Visionary group think they shouldn't and they've said things that are considered to be considered to be offensive I'm not trying to assert who's offended by it but there's one recent story where I trans exclusionary radical feminist said that the trans Rights Movement is a men's Rights Movement right they said you act like that men aren't women though not harassment that was a conversation with somebody else was also a fact she was probably been well that's crazy right men aren't women Okay add contacts to say it right there men or women who the f*** can argue with that while I do you say trans people okay now you're into gray area but Millie. The statement men aren't women that mean you have to take it in context right right right but this is where we start getting into the nitty-gritty of left-wing ideology culture War Wikipedia and you look up man it will tell you a man is an adult human male run but if you look up trans man it will say a transient is a man and so the transection of Wikipedia is at odds factually with the man section so that when it comes to Twitter then we can clearly see the bias Twitter says you can't miss you under someone and the presently that's why I was banned okay that's a left-wing ideology is she what she talkin about a specific human I think she was I think they're having a conversation about somebody I don't know the full details details but I got to say look right now people are being banned or suspended for saying learn-to-code okay that's what is that about you explain that to me too and I saw a few people getting should we start one at a time and they're saying that they would never ban someone for Content they ban them for Behavior right so it wouldn't that behavior no idea if you are using Twitter to engage in responding to people is that bad conduct that can't be conducted literally can't be conducted normally that aren't you allowed to have opinions that are in fact based in biology yes you should be in call the alt-right you vet your very Left Right Center left Central Social liberal left I was a big fan of Bernie you know Bernie Sanders he's still one of my favorite politicians people in call me a socialist whatever these labels are so toxic it's so confusing to people and it and it causes so much so much. between two sides that might not even differ that much are the funny thing about it is I got my start during Occupy Wall Street and conservatives called me for I left because I was reporting on the protests what they were doing police brutality the arrest they said this is a far-left activist now that I'm I've always been critical of the more extreme factions like I got interviews from 77 years ago where I'm critical of these people now all of a sudden they're accusing me of being all right for being critical of extremists and maxing out starting fires and things like that Jason that's my new favorite Bootleggers Bootleggers in the context of Twitter they say freedom of speech freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence that literally doesn't mean anything is literally means nothing will that's just trying to skirt around freedom of speech is so what ends up happening but it but you agree with that like you should be able to speak your mind but there's certain consequences a certain things he say if I throw this bottle at the wall to the consequence but it's it's it's almost it's just like you can predict when someone will say it and it's usually when specific is band they'll say freedom of speech real cosmetology stuff they don't say it went there people they say you know there are people who have been banned unjustly and this is where it's actually scary are in my opinion I could name so many people Jesse Kelly was banned for no reason CJ Pearson was no reason why they have no record of an accident Jesse Kelly is a conservative has account just bent and there was a huge stink in the medial like what was I to do anything who is Judge SE killing the conservative guy you know he eat he post snarky tweets he doesn't tools and that there was a mistake or mistake very simply is for one we can see the ideological bent to their rules but then you look at someone like Milo yiannopoulos like I'm not a fan of Milo I have to make sure like everybody knows that but just because I'm pritika love the actions taken against him but why was he been pretty tweeted it Leslie Jones write in the idea was that his tweet caused his fans to attack her which I think is that's a stretch that's that's that's just yeah and you know what do you call her ugly did he say something like he was insulting or he was he was mocking this feminist version of Ghostbusters right that's what I was doing was talking it was like a critique of the movie forgot I had my Lana podcast way back in the day I had them on twice I enjoy talk to him he's hilarious he's very smart is very witty he's a character is very much a provocateur it but he's also you know he's pushing buttons on purpose like he's trying to get directions from people I mean I almost think like he married to a black guy just to let people know he's not gay larious in that way I wouldn't I would never say that a lot of what I don't I don't trust them I'm not a I'm not a big fan you know if you are ashamed to do it at the gym right literally start over GameStop in and it right but I think I listen to him and that's why I went to the gym and I just mean like if my place it up like I'm going to shame people into that work out why would you say that look that's fine my location can say the nasty things and be the kind of person he is banned from Twitter that's ridiculous why was verification badge removed that was another if it's it's planted them of the verification when was weird we're going to keep you here but we're going to take away the verification let people know you're you that's fine Milo can can say the nasty things and be the kind of person is he should have been banned from Twitter that's ridiculous why does verification badge removed that was another if it's it's planted them of the verification when was weird it's like we're going to keep you here but we're going to take away the verification let people know your you write so it opens the door to fraud right and drive it opens door to fake Milo's and you don't know who's who because there's no blue checkmark that doesn't necessarily make any sense</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> sure against those kind of noxious political commitment but if someone misspeak sort an off-color joke and they were as like they weren't trying to offend anyone and they're just you know they wish they could take it back and like in that links up with every did you say you must have seen the Norm Macdonald in that was brutal he couldn't use the word retard so it's hilarious and what happened I believe it on Howard Stern Show and he was a bounty use the word retard so he was defend he was talking about his friend that the ordeal that Lou okay has gone through in this just mass of Exile experience raises that this massive social shining and he said he was describing it in a way where it's he then got accused that he cared more about what Louis CK was going through then the women who felt victimized by Louis CK and that was not his intention at all apparently and so when he went to a to clarify this he was about to say that you'd have to be rich started to think that I cared more about Louis CK's ordeal than the ordeal of these women who had enough Eldorado careers got derailed right but as the word retard was kind of retarded was coming out of his mouth he tried to course-correct and because he doesn't know what the f*** is talking about he says you'd have to have Down syndrome to it right right which is worse right is more specific he's it that he was at he showed up on The View right with this this apology tour and that's just amazing video to see him on The View surrounded by these these four women who know he's not a bad guy right like they're tried they're trying to throw him a Lifeline after Lifeline he's so beaten down right now and he's so walking on eggshells and the lions and it should be it should be so straightforward like it does is it part of norms goal to cause pain for parents who have kids with mental disabilities right no I am be like it like that like you could you can look and you can look into this guy's eyes for for 10 seconds and know that this is not the big at you're worried about right and and yet people just want him destroyed over and I don't know if they still do but like that the moment would like it was I think it was a real concern that his his Show get canceled and he like this wasn't it hasn't been on Norm show he was on Norms he was like Norm side and Norm really suffered from this in a way that he never suffered from anything in his career and turns like his own personal feeling like he was devastated by by the blowback in the reaction and he wanted to come on my podcast and talk about it but Netflix is like it to talk you out of it because they I think they realize that Norms a maniac and Norma's a maniac in the best sense of the word one of my favorite comics and is hilarious f****** hilarious but he's also completely crazy in the best way possible randomly in some strange way randomly were seated next to each other on two separate flights is randomly I used to smoke I'm so glad I quit f****** terrible for you you know what I mean it's just but I do not always wanted a cigarette and then it began when I want a cigarette if I'm not quit cigarettes that's great we landed at LAX and goes right into a store and buy cigarettes cigarette crazy but that's many many comedians are incredibly impulsive and this is Norm I mean he just what he's got such a he's so off-kilter he's got a sort of Garry Shandling crate like you don't know what's going to come out of his mouth us but we have to be into the diversity Olympics we need some respect for diversity write those people who aren't theirs they're spectrums we don't even know about we are we haven't named right or and everyone is in some weird spot and people misspeak right you there has to be a way back to say that's not what I meant right like like this is offending people of this type was not my intention at some level that has to be good enough unless you know we open your closet and we see that you've got swastikas all you know it everywhere you know and so I think we have to we have to hold the line here you know yeah and very few people are in a position to be able to do it I mean like Netflix Netflix doesn't feel I can do it well Netflix just so terrified of a continual blowback and they going to start like if we're going to save the show the way to save is getting stop talking or I just going to just take his other foot take other people. help to illuminate our understanding of how people behave is what you really enjoy talking about you really definitely changed my way of looking at things that they're really essentially the concept of free will the very flawed thing and that you have to really take into consideration who a person is right now and what was his cause them to be this person right now and that a lot of us are operating on this really bizarre momentum of our past and our behavior and our genetics and life isn't all these different variables that really need to be taken into account this idea that you are autonomous and you are the director of your own life is true to a certain extent but it's also very complicated much more complicated than we would like to admit and when you're talking about something that happened when you were 17 like Brett Kavanaugh or something like that like Jesus Christ you know you going to hold a 55 man 55 year old man accountable to something that he did when he was 17 it wasn't a crime that and you're not exactly sure what happened picture of your own life is true to a certain extent but it's also very complicated much more complicated than we would like to admit and when you're talking about something that happened when you were 17 like Brett Kavanaugh or something like that like Jesus Christ you know you going to hold a 55 man 55 year old man accountable to something that he did when he was 17 it wasn't a crime that here and you're not exactly sure what happened this is all very strange this very strange stuff</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do Jamie and I have a a checkered history I don't know if maybe you and I have spoken about it I never met Jamie but Jamie when Jamie was social justice Warrior number one he went hard he went hard. Probably be like a donkey on me endlessly in ways that were totally unfair and he was just you know he was and then he had his his epiphany Havana Social Justice model came for him over something was over almost nothing pray over him trying to get laid I mean like they were saying he was a creep or something like that strength is hitting on girls I miss the details there but then he can't then so then he sent sent me very friendly and apologetic emails about to see how I'm sorry what I did and you know he was he want he wants to do a podcast I haven't taken him up on it but you know that maybe I could be an interesting play sincerely apologetic he's a good guy I mean he went he and I had our own issue at one point in time over a podcast that we did versus it was the Daniel Tosh rape controversy like remember this woman in a crowd he was he was on stage and he wasn't supposed to be there it was at the Laugh Factory and Dom Irrera I'm on stage and goes like I don't have any material you guys want to talk about and some guy yells out rape and that's always helpful and so you know it's like some drunk in a crown try to go see so Daniel Tosh's take about that guy about rape cuz when it be fine if someone is raped her and everybody starts laughing giant blog about it and she wanted him to apologize about it and Jamie went after Daniel Tosh as a fellow as hell comic saying that it's you know like and I'm like well she's a Heckler and very patronizing cuz obviously he doesn't think there's something funny about rapist it is he's just trying to work through this ad lib set that he's doing with some guy who yelled out something that this whole crowd has to respond to he can't just ignore the fact that it happened and go fire trucks and you know and Jamie and I had this little tit-for-tat about it but he's very honest about his mistakes like when you talk to him and he's he's got great Insight because he was that guy and he was that guy that was going back and forth with people online all day and checking as mentions I couldn't walk down the street more than five steps before you pull out his phone to check his mentions is there help people responding to his latest Duncan heartache down or right just it's a toxic thing that people are doing it's this this Rena looking for people that are that are bad I'm looking for things that are wrong looking for wrong speak is very toxic it's toxic for the people that are doing it toxic for the people that are receiving it just it's not a way that you and beans whatever communicating one-on-one I mean I tried to communicate with people the same way online as I would have there right in front of me I don't succeed but I try that's my goal try to talk to someone if they're right in front of me that's clearly not how everybody Tanto I think road rage is he is the best analogy what's happening social media have adopted adopted that way of looking at 2 you are the highway like the 405 and you have five Lanes on 70 miles an hour it is a f****** miracle that no one dies and every day we do it every day everything's fine let's go back to this idea of what the the actual normative response would be when somebody puts their foot in their mouth or something from their past gets disclose me these stupid and indefensible thing they did as a teenager right you know a lot like this you know you got these guys who are now having their careers destroyed for having dressed up you know the in the black face or neck hood for Halloween whatever it was and then I ate on that one politician that said he's not even in the in the photo but the photo is on his yearbook page or like whatever you put on your yearbook page in high school right you find out this thing that you know adult is going to die send right but what is the path back while I was like what is the reboot that wouldn't that should be acceptable because we don't even know it seems we don't even know what could conceivably work to rehabilitate somebody's career and yet on this other side we've got people who again or being let out of prison for murders they admit they committed right or rapes they admit admit they committed and they're real stated and we had these are these are stories were supposed to feel good about right so that we have to figure out how to square this on the left and you know I don't know I made the way I've been thinking about it is that it has to be intelligible how you are different from the person who committed that thing so I give you if you did something that was less a legit racist when you were 20 and Mark Wahlberg is an example of running around it just be in people senseless right and for a valid racist motives I believe when he was a teenager lost as I write but I think I was doing truly independable things now I don't know what sort of PR moment he has had since or how he's apologized for it or but that was a very different time I think it was if all that stuff was being discovered about him now there may be no way back to the problem is with this day and age it could be reignited right like even though he's apologized for it and even though that it's been addressed it absolutely get reignite on your podcast actively instill today's ideas of what constitutes racism on 1885 so if you were in high school in 1985 and you dressed up as mr. T you know that I don't know if that was racist back then I never did it but I don't know if that's racist like if you had a bunch of gold chains and you made your hair black and are you make you made your face black and give yourself a mohawk and some mr. t for Halloween and the pictures emerged today what you did when you went door-to-door when you were fifteen or 12 or whatever you were knocking on people's doors and everybody was laughing. It was racist but let's say you were racist right in the field I had to Skype is Christian picciolini on my podcast one to ask me or not legit racist all the tattoos to prove it and now there major problems with Christian picciolini as as as I think you know that I discovered after that podcast but so this is not an endorsement of him sorry Christian but the the there's a path back he is celebrated on the left yeah he's a former Neo-Nazi and he's you know I discovered him on Sarah Silverman show on Hulu and he's a darling of the left right and Darlene of MSNBC for this Redemption story so but what is the you take someone like any of these politicians who have something in their back story that is ugly my feeling is all there has to be is a transparent and intelligible account of how you are now different of how you can actually honestly look back on this thing and say yeah I am is embarrassed by that if you think I should be right that's not like that is nothing that does not represent how I view the world at all now but there's just there's a the spirit of the time on social media against special the left and to our total dysfunction politically is to never accept any of that and there is no apology good enough and or the orders the most cynical possible interpretation of your of your apology like you're just trying to what you're the only reason why you're apologizing is because you want to save your job and that we have to figure out how to use some recovery disk that we can reboot from here because it's just not as if this is going someplace terrible and again to look at it to the lens narrowly politically if you know over the next two years it's it's to the massive disadvantage of the left it certainly is but I don't see any way to fix that like with the current climate in his current attitude where people are engaging in this recreational outrage it fits the climate I don't mean I don't know what would have to happen for people to come to some sort of a realization I mean it would have to happen to them like I did to James like what happened to Jamie kilstein is it if they turned on him and he's like oh my God this is awful and then he realized you know I mean I don't know what other things could happen what what weird the game we're playing is part of it to me you and I are in position to take risks that you know even the people at the top of Journalism you can't Kelly says one wrong thing and you know it doesn't matter that she's got a $29 contract she's just she's fired when you look at the thing that she said I mean it was just a question just didn't seem to understand how charged the phrase blackface was she just ignorant of that piece of history or something but like either so she just she put her foot in her mouth she gave an apology that was just like you know full-blown hostage video apology I'm sorry you don't even know I hear take a sample of my blood and you'll just see Michael my cortisol and not good enough not good enough and the letters say the apology more crazy they let her come back City apology Ne-Yo good thanks for doing so she can take real risks but you know you and I you know you and I could do an interview with Louis CK right like view with Louis CK right like it and just process his coming back into stand up and do it in a way where people didn't like it you just say OK fuk off right this is the conversation we had and I think modeling that more and more and I think I think we have to take those risks and people like us have to take those risks and hope to break the spell by having those conversations in public</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's what it sounded like I said anything bad it's what I didn't say yeah but that was upsetting to so many people put that such a loaded thing and because of that podcast now there's there's negative to it that blowback there's a lot of you know toxic anger and all that but the positive is what I like the positive that came out of it is me forced to re-examine how I do podcast re-examined the significance of each individual Gaston especially someone that comes with as much baggage you know that without lack of a better term is Jack that you're you know you got to think that there's people listening and there's some questions that you really have to work at you have to you have to push through and even if he's he's dancing and pirouetting I should have went back to okay why is Kathy Griffin on your platform as bad as I want names his name's and then when you see the actual the actual video of what actually happened and there's so many people there still not walking it back still my friend Matt lived in DC and those hats those Maga hats they're f****** everywhere there's these little these kids were that area carts that sell these hats so these kids bought those hats that day they probably just be an assholes right there unsupervised teenage boys their frontal lobe is not fully formed and they're all together feeding off each other like a pack of Grandma and I was a teenage boy you were teenage boy you know I f****** stupid used to be teenage boys together in a crowd school trip and get some native Elder Drummond in one of them you know it was amazing what didn't happen so violence against a Catholic school kid wearing a Maga hat but what people read into an uncomfortable smile right I may just like that the shots of his face with the tweets that said you know this is what white privilege looks like this is the end of this is this is the everything is wrong in our society it's just we have to slow down because my parents always thought of the left and we always I've been called right when I'm devoted anything--but Democratic my life except for Gary Johnson Gary Johnson was only time I voted independent or whatever the f*** he was libertarian podcast wellred they were they were the people that were more open-minded they were supporting of gay people in minorities that was the left and they were non-violent they were the people in Vietnam when I was a kid pool such a supportive of the virtue of speech and freedom and self-criticism the disadvantage of the left against the right has always been there's this self-scrutiny and willingness to wonder whether or not I'm wrong that isn't mirrored if you go far enough right and it has it there has been so there's been kind of an asymmetric war between left and right politically much of our lifetime but you go far enough left now and you're you're meeting a kind of totalitarian resistance to speech and it's so yeah it's very hard to see how the the 2020 campaign plays at that we could totally blow it with some leftist social someone who has made sense and you know what two things that I liked about Tulsi is that she's a veteran and you know I mean like she's she seems very reasonable to me but except I haven't followed her career closely but it just seems like she's not making the right noises on things like Syria and massage. that is uncomfortable with which in terms of what she is saying about it about him Mission capable of putting both feet in her mouth on that and she say he's not an enemy of America right again I'm not close enough to it and I would be very circumspect about endorsing her going forward</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's it's recreational there's there's two Jack social media and Twitter in particular me you have like so it's I missed the whole Covington High School catholic Fiasco these people just watching their reputations by taking these by Kathy Griffin right basically for the doxxing of these kids you know given all that she has suffered enough of from from Mob Behavior online and she's you know whipping up around mob it was just nuts but what the platform is calling out of people that also when people have been shamed and they've done something awful then they reinforce their base like that now she's like his so heavily hardly because the right-wing rent after her like any one on the right has any think she's calling for her side to go after this person like reinforcing that she's a part of that tribe that she's a part of that left-wing tribe yeah yeah well it's so obviously everyone has a lot to lose all the facts are in in and if you just waited a beat me a New York Times got this wrong the New York Times that they have to send and the so then as the dust to settle in and I see these people some people are doubling down some people issuing public apologies I see somebody who's actually in a branded herself as we have one of my enemies for some reason I can't fathom but this journalist Kara Swisher who she works for recode and end in Vox now but it's got a big podcast and she's a bit can you please read a regular column for the New York Times she's a journalist and I happen to know she doesn't like me because she's tweeted against and she said some disparaging things about me on Twitter and we had a conversation about it but I saw her she said one of the most but suppurative and you know fairly crazy things in response to the kids initially and then once more information came out she walked it back and she basically apologized if you know are you cara I buy I just wanted to support this Norm of acknowledging that you got something wrong and I wanted to do it even I wanted to actually do it for someone who I know really doesn't like me like I mean that was an added bonus for me because that that's it that's another Norm that I think we should support this like like we should we should play fair even with our enemies and honestly I even with people who never play fair with me even some Glenn Greenwald just lied about me endlessly if I get something wrong about them I publicly apologize for it so I did this and to this was at the absolute 11th hour with respect to this this Scandal online when I saw the kind of pain I was getting just for a supporting Cara in her walk back of the same way at a moment when it was obvious she should have walked this back I got people saying you unsubscribing from you I guess you aren't you know now I know you're a f****** racist it was just I just pure pain and I just wow man that's you know it's like you just touch this thing at its very end and your ear you know it's that the Slime gets on you so yeah it is it's the medium feel like their opinions are being heard like they want their Penny to be heard they want to be heard right now it might not be a very well thought opinion but they know that they have the ability to blur it out and send it out and that that the ability to do that it's just intoxicating for folks and you talked about this with Jack there is a what what makes Twitter especially good for this is that everything has the same stature yeah your tweets no bigger than the other tweet that just called you in ASL block only you only write on Facebook right like I like how its setup he's like it's does a big did it differentiates between me and these f****** idiots who are commenting under their of although ironically I hate Facebook I can't even just a graphic design on Facebook I find so offensive that Facebook so I use it as a publishing Channel but you know I keep threatening in my own mind to just delete the account cuz I just don't who's christ-like you too but alive I know it's like YouTube but with people with their real names in man and everybody's trying to navigate this thing and figure it out as it goes along and not everybody's doing it well and I think this world is going to get more and more intrusive I think this is just the beginning I think we didn't see Twitter coming whatever comes after Twitter and this is one of things that I before the podcast I wanted to really talk to talk about to get his take on what he thinks is next on the line because there's going to be something that's more invasive it's going to be something that is more whether it's I think probably something in the line of augmented reality there were probably a decade away from something that makes this look like books look like you know what a f****** cork board at a bookstore we're living to the Golden Age of audio here I think probably something in the line of augmented reality like there were probably a decade away from something that makes this look like books look like you know what a f****** cork board at a bookstore although strangely we're living to the Golden Age of audio here so I can and

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> live and I'm not I'm not arguing they shouldn't be alive because it it it has a massive Advantage for you as well but it is there's a different feeling like you know if I knew that this was being taped and I could rethink the thing we're about to say about Liam Neeson or whatever it is yeah you know it's it's different and so but will it Liam Neeson story is a perfect don't tell that one I don't tell that one is I but I want to be honest like don't don't you could be honest with me I'm not going to judge you if you tell me that someone got raped and you went out with a baseball bat for a week looking for a black man to beat up I'll kill kill Jesus Christ man like what the f*** was going through your head that point I'm like that's terrible yeah like I feel awful about it I can't believe that was me but it didn't happen nothing happened and now you know people are racist and they don't want him in movies and this is fascinating to me because this is a much larger problem with with massive implications we need to think through the whole process of redemption for people in our society we have to understand what are the what are the criteria for successful apologies and for forgiveness because especially where in the world where people are are having their their reputations destroyed in their careers threatened for tweets they sent as teenagers things are not disappearing online anymore in a certain point everyone this is going to be a 360 panoptikon view of everyone's life you know they're people who have grown up on social media and everything is out there and the irony here for me is that you have in a progressive progressives and your people on the far left who receive a disclosure like you know Liam Neeson still still take his and they just want you know they just want to see him burned alive right Alyssa let's just do the Wicker man on this guy because this is this is so awful and yet alongside that the same people in the left are people who have is a as a genuine ethical Norm the rehab Tatian of murders you could be somebody who spent you know 20 years in prison for a crime you admit you committed and there's this Norm around Redemption and so there's there's no way to square those two things are constantly holding two contradictions right here's another one women's rights and support of the job I mean this is what's going on there how do you do that but also women's rights and gay rights okay well Eric Weinstein our mutual friend calls these the the Hilbert problems for social justice Warriors and David Hilbert was at the turn of the 19th century posed a set of problems in mathematics that on his list of the most desirable questions hardest question in the most consequential questions to answer and so you know Eric is being a mathematician put that around ironically said these are these are the questions and social justice Warriors have to answer in the end of these impossible opposition to the store but to the Liam Neeson thing and forgive me if I for some detail that has come out that I'm not aware of but my understanding of it is he and he had a friend who was raped and then he reported this state of mind that murder is state of mind he was in where he was walking around with a cough which word for like a smile metal club right like a blackjack or they like another term for I think and looking for a black eye to kill all your life doesn't hoping someone's going to come out of the woodwork and threaten him so that he could do no kill this guy in this act of instrumental violence because his friend have been raped by black guy writes like any black I will do no that's that's sort of like the extra horrific wrinkle to the story right now and he's confessing this as a symptom of transient mental illness at least as far as I know it's like a he's horrified by the fact that he was in the state of mind can you imagine an actor have everything to lose and although I don't remember what at what point is life he said this happened can you imagine that I was in the state of mind right and this is as you say it an all too honest disclosure it is damn interesting right and it is the kind of thing that we should be able to talk about right and it's not in the fact that this is becoming synonymous with racism seems just wrong given given how he's doing he described her at least how I've heard this because he's saying listen if this had been an Armenian guy or an Italian or Japanese guy I'd be looking for one of them what this was at least on his talent is but the virus of instrumental violence me the viola virus of like this and how every blood Feud it ever get in human history get start is like you like someone from your tribe killed my brother and now what I want to do is kill anyone from your truck right doesn't matter who that you clearly as toxic as it gets you know ethically but that's not racism right that's just that is the way we have a word for it since it's instrumental violence but you know yeah obviously he's getting totally pilloried over this but we need we just need to figure out how to talk about how people can redeem themselves once something this unsavory is is revealed about their past whether they reveal it or whether it's just found out about them or a black guy I mean 10 minutes apart of the other tribe nobody doesn't suggest that he has us a bit heated hose and he feels one way or another by black people so I can't like if you told me he could have said again it could have been an Irish guy right or could have of the tribe is what he was reacting to at least in his description I don't know why you wouldn't take him at his word given that he didn't have to say any of this in the first place right now like this is a pleasingly honest and unnecessary disclosure but it's and I don't think people would think of it as racism If he if the story simply was you know she got raped by a cop and I was just hoping to go kill a cop right story and so yeah but we're so trigger-happy in our outrage with respect to anything like why do you think that is like what it what is going on because outrage seems to be more in season than it's ever been in my lifetime I don't remember outrage being so just such a it's it's it's recreational Trigger Happy in our outrage with respect to anything like why do you think that is like what it what is going on because outrage seems to be more in season than it's ever been in my lifetime I don't remember outrage being so just such a it's it's it's recreational</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> care more for podcast and I feel like I personally I bet it is it as much as out of concern for my guess as well like I just you know this a high-wire act but I want a net normally so that people feel free to be totally unguarded because I know that if we have a spaz attack we can you know we can you know even order in Spanish attack was Crusoe some people's careers talk to you about one of your podcast started it over yeah. It didn't work try this again let's just start from scratch that went completely into the ditch for the first half-hour me just brutal and and I said listen to this a real it was a good conversation for us to have here and now I know how badly this can go or I should like now I know just where the track is I have to struggle to keep the train and so we're going to reboot when I start again and we'll see what happens and you're the podcast was was not perfect and I got some criticism for it but people didn't understand that we were like being a we had a you know we had I'd seen the pit of alligators and didn't want to fall into it made more sense though when you told me that before you even got to go through a half an hour of back-and-forth yeah I think people need to understand what it's like to do one of these things too because you know you do it so often it becomes pretty and you're so good at talking you're such a good orator and you're so articulate that it comes off smooth and easy just having a conversation with someone but you're always considering the fact that people are listening to this you're always saying how do I how do I get more out of him or her how do I take this in and how do I get this person to expand upon this how do I you know how do I make this make something out of this thing that I felt Jack cuz he was talking in this way and we're we're really working hard on fixing all these issues in like oh Jesus I got to change my gears here and try to figure out cuz like it's almost like we have to restart again every time a question be answered he would stop talking and I'll go okay but really I'm that kind of speaker so it you know that wasn't a problem and I didn't know what he talked like I've never heard him talk ever so hearing him talk there and in talking to him live you know I mean some people are f****** effortless Elon took a while but going to start drinking now that was brutal what I lay down Penny but you wanted it cuz you want we did y'all be on Joe's Podcast Thursday night at 9 whenever I can answer but you know I'm mad I didn't want you guys to go live right I wanted I wanted you to both have a chance to say wait a minute is smoking a blunt really the thing we want to go in there so you know you didn't take my advice and it was what it was by the time the weed came out as we were drinking from the beginning of the podcast two or three glasses of whiskey before the weed came out nobody cared the fact that the CEO of Tesla was drunk no one cared about that I mean wasn't drunk but I don't know that was obvious they saw that you were drinking whiskey with wooden Ware was in his life at that moment because it's okay cuz that's what that podcast showcased at least for the first on a 90 minutes was just how many user interface problems you could have with the Elan right like he's not he's not always like that by any stretch and he can give a very loose interview Andy but you were working on the you is just absolutely heroic work trying to keep that conversation happening but once we got loose yeah that was good I was still as I can he was just in a space that he may he was so massively stressed and so overworked and just you know fires everywhere that had to be put out and so I just let you know as a friend I just felt like okay this is for the wrong time to be doing this and this is so I just felt you know it just tell them lucky to me so because he's again women in many of the moments and he can be a circumstance where I was looking at the comments right you know and I was seeing if these are people who are basically reading him as somebody who is much Stranger Than in fact he he ever is and I could see why they were doing that because he the guy he just seemed in a very stressed space and his life what was interesting he was very differently first got here versus when the light came on when he first got here he pulls being a very stressed space in his life what was interesting he was very differently first got here versus when the mic came on right when he first got here he pulls out the f****** blowtorch and starts shooting this flamethrower in the middle of the hallway and we're laughing and she's going to be easy this is great I'm just trying to massage it and get them get them get them going</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Haitian are in discussions right now and I talked to you about this to about building a nap and what I want to do with the app is have a set amount of money that you pay per month if you want to sign up for the app and you get the podcast with no ads so you can either get it from iTunes or whatever you Google play or Google podcast or you can get it from the app and if you get it from the app you pay x amount per month and you get the podcast with zero ads and it'll stream live Mo to figure out a way to do both those things my thought going into advertising when when a person to podcast I've been doing the podcast now for 9 years when I first started doing it there's no ads for the longest time it just cost money it cost money to for pan with it cost money put up what I was doing it for fun and I didn't care and I had my Revenue was coming from other sources a few years ago I decided what I was going to do was because I was getting add will the first add request was a Facebook was the flashlight rather and you were the first person on earth did not have the flashlight on your pocket the first podcast that we did nothing Primadonna we would get ridiculous significant positive impact from that mean their business went through the roof because of the podcast I mean they're really sold a shitload of flashlights where they told me that some ungodly number like 50% of the flashlight they were selling was code word Rogan podcast advertisers tentatively My Philosophy and it's still hold it was like 2006 or 7 or 11 but my philosophy getting into advertisement was I'm going to do whatever the f*** I want to do a hundred percent and have no impact whatsoever on the content of my podcast like whatever advertisers that I choose whatever advertisers that make deals with they have to understand that there's no way I'm changing the content of the podcast and if I lose them I lose them I don't care and that was the thought process going in so I never hit a snag like this cash app Jack Dorsey thing before where people think that the reason why I was easy with him was because of the fact that he sponsored the podcast it's a very obvious conflict of interest but people have to realize that if they churn out off your podcast you've got just an endless number of advertisers waiting did they they buy a lot of ads they do buy a lot of ads we do have a good relationship with them but I don't need them they went away I have too many ads that sounds gross to say but it is a fact I have many more ads and I have spots for ads so if they went away would not hurt me at all financially because I put a limit on how many as I do per podcast I also don't ever interrupt a podcast within that I don't do that and because I don't do that. Cost me money but I just feel like billions of listening to a podcast unbroken is so much better than listening to podcast we'll be right back with this word from Casper mattresses you know it just feels gross but in the beginning I'm like look you know where it is you can fast-forward but maybe you're into this. Maybe you need stamps.com maybe whatever the f*** you need that those are the ads they pay a lot of money I'm going to take that money and I'm going to do whatever the f*** I want and if these guys decide do you smoke pot or you're too kind Marshall are you talk about this or talk about that we're going to drop you okay that's my philosophy I've lost that I've lost sponsors okay I don't care but gets done lost the cash out cuz I was too hot hard on Jack Dorsey or of Jack Dorsey comes back and I'm too hard on him and Grilling him about these people that have been censored I hope it doesn't but I like them in fact I'm having Tim pool come on tomorrow Tim pools and investigative journalists independent journalist who was advice and he knows a lot about the censorship issue with YouTube or with with Twitter brother and he knows why YouTube is well but with who censored and why who is removed who is bendy platform why did bendy platform and where the inconsistencies and you know where why why is it skewing so heavily right where the people the right of the ones were getting banned the people in the left to get away with a lot of crazy s*** so we're going to get into the weed with that and if the cash app how to drop me as a sponsor I don't care I really don't care this is a major source of income for me but it's only one source is one of things of being a stand-up comedian working for the UFC and having a podcast never podcast with ads on YouTube and and having ads that are on the regular podcast self I'm free in a sentence to I have plenty of money it's not whether or not starving or worry about paying my bills I'm free to do whatever I want to do but also I should be clear like I do cuz I sound totally sanctimonious and it's not intended that way I don't think my Scruples around at reading it as I my podcast apply to you or or Tim Ferriss or many other people at me like that Tim is the ultimate example Tim is somebody whose brand on some level is what I'm going to do is I'm going to go out there and find the best s*** in the world the best shirts the best workout equipment and I'm going to tell you about it is reading an ad for something you know that is totally brand conversion for him and I think you're very much in a similar situation if you're talking about on at whatever dismiss p018b you own part of on it right to a lot of ads that I don't want there was one there was a uber for babysitting till I quite a few some of them that are just boring I might do not read that that's stupid but also you're a comic who can send up ads on me so I climatic Bill Burr does this what are you kind of trash is the ad as he's everything any that's part of the time because that he lost NatureBox cuz he told people to go eat apples you can stream live without really worried about it and I feel like can't like so is like a meet you at the end of the day like as if things go completely Haywire on your podcast you can stay with them if I can comment what do I know right you that like you can just pull the ripcord and you're fine right I can't do that I feel like can't like so is like at the end of the day like if things go completely Haywire on your podcast you can say was I'm a f****** comment what do I know right you'd like you can just pull the ripcord and you're fine right I can't do that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you're the way you do yours you used to use patreon and now use your own website after the Sargon of akkad incident with him you nobly step back away from patreon now or not so no played it but whatever you think of Sargon of akkad like what's happening in this is much bigger than even podcast and I think I should know what you feel about this if you have you are the quintessence of the successful ad model Indian podcasting raised like it's working fantastically well for you and for people like Tim Ferriss and it probably Marc Maron the Minnesota there's some great and I am a really also a highly successful example of the the support model is like the PBS model of the NPR model and what's weird is it I can't like that we you know you and I are both surrounded by people who have podcast want to have podcasts and asking us for advice about how to succeed and how to monetize and I'm not even in a place where I can recommend my model to anyone else right because it's it's a very very hit-or-miss I just happen to have developed an audience they will support my work and you had developed that audience previously ironically enough on YouTube there's a lot of YouTube We address for the Bates or random if he had put in people putting my content on their YouTube channel and or or not and I found that I'm have two things to to say you're fairly strongly against dad's but we're the only one of them applies to me and I don't think it applies to you or Tim or anyone else I'm I just felt personally I couldn't use ads because of such as what my platform is and and the kind of topics I'm engaging and it just didn't work then it was nothing highbrow enough where I felt like my credibility wasn't getting subtly undermine by by shillingford Elijah's legit love to make it up in the Oxford English Dictionary and I like you guys is the best dictionary in the world you guys should use it I still couldn't do it and I might ride it with the only thing I took on as a sponsor was Audible and I did that for some weeks and then just you know I love audible put but it it just felt wrong and so I decided to just experiment with a different business model and it's working for me but it's I don't think I can work for most people and I thought I view that as a problem in it I think is as interesting as if there is much bigger than podcast and so you have like you have Facebook on the one hand which is just a it totally free platform were aware that the users don't even realize that they're not the customers their the actual product write the uses are the users are having their attention sold to advertisers and it's enormous business and on the other end of the digital Spectrum you have Netflix which is just a start pay well right and there's no way in but to pay the subscription and you know that's attending a Netflix could run ads and get more money if they wanted to put their they're not doing that and presumably won't do that and I'm hoping just generally speaking at the digital future looks much more like Netflix and much less like Facebook and cuz I see at what adds has had to done is they've anchored everyone to the illusion of free everyone expects visual content for free except in places like Netflix rice I like it when you release a comedy special and you really release your next hour and you sell it to net Netflix I would imagine they're very few people in your fanbase who are thinking will f*** Joe Rogan why didn't he just put that out on YouTube right why is is on Netflix they start understanding this piece of content is belongs on that shelf and that if they want it they have to subscribe Netflix where is if you did something slightly different between a functionally the same if you put it on Vimeo and charge people $5 or whatever in Vimeo on demand I think you'll get a lot more pain right at your people would say will f*** you you crazy bastard like you you're already doing great just release your stuff right now and I do that as a problem it's like it's like a psychological problem people have been anchored to the ads subsidized model more lies everywhere and they expect everything for free and in my world find to just to continually Brook that expectation and push people into a different sense of you get what you pay for and ended the so that the hybrid model I have created for myself is I'm putting more stuff behind a paywall right and it said that this is not just pure sponsorship of otherwise pretty content but I'm personally I'm very uncomfortable with the idea that if someone actually can't afford it they can't get access to my car do I just tell people if you really can't afford the stuff behind my pay while you really can't afford my medication app just send us an email and we'll give it to you for free right so yeah I heard that you can't afford this everything is too cheap in the individual space I think I think we're anchored to I'm in there people who will spend $5 a day on a cup of coffee everyday for the rest of their lives and yet if you told them this podcast or this app that they that they say is incredibly valuable to them is going to cost them $5 a month they they feel raped right now so it's completely understand it because I know what it's like to hit up a wall and think play I can't get my credit card out again I'm not going to pay for this I'll going to find this information somewhere else so we've all been anchored to this thing and you know something is going to win in the end I'm at you know I think at some point you know it's going to look much more like Netflix or much more like Facebook and I'm throwing my lot in with the former but now it's it really is the wild west will the Netflix things different because Netflix has programs that cost a lot of money to create this podcast is very easy I'm referring to call you out pay want to do a podcast you coming over here I mean obviously we got to pay for all this equipment but other than that just and bandwidth and rant and all that stuff but other than that just goes up right where do you do a comedy special across hundreds of thousands of dollars you have to secure a venue you have to hire staff made it's a big deal you know it's that's in that's an easy thing in terms of like bang for their buck with what Netflix will get out of it if you do a television show me my God and you need to hire hundreds of people there is wardrobe and makeup and set and there's writers and producers and executive never have to go over the script with a fine-tooth comb it's incredibly incredibly strenuous is a lot going on when you create a television like stranger things or something like that I know you have so much special effects and so to ask for that for free seems to be to me seems ridiculous but even if it is just a podcast if you want to build something if you want to build a media company like either like or like let's say you were let's say you were asking for support for this otherwise free pot podcast people don't know what your aspirations are me maybe you want to start a podcast Network right maybe you had your trying to build a business that is that maybe you have massive payroll expenses that you notice of the expectation that the product should always be free clothes the door to any of those aspirations if in fact you have them and you know it's like I mean it is very interesting psychologically because so I can so I have I created this network of support for my podcast but I see people do calculations that they would never do in a more transactional space if they were just buying my next book right so like for me offering a free podcast and then saying if you diable you can support it right that from the side of being a creator of that content it feels like Leaf the most transparent interaction possible because a person can listen for free for as long as they want to just discovered how valuable this and then they can support it to the degree that it they find it valuable where is it from selling you a book you can't even read the book before you before you buy it right have to make the decision to buy it and I'm trying to convince you to buy it because it took me all this time to write it and and you know you're you know it is is transactional with but with the podcast people make calculations that they would never make when they're just figuring out whether they want to buy something slight like a really long line what you just described people say well how much does a podcast cost to produce rather like if I knew what you were spending the money on and what it cost you to do this podcast will then I would support you right but they're never saying how much cost to write a book and if I knew what you were going to spend the money on once you want to work at once it once I bought this book then I would know whether or not I wanted to buy to either want the book are you don't write the problem with the support mod on this the problem with patreon everything else is that getting gauge is the sort of the philanthropy charity side of the brain right and people are worried about what you're going to do and how much at all cause I how much does is my cost right now like that that's that's a question if someone is asking when they're doing you went and donating and the problem there is there not understanding you know just the opportunity cost I got you know I have to decide how to spend my time am I going to spend 90% of my time on a podcast will that if so that closes the door to virtually everything else I can do right so it's you know it has to become a viable business and so am I I've recognized now that I'm going against the grain of human psychology asking for support and now I now I feel like I'm going to ask much less a man but I'm going to tell people at the business model isn't and you know and still look and remind them of it but I'm personally I'm going to go more and more than in the direction of putting stuff behind up a wall and if people want it then they can support and it starts and what it would be if it were Netflix that would also let you get it for free if you really couldn't afford it and if people want it then they can support and it starts in what kind of Netflix the ultimate version of it would be if it were Netflix that would also let you get it for free if you really couldn't afford it I like it I like how you thinking I'd like the ethics involved in it and I think it's a great thing and when you set it on your podcast I was shocked but it makes sense coming from you</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let's get right into the Jack stuff that was in your podcast with Jack and I found something very when I did my podcast with Jack first of all was not anticipating the blowback that I received it was her Dunning but he would I thought was I was going to have a conversation with this guy be fun see what it's like to run this gigantic Network that helps people communicate and helps people communicate and distribute information world what is it like to start something like that up and have it become what it is like how have you managed to try to keep up with it and what are the headaches pain and apparently people online particular the people they want to comment about this all they wanted to know about censorship and that was an issue with me there was a question with me but it came of far is a far bigger question for people online they felt like that I tossed him softball questions and that I didn't press him yeah and then I listen to your podcast and one about Jack is very smart guy very nice guy buddy talks in a very slow and methodical way when you ask him a question he takes these routes and if you don't want to jump in and press them like you're in this weird situation where he's not totally answering your question but he's talking about the same subject that you talked like print since you brought Louis Farrakhan like how is Louis Farrakhan a good standing on a platform and someone like you know Phil Milo yiannopoulos or Laura Loomer whoever it was Biggie kicked off he never got to that he went around and around and around with you and he recognize this after the podcast I received a lot of blowback he received a lot of blowback so I contacted him and he said he would be more than happy to come back on again and an address all these things and I said okay what I'd like to do is address specific instances of people being censored and he said okay what I'll do is I'll bring in someone from the funny that's in charge of that stuff so I'm starting to put together a picture of what it's like to be a CEO of something is big and he's also CEO of square he's runs the cash app is a lot of stuff going on that right so he's obviously busy how much day-to-day involvement does he actually have and who gets censored in why they get censored and how much is he willing to share about that so we're going to find out in the next follow-up podcast but I got accused of everything from being a shill to cock being out and there's also an issue that you managed to avoid wisely so of advertising the cash option advertising on my podcast so because the cash option advertising on my podcast write the man had you by the throat and ask all those great questions that we cute up the reality is those are the questions I would have asked now that's hard to say because no one's going to believe it but those are the questions I was asked and I try not to be too confrontational with aghast but in I probably could have pressed more particularly on people like Kathy Griffin calling for doxxing for the kid with Maga hat on with the Native American doors does a quite a few but I noticed that but what was your experience like with it and I have a different interviews because they were time differently at least a week 7 in jackass was like 2 weeks before I released it so I did my interview with him before this flurry of interviews with him came out of his Rolling Stone interview there was nothing out there so I had no real examples of how he dealt with these questions or how we talked yeah yeah because I'm one of the greats he died I didn't know what his boilerplate was and and how he would he would answer any of these questions and your podcast came up before mine did but mine was mine was before the Covington High School catholic so the real missed opportunity for me was just a matter of time and I got this thing put such a fine point on everything that's wrong with Twitter and the way journalism interacts with it right now I farted Manju Road. Bethany art I'm saying Twitter is destroyed journalism in the end and it was not a crazy iPad in fact after the Covington thing and I'll use that and then Kathy Griffin would have been a perfect example to talk about it like we know why she's still on if he's calling for the Dachshund right yeah but I think I had a substantially similar interview with him that you did because he's the two things one he's great at sort of pure wedding around the sharp pointy question of you know when what is the policy and why why are you applying it in this seemingly disparate way and it seems to skew politically in One Direction all the time right but you'll I think you also you know I did and I think you did naturally we cut him some slack in that he's the CEO of these two corporations he can't be expected to actually know what happened every one of these micro cases like I think I brought up the case of I think her name is Megan Murphy I mean I hadn't even heard of her before a lesbian woman that she was like a feminist to said so the wrong thing in the transgender space you said something like men or not women right and she got banned and life or I think it was temporary and obviously can't know exactly what happened in that case it would be surprising to me where is the fact that he doesn't have his finger on each one of these cases and what the what the rationale was and he has this sort of generic answer that what you're seeing you know in public is not necessarily what we're seeing and vacuum in virtually every actionable case is not what we're seeing in private with respect to how these people are open opening multiple accounts and doing seemingly nefarious stuff behind the scenes know whether that is true I don't know but I imagine just say Jack seemed one I like them and he seemed unusually open to talk about anything I wanted to talk about as I saw one allegation that got a hold of you is that you know you must have been constrained by the topics you couldn't touch in advance you must have had some agreement with Him in Advance you know it didn't happen with me right now no discussion whatsoever about what was off limits when you streaming live and and me not I tell him I guess listen if at any point in this interview you put your foot in your mouth or I put my foot in there we can edit it right like we are you I want you I want you to be totally happy with what you say over the next two or three hours so if you have to take something again take it again and you know we'll just hide the same as we go now that virtually never happens right and in Jack's case there wasn't even a wrinkled like that so but you know what you know I recognized as a high-wire act for a lot of these people especially if someone is running to publicly traded companies right and you know it was when I invited him on I said I said jacket DM on Twitter I promise I'm not going to make you smoke a blunt on video that got him so I don't know how you got him but I did try to get him about it I mean I get from their anticipation why it would be disappointing I just thought it was kind of boring I thought my podcast with him just wasn't very good I sometimes do too many podcasts and when I sometimes do too many podcast I think I run low on juice and I'm not as I don't know I'm not as engaged or I'm not as fired up about it and maybe I just should have definitely should have prepared more for him but I really thought it was just going to be conversation about what it's like and I thought that would be really easy to do because it's such a position to be running something like Twitter but he you know I don't know if he was evasive because he didn't know the things or because you didn't want to talk about the things but there was things like he didn't know exactly why Alex Jones was ultimately banned he didn't he couldn't recall or didn't know now is that because you couldn't recall is because you want to talk about it or is it because he didn't remember it I mean I don't know mean you'd have to you have to be inside his head to get that answer clearly got a a very practice line that he uses to answer these questions and I'm going to let you know I know what it's like to have boilerplate now you know I've been on a book to her and you're just basically going to ask the same questions again and again and here he's getting asked fairly pointed questions about you know where Twitter is going and he's got but it has this inability to close the door to further inquiry because he he gives you the full Maricopa right up front you ask me like what what's what's the situation with you know the seemingly asymmetrical Banning of people and he'll say you know yeah we really and me we got to get much better at communicating our process we're not nearly transparent enough with this whole thing is in disarray and my job is to fix it and we're going to get better I promise you Bend right but actually but it's not a lot to get right on that it right in an interview and I guess so I don't think it's nefarious I think it could well be totally honest but it does have this this effect of you just keep reaching a brick wall that you know was going to be there now navigate that very well and that was a big part of the blowback CO2 blowback was accentuated when I found out that he sponsors me raise the cash app is one of his businesses and it's sponsored the podcast yeah yeah well I had a very similar result and I don't have that that problem so I see you know that I don't think that diagnoses your situation at all but Ice is very interesting and it's a difference between these business the business models under which we run our podcasts and just a different image just every choice you make and how to produce a podcast I essentially made the opposite one another. Streaming live like this the fact that you're so that this is just all very interesting to make some kind of a reluctant student of digital media now because I just going to stumble into this wild west that you know you and large part have invented right I mean this podcast in space was nothing and now we got Spotify in a buying up and it says like a land grab for audio Yeah that we were talking about that before the podcast they just purchased some company was it was it called for some ungodly amount of money spend 500 this year something and so it's it's this would all just making this up and you know I make and you know I just released a meditation app which is a different business model still as now I have these kind of two parallel digital business is happening in my life and it's it is very interesting the decisions you make are forced to make and the consequences of it until like the fact that we're having this conversation live you don't even have to think about what you're going to get this right Morganite when we're done we're going to turn off the Mike's and walk out of here and your job is done with my podcast that's not the workflow at all and I totally Envy this is approach that you have but for a variety of reasons I feel like I can't take it in in my life and so it's so it but it is very different hit that dictates many choices you know down the line which there's a positive and negative but it's in a deposit what you hear is what we got and we're done after we turn these mics off and that's and that's not you know that's not how I podcast visual element of it individual element of it in initially was almost like a side effect I mean when we first started it out visually but then when it started going to iTunes iTunes aspect of it became the focus the audio version of it rather became the focus but then we decided to stream on YouTube and put it up on YouTube and put it was totally not profitable just for for a goof like I will have the video on why not some people like video it was one of those things but then you realize ultimately that YouTube becomes a viable source of Revenue and then it's also the way a lot of people like to watch it you know and they also like to watch because they can comment under it it was the other thing that came out of the Jack podcast we got into a controversy about comments in about how comments are deleted or how they're they're shown in Hidden and what happens cuz people are accusing Jamie I'm deleting all the derogatory comments that we don't touch anything we don't we don't delete any of them we don't do anything to them we just leave him up there and it's a mostly acceptable but not a good podcast there's a lot of crazy s*** that happens on these things but from what we think and Jamie correct me if I'm wrong you think that was going on is that people are marking other people's post as spam there's that and then Brandon also has a theory that a lot of alt right people are tar by the algorithm that YouTube uses like an inn in one case there was a guy with a Pepe the Frog Avatar and he said like his his, immediately went to spam and that the other thing is that the comments are curated depending upon who is watching it and what account it'll be doubly different sort of propagate different comments to the top it's not a this you can't actually change it if you if you prefer to see the most new comment I front of your own person right here when you're watching you you as a viewer for user of YouTube have to make that actual yeah so that exact conspiracy theory just heightens the whole thing right okay now they're deleting negative comments I don't like doing bad podcast but I will be the first one to tell you when I think a podcast sucked that podcast was definitely disappointing it wasn't good mine wasn't it was like I said I want to listen to hello it wasn't like he and I were just shooting the s*** having a good time was it take that one decision so you have decided to make video main component of this podcast will probably a small percentage of your actual listens anymore it's gotten to the 50-50 that may one day change but because I don't I don't care what's happening on YouTube right so I never see the comments and whenever I look it is as you say a cesspool it's insane to me YouTube is just accused massively right excuse had just massively mail and it probably seems very young to so you have it just totally just like Millennial alt-right craziness right act like as I say these sentences your YouTube page is blowing up with hate for me right now you got a bunch of Millennials and gen right now able to wear yet but I mean it's got to be younger than than most of of where I go for so I'm not even seeing most common threads they could possibly respond to anything I put out there now I don't even look at my at mentions for the most prized spend maybe five minutes a day looking at that's healthy what is coming back to me but you were actually helpful and and reformatted my brain on that on that topic but so because I don't see any of that stuff and then maybe I'm getting a lot of pain for my Dorsey interview but I don't even know about it right send it so I'm not having I don't feel like I have to course-correct in response to anything now and in large measure it is a consequence of just this decision that you know I inadvertently made that I'm just I don't have a video component to my podcast at the moment and so I'm not I'm not spectating on that you know that the feedback on YouTube will the feedback thing is interesting because we were just talking about this before the show that with feedback and comments on YouTube essentially anyone can comment and if you don't go Banning people from which we don't do we wouldn't do some was totally a piece of s*** but we don't so you essentially have this open Forum so it's like almost like a message board where people you just for the comment and it's unlike Twitter in that regard because Twitter just you know you get abusive and shity on Twitter they just get rid of you if you get abusive in chitty on Instagram or on Facebook Facebook they'll just get rid of you but if you are on YouTube and you're in those comments you can kind of get away with more solid imagine that people that don't appreciate censorship and want to just just f****** spew out whatever is on their mind that would be a place they would go especially to the same product essentially the only thing different in this is about thing where it got confusing with the YouTube people versus the audio people with the audio people it's very obvious that the cash app is a sponsor because it's we say it this podcast is brought to you by the cash app where is in YouTube we don't put the ads on YouTube We there's ads that YouTube puts on the we put the ads on it like after the show is over I'll read the ads and we'll insert those into the audio and that will go up to iTunes and RSS feeds and all that stuff so the stuff that's on YouTube it's abbreviated in the sense that especially the live one doesn't have anything so like this has zero at and then the ones that'll be posted on YouTube later alive YouTube ads so that's what this whole there was a couple of in that regard is also apparently in emerging conspiracy theory about that Jack was trying to pump up Bitcoin because they have some sort of a bit coin deal if you heard this one at any point it's still right around $3,500 so if there was a pump and dump scheme of some sort then like it should be shaped like provable in a box and I guess I don't know what did Wally said was that the cash app sells Bitcoins we talked about Bitcoin that you can buy and sell Bitcoin through the cash app I should say I think you said something about blockchain technology rendering everything permanent online and then it was something different comments into anything blog posts blockchains essentially going to have everything online forever but there's so many f****** conspiracy theories about all sells Bitcoins we talked about Bitcoin that you can buy and sell Bitcoin through the cash app I should say about blockchain technology rendering everything permanent online and then comments into anything blog posts blockchains essentially going to have everything online forever but there's so many f****** conspiracy theories about all the stuff it's it's fascinating</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I want to f****** everything up like Galapagos Island sure you're familiar with the Judas Judas goats Judas go to the other ones in the Galapagos do you know how they do that Raticate goats it's really interesting helicopters they castrate goats like to hang out together right but sometimes hard to locate them a radio collar on one go they castrate it and then they let it loose and they gunned down all the goats around it and let that go. Go find the rest of goats NOAA goes and finds the ghost in the gun down those girls cuz they have the radio collar yeah so these what is this James a picture of a Judas goat I guess so you don't shoot it out exactly why quarantine for 48 hours wow I mean it's the dawn of evolution Darwin came up with the theory of evolution do the finches it's it has been destroyed in some aspects and it's been the habitat has been fixed in a lot of places there's been great conservation efforts and personally I love what they're doing because they're trying to keep it pristine tastic that there's a quarantine I think it's great that I'm not supposed to eat seeds for two weeks before going there and it's it's to keep it as perfect as it is now the island that I'm going to with with my small team has like nobody ever step foot on its active volcano erupts every year it's is crazy harsh-environment got to have a new pair of boots every day cuz it melts melting shred your boots just walking on it been described as hell on Earth so I'm stuck it's so the guy was telling me it's like 45° Celsius so that's well over a hundred and yeah and that's you know we got to be careful that water and hiking and there's just there's a lot of elements but that's the thing is I'm looking for an animal Nobody seen in a very long amount of time so you got to go to these places nobody's going wow that's incredible it's it's interesting the idea of invasive species to write because like Hawaii is a good example why there's been talk of getting rid of pigs and a lot of the natives alike will slow down because if they're what we hunt them we eat them and if they're invasive then what are we right the pigs were here right around the same time that people were there and they existed together that they need each other and its culture you know what that point it's it's Polynesian culture to eat a fire roasted pig and hunt your pig and so it's a delicate balance like Hawaii is a perfect example destroyed the birds and Turtles are frogs all kinds of things have been brought in there but none of those are culturally significant where is the pig as you're saying is a huge cultural significance so where is the balanced well one of the best examples of that would be like Lanai cuz Lanai has it's insane population of axis deer and we here we go and bow hunting there every year there. Delicious and Yep they're plentiful and it's one of the most really ethical hunt cuz you have to hunt them there or so overpopulated people and have you ever been till the night I had absolutely they did that to decide to let deer loose on an island with nothing to eat the deer but people right and then when this is done is like King Kamehameha which is what year was that a long time ago long time ago so back down there and how are they hunting these things back then and they brought him over from Asia right yep there from Asia Hunter's Paradise Animal thing they took moose in the New Zealand they took like 10 of them small population believe that they've been hunted out another shot the last one bottle. There's one guy crazy looking dude long hair long beard like nuts looking guy and he's been on the hunt not hunt hunt but like trying to prove that the New Zealand Moussa still there he's found antler sheds he's not betting sites a picture of one standing on a rock and you know moose to me at 100% of moose so they're in fiery somewhere down to South Island there's one or two or three of the super elusive moose that have been in New Zealand for like 50 years wow he is special with The Rock's real slippery and it's just like cold as s*** and get really high altitude and you've seen them before right you look at in your like that's not a real creature like some kid drew that yeah like a big old Shaggy weird looking thing yeah that's the last one that was Tate last picture taken in 1952 years ago and I look like I don't know who sang It's not but it's from 1952 that's a hundred percent of my freaking mu that's no doubt about it you know what I'm saying what do you think that is exactly a rubber moves that someone stuck there and they like arguing that somebody could a computer-generated ridiculousness</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> adaptation I think it's one of the more interesting things about this planet definitely is these weird organisms that are trying to figure out their way to to survival you know and then we're moving and changing and we're always finding new ones like I found a f****** snake I posted it up on Twitter like a week or so ago a snake that has a tail that looks like a fake spider I think it's from a Ron Viper scale pit vipers that it right this thing moves its tail and it perfectly Blends into the rock around it like look at that unlimited amount of camouflage adaptation like how does that happen it's incredible it's it's play creatures can create that without you doing it knowingly some some handful of snakes at one time start wagging their tail and realizing the birds came in and then over generational time does Taillow evolve little spikes in little things and all the sudden you have this whole population of animals that look like that grow something like that a lure of its head do you want to eat it cuz I want all my God is kind of worm thing literally has like a fishing worm like a bass worm I mean it's it's so amazing all this adaptation and all these look at that f****** monster the light grow and he's got a flashlight how much adaptation there is and how all these things sort of work together right like there's the bacteria and the fungi I am your plant life in the animal life and the predators and prey and atolls or two words together and when something doesn't work is cancer drops off and then the system to reset itself in a new order I mean to me there is nothing you say it's why most fascinating things to me there is nothing more fascinating like I'm obsessed with it I live for it because I find it so interesting now when you study these things and do you ever try to think like how the f*** that happen I see that that spider tailed snake is there anyone that has like an idea like that this was you know this was just a lucky break that this one snake had a freaky tale and then he got the f*** a lot 98 a lot of birds one or two or three snakes kind of got this adaptation just a random random genetic sequencing that led to maybe a white blotch on the tail something unique although it seems like the fashioned it but over time over at they did but over Millennia right over thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of yours the one what happened with say there's two snakes with a white spot on their tail then they have a baby and it has little bit of deformation write a little thing sticking out then that snake all of a sudden catch more birds than the rest of the snakes. Snakes reproduce Offspring and its offspring that has a little bit bigger of a spike catches more birds and sewed those become the the prized animals to reproduce with continue to gene pool and so that's what happened to keeps evolving like a peacock right crazy big tail that it's attracting mates with its not useful to the bird you know that's entirely made for Showmanship for peacocking if you will and it over generational time it gets bigger and crazier and more elaborate more colorful and the females literally flock to him and that the animal that continues on what I really wish there was a way and maybe there will be some time in the future where they're going give the show you would like some sort of a supercomputer sequencing will there be able to look at the DNA of this thing to say oh this is the exact progression tries to start off with in this is what it became right this is how some sketchy looking for some chicken became a peacock. You know this is how some freaky snake became perfectly adapted to its environment I mean that thing looks exactly like a rock that its source on perfect perfectly adapted to its environment I mean that thing looks exactly like a rock that its source on perfect since it is incredible like I would I'm like you I'd love to know who patient zero is you know who's the who's the first one to look at that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the extinct some animals thank you what like what it what is currently going on right now they're calling it The Dawn of the extinction and it's a it's a lot of very very intelligent genetic scientists that are trying to isolate specific genes that are specific to the animals that have been extinct and putting them into extant animals animals that are still here to basically May Miss Frankenstein animal cuz it'll never be the animal that's gone right it will look like it'll behave like it'll think like it excetera but it will never actually be the animal that we've lost at least not yet we haven't we don't have that technology right now what we can do is isolate a genome put into an existing animal that gives birth to an animal that looks and acts very much like the extinct down but it it's some degree different because it's like part of a mammoth friends right they would have to take some DNA from a mammoth right that they would say another get and introduce it to an embryo but we have an elephant in the elephant would give birth to a very hairy very large tusks like these isolated genetic codes elephant run it would look like a mammoth it would act like a mammoth but the reality is it's a Shaggy elephant with big tusks right so if you did like 23andMe on it it would show all it's mostly elephants but it's a little bit of a mammoth have these little bars in the middle of it so what they do this is a very crude way to explain it but they pull out a bar from an elephant and they put in a bar from a mammoth and then eventually you get this Mammoth until this would be looks like Gene editing tools like Crispers a killing those lines exactly wow and so how far away are they from doing this it's I mean it's been successfully down a couple of times they've given birth to animals that are very very close to the most of the time there problems right there's it's infertile its it has lung issues whatever it is there's a couple different cases I'm not a geneticist I'm a wildlife biologist so I don't really understand it but it's they've done it they have successfully reproduced things that are gone basically clone things and then the animal hasn't made it to adulthood and that seems really really like playing God doesn't feel like I mean because they can is it one of those things or is there a like a real valid scientific reason for trying to reintroduce these animals are the extinct them valid reason is to conserve ecosystem right like we talked about what we are saying it's just that that quest for knowledge the can we do it the Innovation right can we play God can we fix it can we take this thing that's gone and say no it's not like we have the tools to make it knocked on ya there some article that I read where they were talking about reintroducing the mammoth to Siberia and that there would be some ecological benefit to reintroducing the mammoth because of the way they forage for food or they would have some sort of an effect on global warming about that I don't know about that specifically reintroducing the mammoth to Siberia to benefit the environment to Accurate or not until you put on the ground but how do we it's a great Theory and that's what science is right it's coming up with hypothesis and then trying to prove them and it sounds cool like do I want to see a mammoth walking around Siberia f*** yeah but does that mean it's actually good for the world hard to say could bringing back Mammoth help stop climate change scientists say creating hybrids of extinct bees can fix the Arctic tundra and stop greenhouse gas emissions I don't understand that I find it hard to believe to be honest maybe it's just some scientist clever way of sneaking it in because he wants to play so yeah we're going to fix everything give me the money scientist right right new Joe Rogan is a scientist how are you going to make your career are you going to make your career by raising money through being like yeah sure like I'll study Cricket legs or you going to be like look give me the money to stop global warming my bringing back f****** mammoths like Rhino like why you can make the outrageous claim if you think it's going to find your research but that's how you make your bones and that's that's one of the sad realities of some certainly not all science</div>

Carl nose on a doctor thinks it was Carl Harmon Carl something harmonica and he's a wildlife photographer and we set up a bunch of camera traps and he got 101 walking Tomatoes it's freaking is some photos of these gentlemen that shot one near an airstrip and it's f****** huge the men are real they might be small and they are in front of them but it is without a doubt like when the biggest chimpanzees you've ever seen a lion and they have a Crest on their head their skull has a Crest like a gorilla yeah it is like the the bone of the skull has happened for the longest time they didn't think they're real to part of that Michael Crichton book Congo was a really terrible movie that's insane yeah that's one of them and I think that doesn't look like forced perspective know what I mean it looks like they're right in front of them and that's one from the early nineteen hundreds of where these guys shot one and there were like what is this this is just giant chimp go didn't see if you can find the one of the right above is the one that worth walking right there yeah directing these you know these people that want to one of the sightings they saw one walk by a truck like walk Crossroad they said it was the same height as a truck that's insane so they have like you know like a Toyota Hilux or something ever had literally the height like a 6ft tall man but a giant chimp and I mean to go back to the Bigfoot thing you can totally see where we get that from brain instantly goes Its mythological and I'm pretty sure that they didn't have photos of this thing until the 20th century like the late 20th century that's amazing different name for two different names for chimps they call metrie beaters and lion killers and the tree beaters are the ones that are up in the trees a smaller Champs Sheeran. The Lion killer but he's big ones that live on the ground and apparently there's some either video footage or there was some eyewitness account of one of them eating a leopard no way it was a dead leopard that they were eating whether or not they killed it or they found it but they were eating this f****** regardless like to be a primate at the top of the food chain eating a big cat I mean that's not it's not did not do you ever think of going there and try to find those things too deep in their great isolated population of them there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> maybe yeah I'm what did you think when they found that Flores man on in Indonesia it's amazing I like I'm not an anthropologist so yeah that's not quite 100% but essentially they were talking about a three-foot-tall hobbit like man kind of cadence please like fourteen thousand years ago which is like what I think it's completely believable I mean there is an people in the Sahara Desert are tiny you know they're there are like four feet and double-check but I believe until the 70s people used to go and hunt them maybe was earlier his sixties or 50s but you could go and hunt this primitive sized human being as like a pet you know I'd like a hunts like an Old English man with a big mustache in his musket would go hunt these people now we have an understanding that you know they're people like you, I can go and hunt them but like what's to say there weren't tried like that all over the world that other people used to hunt the drove to Extinction Jesus Christ right say the name of it again play perfectly adapted to the desert life they really used to hunt them and they look just like people I mean Warwood going conquer Africa and and Hunt these people like they were an animal you know crazy right until the 1970s that might not be right that sounds too recent doesn't happen to a lot of the non Appian human type people I would think so anyway if it's not like for sport it's for competition or resources or you know what any reason and that's that's human nature conquer so what are the pockets of the world are like mostly unexplored or could perhaps contain some of these animals South America for sure central Africa for sure there's some very remote parts off like Russian Arctic Norwegian Arctic there's areas in Asia that are still unexplored believe it or not regard us their populace there really are deep deep China there's some very Northern Mi Anmar hotspot nobody goes there varying I read something about some part of the world were they thought pterodactyls might still exist there's so many of those things I I don't know that one specifically there's especially doing what I do I cure them all the time right now look for Bigfoot's or pterodactyls or whatever man that sits could there be a large reptile that perhaps flies sure it's possible is there a pterodactyl as we know it it would be something that we don't know about like yeah basically I think there's enough pieces of this world that are unexplored that there are still megafauna to be discovered not a lot not a lot by any means and I might get ridiculed as I go back to my scientific Community for saying this but my belief is there are these isolated pockets were small populations of megafauna still exist that we don't know about low South America is I mean how much of South America is actually populated I mean you look at the size of South America is I mean how much of South America is actually populated I mean you look at the size of the Amazon jungle or something and it's it's the sure there's there's communities and stuff but not that much I mean it's Australia you know that if you're not on the coast there's nothing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> sitter talking about bring animals back as a scientist sure the extinction is it is it is it is to me it's fascinating especially if it's something like sit a passenger pigeon right we used to have billions of them in the United States wipe them out and now they're saying we can take the closest living relative isolate some jeans and make a new passenger pigeon is that worth it cuz it's something we wiped out in the last hundred years yes I feel like that's we should heal the ecosystem by putting that back right that being said we still need to learn from our mistakes like we need to take into account what we did and why we did it and like do I think there should be a Jurassic Park in a bunch of mammoths and T-rexes absolutely not that's a waste whether we can or cannot do it to me that's a waste of scientific resources that could go towards conserving things that are on the beach now when you say like he'll or men the environment or the ecosystem when you would bring back something like Pastor pigeon isn't like 90% of everything that ever existed extinct I sure absolutely what does the ecosystem adjusting evolve and would reintroducing something like a passenger pigeon what it kind of f*** things up that exist now we're new animals have taken a different position in the hierarchy it's too short and evolutionary time so we are in what's gold the sixth mass extinction event right there's been $5 Boris the one wearing now it's happening at 80% greater rate than it's ever happened before so we are wiping out things more quickly than the world can adapt so you know you go into an environment and you take out all the apex predators the prey explodes the prey explodes the grass gets eaten down everything collapses now if you left that environment over time a revolutionary time it would adapt right maybe you say say all of the Predator got a disease and they died over three hundred Generations during that time something would have all within the environment to adapt the prey so that it didn't wipe out the environment that's just kind of the Nature's Balance but when you go in there and do it in 10 years or 5 years it throws off the equilibrium so when you in Siri when you reintroduce something that's been. It's science I've shown this one right here in the California Channel Islands when you put something back that's missing from the ecosystem it's like you're putting a piece of the puzzle back right and then allow it to do its thing over evolutionary time zones so I was actually a big part of that and I loved loved the project so the California Channel Islands were settled by agriculture there were sheets go to take bottle by there's everything brought over there right and it's so not Catalina but think about the northern Channel Islands what happened was when all these animals were brought in all the farmers were there then Golden Eagle started coming over golden eagles came over to eat the pigs and everything else there was an animal on the Channel Islands called the fox very gorgeous cute cuddly little fox you can see him if you go to Santa Cruz Island there's loads of them now thanks for the work that scientists done anyway they were like okay the foxes being there it is yeah the habitats getting destroyed the end that that's just the Keystone there were several species that were on the decline the cows are getting the livestock is wiping out the habitat the foxes are declining what do we do well obvious answer let's remove all the livestock so we removed all the lights. Kreit helicopters is a lot of pigs were causing damage all that kind of stuff we removed then the golden eagle started praying on the foxes because there may even more pressure so they remove the golden eagles this is a very Abridged version but now we've got the golden eagles are pushed out the bald eagle with your Fish Eaters which lived on the island so now after loads of yours of removing golden eagles like relocating removing all of the livestock now you have a healthy population of Channel Island foxes the bald eagles are back they're eating fish the whole ecosystem is Back in Balance had it been left the way it was what you would have found at the California Channel Islands over say 20 or 30 more years for your 50 more years do foxes no no bald eagles ton of golden eagles in a ton of pigs and likely overtime pigs with exploded to the point they Easter Island at themselves right they ate up all the resources destroyed all the habitat population collapsed golden eagles claps nothing left on the statues are and all that stuff but I am not familiar with what happened to Sharon so that island is was an ancient civilization that was the mecca had everything offline had Big Trees tons of food blah blah blah people settled there and they said this place is Incredible 2 and then they start cutting down the trees to fish they started eating all the mammals and what actually happened is because there were so remote the middle of the ocean nowhere near South America and nowhere near anywhere else they cut down the last tree there were no more canoes there's no more food on the island and the population collapsed the island was Baron it was void of trees Boyd of Life void of anything and they didn't have the canoes or anything to leave anymore cuz they cut down the last tree to build build a boat or make firewood and everybody there. Oh s*** that's what happens when you use up every last resource wow when did this happen I couldn't couldn't tell you that I thought it was like a mystery 2 what happened to the population of Easter Island so they're pretty breeding mystery why I think certain people believe that the heads were like a nail calling to the gods to help save things cuz they were going so badly idea. But I believe the heads are still pretty big mystery but the actual Anthropologie the population to collapse is is known to be due to running out of resources how long did it go for an idea of how long the population lasted flew too close to the Sun is they said because he's around small-size 163 square miles it quickly became overpopulated its resources were rapidly depleted when Europeans arrived in Easter Island between the late Seventeen hundreds in the early eighteen-hundreds it was reported that the moai were knocked down in the island scene to Desa. Right well I knocked down and the island seemed to have been a recent War site constant Warfare between the tribes lack of surprise Plasma Resources disease invasive species and the opening of The Island to foreign slave trade eventually led to eat around Collapse by the 1860s so long as that was a rap wow it was annexed by Chile until they've never tried to repopulate the island with trees or anything else I'm just going to leave it alone I believe so I know you can go there and visit of the island to foreign slave trade eventually led to Easter Island Collapse by the 1860s Soulard ending long 1718 60s that was a rap wow it was annexed by chili until they've never tried to repopulate the island with trees or anything else I'm just going to leave it alone I believe so I know you can go there and visit and I think there are some things there now but it's it's Barren there no trees there's no you know it's all been depleted</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> a lot like what time are primates I'm going to Borneo to look for an animal called The Millers grizzled angular to type of monkey I just got back I was looking for an extinct Caiman in the Amazon thing came in at UC there's many types of crocodile Disney types of Caiman looking for one with a very weird morphological variant it looks very very different to any other what's what's different about it got a very elongated snout if you ever seen agario you know what that is type of crocodile with this long crazy knows it's like the alligator family to Canaan family version of that this really long skinny face super light super yellow coloration just very different last time when was seen was 52 years ago and then they had one in a zoo that died in the 80s and nobody's found one since so just really cool until the leopards and I did wolves and and a bunch of really interesting stuff so it's fun and you love you should come with I'll talk to Animal Planet such a p**** what about Giants loss what are your feelings on those I believe it's at the South American name for giant sloths there is I don't want to give away too much info before I get to do a chance a chance of looking for it but after all the research I've compiled there is in my opinion one location on Earth it's in high Peru where nobody goes it's a bowl of mountains impenetrable the only way is a helicopter in the center to me that that ball is going to be like a primordial eaten all of the culture surrounding it have old stories of giant slots they all have different names for it but they all have these stories these Giants lot right there all hunted to Extinction however they've handed down a tradition nobody except for you know tiny handful of like far-out tribal people have ever really got into this impenetrable ball and I think they're anywhere they're in their wow I saw a documentary once about the scientist that was essentially risking his reputation trying to find a giant sloth somewhere I think maybe in the Amazon something somewhere where I'm thinking to he kept talking to people that it's been there for years what if your little Amazonian villager you don't read you don't have TV there's no reason to make up scientific science fiction why say you've seen it cuz you like to f*** with why people could be love you mean man that's a mean guy needs you want to log all right buddy patch on the back this is the last spot for you and I'll be taking then I'll take your binoculars and there's no reason for them to lie but that's like the thing that people say about everything crypto creature with a grain of salt but you still have to take it you know what I mean you don't have to bank at inconsiderate and so that's that's kind of the way I go I I always talk to people but then I come up with I do the biology right I track I put the cameras out I bait ice and I do all of that stuff to try and get evidence of my own because just going with eyewitness reports has like say it's nothing is there ever been any eyewitness reports that two for sure like what I mean like about the thylacine friends there was a guy that we met there who's like everywhere they run around with the black cats like what is Black Panthers today like hang out together write a crazy or completely f****** with me I'm not sure which one it is because your eyes are telling me crazy well I mean how many different pockets in the world are there like that Basin that you said you got to get helicoptered into there's a few pieces of the world still the artist he he went to the Congo I think was a Congo to look for dinosaur early Vice piece advice was first starting out and David is one of the more eccentric people that I know he's a multi-millionaire me to shitload of money gambling and also he made a shitload of money because he was a Facebook painted painted Facebook what does that mean now he's just as freaky super talented artist Yahoo is just doing weird s*** and wanted things they did like a many want to look for a dinosaur he's like yeah I'll go absolutely which doesn't totally make sense but it but who knows why not investigated kind of thing I mean how big of an area would there have to be for there to be a species that we are not aware of like how big of an area I mean question cuz we discover you have to look at the numbers but it's like 2,000 species a year little stuff but mostly little stuff there's an animal discovered most recently there's an animal called a it's an animal that I'm actually working on later this year and it is a an antelope like they called the Asian unicorn cuz for Generations people have been talking about the Asian unicorn and Western world like yeah whatever whatever whatever and then finally somebody went down there into the Laotian mountains and and was like yours a skull and here's a skin new like holyshit this is a real thing and this is like in a pot not populated but there's plenty of people living there you know I mean this isn't like this isn't like the middle of nowhere this is where there's villages rides in people and they're like yours this animal hear the skin hear the skull and since then I think one trail camera has the photo has ever surfaced like nobody's ever successfully documented it because it's just this incredibly elusive animal like whether it has super sensory organs you know what hearing sight smell whatever it is or it's just super low density in population nobody really knows but this animal huge like antelope has been around forever people little tribal people have talking about it in like a mythological way the same way they would talk about dinosaurs in the Congo in the Western World going sure buddy whatever you say and then somebody finally goes down there doesn't Expedition just like David did and goes out turns out a tear what is it about animals where were so fascinated by the ones that might not be real or that might be hidden like what what is it about them when we women people love study giraffes are things that are absolutely real compelling need to search for things that are not quite sure that I'm not quite sure if they exist or not I don't know man I think it's like it's human nature to want to know more Ride Like We of course like not everybody you see a drop you like it's real I know it banked it right some people go to the extreme they study every aspect of it but as a general populace I feel like once we know something's there we want to know what the next thing is I don't know the answer I think it's probably a side effect of our compulsion for Innovation like human beings are constantly trying to find out new Secrets or find me like find out new discoveries and invent new things and fire Explorer new world I mean this is just something that's been a part of human nature Forever This desire to improve writing to go for the find the next best spot for a new thing you know and then I think that also works with animals for the find the next best spot for the new thing you know and then I think that also works with animals I think we have this desire to find animals that we didn't know a real or weren't sure real real knowledge is the foundation of that right took to go to a new planet we have to have the knowledge of how to get their right to go to a new habitat we have to know what's there and I think maybe that's that's kind of that deep-rooted desire is like we need to know about this thing in order to to understand if we can innovate</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> easy trips do you want to do that you haven't done yet is a lot man I mean the one that I've had on my bucket list since I was so there's a couple wanted there's one really one place on Earth left where there's true cannibals in Papua New Guinea and unlike the missionary that went in Uno with an agenda I would just love to actually see these these cannibalistic tribe so I'd love to do that nobody has successfully unless it happened very recently and I'm aware of successfully done source to see if the Congo River from guerrilla warfare crazy waterfalls disease that's an expedition I'd like to try and then when it comes to Wildlife I mean the list is infinite there's so many of these animals that I'm desperate to try and find those sound like very dangerous trips like visiting cannibals yeah I mean like I don't know how to say this without sounding arrogant but that's what sounds exciting to me giving that shot that other people aren't taking so have people visited these cannibals and come out of there there's a Nat Geo photographer who got some incredible photos are called the car away tribe and he went in there took him awhile for them to kind of assimilate and get comfortable and then you got these photos that are just mind-blowing now how often do they practice cannibalism it is a it's not a daily thing it is a spiritual thing where they actually eat the eat the other tribes deceased after a war or an intertribal conflict as a way to like ward off bad spirits not like a daily thing it's not like they're going out hunting each other it's more like when these things occurred that they have to eat a certain killer at certain body to keep evil spirits at Bay do they get that version of mad cow's disease of cannibals get was it jakob-creutzfeldt I know what you're talking about I'm not sure I think it's probably infrequent enough but they're not getting it cuz I'm in the South Pacific they got that all the time but they were eating each other like all the time yeah that's that's where they're getting it from it's essentially mad cow disease actually yeah yeah is this guy hanging out with them they're eating something I don't think many people with many many many thousands of years ago and they essentially just get the resources from the land play new Love and are they just rocking it old-school and then for me at like the cultural significance is huge but what's the biological area like right nobody's going in there how much biological studies been done the answer is none and these people have large Papa looks like that lady evolutionary thought about leaving his know why you've already I think that's the name of his he's amazing yeah it's it's a great book but one of the things that they talk about in the book was these nomadic tribes that would yeah that's it Yuval Noah Harari I f***** up his name talk about these nomadic tribes that would kill the old ladies like kill the people that were burdens and like to just shows like them talk about like what people became problem brat who just kill him and this was a normal but they got along together great everybody was like laughing and smiling everybody's really friendly but as soon as someone seemed to be a problem f****** club them from behind and it's like this is going to sound awful but doesn't that make sense kind of does it sucks but it kind of does a burden on the community or Society absurd but as a culture removed from the rest of the world makes sense that you're a burden you know you've had a good life it's time to move on and their nomadic that's the other things like they have to keep moving so if someone stops and it like this one guy he was sick and so they left him on a tree and he became covered with Buzzard s*** because the vultures would just sit over him and wait for him to die but he eventually recovered and he caught up with the rest of tribe and for the rest of their call them something like Buzzard s*** for him and wait for him to die but he eventually recovered and he caught up with the rest of tribe and for the rest of their call them something like Buzzard shitt I don't like that that was a third their nickname for him being polite enough to wait for you to die</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah we talked about that was Brian Cox the other day yeah I'm not I'm not super well read on it but like it looks like a damn alien yeah he was very incredulous but he know he's obviously smarter than both of us RNA and DNA is right on them right I don't understand it well but yes it's like the thought that the population Came From Outer Space because the DNA sequencing suggests something that makes it extra terrestrial adaptability he was so close to everything else here that doesn't make sense but the other theory was it might be just this is the path of life right and the reason why it's so close to us is that this is the way all life even if it's extraterrestrial sure gets I don't believe Octopus from outer space but I love the theory I love the idea that it looks like it's from outer space you know it's just wacky that's that's bananas I take a lot of mushrooms not psilocybin but a lot of porcini a lot of chanterelles like I do a lot of farting it's really fun are you aware of Paul stamets know podcast ever he's a Mycologist and a f****** trip in every sense of the word super-genius Mycologist who had the craziest story about being in high school and what do you say took 20 grams of mushrooms and lightning storm something f****** something where you hear him tell the story your hands start sweating away something f****** bananas kill moose yeah and he did this and stop. I'm not very well right on that but there's a whole idea that microdosing with these chemicals that are naturally produced can actually have very positive facts really strange yeah so what would that why would that help you like as a fighter is it is not a mental focus thing it's a physical thing at that point right now it's get you into the Flow State interests and so like with Fighters the real thing is it's not just your skill but it's your ability to execute that skill Under Pressure so the overwhelming amount of anxiety there's extreme consequences to getting hit or going wrong getting knocked out the losing a fight is absolutely devastated it's devastating emotionally devastating physically is devastating psychologically it changes your perception of who you are and how you fit into the world and dab sometimes and nausea they sometimes often times impedes performance Cheryl Pratt comeback from the consequences of a possibly go wrong make you hesitate and it just it's it's the stress of it all is very constricting through difficult to operate the mushrooms some people alleviate that stress and put you in this elevated state where they say and I haven't I've never fought on mushrooms but they say that when you're on mushrooms you actually can see what a guy's going to do before it does it interest you have a sense of what they're going to do that's a much more heightened sense then you would if you were just in a normal silver states are you picking you think you're picking it up through like biological cues like you could see the muscles twitching in the arm before the punch comes or like what how do you think that's a good question I haven't done I don't know you know I've never sparred on mushrooms or is a good idea states that you get into where are you just you can't do no wrong and neither usually very elusive they come and they go you know you get them like give a play pool I'd a little bit I mean but you know how sometimes you play pool for a few hours and then you just like sometimes I can't believe I'm in the zone then it goes away right you know right maintaining that flow state do you think it takes emotions out of it like is that is that why you're in that state like if you're not emotionally attached to that shot her that punch maybe you can execute a better it's possible mean is a lot of speculation of what's going on and what's causing his elevated State of Consciousness interesting yeah I don't know how to start microdosing on mushrooms snakes around me flowstate you think it takes emotions out of it like is that is that why you're in that state like if you're not emotionally attached to that shot her that punch maybe you can execute it better if possible mean is it a lot of speculation of what's going on and what's causing his elevated State of Consciousness interesting yeah I don't know start microdosing on mushrooms snakes around me</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> he just be in the Amazon itself as well right for sure in the jungle not just the rivers and the lakes or whatever is out there but the actual jungle itself it's it was incredible the jungle there so we were in Colombian Amazon and liked by people there's been this kind of ongoing going conflict in Columbia for many many years so where we were the first westerners to go there and over 60 years so the village refluent literally never seen white people before and then we went to a hundred kilometers from that so like Midland know where they want to touch you hair cuz their hair was very dark and very different and like I'm not particularly fair but just to touch like the hair and see the blue eyes and stuff they were just Love Her Madly super-friendly like the culture was very stoic like there wasn't a lot of smiling or crying you know there wasn't like a lot of emotional exchanged but straight away they came and greeted us like Shook and said hello it was really cool you and the tribes yeah so we did in this case have one guy who communicated I speaks Spanish Spanglish I guess and they they don't speak Spanish from back in the day so we set it all up it's part of the wildlife stuff that I do we literally flew a DC-3 a World War II cargo plane into this cocaine dealers airstrip yeah I was that one was really cool really remote how crazy is that they learn Spanish from people who came over on boats from Spain and it just stuck is that nut and took over the whole like Regis in the middle of the Amazon that has this language from another continent and Brazil right from Portugal no language was it sounded like they did so it's funny because when they didn't want us to understand what they were talking about they would switch to their native Indian language so they still had they were bilingual a community of 25 people that I've never laughed and they're bilingual amazing their native language of their tribe they're so isolated they're unaware of what country they live in they don't even know that they're in Columbia really they're just like to them they're Amazonian they're not Colombian Ecuadorian Brazilian there Amazonian you know they just stay where they are they stay and the village we were in is literally I think it's over 200 kilometers from the next next Village of 15 or so people and they don't have fuel they don't have Motors you know they just in this pocket and they just substance and they're all Barefoot right do they have those crazy splayed out feet big feet you know what they're not very big people they're like small Indian people but really big kind of useful feet and the way that you know they could run up and down trees and climb stuff I mean it was unbelievable like so much more athletic than you could imagine their whole life their toes spread out and their feet almost looks like a hand no way I did not like pay enough attention that might have been the case but I didn't notice that their feet pictures and videos these people's feet but look at these guys up there that's how do you say that horror horror horror horror it's very strange like it's the kind of the opposite of what happens to women when they Jam their feet into those with a pointy shoes right where they get the the toes kind of switch onto each other a life e marble instead of that they're all like crazy. What is going on there and I think would be at the top or the bottom is like wood feet what does that's got to be like what are feeder supposed to be probably right Toes that actually have muscles in them that move that you can use like a tool like yeah climb up trees with them so they grip the the side of the tree with their feet like a hand I mean I didn't notice tree trunks like to get up and down the village and here's me and my crew with our awkward cameras and stuff and where it's slipping and sliding and falling over in like they're they're literally like what's wrong with these people why can't they walk we must look like infants to the right and you guys probably have like boots on and should they divorce and f***** up and but don't have contact with the outside world like I'm sure you're aware of that recent Story the missionary was killed by the people in North Sentinel Island absolutely that which is one of the weirdest places cuz they branched off from Africa with 60,000 years ago or something like that right around these people like what would they do if they get injured so funny you ask that because we we kind of had that same question right and they don't leave they stay in the village they have a man at the Village who blessed us with a crazy green powder and that's a whole nother story but they have a shaman and he is their doctor however he has no access to any Western medicine so it's only his learning knowledge handed down through generations plus jungle powders and whatnot and and that's it so we help if you want everybody had ringworm everybody had respiratory infections there a lot of Lady problems in the village armatic had to deal with I mean there was a lot of health issues and you don't even realize it. The people in the jungle he was he's an actual Doctor Who Is He specializes in infectious diseases in Jungle and tropical climates and he's like everyone infected with everyone yeah but the so when these people have ringworm and all these different infections do they treat it do they have like some naturopathic cure or some s*** I think it's kind of a 50/50 like a lot of it they don't treat because it's just part of everyday life like when I say everybody had ringworm I meant everybody had it so I don't think there was any kind of treatment or cure it was just kind of part of it part of them but other things you know that the witch doctor or the shaman was trying to treat and then we kind of went in and we had like medication for ringworm so we dewormed everybody and with the shamans blessing and he was like super excited to have Western medicine in the village and would usually Glamis or something like that I couldn't tell you I think it was it wasn't topical I think was like a pill that you take that kills the kills the worms the weird thing about that is like don't you you leave and then they're going to get it again right I mean is only so much you can do it right yeah having the same dilemma as like do we interfere because we're from the outside world do we help and we talked to the shaman through our translator and he said please help please help so we gave including him everybody just dewormer but you know we'll just come back and also they probably don't understand the consequences of taking some antibiotic that's going to do some weird s*** to your whole biome right right full is it hindering our medic was like it's undeniably going to help you know that they need this until we got we went for it and it was so it seemed to help everybody felt fine but we were only there a couple more days before we left so who knows kind of funk that's why people tell you to pee on your feet that's real common so it just the guys get it and there's people really f****** where they like put bleach on it and a bunch of different things to try to kill it and wants of getting worse and also in Fox up all the natural skin Flora jock itch athlete's foot and ringworm are all types of fungal skin infections known collectively as team Taniya Taniya there caused by fungi called dermatrophin bites that live on the skin hair nails and thriving warm moist areas the jungle sounds like yeah but years old and he was and he was according to our medic so my our medic gave them like an ass my medication and he just said you know if he has an attack where you can't breathe in this and like you got to be super real with you when we walked away our medic was like I doubt he'll live to see adulthood and we've given him inhalers you give him I'm not sure to be honest what it was that he left with him about like injuries worth it break a leg or something like that what do they do I don't think anything yeah a very rudimentary tools I mean it's it's not they have to get injured it's so interesting that we have this understanding of medicine and doctors and hospitals but that's probably pretty f****** recent so breaks the arm in like 15 places compound fracture the real deal I can show you pictures I will blow your mind and we hear about this and we're minutes away we just it's kind of one of the similar situations were the first Western to be there in a long time we go bowling over at high speed and we get there and the mom is like off mourning the death of her child but her child is sitting there still alive like they have written him off and it's Mom is mom is literally mourning the death of her child and he's he's lying there chest but like in total shock fortunately just because the situation we had a speedboat everything else we bandage him up you tried to keep his arm stable on his leg stable put them in our speed boat in 6 hours by speedboat to a village that had a to a hospital really and so we got there and his life was saved but I asked we asked the people in the village what were you going to do and they're like there's nothing we can do so he was just going to bleed out or go septic and that was the end of it how to get away from the crocodile was just hitting it or hammering on Hughes crab fishing in the water and it came up and grabbed him rolled a few times and at some point he escaped how even got back in the boat and made it back to the Village I've no idea cuz his leg was shattered his arm was shattered was brutal and was a canoe motor or a wheel to drive canoed back on the most disturbing stories I ever read was these guys were kayaking in an African river and the guy in front of them grab a crocodile and that it went under and they like get like plums like a bobber as the crocodile pulled him out of the bottom of the kayak yeah it's awful being the guy behind him hernia leopard stuff like that I've never seen a wild jaguar in the Amazon I think there really a lucid I know there's areas that are are hot spots all of the locals were very nervous and kind of knew about them like you know I went out for Bush walks at night and stuff and I just go me and one guy with a camera and they were like we'll be careful like peligroso in a very dangerous don't do it but Predator Grosso means very dangerous I'm not trying to act like we were tougher than them or anything we would love to have seen one but they were very aware of them so they were there we just didn't happen to run into one sort of like mountain lions exactly like they say that mountain lions are like if you live in a place that has them in Wyoming or Colorado or something like that they know where you are right right you they might be around you all the time and you might rarely see them exactly be driving home as he wants skittering into the into the bush there was a nut video I think it's from the LA area cams picked up this mountain lion that was walking through this like very residential neighborhood and you'd see like people would walk by and then 30 seconds later he'd like dip out of the shadows and it back in the next set of people would walk by and nobody had any clue he was there what would you have done if someone got bit by a venomous snake or did you guys have prepared for something like that that's kind of my my department is make sure nobody gets bitten make sure nothing like that happens and we handled very very many venomous snakes and caught anacondas and all kinds of great stuff we did have like my main camera guys named Mitch he got absolutely let up buddies wasps one night and we all were we got like 12 14 sings each but I look back in a canoe at one point and his eyes are just super swollen he's bright ready sweating and like Michio Kaku reaction to we had to hit him with antihistamines and I'm not accept Medicare administered the EpiPen or not but he was like we're in the middle of jungle or 6 hours from a village that's been a full day's travel by a charter plane from a hospital I mean middle of nowhere and his throat is closing up and think that's why we take a medic with us thankfully we had this emergency medical administered the antihistamines is okay but these things do happen we're in the middle of jungle or 6 hours from a village that's been a full day's travel by a charter plane from a hospital I mean middle of nowhere and his throat is closing up and think that's why we take a medic with us thankfully we had this emergency Medicare administered the antihistamines amateurs okay but these things do happen</div>

That's insane exactly mosquitoes to avoid devoid of malaria and they hybridize right so my understanding is the way that it's done is they genetically engineer the males to reproduce with the females with your the malaria carriers and then The Offspring of that generation can no longer carry malaria that is Bonkers it's a myth I think a real number then it would have to be five and a half yeah measles returning and polio returning Ali mola came in what the hell LA and Long Beach wrexham who you spend the time of time hiking around here yeah well California doesn't have much lime but east coast it's horrific it's like everybody that spend time outdoors in the Northeast seems to get it yeah and I don't know what you can do about that there was a vaccine that they were doing for a while but one of my friends her dad actually got Lyme disease from the vaccine like you didn't have it got vaccinated and catching it from the vaccine I think they were like okay East Coast terrific it's like everybody that spend time outdoors in the Northeast seems to get it yeah and I don't know what you can do about that there was a vaccine that they were doing for a while but one of my friends her dad actually got Lyme disease from the vaccine like you didn't have it got vaccinated and catching it from the vaccine I think they were like okay</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah how many I come in I'm in the studio right now with this group called suicide boys who are awesome there from New Orleans and we have a EP coming out that's called live fast die whenever and we just finished over the weekend so or yesterday so it's you know you go in there at noon and you leave there at 4 in the morning everyday until you're finish cuz they're only in town for a little while so yeah it takes a little bit the album before he passed away I work with like smokepurpp Vic Mensa a bunch of different artists you like that because it's a different genre helps you mix it up a little bit that you just a big rap fans white obviously wearing Ice Cube shirt before any kind of music at all like Beastie Boys and Run DMC and Public Enemy in the far side and krs-1 that's what I grew up on discovered yeah I loved Metal 2 out of Slayer and King Diamond and then I discovered a band called Minor Threat and The Descendants and black flag and Bad Brains and I just liked it all and then my dad listen to jazz music and Country rebel music so I was born in raised on like Johnny Cash and Buck Owens and everything so I kind of learned to love it all and I had people around me when I was young when I was first learning how to read music that just kept invading my head like you got to listen to everything can just learn one thing so I was actually taught how to play like traditional Jazz when I was really young and then I taught myself how to play everything else that's f****** cool yeah but I always have everything to you know birds are pop punk records or whatever it was I think I would go insane and it's been like that for four years you know I think different people I think some people if they're just doing like baseball commentary something that they're f****** happy s*** they love it I just want to do that but there's some people like you or maybe like me that I need different things yeah I will go crazy I love like Studio life is awesome like I did the other week and then the next day I'm in with like a band called Nothing nowhere doing completely different this week I'm doing a little peep and XXX remix it's it has to be like that for me or I get really bored and I just don't feel creative real kind of like I don't know that's how I like that how does that work do you get a phone call or someone texts you hey Travis we need you to come in here and like this m*********** on fire and you get in there and yeah it's been like that you know or likes you know some projects manifested to like there has been called the fever 333 that I produce and in right with and they just got nominated for a Grammy like you're up for a Grammy for Best Rock performance and that was something I just envisioned with the singer that band Jason and we started literally a year ago and they and their nominated for Grammy so like stuff like that like kind of being an architecture without building buildings you know being architecture music or whatever it is whatever it is your passion about that excites me use building sound yeah like there's nothing better different genres Tuesday to be exciting to cuz you can mix it up and yeah well now when you're like how do you like schedule your time in terms of like how much time you going to spend on your own Studio work how much time you going to spend on other people's stuff to just play it by ear it seems like with a guy like you he was gets so many requests and you said you have a hard time saying no I would imagine it's f****** overwhelming ya will my kids come first before everything you know and then I get a lot of opportunities like my son Landon is a big rat fan like he loves that he was raised on rap music like he grew up touring with me and Lil Wayne when I told Lil Wayne and he loves being in the studio so he'll come with me to studio so I can kind of like double-dip work at the same time as he's in be making music on my Studio B which is really really awesome and then stay with Alabama she's a lucky they're both musicians cuz Alabama and let him the music so they like going on tour with me that I like me yeah or I probably wouldn't be working so much that's really cool what the f*** is it like going on tour with Lil Wayne it was so awesome I came out with a wrap a wrap projekt red produced made all the beats and I just got on my favorite rappers everyone from like Rizzo from the Wu-Tang Clan to Lil Wayne game Swizz Beatz it was it was crappy I had 32 guests on there and Wayne asked me to go out on tour with him so me and Mix Master Mike from the beasties we're like the opening act on that tour and Drake was out there Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross so fun so I loaded up the bus with everyone I brought Yelawolf out I brought j-roc about Paul Wall I brought the cool kids and we just got on the bus and went on tour yats long my f****** shows over like good Lord that audience must be beaten into a coma oh yeah but then the headliners on who they really there to see right but that was a big accomplishment just being able to play in that genre music cuz I listen to it as a kid there's never really been a home for live drummer in rap scenario where I am so from the beginning I think I don't even know what year was went puff call me when I just do seems like you all are to be in this video because I pretty much was I was just like I'm in one of the biggest bands in the world I'm so stoked I couldn't ask for anymore and I always want to go I always wanted to get that score was so fun but yeah once puff asked me to be in a video is kind of like a I just snowballed from there. In that world yeah I had no idea why wow this is so cool because I grew up on biggie like I loved all that genre music but I was okay with just staying in my Lane as well but when I got accepted with like open arms and I was invited to do like BET Awards RTI or tiger Wayne and they was just insane you know playing the Grammys the funny thing is I've never play the Grammys with blank but I played the Grammys with black pitbull Drake Eminem like it's so weird it's so weird to me I just feel it it's a trip to me I just feel it it's a trip the opportunities I've had outside of rock music have been such blessings to you when you say all those things and you know that you did all these things is almost seem like you're living in a dream yeah I feel like smacking myself like it doesn't feel real with I feel like I'm so spoiled and I've I've been so blessed to play with all these musicians I love I just seen nobody you know whatever comes I'm happy with</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> entertain the idea that it's possible that we are the only intelligent life in the known universe meaning are you looking for how we should behave even politically you know that to me I mean imagine that we're the only place where there is intelligence in this galaxy how should we behave should we actually notwithstanding I would go as far as to say they'll be nowhere else when meaning exist in the Milky Way because meeting is one of those things that scientist and talk about talk about and so meaning exist but I think it is a local and temporary phenomena I think it's it emerges meaning emojis from configurations and items which is what we are we are simply that we nothing more than that we've very very rare configurations I think I'm so that means that if you go all the way down Galaxy I'm meaning only to ourselves it means something to us because we're the only ones who can grasp the concept and we are finite we are finite organism we have this temporary existence while we're here and to us there is meaning I think more wonderful and I'm more challenging to us cuz we have to take responsibility for it to say we should operate search that we are hit in this Galaxy with nothing else I'm sure I'm sure there's other civilization they vary widely spaced and I think they may do wanted to play Galaxy on the average I could but that you said that what you said you and it will only exist for a short amount of time and so make the best of it would be my date so unbelievably compelling though to consider the idea that somewhere out there there's another civilization that maybe even more advanced than us and just thought of it is just so attractive it's it's it's incredible or even slightly, and then that should be civilizations ahead of us because it's been so much time to see what that's like so compelling 800 million years ago 200 million years ago 1 billion years ago and imagine what they'd be like if they survived when we've been waiting around waving signs that say since Newton at most what we've done we've gone beyond the solar system with voyager we've walked on the moon and we where we're about to go to miles I would think they're about to begin colonizing our own solar system I'm 500 years imagine a million years in the future is one of the arguments in the galaxy exploring the galaxies we will have spacecraft that are going through with the Stars we will be doing it so I signature will become visible I'm sure if we last into the medium said would we choose to not do that Here's my thought on that is uncontacted tribes like do you know about the the gentleman who was the missionary who visited North Sentinel Island and was killed by the natives North Sentinel Island which is a really unusual place because they branched off from Africa 60s years ago and they've been living on this one small island the size of Manhattan and is Wells we know there's only about 39 of them left somewhere around there and we can't we not supposed to contact them like people are nuts but we were supposed to like leave them alone and there are rare try when they find them in the Amazon The uncontacted Tribe initial instinct is back off been around here for millions of years of life is supposed to quarter-million why would they why would they let us know like what they look at us dropping bombs on each other and polluting the ocean sucking all the fish out and putting clouds into the Skies of dirt and particles and why would they look like look at these crude monkey so they're so far beyond where they need to be before they could join the Galactic Civilization Network it technology so Advanced would be difficult for us to detect and then we tend to think of when you say written across the sky I'm thinking of Starships in Star Wars</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> alien life on life outside of this planet you think about I think that must be even in the solar system I would not be surprised if we find microbes on Mars are some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn where there's liquid water like Europa and the reason is if you think about the reason I think that is because then there's a ball of rock and almost as soon as it cooled down we see evidence of life so suddenly 3.8 billion years ago possibly even further back than that we see evidence of Life of that so somewhere along the line geochemistry alkaline and the conditions that naturally present on the surface of oceans then complex carbon chemistry spontaneously happens so we have a we know that life almost certainly we know that life began on Earth at least we know that the conditions that led to the origin of life on Earth Namaz 3.8 before billion years ago and we know that that present on Euro for today so I don't see anything special life is just chemistry the idea that geochemistry become biochemistry is not fanciful because it happened here so I think that given the same conditions it would be surprising to me the same thing didn't happen in that life begins that is one of the great frontiers of Sines notes on the great challenges which is why another reason were interested in Miles because we know those conditions with that we know the way. Hydrothermal vent systems on the floors of oceans on miles is 3.8 or 4 billion years ago so it would be good to know if what I said is right and then the way we find out is to find life or evidence of past life are you aware of the speculation that was going around how recent was it that occupy thing the Octo the octopus eggs they there was a group of scientists that were speculating that it's Paulina panspermia the idea of pain from you that it's possible that octopi had come from somewhere else in frozen eggs that actually come from somewhere else and it landed on earth like legitimate scientists are constipated not morons it doesn't have to be unlikely people in the other day we found enough so I'll come the mood yes right but the thing is that the octopus is still extremely similar biologically to us I mean the difference is negligible the talked about this possibility there other people that disagree with it though because you couldn't you could Advance would be there's only one way to do life so you could say that actually given because the laws of physics and chemistry so that's the way it gets done which is why they're so similar to us so alien as well under microscope and you would have bounced a little ride sharing apps for selling humans so the only way that that would make sense as if all life comes from basic of the same kind of building blocks and just varies depending upon the conditions and where it takes place I'm I'm guessing but the elements in Salem that we have in our universe we have so many different life-forms on our planet but if we found anything that's remotely similar to what we have here on Earth on another planet would be such an incredible Discovery like we sent we kind of frog on the moon the world would stop right remember me mentioning that is what we do know it's a 3.8 billion years ago it wasn't until around 600 million years ago or so maybe most 700 that you see any complex multicellular organisms that's all sofas something like 3 billion years it was single-celled alone and that's one of the reasons why I would guess if I had to guess I would say I would guess if I had to guess I would say that microbes would be coming because like to come very quickly on Earth and it was Friday funny but complex life multicellular life insects plants intelligence I would guess would be very rare because he took so long on Earth together slime</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I called Joe Rogan questions everything we went there looking for bigfoot in the more I talk to these Bigfoot folks the more I was convinced and none of these m************ ever seen Bigfoot who just did not seem like a liar and she was telling me that she saw something in the woods and it was standing up and it was tall x 70 ft tall and she's like why is there a gorilla in the woods and then she's like oh my God that's pigfoot and it said it was a Pacific Northwest outside of Washington state are in Washington state outside of Seattle and the woods are so dense up there that if anything goes 10 20 ft it's gone the problem with that is that is black bears up there and blackbear sometimes stand up on two feet they do it all the time and if you saw black foot especially black bear rather especially from a distance you would think it was a big gorilla that's crazy I can see how that would resemble a Bigfoot I don't think that lady is a liar I just don't they might be real there might be a few of them left there definitely was a thing called gigantopithecus that lived in Asia and the thought is that it came across the Bering land bridge the same time that Native Americans came across from Asia and that they came across and you know cuz they lived in Asia and this this Gigantopithecus I think lived as recently I think as a hundred thousand years ago I think that the most recent fossils they have of it which is you know human beings were alive back then yeah and this thing was 6 or 8 to 10 ft tall bipedal hominid so was it a huge huge ape like creature if you saw that is totally yeah yeah yeah oh my God it's a f****** pigfoot especially if you believe the hype your search for Bigfoot by the other pairs foot off or you could have gotten shot or it could have broke it off on something yeah that's crazy he's missing a foot who's he's walking around out there like a gorilla but everybody else I was like why I'm talking to them and make believe world around two feet look like f****** people man I think that is a big reason why they're feeding him that is so crazy where is that that doesn't seem like America</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> user dreams know where that guy think I f***** up and I'm smoking weed again I wake up and I'm like oh my God how am I going to stop cuz I love I love smoking so much you know or whatever your Vice was you know if it was like whatever was going out yeah you're just like you wake up and you think you're doing it again and then I realize now I'm all good things like that where I had to go back to HighSchool really I just have dreams for years you know soon to be a professor f****** doctor something well I just had no idea what I want to do for a living and I was just like being trapped in a classroom constantly was excruciating yeah I must have had I probably do have like some crazy form of Adda I don't know I never been diagnosed shrink but if I did I'm sure they probably try to put me on something if I tried to tell him what's going on in my head all the time to be like Jesus who is bad but it when I was in high school I f****** hate it and I barely got by and then when I got out of high school I would have these dreams where I would wake up in the middle of the night and I didn't have enough credits to graduate and have to go back I was sitting there in my bed before I woke up trying to decide whether or not I was just going to f****** drop out and not graduate from high school not have a high school diploma or go back and do another f****** year of hell and it would make my guts would turn down wake up from coma. Graduated graduate yeah yeah it was the worst idea I was the same way man I just like just barely got by high school did you go to school here in like Fontana Riverside Corona yep yeah I was the same way just just skated by high school and then I didn't even want to walk a f****** hate it so much I actually rode my skateboard with my friends that were like much older than me. To go skateboarding with everyday and we were skateboarding by the high school and everyone walked and got their diploma and I was just how many more I can be free took me awhile to figure out what the f*** to do next yeah I would sit there and they will be like so what do you want to do answers and it's like I just want to play drums in a band really and maybe like an option like we're going to you do what you're passionate about you know instead of just being well but that's not going to happen so what do you want to do any f****** people there probably want to be drummers and just never got a push and never never you know ya never made it through the other argument that if you really want you'll find a way you got to do it I mean my dad used to tell me the same thing he'd be like you got to have a plan B and I'd be like if I have a plan B I'm not going to try yeah they're thinking in my head and then that's when I just said Norfolk that like I'm it's only this no matter if I'm rich or poor what at whatever whatever the circumstances this is what I'm doing I don't give a fuk with The Alchemist I think that's the right mindset yeah I don't think people get by that well when I was just started to stand up there's a lot of guys would full-time jobs and they got degrees and you know they would work their full-time job and then they would just do stand-up couple nights a week they never made it as the obsessed guys and women the people that were just like I this is my f****** life this is what I do I'm going to do this for the ones that do with the no safety-net people the ones that made it yeah I mean it's gonna f****** happen you just have to you have to stick with it I feel like the people who really stick with it and give it like 110% your time will come it's it will have a big or small it is something will happen you know if you figure it out and keep improving keep learning and learn from your mistakes and learn from your setbacks and I'm keep trying to push and get better and improve if you do all those things is as hopeless and helpless as it seems if you continue to improve you've got to get to a better place you got to get better in one day you'll be undeniable and if you don't and if you just fall back on that safety-net you're always going to wonder you know you was going to look at Travis Barker Google Buckingham don't shut that could have been me dude I almost did it actually at one point my pops and my pops is awesome but he's like Vietnam vet and you know go to Harley his whole life and you just basically said to me was like yo you got to start paying rent the house cuz you know you're not in high school no more or and get like a 60 hour week job like a real job or you need to go and I'll go f****** play drums for you're not going to do it here in my garage as harsh as it was or whatever and then I had actually caved in and I just told my my friend Noah you know what I think I'm just going to I'm going to get this f****** job cuz I just somehow got a job that made you know in a warehouse was like Target warehouse making pretty good money compared to what I was making at the time and any hit me the next day and he's like I think you're making a big mistake I think you're very f****** talented and I think you'll regret this and you can get this b******* job any anytime down the line come live with me you stay at my house you can sleep on the floor the couch and let's play in this f****** band and do it and I did it you know I was like a trashman in Laguna Beach lived in like this studio apartment with a couple other guys and I just f****** took off like I had it like I mean it was like humility to you know that was like playing bar after bar and you know you know but I was eating I was eating I was like I was skateboarding everyday and I was living at the beach playing in about my friend so for me at all right already made those are the best stories does the best stories and I think back even to this day I go to Laguna sometimes I'm like wow that was kind of one of the best moments in my life besides my children being born like poor no money but like happy as f*** cuz I can't even think of another time I was at happy you know already succeeding in the overwhelming pressure that you must experience now yeah does a great stories man the stories are like where you didn't know if it was going to work yeah you don't stories right now some kids are listening those stories right now listening you say this like f*** man I'm going to do it I'm going to go for the two knows how many rock stars you're making right now just saying this because a lot of them are Teeter tottering funny just be passionate about what you're passionate about and f****** dedicate a hundred percent you know it's not sure it's not a it's not a definite thing you were in this weird limbo space like man like my whole life what's going to happen to me and those moments man when you look back and you realize you could have quit but you kept going you figured it out you sucked it up and when you look back and you realize you could have quit but you kept going you figured it out you sucked it up you work your way through it and proved kept moving that's that's why I can never get enough of them dirty grimy and then finally make it story</div>

point you know like getting tattoos on top of the tattoo The Giver got lasered yeah once I had like a new wife and I divorced my ex-wife and she wasn't really stoked on the ex-wife's name on me call my neck and she always had to see it and then forget the only time I've ever done it at there's nothing on me I really want to get rid of her I'm like all that it's all a story to me and I'll tell the story it's like a moment in time and I got it for a reason but I was trying to be cool and you know what I mean trying to be respectful and made her happy at the time being married with another yeah yeah but yeah I love tattoos Manor addicting I love him too once I figured out they didn't hurt at the age of 15 it was on I didn't yeah it's like what people tell you it's so painful and then you get when you like wait a minute it's not so bad this is like a slight burn at the same time I wow just cuz I f****** hate wasting time they did my back together they did my head together too impressive let me see that that looks like when did you get that done I did my head like I don't know 6 years ago wow yeah he's a legend even outside of tattooing like lowrider culture he's he's one of the illest but yeah he he did that and then that kind of Set It Off I always had like praying hands on the side of my head and then I shaved my head and I've never grow my hair out since cuz I'm like f*** it it's permanent haircut you know what is up there I don't know what's on my head like a transplants gas mask on the back of my head I have one life one chance yeah and then like some writing wow now when you got burned did it affect your tattoos did you have to tattoo over it yeah so I lost I lost all of my tattoos on my legs wow yes I lost my first tattoo ever forever and a bones tattoo just my nickname growing up but I lost everything on my legs so then they do like they do is call that grafting so they wanted awesome tattoos for my back so they take like a cheese grater and they grade all of your skin off your back and my thighs and then they staple it to you with pig Kadabra and they wait for a for you to start healing so yeah so I lost a lot of tattoos and I did I like on my size can only see I did I did memorials for 4 though Christian djm who who all passed away in the accident so I put them on my legs over the grass so you can't really see it but yeah I mean pretty well man and you can see it's discolored and stuff but for having almost 70% of my body can't really tell that's amazing Dad up the pain of healing Burns supposed to be excruciating it's dfucking worst thing ever for me too I mean I don't think you guys ever think about being burnt I know I didn't I'll just be like I don't know I just never think about fire until you're on fire and then you're like oh s*** and then and then the you know the treatments afterwards to like do everything you know like I mean this big pan that was literally about as big as this table with different people all around you and they would scrape on my burns with a metal brush to get rid of all the infection cuz I had I basically when I when I jump through the emergency exit when I open emergency exit before the plane blew up I was in such a hurry to get out of the plane and exit the plane I jumped right into the jet which is full of fuel so my whole body lit up you know so I had jet fuel in my whole body like I burped jet fuel from most like 3 months so they had like that was the main thing to get rid of infection is a scrub you with a metal brush to get rid of all of it and all the dead skin and then and then I did about 30 surgeries to to repair everything I skin graft surgeries they save my foot so on point they're going to amputate my right foot yeah it was wild didn't make it was it because the way it was was it was necrosis or like what was going on that they were going to amputate it I think cuz that was the thing that was most soaked was was my shoes and socks when I jumped into the Jets you know and I had done like I exited the plane I started running I'd started like ripping off my clothes just that's what my instinct told me is just get rid of everything but little did I know I would still be on fire cuz the jet fuel was I was soaked in it so I'm actually running toward the highway I was right on the side of me and I just hear some Guy Yell like stop drop and roll and it just like I heard it out of all this chaos of every sirens and everything and I stop drop and roll and the only thing I was still on fire was my feet and am came in padded them out so I think they were on fire the longest to so still like my I think my right foot is probably like over 50% of it to graft stop drop and roll and the only thing I was still on fire was my feet and am came in padded them out so I think they were on fire the longest to so still like my I think my right foot is probably like over 50% of its a graft yeah that's wild but I never even thought about it until it happens to you but

		<div class="paragraph"> is it like Athletics where as you get older drummer slow down as wild as I did back in the day how old do you know 43 you look great thank you don't look 43 yeah Max Weinberg tell me one time he was he watching me play and he was like at a show or blink play and he's like I don't know how much longer you can play like that Mansion of just a play exactly how I always have you know I don't even want to think about a day where I have to plan a different outcome but do you get massages a lot right massages that's when the tank comes in play Man maintain this pace cuz everybody drums differently you know I mean it's really interesting to watch people's different at especially my friend Bill Burr really got into drumming and you know he's really into it and I like watching him play and it's it's interesting to see someone take something up and get better and take lessons and learn it but the thing that really strikes me is how many repetitions are involved like as you're doing this like the amount of times you're hitting his drums is f****** and Saturday you got to pace yourself if it's a 2-hour set I know like this is a burst of the song I can kind of this is not a big big part you know you can kind of chill but it's like around you know if we're running around looking for the clock and you realize l y stuffed 2 minutes left will pace yourself and you know what I mean that's kind of how I approach shows but but the goal is to train so much before you even get on to her that you're not even having to think about that you're just playing the show exactly how you want to play it's almost imagine it's like that fighting where you envision what you want to do in your head and your in the shape and you know the technique to execute you don't have to think about her going now I can't do that I'm not I didn't practice that enough I like to be able to just do whatever I'm feeling and not be no be like shitt I don't know how to do that or I'm going to get tired if I do that I don't want that to happen to know so that's the goal is just being able to execute what you have the idea in your head what musicians have to discipline because you have to practice it said that's one of the things that makes you guys so unique in the entertainment world it's like I mean I guess maybe actress have to practice stand-up comedians we only practice in front of an audience but you guys have to f****** practice like she'll go on yourself before you go out right I right and I listen to recordings of old sets but I don't like sit in front of me Argo hey folks yeah I don't do that anybody to do it feels so weird when you go up to do it it would feel we're Hurst right yeah that's the last thing you want you got to be in the moment something happens with it if you practice too much is a band and then you go try to play those songs and act like you're having fun so I try to practice a lot on my own and I'm not even practicing those songs just kind of drill you know and my Jesus f****** a truck like it's becomes a job that you don't want that you wanted to be fresh and exciting and you wanted to be something that you really in the moment really thinking about so I make up new shitt on the spot to that's the best is I just make up new fails or just try to reinvent the songs to the point where even like Markle look back at me and be that's the best kind of freaking it on the Fly I heard like that before that's like after two or three months of being on tour you do stuff like that when you get off tour do you consciously give yourself a rest know I'm busier at home than I am on tour on torso lavish man like you have you have someone saying I mean and you do have people kind of waiting on you hand and foot somewhat you know I ate catering you know ready if you want to eat or hey you got to go do an interview 3 minutes before you go onstage cars outside waiting for you after the show taking you to the hotel so that doesn't happen until you know and it home I do so many other things besides playing the band like I you know pretty is a bunch of rap artist I have Crossroads at clothing companies have three kids it's way busier at home torres-torres a vacation for me rap artist I have Crossroads at clothing companies I've three kids it's way busier at home torres-torres a vacation for me wow I have a lot of things I love that I loved at all I just kind of love it all so much that I have trouble saying no sometimes</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> doesn't bug me what about Edibles haven't really done it you don't f*** with Edibles really had anything for 10 years as well I was fed you know for months in a hospital being fed morphine every day for 4 months and then being on all these bipolar meds and everything else I didn't want to put anything in my body when I got out I didn't even take painkillers when I got home know what kind of bipolar meds they put you on remember I was on like 4-5 just bipolar and then I mean I had like I had so many after I had like twelve medications I got sent home with and I did it for about a week or two and then I wouldn't see my doctor I'd actually overheard one of my friends talking who was like a brother to me and I heard him talking to someone else seems like you like Travis seems a little different you know he seems a little bit slow or something and it and I overheard him he didn't know I overheard him but I was these meds I have been telling my doctor feels like I just don't feel like me I feel I don't know I feel weird and I just don't feel like myself so I just flush them down the toilet one day and next week I came back to see him he's like how you doing I said good I'm off all those meds you told me I'd be on for the rest of my life no like dude from what you've been through like it's okay to be on like that and I was like yeah I'm doing fine though like I don't need those you know because I wanted to put you on because of the plane crash yeah they like don't shame yourself and you know it by giving yourself a hard time that you have to take these pills and I said well you know I'll just I don't feel like they're doing what they're supposed to for me and actually having like a negative effect on me so I don't I really don't want to take them you know they also told me I'd never run again I'd never do this and never do that again so I think I just got to the point where I was like let me see how many things I can otherwise that they've told me you know once I stop taking the pills Jesus so they put you on bipolar medication because of a traumatic crash yeah that seems odd to me I mean I'm not a doctor obviously but well I was kind of crazy you know I was like suicidal when I was in the hospital I was on so many drugs I couldn't even I didn't even know my friends have passed away I didn't even know the two pilots have passed away I didn't remember anything I kept thinking like everyone was in the hospital including the two pilots including my two best friends and am I thought everyone was just in different rooms till about two weeks before I left and then I went crazy then it was like they had a few no 5150 case on their hands you know I wasn't I wasn't in a good place so yeah then I did I did a lot of like post-traumatic like therapy when I was in the hospital too kind of like calm things down once I got to all my surgeries yeah let me know what time it was it was cool but it was never cool but I started to feel better you know but yeah I think it was cuz I was so crazy at the time but it's interesting that I would think the bipolar medication would be something that you would give someone who has like a condition that just is sort of priest there predisposed to it yeah I don't know anything about bipolar but I would think that that thing that you just have you know it's like I have a mental condition I wouldn't think they would be something that they would give you to overcome a traumatic incident yeah I think they were afraid I was going to be I had like a mental condition after everything happened you know I think like maybe because you're an artist that you're probably a little crazy anyway and possibly I mean I think I had done I'd smoke so much weed everyday and I taken so many pills and and I would self get quite a bit that I woke up pry out of 11 at my 30 surgeries I have the burn center I woke up swinging on doctors so I would wake up and I would just I'd be opened up and I would just go crazy Jesus Christ so they're going to get off the table yeah I would just try to get off the table I don't even think I really knew what was going on I just wasn't they couldn't give me enough medication and knock me out cuz I've been self-medicating for so long and abusing meds for so long get up from anesthesia yeah wake up in the middle of anesthesia so yeah that that was crying I was a problem how did you clean up I think after the last time I saw on a doctor they were kind of like you you're not going you can't be here no more and then I was like wow wow I need x amount of more surgeries and I I really was just fighting demons you know I'd figured out like my two best friends had passed away and the pilots who passed away and I was just like in an ugly place and you know my kids couldn't come visit me because 65% of my body was burned so I couldn't be around people so I was just in it man and then and then I just I don't know I turned a corner and then I was like a team player and I don't think I was on as many meds most of my surgeries were over and just learning how to walk again being able to take a shower by myself again all that stuff man I think that was just those are the good points that help me turn the corner and I don't know I just had more strength you know so wow so you just just turned a corner in your mind and just sort of accepted it and yeah say what drugs like I didn't never do rehab anything I think it was mainly my kids and just Second Life second chance at life was enough for me I was like I don't I never want to do any of that stuff again you know that's cool so once you get a certain distance between you and those days does it seem like like wasn't even real it wasn't you doing those things you look back in your just like I still talk to those doctors to this day like Dr Grossman he's he's he's so awesome and basically saved my life you know but I still talk to him he lives out here in the valley and he has Grossman Burn Center and I go without Christmas and and see burn you know burn victims that are over there in that in the Branson help out any way I can but yeah he's really cool many of my friends so I know that I had real bad drug problems and then now or off drugs they'd look back and then go what what the f*** was I doing I got an idea how is that mean yeah it's interesting how that happens in your life or you have these new chapters in your life and in and sometimes it could just be something that happened like 2 weeks ago and you're like who the f*** was that guy two weeks ago I'm not even here anymore really cool yeah many of my friends so I know that I had real bad drug problems and then now or off drugs they'd look back and then go what I know what the f*** was I doing I got an idea how is that mean yeah it's interesting how that happens in your life or you have these new chapters in your life and in and sometimes it could just be something that happened like 2 weeks ago and you're like who the f*** was that guys who weeks ago I'm not even here anymore</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I'll be on tour when you go to a vegan spot and I'll take my bus driver in or whoever's travel at me and thinking about like man I might not enjoy this meal some good spots in La has some great spots to follow your heart in the valley all the time in downtown call Dalek who took a vow of silence 22 years ago yeah you special man yet 22 years ago to kivela silence and he's done no more talking no more talking what in the f*** is that about so we just communicate he's in the pit with his camera the silent guy who doesn't say a word yeah and it is cooking is phenomenal so but yeah la or spoiled with great great vegan restaurant. So f****** trip 22 years of no talking yeah he also does like this juicing where this year he juice for 189 days with no food wow get down to think he was yeah he lost about twenty pounds he does it every year wow yeah he's trying to banish right. Talk I don't think I could get intermittent fasting is like as much as I can do yeah I do that every night but that's just freaking me out I've never really asked questions why a lot that too but I've been around when people ask him he just said he wanted a timeout for 22 years that's a series f****** timeout how old is homeboy he's got to be probably in his 50s so almost half his life yeah what the f*** man Thanksgiving with my family and I you like that did you making any noises as you whistle know I've heard him snort one time when he was laughing hella hard but that was about as close as it gets so he doesn't laugh out loud like hahaha wow thanks for the cruelty of animals and whatever else so I can talk to him for what it would be like that's so strange can you do my head around you know no one didn't introduction going a disguise silent I just tell you I had no idea he meditates I think he has like a lot of kind of Buddhist kind of qualities I kind of I think if you had a lien in some kind of religion or or practice it would be that wow that's intense that's a serious commitment man yeah I could even imagine going 22 days without talking a day I think you're being very hard cuz I have sleep apnea cuz I have a fat neck but I found a mouthpiece that I can sleep with that keeps my tongue from falling over cuz I have a when when your neck is thick your wind hole is smaller believe or not cuz the more muscle you put in the smaller your hole gets and then had a big tongue when you lay back you can actually block your Airway wow and so friends that I know I've had their adenoids or tonsils removed and they actually takes soft tissue out of your your passageway so you can breathe easier but the problem is you can't talk for like 7 Days yeah that would probably be rough for you I may wonder if the internet phenomenon now you know what I heard is I had I was smoking tons of weed right like but I would smoke Backwoods like I love the wood so it does everything back was a day and I turned kept smoking didn't even a I didn't really know what was going on and then I went to the hospital that night and they rushed me to another hospital to get my tonsils removed because they were like twice the size they should be and then I had a throat infection and then it comes to find out I had was called like Barrett's esophagus which is like pre-cancer lining my esophagus from smoking and I don't know I guess just abuse over the years so that was that's what led to my tonsils being pulled out I didn't really know what was going on and then I went to the hospital last night and they rushed me to another hospital to get my tonsils removed because they were like twice the size they should be and then I got throat infection and then it comes to find out I had was called like Barrett's esophagus which is like pre-cancer lining my esophagus from smoking and I don't know I guess just abuse over the years so that was that's what led to my tonsils being pulled out</div>

the weirdest thing I've ever driven in my life it doesn't even make sense it's not even not even there's not a single car that I've ever driven this even close to his fast nothing like my porch is so slow have a GT3 RS 8000 pound it sounds like a dragon and that Tesla would leave it in the dust I mean leave it in the dust like zero to sixty two seconds quicker it's f****** insane ludicrous mode always available get is a roller coaster ride it's insane I mean you can't believe how fast this it doesn't even it's literally doesn't make sense it doesn't seem right it seems like like it's punching its way through a wormhole using alien technology me when I posted it seems like something Bob Lazar snuck out of Area 51 get all these messages from people problems or has been debunked that's controlled opposition that's a fake story is fake news bro they got you with the Bob Lazar story do you like all the tech in it I mean that's too much almost because it's is Giants green like I had a dim it with the f*** down cuz I was looking at like you're so pretty mesalamine allegedly 311 miles in it feel like a moron so it's not going that far it is to get to get is there a few option for that model like are you card that you can pay extra for like 1 gallon of gas so like if you ever lose your battery then the Acura NSX the Acura NSX has two electric motors but I think you don't ever charged I think the electric motors are powered by the gasoline engine and electricity in the car if I remember right that's supposed to be the mother f***** like the Acura NSX is supposed to be the car that people are under look under looking for whatever reason it just doesn't get the love it deserves and apparently the 2019 model was even more insane I can't wait to the day where they get your garage floor is like a wireless charging mat you just pull right up into them a tour date would never would be because it's rubber termite away is Lakers that there's there's like if you if you take her phone and put on a wireless charger there's like a little roommate if you don't you don't have to touch it but maybe that's the whole reason why you're safe from getting hit by lightning bro the rubber protect you from electricity part though a little thing comes down to the ground like a little bit Boboli ideally it would be great if solar panels had gotten so powerful they can charge it just with the sun especially cuz Southern California is always f****** sunny ledfurd today but it's a matter of time but the cars the future that's what it is it really is look I'm a Giants fan of American Muscle Cars they're my all-time favorite cars in terms of like to drive to hear the rumble of the engine and that I love them I love them maybe I'm some crazy old dude from the f****** 80

dummies like you and me are never going to come up with any of those ideas ever if we lived a thousand lives never figure out SpaceX it's just not in my wheelhouse we would never make a f****** electric car we never make one of those things never got that Tesla Roadster that's going to come out that go 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds and and looks like like a spaceship like a like a racecar spaceship

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Time Warner doing the UFC commentary like you know if I watch the fights and I start posting about MMA I'm not trying to be funny and so yeah just what it is you know you're living in a lot of different worlds but I look at your Instagram you're cooking meat right yeah but for me I'm thinking how the hell does he get the meat like from from top to bottom like medium rare throughout you know I can for me that's more of a Sebastian I could beat you you know that he is cooking it slowly so you got like this grill or whatever the Traeger grill the sawdust they take the sawdust from from Sawmills and they can press it and then make these little tiny pellets and so there's no chemicals known others just wood and then that the way a pellet grill Works a bunch of really good companies that make them I use a Traeger but I'm used to Yoder that's a great one to and Green Mountain Grills at the great one this they have their all work the same way they have a heating element in a worm drive to get this big bucket of these pallets and then the Worm Drive feed the pellets into this heating element in the heating element makes a pellet catch fire so once they catch fire it's a matter of how much pellets and how much fan to keep the tube that's what it looks like up there so then she looks like that looks like a lot of work I'll have it delivered I'm trying to get more people to cook like this because it's just wood and fire it's the best is no chemicals no bulshit no lighter fluid no gas no nothing so you're in Warrior me fire your entire meat process is on this Grill except the end at the end this is a different grill that I have to just one has a thing on the side of you see that thing on the right hand side is like like that looks like a like a direct flame thing looks like it's got gas as well write the one that I have doesn't have that at the end I sear it at the very end on a cast iron frying pan so I cook it from between 225 to 275 degrees which is pretty low and I'll kick it until it hits an internal temperature depending upon what I'm cooking somewhere around 1:20 to the maximum like 1:30 ish then I take it out and I have a cast iron frying pan is hot as a mother f***** and I use either beef Tallow or grass-fed butter and I see you this s*** out of that with some garlic and I throw some time in there and f****** flip it over and get that good Seer and I'll let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes waterways in at 2 to cook meat and if if you're saying that this pallet thing does it add any flavor it's different and is also a setting on a Traeger called super smoke where you headed it goes to camping over 225 but that's what I like anyway and you put it on 225 and it just constantly fans hard and pushes all the smoke so it just gets his deep rich Smoky flavor in the meat malisima but I like if you're not a regular Weber grill Weber what are those things called that you get what would you call them like a drum looks like a half a drum Barrel f****** thing the way it looks like yeah and even if you buy that lump charcoal that does charcoal briquettes rather the charcoal briquettes visit there's something in them that makes them that shape they have to and then they they they like Fast gasoline in them but lump charcoal meaning they just take hardwood and then they burn that s*** down to two you know that clunky looking lump charcoal just get that stuff and then take some newspaper and roll the newspaper up at one of those ever use one of those those chimneys do you know what those things are the barbecue chimney it's like you pour the charcoal in this tube and at the bottom of the tube you take like pieces of paper to proper warm-up and balls and then you like the balls on fire and The Fire Rises up from the paper to the charcoal and it lights the charcoal on fire than you dump the charcoal out into the grill and that that puts a nice flavor on it to let's just do it again seemed kind of feeling like would just as wood you take like pieces of paper to proper warm-up and balls and then you like the balls on fire and The Fire Rises up from the paper to the charcoal and it lights to charcoal on fire than you dump the charcoal out into the grill and that that puts a nice flavor on a to let you have it again seemed kind of feeling like would just as wood flavor on the meet a nice I'm so I'm a big fan of cooking I love it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> comfortable Under Armour running shoes on how are those for me feel it they bind my feet tad bit when I got to the store I to swap them out for had a pair of Converse All Stars with you my go-to you got Yeezys right uses about a year ago it's a new thing that's illegal on Twitter as it's something I wish I knew I didn't know until after the podcast but deadnaming is its band so say if you decide tomorrow to become a woman and you like I'm not no longer Brian I'm Brian Tina feel like Rihanna that's so I be like okay Brianna but you're still a man and then boom that's dead naming you can't call someone something other then their preferred gender so like if that identifies a woman but they're biologically male you're not allowed to say they're biologically male you not allowed to call them a man because that's deadnaming you not allowed to call them like you couldn't call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce if you called her Bruce you'd be dead naming her but that's just like that's not a legal or I mean like is a poopy pull up I did not know this I did not know this. It's been around for a while maybe a couple weeks ago and heard the term for the first time somebody wrote deadnaming and I was like what what is that and then I had to look it up Saturday new role as we happened directly word for word in there okay deadnaming of transgender individuals repeated or non-consensual slurs epithets racist and sexist ropes or other content that degrade someone okay well hold on a second like what does the great someone so if you if you contact me and say hey bro you're f****** you're not funny that's degrading like is that not loud that's crazy you have to you have to have that be allowed Weber HIPAA targeting individuals with repeated slurs troops or other content that it tends to dehumanize degrade or reinforced negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category see that's where it comes from like white people not protected this includes Target misgendering or deadnaming of transgender transgender individuals I love how they just went with the others a giant Corporation and they just went with some new word that's only been around for like a month how long is deadnaming been around for I do love the chaos of it all I love the fact that they're trying to sort everything out I just think it's the whole thing is crazy it's so bizarre that they're trying to in that sense with that like that's so vague to dehumanize or degrade what every joke about someone every joke about Trump every single joke about Trump at every single comedian and or, Tater and or person makes is in Conway degrading when you talk about how f****** stupid like Rob Reiner had a joke about him called him a piece of s*** or call them a piece of crap yesterday and said he couldn't believe how f****** dummy is Trump talking about Hillary now she's doing it to 100% yeah man I don't know if your name used to be Bruce and you change it to Caitlin I can't say that that seems bananas the sea is bananas so like when somebody say somebody became a woman and it's still an a****** IQ can't call him Mike you know hey Mike look I'm sure you bitter about this whole changing your sex thing you can't bring that up but annoying guy just don't have your dick anymore by like if someone says that they can't say that why can't they say that to me stupid transgender people are considered hate speech or whatever but only when it comes to like gender right like if you could you could tell someone hey you're short and fat and stupid and they don't know you can say you are you're ugly as f*** your nose is disgusting what happens there is that the same what is it the same thing it might be if you do it repeatedly right out there probably okay probably one time you can sit on someone's looks at 1 but it's like what deciding what you can and s*** on someone for like what I'm saying is if someone's an a****** Cinderella cues perfect one that woman who used to be man to transgender woman who was in a store screaming at this kid behind the counter that it's ma'am it's man is the perfect example that that was terrified she's f****** huge and she used to be a guy clearly still looks like a guy and she's saying it's f****** man like not cool how are you settle the f*** down because you look like a guy you're acting like a violent guy and you used to be a guy pardon me if I think you're still a f****** guy that's deadnaming but that's a good thing to say in that particular instance so without new ones right without context saying you can't say anything to degrade someone set that you got your dick removed and the still look like a guy but f*** you like why can't someone say that because that's people communicating how they feel about you being a dick like if you start out being a dick and then they communicate about you being a dick by being a dick as well and we Banning this is coming or but you know what like kind of like keep going and going and going and going but gets it gets very slippery when you have one group thinks it's right and they're trying to control another group that thinks they're right man that is its it seems so simple when you just talked about deadnaming transgender people or not degrading People based on their looks or their ethnicity or the disorder that but what you're doing is you're trying to dictate how humans communicate with each other people don't like it when you tell him what to do</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it in a lot of ways it's dangerous to control people's thoughts and behavior because who are you to say and when does it end it just keep going and going and going and going and gets it gets very slippery when you have one group thinks it's right and they're trying to control another group who thinks they're right man that is its it seems so simple when you just talked about deadnaming transgender people or not degrading People based on their looks or their ethnicity or do this or that but what you're doing is you're trying to dictate how humans communicate with each other people don't like it when you tell him what to do the problem with telling people what to do if they want to do the exact opposite this one of the first things you realize when you have kids like they don't want to listen to me I got to figure out a way to sneak information into them to figure out a way to not be too bossy don't want to do this is what I missed when I was headed headed into that conversation I missed out on other people look and what he stands for I don't think it's correct I think it's way more complicated I think it's an insane business to run him out I don't think you really knew why Alex Jones was banned or anybody else has been I don't think he really knew I think he's dealing with a giant Corporation and he's a young guy and he wear sandals Twitter Alex Jones brought up today that he sponsors the podcast through the cash app which is also he also run to 100% true but I would have and I think we talked about it on the podcast we even talked about the cash app being a sponsor in about how it's helped Justin Wren fight for the Forgotten charity so Alex Jones erroneously said that I didn't mention it we did mention it it's worth mentioning and Alex Jones is to like respond to people that want to know if I seen what Alex Jones said about me lately is one of the weird things that I've dealt with because first of all I've always had good dealings with Alex in person person-to-person he's obviously in a world of s*** right now there's a lot going on with him with the Sandy Hook stuff and he wasn't entirely honest with me about what he had said about Sandy Hook maybe he didn't remember Maybe who's trying to phrase it in a way other than the way I interpreted it when I saw the videos but there's a Media Matters video that shows all the time where he said that Sandy Hook was fake this is very complicated to me this is one of the reasons why I struggle with bringing him back on the podcast that's very complicated it's that is even though I've known the guy since 1998 and if I'm around him I'd say that's my friend Alex Jones he's a friend he's awful f***** up and the parents that had to deal with what he did There's parents that had to deal with people calling them a crisis actor they had to deal with people harassing them at the courthouse and harassing them if they met them in public because they were saying that they were lying about their kids being killed so not only their kids being killed but they have to deal with someone harassing them and saying you're a liar and you're an actor it's insanity and I wouldn't I would think about it differently evidently think about differently if I wasn't friends with Alex but it would also think about it differently if he hadn't made shut up about me he said that I was told to stop talking about conspiracies are they threatened my family that's 100% horseshit and he has my phone number he could have called me I called him after I heard about it he told me that someone told him that I talk to the person who told him that I'm like this is f****** Bonet you have your mind call me this is so stupid you think I'm not talking about whatever fill-in-the-blank whatever ridiculous conspiracy the Rothschilds the f****** Rockefellers whatever it is I'm not talking about that because the government threatened my family that is f****** wrong it's ridiculous and now you put it out there so Alex Jones went on afterwards and he apologized and corrected it then recently because I haven't had them on the podcast he decided to start saying that I work for the CIA and that I'm George Soro talking points which I don't even know what these f****** talking points are talking points about him and specific not talking anybody knowing give me talking points not George Soros and what Eddie Bravo has been saying I mean I still like you as a person if I saw you I'd still give you a hug but you're making s*** up in this is this is not helping anybody wants to defend you it's not helping me as a person talk about the good qualities in you and you know that these things that you're saying or made up you're making up the fact that I'm in the CIA you're making up for the fact that the Hollywood insiders of giving me information and tell me what to say that's not true you know it's not true you know me I don't have time to be a CIA Insider I can't take on another job in between doing stand-up and podcast and UFC commentator running family I can't do it I wouldn't do it I'm not interested I'd rather stop doing everything then work for any government organization no one's ever approached me no one's ever approached anybody I've ever heard of I don't even know if that really happens I don't know if that's real thing the thing is they always say is that the CIA would talk to the people and Holly tell them what to say in terms of propaganda in it maybe I don't know I don't have any personal knowledge of it I'm sure someone has decided that it's going to make a movie about like Zero Dark Thirty that they have to get some sort of approval and I'm sure that a lot of movies that are very inspirational that have to do with the military would be great for recruitment so I'm sure there's some involvement I'm sure there's also some patriots that work in Show Business that want to put out these movies about the government and about the military and a very positive what that's probably the case in some instances too but is everything so f****** conspiracy this is why it's stupid and white stupid is some things are f****** conspiracy and Alex Jones have talked about some things that were real conspiracies that 9/11 documentary The Road to tyranny detailed to World Trade Organization protest where they sent in these agent provocateur that which are essentially soldiers descend soldiers and military people dressed up in all black and cover their face and they smashed windows and tip over things may take a peaceful protest and they turn it violent so then the police can move in and shut down the protest and then not only did they do that but they made a no protest Zone in the United States of America a no protest Zone was it the United States of America touch it but Alex detailed Us in detail and it was real when he makes things up there was one recently the David pakman show had on about Alex talking about people eating babies pituitary gland and Scattered vandalism of downtown Seattle 1999 October 27th 2009 was the article said that that was real that was legit and it was very informative cuz I didn't know that that is how the government operated sometimes they can contact him the second time and do what the f*** Sauron MCS like it's all fun and games until you're talking about people's kids getting murdered and then all the sudden people are like f*** you and that's basically would happen with him if he was just ranting about government conspiracies or you know who shot this guy or who stealing money from hear some of what he talks about is beneficial but Alex is not I don't think he's in a good place I don't think you did a good place mentally and I don't think he's in a good place in terms of his situation with the law you out Jones if you listen to this if I saw you at still give you a hug I'll still even do your f****** show when I come to Austin I don't care you can we can come and hang out but just not making s*** up it's silly and you know I'm sorry if there's bad stuff between us I'm more sorry of what you said about those kids I'm sorry about everything it's unfortunate it's all terrible now eat something like that what's the road looking for someone like that this thing about people is and I think this is also what's going on with Alex people need a Road to Redemption like if if someone f**** up horribly and does something terrible should that be the end of them this idea that we don't need them anymore no matter who it is mean what what does a person have to do to grow and learn and for four people just accept them again momondo all platforms again what what what is a person have to do some real good question I think it's per person that like somebody like Alex just seems like he's getting worse and worse like this seems like he what he did teach Su is lights on I asked him if he had said that it was fake and he said he questioned whether or not it was real but then eventually he acknowledged that it was real what she has done but there was many times we said it was fake not one many times it's absolutely fake it was 100% fake this video of it I didn't see the video before we did our 911 podcast I've seen it now and I still thought about having them are still thought about talking to him about it and and talk to him about all this s*** and what it's like I think it's he plays a character honestly I don't think so I mean with a reptile guy isn't people of the things that he says none of it half of it's just like what the f*** are you talking about he definitely goes goes crazy with some things but I don't think he's doing well buddy was talking about eating babies pituitary glands with city of David pakman video David pakman Progressive commentator online he he was going through something like he's playing his video like what he's talking about them breaking in the morgue what is happening Alex apart on the video where Alex is talking it's early on sounds like schizophrenia sounds like any episode of Live PD or cops you know when people are talking like I saw aliens upstairs in my house you know the other guy do anything to stop him that's like a Bill Maher nail expression company is a kid love just a slogan basically about having sex with kids all the time and then it said it's okay to have sex with you no kids that have section 35 year olds for 12 just incredibly outrageous evil pathetic stuff of the soulless demons. Light Willmar but Josh was saying he had Builders what Walnut sausage and I do you say is the pituitary gland because they confirm that Jimmy saval and others would porcelain kids dance but they couldn't get regular ones to kill if everything was a grab a kid run over the cars they can say others a police report they run over but they would hurry to the morgue they work with different that's ya first of all Bill Maher's down a f****** pedophile this is this is crazy this is like a weird rambling and this is not Alex that I knew from 1998 so it's not it's not the same guy this is guys not doing well so my apology as a human being to Alex Jones if you are hurt that I didn't have you back on the show if you are hurt that I occasionally poke fun at you I have to your house unfortunately but I don't hate you. Don't wish you wish you badly and back in the day I enjoyed a lot of stuff people lose their way you know so I think that it's a real bad feeling being stuck on the outside too and they all band together and kick you out and everybody keeps you out everybody Twitter Facebook YouTube Twitter was the last one but that was Jack Dorsey didn't even know why Alex Jones got kicked off Twitter and people that will let him back in then again but somebody knows like somebody like I don't think Jack Dorsey is really the guy who's looking at each individual person that gets banned I just have a feeling that that stuff is compartmentalised write 7 million monthly active users how many people are responsible for Banning people in real high-profile people. There's a whole like maybe 12 people they have to have a meeting then they at you know maybe they talked to Jack maybe they don't maybe they don't know maybe he doesn't we don't know I'll ask that for sure but maybe he didn't know when people got banned until he like maybe got a company memo maybe he was involved in the course maybe I don't know maybe he's the one who called about to get rid of this m*********** that's possible to when people in real high-profile people. I don't know the whole like maybe 12 people they have to have a meeting then they at you know maybe they talked to Jack maybe they don't maybe they don't know maybe he doesn't we don't know I'll ask that for sure but maybe he didn't know when people got banned until he like maybe got a company memo maybe wasn't involved in the course maybe I don't know maybe he's the one who called about to get rid of this m*********** that's possible to</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and one thing you could say okay like when Kathy Griffin held up the the the Trump head member that did she do that on her own Twitter account yeah yeah well I mean celebrity is threatening a public figure who's also the most powerful person in the world so it's okay is that why that is I think she posted it cuz it was an art piece that was kind of controversial I know that why is it okay why is she still allowed to be on the platform in Alex Jones gets kicked off that's it it's an interesting question right like what do you need to do to get kicked off cuz that's not the only thing that Cathy's done recently she all the people that's calling for the name for that young boy who was with that Native American in front of his face beating the drums you know I'm sure she feels bad about it now and she's watched a video but she got carried away and she saw what we all thought we saw the picture there smirking come to the kid that got in the face this beautiful indigenous man is singing his his raindance cry where the f*** is doing yeah that's not what it was though we found out afterwards sounds cool that you make a record workout if you can get like some some legit Native American chants like that put you into a trance right if you don't know what they're saying you just go running a listen to that couple totes go for go for a jog in the woods Wilson the Native American chants and your airpods that was an interesting video. Because I mean it I was a 180 and after disc ring the second side of the story later people still we're calling for that guy's head yeah and I saw someone who said what's his name Ron Perlman know who's the guy who is Hellboy and she said something about are you saying we're not seeing is a video that shows how it occurred it's all it is you know so why is that okay right why is that okay why is it okay for some journalists to say horrible things about white people why is it okay why is it okay seems weird encourages violence against a innocent white person just one sweet and I was like you know what I am going to go out and punch a white person f*** that I just found some white old lady and I beat her ass like if someone decides that you're not responsible for that are you probably not but you kind of kind of feel like you played a part in the way people look at things especially people that are very easily influenced you know it's just all so it's gross you read something really racist against white people be like that's gross like that a whole group of people how much melanin thrall s*** that's ridiculous you're ridiculous person I don't care if you're brown or black or yellow you're ridiculous that silly do we have to decide if you got to decide like what the f*** were doing and we keep letting illogical Behavior be normal like breaking us off into f****** groups like that and thinking that you know all men are great or all women are gray are all gays are great and never else cis-gendered mango f*** themselves all right that's death silly talk I don't care who you are you not allowed to do that but we let people do that if you're part of a marginalized class some of the part of a martial arts class then you get the s*** on everybody in a weird way you get to like reinforced races it's really excite so f****** counterproductive to because if you do that then it just makes people just get defensive on the other side they don't want to even think or empathize with how you are that was all right that's death silly talk I don't care who you are you not allowed to do that but we let people do that if you're part of a marginalized class some of the part of a martial arts class then you get the s*** on everybody in a weird way you get to like reinforced races it's really excite so f****** counterproductive to because if you do that then it just makes people just get defensive on the other side they don't even want to even think or empathize with how you are</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> hundreds of people like I just started watching my YouTube recommended that to me when you like how did that happen you know this little guy with a tow truck company is now pushed on everybody's laps and now he just went over a hundred thousand subscribers the other day and it was like months ago that he was just had like ten that's the argument some people have made that that's how fast the Paul Brothers they grew they grew so fast on YouTube that some people thought there was something like millions of followers within a week or two of being on there does coming from another platform is giant but it's also all it really takes is one person deciding that whatever the f*** you did was funny or weird or crazy like that cash you outside Girl by the same people that own TMZ and that's why you see it on TMZ picture is a coordinated event over hundreds of different social media accounts for her for the catch me outside girl from there are a team of people there are agencies that have all this influencer accounts that pay them they don't have to accept the money or accept the offer accepted campaign but often times they do so it's like a talent agency hundred percent speaker watching how many people are unsubscribe nut fuckjerry in the fat jew though that's insane but are they I looked at the other day look like 14 million Burgers page is a few, cuz I've posted videos like hey do you know if that you stole this you know I tried to reach out and never got back to me he got you a million what do you think about this idea there like that's kind of piracy you know like he's in so Instagrams allowing and Twitter is allowing piracy well I think they're allowing these people to post videos because you don't really know where it came from there's no proof right look if you find a me my tummy time she posted a meme repost whoever sent it to me if someone sends it to me sometimes I'll just find it in a Google Search and you got to figure out who made that Meme and if I find her Instagram account and I'll try to find it and repost it but some people don't and I haven't in the past like I did that one with baked Alaska got mad at me cuz there was one with Alex Jones sitting in a hot tub and it's like when your friends are trying to chill and but you have to keep dropping truth bombs it was hilarious I didn't know was his I just posted it to me I text message I think but those things have a Creator right and I know Pete like Eddie Bravo makes his own he make some sometimes but he'll send some to me or post some online that he finds that are funny too and everybody tries to credit the person who did it right but now what they do is they they take it and they credit the person but they didn't for so long busted in the way you're just explain that to what is that about though cuz that seems like deception it says the way around the back door in that that qualification of it needs to be on a Camry 2.2 somebody okay will point to this account but it's not even a real account and if they find that stuff and then later add the person cuz the person contact them and said they're almost like that's admitting to piracy like weed that's important I don't make any money off my Instagram right they're taking me like I've been offered to post stop up and not saying that I wouldn't if something was f****** killer and they want to give me money I'm greedy I'll take some money but I wouldn't lie about it and I haven't yet I've never accepted any money yet yeah cuz it's also I think in Instagram you know law that you have to that's an ad if it you're making money off of it and so that's another thing that both fuckjerry and fat Jew or not doing or not put an ad is it just wanted like to Devil's Advocate this so is is there a place for them for those accounts like is there a place to have to be the retweeter of the memes to be that guy to be that account you know like set like a stand-up sets were you know something that you just but you could get everywhere and you can just repost it on your page but then your page become super popular because you're all these people stand upset you know like a Spotify Spotify gets a that's right but they don't really pay the artist a little bit in them as opposed to Art oriented things that start making money there to do very different things so this is not an art thing this is they find other people's art and they sell it there pushing it the Big D create these accounts the accounts get giant people pass it around because they're just finding funny things and then they start profiting but all the people that created all the intellectual property get zero money which is weird I don't remember but I only learned more about this one accept the gift shop came out isn't that what Andy Warhol sort of did I don't know and I don't care I mean maybe maybe did but the thing about it is that this is happening right now on the Internet it's a totally different animal I mean Andy Warhol wasn't running around taking exact photo duplicates and putting them on his website for sale this is when someone's doing on an Instagram page is like you could within seconds take a piece and put it somewhere else it's seconds Bryan post something I think it's funny I go to copy I go to the f****** repost that app I put it in there and repost it it's seconds later you could do that all day and if you hire kids and you I don't know he has people working for them but if these guys do they hire people for f****** 20 bucks an hour or whatever and these people just do it all day long they just find funny s*** all day long and look for certain hashtags meme Factory all their own you know a lot of people that are just doing that all I know d'elia's down a bunch of them and then there's also one that they do what they steal people's act and make a meme out of it and then post it on their page that's where it gets even more slippery because you talking about like stand-up Zacks the Inuit you're making money off at how much are they making are feet supposed to mean I don't know but these are multi-million-dollar business for sure if you're still doing that material is Big Brother on Netflix or a Comedy Central special something for sure that sucks it's always happen though hasn't it TV shows have been accused of stealing the development deal for NBC back in the Disney back we're young pups both of us 127 maybe he's actually that was like during the Newsradio day so we're probably like in our thirties and he had his development deal nice development deal they're paying them a lot of lot of cash lot of paper and they were setting up a sitcom around him so they had him do a set out of theater in Hollywood and I was there and it does this set is all these writers from very sitcoms and the very next season one of his best jokes is on episode of a television show that's very popular very popular and popular medium is Instagram and social media and then comes along and steals your s*** and doesn't you for it just puts it up there you know what they did unless someone send it to them and didn't attributed to you which is possible but it seems much more likely that what they're doing they're doing on purpose for the longest time and they just did they thought that's what you could do on the Internet it's a wild west you can just take me into and you could become famous and look that fat Jewish guy did it mean that guy became famous what will you agree with his methods or not it worked he has got his crazy you shows you you know like Jesus crazy-looking guy and he has all these funny memes that somebody else wrote and they're all up on his Instagram page and it worked and people don't like him now there's a lot of people that don't like him people get real shity with him in person they don't want to do an appearance they know what he did so there's a certain number of people that go hey man you're a thief like does not cool like what you did is not cool but then there's certain people that don't care and then the certain people think what he did was just what any we did back then it was the Wild West no one thought about it and once he established that business model and it was effective was probably very hard for him to slow it down or did tribute things to people or to admit that he didn't do it for the all that amount of time just bugs me that companies pay these guys knowing that they do this or like as it's by Julie's like to see he's like slime with CAA who's sign with a bunch of comedians that you probably now if you was going on stage and doing their acts he's been doing appearances right he's got a book he's been on TV shows why don't know what you're doing weird to because you might be sitting must be sitting there going okay advertising on the fuckjerry page which is like Jesus, I didn't know that it was like Jesus can I just hit you guys down especially like meme kind of Comedy that's done by Folks at working in offices me and kind of Comedy some of the funniest f****** comedy on Earth it's done by Regular People it's not like it's not like most memes are written by high-level satirist that work for the New Yorker know the f****** regular folks would think something's funny you know I think that's going to happen if it's technology improves like being able to scan a photo and go wiktel the first time this was ever been on the internet was from this little girl she took a photo of it has all the data in the picture and it's now used on this mean that's making this much money and that it's going to be kind of broken down like you know I could any kind of artist I mean picture of your band and they have a funny meme under the picture of your band who owns that then they tried to get that picture taken off the internet from her from the Super Bowl couple years ago because it was like a bad picture she didn't like how she looked in it that's hilarious picture Hank that Meme should Beyonce get some of the money or that's the question you would have would like a corporation right what should someone be able to grab photos in or out in the public domain make something with it and then Provident that's the way that's is it a lot of bands I'm sure that that's why I said damn because they're like really good at protecting copyright and their logo and s*** if you had like the Kiss band logo you don't think Gene Simmons to come at you is coming at you with some lawyers hundred percent right that's just what he's going to do but it's those photos of it's like Gene Simmons like Spitting Fire out and I think if you took that photo and cameras were allowed inside the event you took it that's what it is though most of the photographs are people that are putting up there to put them up online and someone takes it looks a few Gene Simmons Spitting Fire and it has a joke about eating hookers p**** or something like whatever it is make something funny there online and that becomes giant meme it gets all these likes and that somehow another someone do you profit from from Instagram you don't profit from Individual post but those individual post with boost your signal start profited Instagram</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> has anybody got so upset about it and let's clear up a few things first of all the guy seems to be willing to talk about anything it's not that I didn't want to talk to you about those things it's just he was being I wouldn't say he's evasive but he's basically just saying what he knew based on the company policy I didn't know what else more to ask him and people felt like I didn't press him hard enough and he to his credit reached out to me and said that he would offer to do another one that's more question that's cool I said I'd be awesome so I said this is the thing that people seem to be upset about they seem to be upset about very specific cases we are people showed like if if people were right wing and they were posting things they were banned where is people who are left-wing or maybe people of different races were allowed to post racist things or more offense of things and even Docs and didn't suffer any consequences for this is the argument my problem is I don't spend enough time reading the stuff I don't know like this is like when people get bands like Anthony cumia is a friend of mine I don't really know why he got banned I don't know what happened I know there was that incident with that that woman that punched him and he wanted getting fired he was drunk he said it was really stupid s*** on Twitter and then later apologized for it but I don't know if that's what got him kicked off Twitter but he's my so what I'm saying is all these other guys that have problems I don't know what the fuk happened man I'm busy I really don't I don't know I don't even know what got Alex Jones kicked off which is why I asked him because that was one of the last platforms for Alex Jones was Twitter but something got him kicked off their take on it was it they never took them off before because he didn't violate their terms of service and another thing is very encouraging that Jack said and I know it's it's fun to get mad at things respond to get me Kim's want to get mad at me for it I get it I probably the exact same thing I totally understand it but one of the things that he said was that he believes that the ability to communicate on the internet through Twitter or through these platforms is a basic human right that's how he looked like I said you think of it like a network like NBC look and run in DC they can decide what saint was not on or do you look at it like a utility and he specifically said that he looked at it more like that that he thought it was a basic right that's very encouraging he also said that he would bring on whoever it is in his team that's responsible for these things so we could hear from the actual person who decides who's getting banned and why they're getting banned and what what is what's the decision-making behind all these things we can go over all of them I didn't think the podcast would create such a controversy but that's probably poor prior planning on my part because my thought about it was hey I want it so it's f****** crazy to be run in Twitter like it's the crazy of this thing exists the president uses a python or talk about the dude who created this and what is this like to have this thing evolve to become what it's become because it didn't start out that way so I don't like fun s*** like that Brian Redban going to the movies you know what I mean like that's what people used it for and then along the way if you came this Global method of Distributing information where people used in war zones man they use it to tell people where attacks are these a frog kinds of crazy s*** it's like a really powerful but strange medium I didn't think about getting into the weeds with all the very specific people that got banned I just wanted to find out why they been people that was my take on it I know there's a lot of conservative voices that have never been banned I don't think Steven Crowder has been banned I don't think cernovich has been banned is even then there's a bunch that have not been banned right so it's not like they ban all right wing voice is so what is it I don't know what it is I think it's what he said people reporting the tweet and then somebody's looking at it going throughout this does violate our you know policy and maybe you know all these people that got banned violated the policy somehow you know it's probably a simple and clean as that you know and it's also not that simple if people are allowed to say similar things that are very racist in an in Vass generalizations about white people which seems to have been the case and at least a few instances where people reported that people said f***** up things about white people but there's no repercussions and you know that's where the argument becomes these people or more a press and so with the white people are thought of as the oppressor so you have this white privilege thing that people like to use now as a reason to to decide till like silent someone like check your white privilege that's it that's an interesting thing is happening so if if there's is genuine movement where people think that it's okay to say things about 1 race whether you like it or not that's racism and if you're allowing that from any one side and not allowing it from it side seems hypocritical but it's very distasteful the idea of racism against black people in this country is very distasteful to everybody almost everybody who's not a race it's right because of the history of this country because of slavery because of all these things it's a different connotation but if you just allow people to say terrible things about any race it's racism your you are allowing up like a predetermined attitude about a race people have done this they have made generalizations generalizations racist statements about white people the the really weird thing that people are throwing around these days is that you can't be racist against white people because racism is about power and influence it's about using your you're in the that black people are not powerful the white people power from the white people the ones who are oppressed so it's impossible to be racist against them that sound push it to me I'm not buying that doesn't make any sense it's not beneficial to anybody to generalize this is what we got to get in her head it doesn't matter if you're black or if you're white or if you're whatever the f*** you are it is not beneficial to generalize to take a person out of the group that we we think of is just human individuals that you have to be an individual I mean knowledge the fact that people look different they have different heritages different ancestry the different occupations different parts of the world is all these differences but at the end of the day the only way we're going to get true equality and true kinship and camaraderie as human beings is that we recognize we're just all a human being that's it there are very big differences in the way we look in the things we like that's cool but as soon as you you can say shity things about white people or white men that leaves but who doesn't fit that description guilty in his weird way are presumed guilty because of a racist statement that's all it is it's not good ring buddy I get it that it's different than racism against black people in America a country that was built essentially in a lot of ways by slavery there's a war for slavery in his countrymen that is a crazy reality that it's not your responsibility it's not my I didn't do it you didn't do it but it's real therefore as a person who is aware of his history the history is country racism against white people seems different but it still sucks to be racist against racist against black people rather seems different but it still sucks to be racist against white people sucks to be racist against Puerto Ricans not good for anybody that's what we have to understand about this social-media thing what actually did happen and what is happening why is it happening and if it's some social justice Warrior ethic that you're not debating doesn't seem fair it seems like there should be a conversation about this and I bet they're super reasonable really intelligent people and it's possible they can come to a good place that we can all agree to that is possible I'm not a cynical person I'm sorry I know a lot of gas what they already have it they have more money than they could ever spend and my dudes with Jack as a person seems like a very nice guy in a very smart guy and in a very empathetic I think he's in a crazy unmanageable situation to be running something like Twitter yeah and there's probably people that did something that they should have done in terms of silencing people moving things around it's probably happened it's a weird thing with people of influence over people and there have been videos have been proven were Executives from a bunch of different social media Corporation have talked about how to silence certain voices how to push down certain voices this is something that needs to be discussed like is this is a policy as a whole is it because you think you're pushing the right message as soon as someone thinks they're pushing the right message but they don't have a there's no debate about that right they just decide are always the right way and they're pushing this and there's a radical opposition to that man from half a country like you didn't like it but you do like no no but this is the one that can control the narrative this is the one that's in control social media so far left-leaning ideology and the other part gets pushed aside that's a very bad situation for all of us because there has to be conversation there has to be debate cuz if there's not just Shores up the difference is G2 people and they f****** hate each other even more I did not take that into account and I f***** up that's my mistake that is my mistake I made that pot shop but didn't take it easy on him because I didn't want to discuss those issues I just didn't think enough of it in advance I'm not as involved in it as other people are aware that there censorship in social media I'm aware my my ideas going into that conversation were more about how insane this method is for Distributing information for the people have been banned and for the people that were fans of I can understand why you'd be upset at me it has nothing to do with any preconceived notions that I had is how the conversation took place so it is and if you felt left down by that you didn't feel like it was his extensive enough I'm more than willing to do it and go further into it and we're going to and Jack offered it and he's going to bring someone else is going to explain things to us I think this would be very beneficial for everybody I also think that there should be a Road to Redemption I think if you got something that's important is Twitter or Facebook or Instagram if you're not stealing someone's stuff like you know you using copyrighted music or something on an Instagram page where you get banned over and over again for doing it but he keep doing it if it's not something like that if it's if it's an ideological difference if you maybe you crossed a line that day they decided was a line you should be able to work your way back there should be a way where you and sign up again when I get a new email address I don't mean that. I mean to be the same person you should be able to be the same person there should be a way different levels definitely they f****** and they make mistakes and people also grow I mean there's this guy that was on Sam Harris's podcast Christian picciolini I think is his name he was a f****** white supremacist a full-on white supremacist and now he is the exact opposite he's he's like his very Progressive guy who gives speeches on the dangers of racism in that and the Audiology how it caught up with him now if she got banned when he was a young man and making terrible decisions and then became a better person shouldn't we give it a guy like that a chance to get back into platform right in without making a whole new screen name like maybe it would be I don't think there's anything wrong with the anonymous the somethings are really good about it right by people like Jack even talked about this that people can report news stuff and not worry about fear of Retribution that they can you know they can whistle blow and not worry about fear retribution if someone's life is on the line but they're trying to provide a service to the general public but they're trying to give people information that maybe might even save lives but couldn't put them at risk especially in like third world countries or war-torn countries that could be a huge problem if you supposed you know Brian Redban this is the only way you can get this information out your fuse your whole name but I'd be better off for everybody if people had a way of communicating with each other like it's just person-to-person and I think the real problem is when people try to engineer these conversations and it's another conversation about YouTube people said that we are delete comments on YouTube without deleting anything we haven't deleted any comment so I don't know how it works I don't read them I'm sure people say mean things have a good time the thumbs-up thumbs-down thing like we would you don't have to have that on there you're not have comments on their YouTube gives you the option to have comments on and to have the thumbs-up thumbs-down not taking those all have a good time with it but we're not f****** with that there's something that they're doing that's not it's not I post at 3 41 and Jamie post at 3:42 and this is the line of the comments it's not like that they've got their own way of doing it the question is why does YouTube do it what's their what what are they trying to do is it are they trying to block out spam are they trying to block out hate speech or other trying to engineer conversation 10. Comment order comments on Note becomes disappear to go away it's automatic if somebody Flags a comment that. take the common away until it's like looked over upon only one person yeah I think on YouTube that that happens quite often probably be as little as one or two people yet so that is probably what's happening to all you folks to think your comments are getting deleted no one's deleting s*** like I'm I'm not attached to what I do in the sense that I'm unwilling to look at what I do wrong I try to look at everything that I do wrong including this so if you were upset at this podcast you thought somehow or another I sold out cuz I didn't ask any more questions I just asked him the questions I want to ask I understand you have more more questions and I do to have more questions to especially upon seeing people's reaction to it and upon you know making myself pay more attention to it all these very stories Matt sent us a list of them some of them really f****** crazy there's some crazy things people said and not gotten in trouble for or is that if he things that really weren't that bad and got in trouble for it why is that that's a good question to ask so we'll we'll concentrate on that we're just going to work out a date so my humblest apologies to all of you don't not trying to let anybody down I always try to do my best that's it and it also here's another clear one no one tells me what to do there's no one there is no secret person behind the scenes if I f****** it's cuz of me it's my f****** I should have prepared more I should have thought about it more but I didn't realize how upset people to be I think you did a great job as a great interview and I didn't even think of that I thought you kind of touched on it a little when you were talking about Alex Jones and I think that was like okay you know this is what happens with a very specific group of people that are of my life easily especially being a troll online you know if you're working some f****** job Jamaican Pepe the Frog memes and your flock when people I get it I get it it's one of the things I like about the internet but I don't I want to be comfortable I'm like I don't want because of all the time I want I want a little bit of chaos I like the fact that these people like they're like that f****** I was upset that that Radiolab podcast they took it down where they were f****** with Shia LaBeouf with those guys from 4chan and the way they took it down was they contacted Radiolab it said those guys are white supremacist I support white supremacy you knowing that you just you know you made these people that are awful terrible people that write terrible things you gave them props but the thing about something like 4chan is know you might read some terrible things but you got to realize you're also reading terrible things from Anonymous people that are working at their jobs most the time and they're trying to f*** with people's head and they're trying to get people upset that they're having a good time f****** with people if you want to take them as that that's like them you like giving giving a talk to a dear friend or them giving an affidavit in court when you're missing the whole thing it's entertainment like half of the whole reason why they're doing is entertainment they didn't go steal Shia LaBeouf flag and go and go right to the camera go f*** Shia LaBeouf by using coordinates from photographs of the sky where they figured out where the f****** with the constellations lie and then drove around honking their horn so that you can locate where it was by using the webcam and listen to help mostly got to it me it's f****** genius s*** and it got taken down just for this accusation of them being racist for the thing about a forum like 4chan or Reddit or anything you have so many f****** people you have thousands and thousands and thousands of people posting jokes about black people that's all you need to ruin the reputation of thousands of people so for someone to say everybody that was like f*** Shia lebou is some racist in the white supremacist that's a cheap way out that's a cheap way out I bet more likely it's some dude is bored and he's sitting in front of his f****** computer and he works all day and this is where he escapes he's casing and types and right things and check them later and then goes back to him types things and saying stupid f****** cubicle that's a lot of the people so they pulled that whole amazing podcast down because of that when he was a child boo thing was ridiculous he will not divide us come on stop stop we get a chant that everywhere it's funny what they did they mock something that's their way of marking it nobody got hurt they made it out like it was awful crime they committed on this amazing person who just try to change the world no no they prank Shia LaBeouf and they said f*** Shia lebou LaBeouf Whatever It Is Shia LaBeouf I'd like that but this is an important part of this thing if it wasn't for people like that there would be no podcast now would like to dislike ratio that you see on YouTube videos is fascinating right because it's weaponized and they're thinking trying to ban that now because so many people use it to f*** with people I hate to say this about you folks but every time you have a check on here they got f****** torture the like to dislike rightly it's ruthless because they're just going to dislike it because Joe Rocket window sun yeah I mean in disliking it gives a little bit of power in the algorithm of deranking it so</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> don't put yourself a time limit know some people say if I don't do it in five years I'm going to quit or whatever so when I came out here was all in you know if I said five years I wouldn't have been here I would have been back in Chicago working at Motorola who knows so families always been really really key to my success having people very supportive and my wife who's a huge huge reason I am doing what I'm doing I mean to have a wife to deal with the life of a comedian on the road away from home a lot and you got to have like a strong strong woman to to be in your corner into the put up with that also just to deal with the weirdo a f******, to a weird person to be around to answer your question where do I go from here I don't know I joined doing some movies I just got started dipping my toe into some of these movies at the green book which is out now and nominated for some awards for for the Oscars and happy to be a part of that and then I like it exercising a different muscle when it comes to acting but not comedic acting I like the dramas I'm a serious guy generally speaking I'm not a goofball I'm not the guy always the center of attention and that's just not who I am so I like kind of being serious and and and and acting in a drama kind of place to kind of who I am and it's kind of serious guy and I liked it I get my fix from doing the stand up on stage I don't need to do it in a movie so I like the challenge number one and number two I just like to do different different things little bit outside the box so I left I'd like to do and then I'm into this gangster movie coming out with Scorsese and what is that called so and I play Crazy Joe gallo and my first and sent was with DeNiro and Pesci so what the f*** was that lie this is coming out on Netflix that's crazy how different he looks wow Sandler Netflix movie level is his but it's like either Francis Ford Coppola Scorsese this like a few people that you if you're on a set with them no Kubrick when he was alive like holy s*** that was a holy s*** moment for me I was out listen I am by no stretch of the imagination a season back there and then to get thrown into this group of people and working with them I mean I got to tell you there was a sense of Doubt like you know sometimes that I should I be sure this is happening and then you know to do the scene with DeNiro and Pesci it was almost like after the first scene I'm like oh yeah I should be here it's all the anticipation of leading up to the moment that is unfamiliar to you then once you do it you feel like man that was all in my head and I made it sound like it was going to be cuz I was thinking the negative 2 hours think I'm going to screw this up and this guy that's the way it's what motivates me I never look in the positive always come from a negative place but once once I did that first scene with them and they were these guys were more than helpful working with them and Scorsese when he came out of his friendly nice you know it was it was encouraging to be around that kind of positive energy the first week leading up to the scene because I knew it was going to be with DeNiro and Pesci what they did was that they took Gotham Comedy Club in New York City and they made at the Copacabana which I thought was fitting because Gotham Comedy Club this kind of where I did all my stand up in New York I didn't really do any other club but Gotham and then hear a club break Club mazzilli brothers who run it or know those guys and they transformed into the Copacabana and Don Rickles is played by Jim Norton I'm watching I'm watching him on stage with crazy that's fantastic cast and crew come on on my mind just want my mind but this thing is going to be I can't wait to see I didn't see any of the movie even when I was doing it I'm even look at what I was doing so I'm really excited to see what this thing looks like goddamn that's phenomenal what a milestone a movie with the Niro Al Pacino Joe Pesci a f****** Scorsese film Chi-Town lot of people never saw the Bad Lieutenant never seen my God has been amazing virtually everything he's ever done but the Bad Lieutenant is one of those movies that's so f***** up and so crazy it was a about a bad cop like a f****** really bad, Okay and like completely totally out-of-control but it is one of those movies where after it's over you know the credits roll and he was sitting at Jesus Christ what the f*** did I just watch 80s workout Jackie was it says 93 but they remade it with Nicolas Cage couple years ago Eleanor Mustang Gone in 60 seconds but it's just certain guys that take over roll and to do that again like like said they offered you Taxi Driver how do you say hey we're going to do Taxi Driver again you have to be like a good luck casting somebody else get the f*** away from me right at you can't be you can't be De Niro in Taxi Driver unless you're De Niro like possible that movie Cape Fear another one like he nailed it or was I think someone else was that character before I think Robert Mitchum I think played the same role that De Niro played but I didn't know that when I saw it when I saw it I just thought it's f****** DeNiro can 62 there it is yeah but if they try to do it today like it the f*** out of here no no no no no no no no you can't specially taxi driver Port of Call New heard about that but yeah that's the Nicolas Cage one yeah but whatever that Harvey Keitel version is holyshit when spoken to there was a part when they were kind of lighting De Niro and I and we're standing face-to-face and he's looking at me and I'm looking right at him and I wasn't going to say nothing and then he comes in on my my tiny tiny should be thanking a little bit me since my pie be straightened out my what it look like actually has been stated that if you if you type up Sebastian Maniscalco Irishman it should pop up it's got sideburns I mean if you if you see it in person you'll understand me they just said again that I didn't say nothing they said you're going to wear a wig no problem whatever you want me to do Scorsese was like okay there's a part where I'm going to go through a window when you go through the window and he's telling me that I'm going to go to the window and I wasn't going to say I don't do windows Jay-Z I'm sorry but then they said hey guy hearing he wants me to go through I mean big guy went through the stunt double went through and he cut his hand how did it really so I don't know what what it was if I would have went through the window I would have been dead glass whatever it is is not going to work but you probably cut yourself on that sugar glass yet if you landed wrong I mean if it was sticking up wrong you placed your hand funny makes NPR could cut yourself a little but but yeah it is exciting and it's been really exciting for me to last three or four years to have these opportunities to do these things and</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Japan's King Abdullah is that racist the way I said it's the first of the year at Tokyo's new fish market set a record price more than 3 million for a giant bluefin tuna a critically endangered species yes he that's where you got to go man is it critically endangered and if it's if it is so should you really be counting that f*** her up yet I don't know about that when I was in Hawaii we caught some yellowtail my youngest daughter loves fishing so we went out with her and we went on this boat and we were actually jigging is like this shelf and it's big drop-off and he's yellowtails hang out there and we caught a gang of them and one things they were saying was that the Big Island had a farm where they were farming yellowtail like they had his gigantic like sort of nodded in the area where the fish couldn't leave and they were they were trapped in this area but then this storm came and broke down all the Nets and the fish escaped and now they're everywhere and you're catching them we caught lights I don't like six or seven of them and they're f****** big like 10 lb of a light spinning rod really awesome awesome time but they were unbelievably delicious but these are non-native they brought him over there and released them like they start doing that with other fish these fish farms in just released these m************ out to the ocean cuz they're just take a nap and pulling them across the bottom of the floor and he's been it's like such a there's something to be said about going out and catching the fish like you're saying rather than taking a nap and just scooping everything up and it's past everything Turtles Dolphins whatever the f*** is there everything gets jacked in the problem is you know there's who knows how many countries have boats that are doing that and they're all operating and National Water and I don't know what the f****** laws are but they're just pulling what any of the other thing they do that's f***** up when they're done a lot of times they cut the the net loose and they just leave in the ocean they just dropped the net to the bottom of the ocean it's funny they have the regulations for like hunting yet they don't have it like in the ocean you known as nobody owns it and you only own like a certain amount of your sure like I often I saved from Malibu out know how much they the United States owns but we only own a certain amount and then it becomes international waters international waters is like kind of anybody could be out there it's weird that mean it makes sense but there's no I don't think there's any I think if you have a boat you can just kind of go anywhere that's International water and just no regulations what parts of the ocean are considered international waters by a 1982 United Nations on the law to see it's a belt of coastal Waters extending at most 12 nautical miles from the Baseline usually the mean low water mark of the coastal States owe 12 miles till 12 miles out or 13.8 miles 12 miles are in 12 nautical mile and mile and .8 away from you call those stores use the labels sushi-grade fish there is no official standard for using this label the only regulation is that parasitic fish such as salmon should be frozen to kill any parasites for being consumed raw the best ones are signed grade one which is usually won't be sold as sushi-grade but what about sashimi-grade is what he said the same thing freshwater fishing salmon that can f*** you up but you could pull a tune out of the right out of San Diego they caught a tuna and they slice it up and eat it right there on the boat like why does it right after they pulled it out of water that I haven't gone but that that to me would be the best to eating right out of the water I mean I just hope they don't wait until there's nothing left before buying it for three million dollars that's almost like a scene in the movie Ride that's like the end this was the one of the last to not look they bought it for 3 million everybody smiling and cutting it up it's like hunting regulations are critical but you could you know what the population is it's very they they fish and wildlife departments have all these different methods they use whether it's using reports from Hunters whether it's the they fly over with airplanes and helicopters and things along those lines never they use they have a bunch of different ways they can determine which population is then they had determined population of predators how many animals are lost how many animals are are shot during any hunting season and then determine how many tags can be divvied out so I say if you live in an area there might be 500 tags available but there might be like 2,000 Hunters that are applying for those tags the most people are not going to get it it's it's a very smart way they've they've really got it down to a that's because that there's more whitetail deer in this country than then even when Columbus landed its they've got a really good system figure figure something out for the ocean Bahamas you have to get everybody to cooperate and stop killing whales like there's there's certain Japanese folks who they have is really sneaky thing they do in this is conservation group called The Sea Shepherd's they catch these f****** people all the time but they basically do as they say we're research boat and the user research boat and go Slaughter whales and then sell the whales but they pretended that it's research but if they kill a whale a certain country still Value parts of whales they make things with it what the f*** do they make with whales I think they make some perfumes like what but people are still killing well well yeah I mean in these countries that they're using like you said parts of the fish for the day put it on their mantle they got like a I don't know or what-have-you phone from a whale or shark or whatever that's the big thing with rhinos this is what I'm talking about you know these things and I don't know how the hell you remember all this stuff I'm going to 5 just forgot the mileage off the coast of miles yeah I know how to remember these things I wish I had your memory Joe that's what I'm saying that I don't remember I just remember things that are interesting you know I have a it's a it's an odd an odd sense of memory but the the Rhino horn thing is kind of sad because it doesn't even work you know especially in this day and age where people can get by that works but there's something about it I think in some Asian cultures where it's considered like a sign of wealth you drive a Rolls-Royce you drink Rhino tea this guy's a baller you know he doesn't give a f*** he drinks wine OT and I like a man what a guy but there's something about that like you know I want to eat an extinct animal going to bring a woolly mammoth back to life and shoot it in the head like there's some people that are like that like they they wanted drink Rino T disguise a baller you know he doesn't give a f*** he drinks wine OT and I like a man drinking Rhino T what a guy you know this but there's something about that like you now yeah I want to eat an extinct animal want to bring a woolly mammoth back to life and shoot it in the head like there's some people that are like that like they they want to be the ultimate conqueror you know I want to eat a whale dick you know what I mean like this there's people that are like that</div>

We have a child so I don't know if you went through this but a lot of sometimes when you're coming from a single couple but a couple with no kids and now you have kids now you're you're finding other people who have kids so that's where we're and we're we're not yet into the preschool so we're kind of in limbo we're looking for new friends that are old friends are bad it's just now we have other obligations we have a child we can't we maybe can go out to dinner at 8 at night only eat like we used to know it and I were looking to bring it to the house yeah I know I know exactly what you're saying we went through that exact same transition and a lot of times you pick up some dead weight along the way it running these people the only thing they have in common is the kids the same age and then you have to talk to some f****** guy do they give you ear beatings about their job why can't you just some people just not interesting from fortunate yeah I mean you do run into that we need a guy like I went to a toddler group last week sometimes I do this obviously cuz I wanted to hang out my daughter but sometimes does material that comes out of going to something like that is gold yeah now it's me 15 women and a gay guy at this toddler group rent so I mean just like you it's almost writing it is like writes itself LOL I'm in a in a circle sitting Indian style cuz I feel if I live more of my life I could draw so much more humor from it and it's it's it's two-pronged it's I want to hang out with my family and I want to talk to people who are living these life experiences because what I've noticed is I want to keep the same kind of Lifestyle I've had when I wasn't successful because I feel when you start detaching yourself from the daily routine I say even going to Target you have somebody go to Target for you you don't you miss out on like what happens on a day-to-day and I want to still keep that richen and and available to me experiences because what I've noticed is I want to keep the same kind of Lifestyle I've had when I wasn't successful because I feel when you start detaching yourself from the daily routine essay even going to Target you have somebody go to Target for you you don't you miss out on like what happens on a day-to-day and I want to still keep that rich in and and available to me</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and obviously it's a f****** cage fighting promotions like how sensitive can you get here but with some social issues you know this like if I was working for the NBA probably been fired a decade ago you know the Dana White and you started so how did you become kind of the voice of of the UFC well I started in 1997 I was the post-fight interviewer that was it was just a position that was available in the UFC was very small back then very few people knew what it was was off a cable you couldn't get on cable you could only get on satellite and they needed someone to do post fight interviews but you were in that world to begin with was in the martial arts world you know used to teach martial arts before I became comedian ice to fight Taekwondo tournaments and had some kickboxing fights and I've always been a martial artist since I was a kid and so I just was interested in watching the UFC and then I start training and Jiu-Jitsu and when I was training Jiu-Jitsu I was just a Wipeout was just starting out that's when I got hired by the UFC to be a post fight interview but I only did that for 2 years and then I quit was just too much and it was actually like it was I was losing money I would make more money do the weekend of the comedy club then I would doing it doing the UFC and it's got to a point where it was too much of a pain in the ass and so I still remain the fan but I backed away and then the UFC was purchased by his company called zuffa in 2001 and when that happened they start putting on shows Vegas and I would go there with my friends they got me free tickets they reached out and they would try to get celebrities to go sit there so that it would it would cuz they were very small. hemorrhaging money they're trying to build it up and in talking to Dana White one day when I was talking about fights going on Japan like have you ever seen Sato fight do you know what what do you do know soccer Rod you know this guy I was bringing all these names and he was like do you want to do, turn him like I don't want to do, I'm going to get drunk and watch each other at work and he talked me into it for one show UFC 37 and 1/2 it was a show that was on Fox Sports Network sling and I think was the best damn Sports show. Was a part of it I did that and the rest is history and then I did like 12 of them for free like the UFC didn't have any money. Will they were hemorrhaging money than they had the rich people that owned it but it was not a profitable Venture and I said just get me there get me my friends tickets and I'll do it and so that's how I operated for like over a year and then I just became the commentator just weird that's crazy this Dana White he's a crazy man and he's he's got out in a weird way of looking at things that that's very effective and in his crazy mind he's like let's take this guy's never even thought about being a commentator and make them our commentator I mean I didn't know what the f*** I was doing I mean I really didn't I didn't have any training at all in the sports commentary I just would see what was happening and start talking about it you know which is really like the wrong more even play-by-play and color was I doing both of them at the same time was really weird and as far as you doing that do you get any notes from anybody going Hey Joe try this try that or you just develop that whole that voice all on your own 100% of my own so the only thing that I had was those like Mark dellagrotte a was a good friend of mine he is he's a top trainers in the world he's in the truck and I can communicate with him as a button where I can communicate with him and we talked about stuff like I can say does he look like he's limping to you and he's like yeah there's something wrong and then I'll start talking about it or am I wrong is he dropping his hand or is is this you like is a nice it's a nice thing that's going to bounce things off that used to be Eddie Bravo Eddie Bravo used to do it as well or I would be able to talk to him about position cuz he would be in the truck and I'll be able to ask him like his left leg's in Jeopardy right not right or he needs to step over with his right leg we be able to go over cuz like there's some aspects of martial arts are extremely technical especially to Jitsu when things go to the ground and you're trying to commentary do, Terry and I have to decipher which is his left leg which is his right leg where is he tied up where's he Tangled in a bun in real time while I'm trying to be entertaining and talking very complicated you know but nobody told me I figured out how to do it and you're not looking at it like a Jim Lampley or anybody in the broadcasting world when it comes to fights of this is something that you develop then on your own neck sometimes you look at it as a comedian you look at other comedians that are Friars or no not necessarily because one lot of guys that did it in for martial arts commentary there was John Peretti who was excellent he was on the very best who was actually the UFC Matchmaker and a commentator when I first started he was very good this guy named Jeff Armstrong he was very good to he was there when I first started to he actually ran a promotion called hook and shoot he's excellent really knows what he's doing and then there's a few other guys you know that that also did it but there's like what I do as far as like stand doing commentary for MMA this might mean 10 guys in the world to do it now you know they really do it on there on a high-level maybe 10 guys tomorrow Amy between one FC between you know Brave and then the UFC Bellator pfl there's maybe maybe 10 guys on the planet that are doing it does not a lot of people and there's a lot in the UFC now we're Fighters are now transitioning to become commentators and often times are the best at it like Michael Bisping just did this past weekend he was the UFC middle he's awesome at already did one one show they know more obviously because they've been in there and they have that added element of actually having fought in the UFC which is gigantic yeah I could see UFC which is gigantic yeah I could see other Paulie malignaggi but also very aware and Fighters can see things that maybe the average person can't see like they see when someone slowing down to see when someone's laying back they see when someone got hurt to the body they seem like little things that maybe a person who's never fought before it doesn't see</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> after looking at you what's going on man what's going on everything I've done this once before and I've watched you throughout the years and when I come in here I get a little nervous why who knows alot about everything I don't know a lot of I don't know a lot about everything I know enough to make it seem like I know a lot about everything whatever you doing it it's you know more than I do right like like we were on your treadmill out there and you go it's 13% that what did you say I keep some more difficult than regular running okay I forgot the fact what you just said from the time we walked in I lost it so I don't I don't have the ra pension that I wish I had I'm going to get you some Alpha Brain I need something do we have any is that what I'm missing in my didn't my diet Alpha Brain out let me know what's interesting though is that people come up to me with s*** that happened just a few years ago and I'm like I don't remember that at all I think you have a certain amount of room in your brain and my brain is always deleting stuff that doesn't think it needs anymore and then shoving in new things are sometimes someone will tell me about something like what are you talkin about and they're like you don't remember it was the guy with no arms and drove us around on what and then I have to go oh yeah it's like I find the folder in my head and like are there that yeah I just wish I could retain a lot of the things that either see or hear to then recall it in a conversation you can be got to write things down you going to like want to work all things that the prom I don't do a lot of writing as far as like a notepad or anything to just take notes when you write your act you write it in your head or do you write it on paper or Chris audio just audio go to The Comedy Store I'll record it and I listen to it on the way home and then I'll I'll do this next time maybe I'll do that I'll take that out this out and then so there's no writing my ACT is more recalling stories than sitting in a room going on I think this is funny that's kind of how I work but yeah the reason I say that to start off as just like I see you go down a lot of different paths on the podcast and I often go man if I was sitting in that chair can I add to the conversation and a lot of times it's no just because for whatever the reason I I just feel like I need to be a little bit more well-read company read the Goggins book book yeah but then I thought of this guy don't you know what was another Mile and so yeah I mean I'm just now starting to get into a little bit more books than I have in the in the past is in the past to be honest with you I haven't really I haven't really read much I try to read one new thing a week and the way I try to do it is I have I use a lot of audiobooks but I also read books I go back and forth in between them between reading and audiobooks but I find for whatever reason read books I go back and forth in between them between reading an audiobook but I find for whatever reason I retain more with audiobooks then I do with reading maybe it's my ADD or something like that cuz when I'm reading I kind of have to back up sometimes like I'll go through a whole paragraph I'm thinking about some other s*** while I'm reading yeah and then I got a whole back up re-read that go over it again you know that's what I find my mind wanders</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when things come up like say if you find out that there's people from Isis they're using Twitter and they using Twitter and posting things like what is the conversation like how do what do we do about this do we leave this up do we recognize this is Free Speech do we only take it down if they're calling for murder or hate speech like what how do you handle that it evolved send me because like we first saw Isis when the world we need to change our policy to deal with it what was the what was the initial reaction to it so once you realize that people from Isis for making Twitter accounts and they were trying to recruit people doing all these things what was the what was the thought process was a question like what it what are we going to do about that we we we haven't experienced it before we need to I'll reach out to our Pure companies to ask if they're saying the same things that we're seeing we have a bunch of civil societies that we talk to to get their take on as well and we try to balance that across some you know very spectrums weather be more organizations and I'm more focused on preventing online harassment all the way to DHL you and BFF who are protecting the First Amendment online so we we try to get as many perspectives as possible take that and then make some informed decisions but also realize that we're probably going to make some mistakes flying away and all we can do to correct somebody should be open about where we aren't that's probably where we failed the most in the past as we just haven't been open about our thinking process what led to pick a good decisions how are terms-of-service evolved it terms of service as an area industry is just it's a mess no one reads them you do you sign up for the services and you quickly hit accept yeah and we expect people to read these rules of the road but they haven't read them and have you ever read them I have rats I was I was in the first time users of Instagram really Kevin was intern Kevin Systrom was an internet video and I was on the First Investors of Instagram and love the service I don't think I've ever had their temp service put at the top of the page was copyright and intellectual property protections you see everything about violent threats and abuse and harassment and safety and it's not that the company intended for that to be the order it just we just added things going on but even a read of that puts forth our point of view like what we're actually copyright infringement above the safety of safety of someone so we need to relook at somebody sings and how they've evolved in how they reacted and above just because it's listed the second I mean is it they're essentially all in the same one cheat their own there was she when you bring it up when you discuss it first is that really critical they're all they're all part of the terms of service but I think that would only matters what what do we consider to be most important and we have to consider physical safety to be the one thing that we provide a most and I don't do threats physical threats doxxing anything that impinges on someone's physical safety this is an area where I don't think technology and services like ours have focused on and off we haven't focused on the off-platform ramifications of what happens on mine so what you do like like here's a good for instance this situation with this kid who had the Maga hat on in the Native American gentleman who is in front of him banging the drum and then people are calling for this kid's name they want his name they want his address including Kathy Griffin like how do you how do you handle something like that well that's essentially request for doxxing that is a new Vector that we haven't seen in Macon Mississippi Zara diesel cases at bring up entirely new thing so we're to study at we have to see how we reacted what happened with the net but this goes back to the incentives like we are incentivizing this very quick reaction and it's taking away from some some more of the you like considered work that we need to do to really diagnose what's happening in the moment and it was it such an interesting case study to see how that evolved over just 48 hours and that's one of the most because it's nuanced there's there's many different left onto it and a lot of like really need York reactions totally and but we helped that had to help it well it is just that that's how some of the Dynamics of the service work but is the Moses things when people choose to use the service like if you are a thoughtful person you wouldn't just like Prince the original image that was distributed came from an account is now and brighten so it was it was discovered that that account was a troll account what how does that happen and what was the thought process behind that cuz it was the images they they posted was illegitimate image it really did happen it was a part of an actual occurring event so why do you ban the person or the troll account to put it up I don't know about this particular case but it's likely that it was found there's a lot of what you see on the surface the Twitter and some of the actions that we take on the surface but where we spend a lot of our enforcement is actually what's happening underneath so in many cases we have trolls or people like the case that you mentioned whose sole purpose is just to harass or abuse or spread particular information and often times these accounts might be connected were they start one account that gets bands they start another account but we can actually see this through a network lens and we can actually see some of his behavior so that might have been one of the reasons I'm not sure in an in that particular case but you know how do you know do you know because of IP addresses do you know because of the variety of things like it could be it could be trying to use the same phone number or same email address IP addresses device IDs all these things are and you stood to judge what's happening within the context so we do have a lot of occurrences of suspending or temporarily suspending accounts because of activities across accounts in a nut that happens a ton but what what I mean what I mean in the in that we're helping this right now is like some of the incentives like just just imagine seeing that unfold and when you see someone with one take it kind of involved in something to follow along and then mob control so there has to be a way for us to incentivize a lot more more considered and more nuanced introspection of what's going on if I followed a bunch of accounts that like like Boris Johnson who was constantly giving me information about reasons to leave I would probably only see that perspective have a completely different perspective hopefully journalist do but most people won't do that work this is the only tool we give people follow an account if however during that time you followed the hashtag you filed a hashtag vote leave 95% of the conversation in the tweets you see are all reasons to leave but there's a small percentage that shows a different perspective and that shows a different a different reasoning we don't make it easy for anyone to do that and that is a lot of anyone to follow the perspective follow the hashtag for a topic for my loan interest and because of that we helped build an echo chamber Brian and something that doesn't really challenge any prospective and not to say that we should for set upon people but we don't even make it easy for people to do in the first place though the way you do that today is you go to the explore tab you look you search for hashtags are you tap into a hashtag and you can see all the conversation but that's that's work #and you can see all the conversation but that's that's work and most people just want you to work those Dana timeline will see what they need to see in I can certainly imagine you know why if I'm just following a bunch of people who have the exact same take on this it just continues to emboldened and Bolden Bolden and they seen nothing of a different perspective on the exact same the exact same situation</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it's not you making a statement and me just reacting to the bike that our conversation of all is based on what we say we can interrupt or another we can you know we can completely change the subject I can take control of the conversation and the people who might find that interesting follow it and the folks that don't just stop listening where you can't do that in a post comment model yeah it's also text is so limited it's great for just getting out actual facts but it's also thinking it's so close to thinking like an there's no composition right enough said that to me is the most beautiful thing about Twitter but also something that you know can be uncomfortable like I I can compose my life on Instagram I can compose my thoughts within a Facebook post and it can look so perfect but the best of Twitter is just super raw and right it's right to the thinking process and I just think that's so beautiful cuz it gets stuck it gets to Consciousness it gets to something deeper and I think that decent house out how is it different than a post an Instagram post on Facebook the speed demands that you know that the character constraint the speed or conscious present focused stinking versus like stepping back and and closing a letter closing a letter in and thinking about all the outcomes but often times people do compose it as a letter and they break it up into separate 280 character posts the other threats because of the Rhythm and we found a lot of residents with hip-hop as well because the bar isn't just a structure and the constraint allowed that flow did the thinking was read we looked at are you know languages around the world and there's some languages like German 140 characters you can't really say much can we say much at all 140 words and what was interesting about Japan was Japan is one of our largest our largest countries where we're bigger than Facebook there we're what is Twitter seems to be more fun if that makes any sense even though it's there's a lot of chaos when something put one of my favorite things when someone post something stupid and then underneath it is a bunch of jip's was it gifs or gifs I say gif El Chapo something ridiculous and then I'll go and I'll look at the response of like politics Twitter which can be super toxic you have sports Twitter MMA Twitter you have a UFC Twitter you have Kpop Twitter you have black Twitter super toxic you have sports Twitter you have NBA Twitter you have MMA Twitter you have a UFC Twitter you have Kpop Twitter you have black Twitter that's Jamie's you in love</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> social media like we go all the way back to Myspace Wright Myspace you got Tom Tom was sitting there in your in your top 8 and you know people would like post music that they liked and it was never political it was very often very surface and Comics it was a great way to promote shows and it was an interesting way to see things but it was it was like like the seed that became Twitter or Facebook or any of these is one of them I think we at least for us so I thought we got more of our routes from AOL instant messenger and icq message where you said like I'm in a meeting or I'm watching this I'm at I'm at Joe Rogan's studio right now. It's cool I don't need my computer on my phone to this and change this desk I can I can do it from anywhere and then the other aspect of of into messenger was of course chat so one of the things that the status would do is you might you might say like in almost Anna Kendrick Lamar right now and I might hit you up on chat and say like what what do you think the new album but now it's all public that's the biggest difference in the nuts that to me is what Twitter is my MySpace was it was profiles and you know people organized around these profiles and this network that developed between people and that is Facebook Facebook Facebook optimized the hell out of that and they scaled the world we we were something very different we you know we'd we started with a simple status and then peep and that is Facebook Facebook Facebook optimized the hell out of that and they scaled the world we we were something very different we you know we'd we started with a simple status and then people wanted to talk about it we we decided that should be on the same surface and shouldn't be so brilliant to the to the to the status it should be part of that flow and that's what makes Twitter you know so fluid</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what what is this pain is experienced in life you cuz I got to imagine that it wasn't anything that you predicted no one predicted Twitter right now so to all the sudden have this responsibility order changes everything and your young guy hold you 42 that's young to be in control of that much into have it over the time of what is it been 11 years or like what is that been like for you it's been it's been both beautiful and scary and uncomfortable and learning and it's just been a ton of learning and evolving in my code it shows me every single day where I need to push myself and what I don't know and and I think a big part is like just the realization that we're not going to be able to do this alone and I don't think we have to either have all the answers around enforcement of policy what not we're not going to serve the world we have aspirations to serve every single person on the planet and we we have aspirations to you know be the first consideration for the global public conversation and you know if we're the bottleneck for all this work we're not going to reach those aspirations so it just thinking deeply about how we might distribute more of us work and decentralized more than look at me look at you know the platform itself in like what we need to change to reach that reality and I think we got to look really deep and foundational it goes back to you know that your question on 141 of things that we saw was you know we shifted to 280 characters and that you noticed 140 characters is so sacred you know it it became this cultural thing and I was in love with him so many people are in love with it but when things we notice as we move to 280 is that the vast majority of tweets that are broadcast don't go above 140 even with that limitation raced but where they do Go Bubba 140 is in replies when people reply they tend to go over the hundred forty character limit and even bump up into the 28280 lemon and what it'll at what we seen it allow is just more nuanced in the conversation and allows people to get more context and Panda and come just get their experience on the table of him or where is 140 did not allow that so we have seen that increase the health of those conversations in the discussion so it's stuff like that that we need to question and not hold so it's so sacred 40 characters are going to be really pissed off if you write a million characters in cat does think you know what I would like I would like edit the ability to edit like if you make a typo or something like that but also the ability for people to see the original like at it but see the original like that we're looking at exactly. when we have to exist anyway I mean no matter what if you send someone something even if you on Instagram people are going to know the original you could build it such that you maybe we introduced a 5-second to 30 second delay in ascending and within that window you can edit I'm going to need more time autocorrect got you totally but the issue is going longer than that it takes that real-time nature on the conversation with her out of it for Delaney's tweets and like when you're watching UFC are you watching like Warriors basketball a lot of a lot of the great Twitter is like just like in the moment just like you know it's the Roar of the crowd it's like you know looking across at someone you're in this virtual Stadium within just saying like oh my God that shot can you believe it and Clarity more important because it doesn't have the ability to communicate quickly the ability to clarify that's it that's where we need to really pay attention because if you're if you're in the context of an NBA game do you want to be fast and you just won't be at the moment you just you know what you want to be raw but if you're in the context of considering what the president justed were making a particular statement then you probably need some some more time and we can be dynamic. I have the ability to communicate quickly the ability to clarify that's it that's where we need to really pay attention because if you're if you're in the context of an NBA game do you want to be fast and you just won't be at the moment you just you know what you want to be raw but if you're in the context of considering what the president trusted were making a particular statement then you probably need some some more time and we can be dynamic.</div>

They have and I don't know it yet developed the skepticism and healthy and I have a lot of skepticism of companies like ours leaders like me I think that's right I think that's right and people should and we I mean I was I was I was formed through a lot of the ideas at the end I just fell in love with what it made possible and I never ever want to run afoul of of those ideals and and you know the the the removal of barriers and boundaries and indica action that we have because of it and I think often and reflect often about my role in the centralization of my role in our company and I want to I want to figure out and help figure out like how we can continue to add massive value and and be an amazing business which is is us and we'll always be us but at the same time be a participant participatory force in this greater good that the internet has really started and it it's not it's not led by any one individual or anyone company nuts to the beauty of it and I want to I want to make sure that we find our place or not and we can also contribute massively to and then I think we can just take a lot of work a lot of introspection and a lot of experimentation about making mistakes and failures encouraging that you have that attitude cuz you know a lot of people I think in a similar situation would try to control the narrative they would try to reinforce their own particular perspective on things and try to get other people to adopt it or try to push it and I think it is it's very important to just have this open discussion in and I think it's very important to review your own thoughts and ideas and the best ways to do so without everything it yeah put it out there is a great process and that's the way this podcast has evolved more than probably any thing you did this because you want to learn from people and and their the platform that you've created Millions get to learn from it as well and MSS so amazing like I'd I learned from your podcast all the time and that's what technology makes possible but with that power also comes grandma Nations and if we're not talking about the ramifications in like at least being open about what we know and what we don't know and I think we're I think we State and post a lot more of what we know rather than what we don't know don't be evil but that your own s*** f*** you good post a lot more of what we know rather than what we don't know don't be evil put that in your own s*** f*** you good</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the most controversial like I know my friend Sam Harris was trying to get you guys to ban Donald Trump who sang it to follow your terms of service I just did a podcast with him today or tomorrow I love him to death but it would he was trying to do was like saying hate he's threatening nuclear war like he's saying hey Korea my mom's a bigger than your bombs like what else does the guy have to do to get your from the platform when you guys saw that what was your reaction to that and was there an internal discussion about banning the president United States so so two things are one it was the context that presidents of this country have used similar language in different mediums they use it on radio that use it on television it's not just through Twitter and even if you were look at you were to look at the Obama it wasn't exactly the same tone in this exact same language but there were threats around the same country and we have to take that context in the consideration so the second thing is that we need that the most controversial aspect of our rules and our terms of service is probably this Clause around public interest in newsworthiness where powerful where's our public figures might be in violation of our terms of service but the Tweet itself is a public-interest there should be a conversation around it and that is probably the thing that people disagree with the most and where we have a lot of internal debate but we also have some pretty hard lines if we had a global leader including the president United States make a violent threat against we will take action we always have to balance out with like is this a is this something that the public has interested in I believe Jenna Lee the answer is yes it's not going to be in every case but generally the answer is yes because we should see how our leaders think and how they act in essentially I do forms voting that informs but the conversation on forms whether we think they're going to they're doing the right job or we think the they should be they should be part of that it's very important to see how someone uses that platform and when someone uses it the way he uses it and then becomes president continues to use it that way that's what people like what he's been consistent in 2009-2012 and you look at all the way back then but once he became president maybe just lock it down try to do a good job for the country and then you know after 4 years or 8 years just go back to his old self f*** you f*** the world f*** this but no he's he's he's just in one way it's hilarious see as a comedian I think it's awesome because it's just it's so hilariously stupid it's so Preposterous that even has the time to talk about Jeff Bezos has affair the fact that he got caught with the National Enquirer getting text messages and calls him Jeff Bozo like don't you have s*** to do man like as but as a comedian I am a gigantic fan of folly almost against my better judgement I like watching I like watching disasters I like watching chaos when I see nonsense like that like oh Jesus drawn like a moth to a flame this sets a very bizarre tone for the entire country because want one of these will about Obama like Obama or hate Obama seems very measured very articulate obviously very well-educated and I think that that aspect of his presidency was very good for all of us because he represented something that was of a very high standard in terms of his ability to communicate his access to words the way measured his words and held himself I think that that's good for us like talk better than me he does he doesn't use Twitter better he's not he's just as f****** mad mad but isn't important understand how I could hopefully that informs opinions and actions of the percent that's my point that's my point is like that this is this weird gray area where I think overall I definitely support your decision to not not ban him for violating our terms of service like it we need to know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> but I also think about it because of podcast cuz podcasts are in a similar way just no one saw coming and the people are involved in that are like what the f*** are we doing like me I'm like what am I doing like what is this like for me it's like to talk to guys like Ben Greenfield and and Jonathan hate and all the different people and learn some stuff going to have clearly learned way more than I ever would have learned without no doubt about it unquestionably but I didn't I didn't f****** plan this so now all the sudden there's a signal that I'm sending out to millions and millions of people and then people like well you have responsibilities great why didn't want that any more responsibility to what what I distribute I just want to be able to have a freak Show just talk to people like what it would be like there's certain people have on with his house Jones or anyone that's controversial f****** mad why you giving this the platform are you okay I didn't think about that way and I don't think that's what I'm doing I think I'm talking to people and you can listen but it's giving that person to platform cuz there's a well know they'll tone down there like Milo yiannopoulos that was one of the arguments people gave me like he tone down his platform when he was on your show so you can get more people to pay attention to him like okay but he also talked about was exposed with my show because we talked about that it's okay to have sex with under boys with their gay because there's like a mentor relationship between the older game and the young people like what the f*** are you talking about and that was a big part of why he's kind of been removed from the public conversation that was there was one of the fitting and then there's the discussion like what what is that what is removing someone from the public conversation if someone is very popular and they have all these people that like to listen to them like what is the responsibility of these platforms what is the responsibility in to decide whether or not someone should or shouldn't be able to speak and this is the thing that I've been struggling with and I've been bouncing around inside my own head and I see that you guys struggle with it and pretty much everyone does YouTube does and it's it is a hugely significant discussion that is left to a very in a relatively small amount of people and this is by this discussion of what is social media is it something and everybody has a right to or is it something that should be restricted to only people that are willing to behave and carry themselves in a certain way I I believe it's something that everyone has a right to he he did not your house he he did very different things on our platform versus the others week we saw this domino effect over a weekend of one platform Banning him and then another another another in very very quick succession and you know people I think would have assumed that we would just have followed suit but he didn't violate our terms of service and afterwards she did and and we have you know we have a we have a policy and if if there's a violation we take enforcement actions one might be asking the account holder to delete the Tweet another might be a temporary suspension another might be a permanent suspension he said that on his show I don't know I don't know all the mediums you said it in the what we're looking at is the is the is a conduct and what he did on our iPhones what did he do on your platform that was like that you all were in agreement that is enough I'm not I'm not sure what the what the actual like you no violations were but we have we have a set number of actions and if they keep getting if it's device an account keeps violating terms of service ultimately sapona suspension and when all the other platforms were taking him off we didn't find those three we didn't we didn't find those violations and they won't report it but again it goes back to a lot of our model people weren't reporting a lot of the tweets that may have been in violation on our service and we didn't act on them what's going on with patreon are you aware of the Sargon of akkad thing cuz he did a podcast a long time ago I believe six months or so ago where he used the n-word in the way he used it is actually against white nationalists and he also said a bunch of other stuff and they decided Patriot decide that what he said on a podcast was enough for them to remove him from the platform even though he didn't do anything on their plan that was egregious and also they had previously stated that they were only judging things that occurred on their platform is been a giant blow back because of that because people are saying now you're at you're essentially policing and not based on his actions just Concepts and communication that he was using the way he was talking that you're you are eliminating him from being able to make a living and that you're doing this because he does not fit into your Paradigm the way you want to view the world he views the world differently this is an opportunity for you to eliminate somebody you disagree with I mean that I don't know that nuances of their policy but like we we have to pay attention to folks who are using Twitter to shut down the voices of others weaponized and we also have to pay attention to where people are using it that put other folks in physical danger and also pay attention to where people are using it that put other folks in physical danger and that is where we need to be most severe but otherwise everyone has a right to these Technologies and I think they also have a right to make sure that they have a very simple and open read of the rules and then we're not in a great state there are are rules and enforcement can be extremely confusing if you</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's not really I don't think it's at what everyone wants either sometimes people just like to go on there and talk s*** mini someone that's trapped in a cubicle right now just ran they just want to go in there and get in arguments about gun control or and out whether or not Nancy Pelosi's the devil this is this is what you know it did serve the purpose for them things that get strange though is who's to decide you know there's a business this is concept there's a discussion I should say where some people believe that like Twitter or Facebook or any Forum where you're having a public discussion should be considered almost like a public utility like anyone has access to the electric power even if you are you know even if you're racist you still can get electricity and some people think that you should have that same ability with something like Twitter or the same ability with something like Instagram obviously this is we're in Uncharted Territory and you are you are in Uncharted Territory no one has been there before so who makes the distinction when you see someone that it's saying something that you might think is offensive to some folks but not offencive to the person who saying it may be the person saying it feels like they need to express themselves in this is important to say and how do you decide whether or not this is a valid discussion or if this is air quotes hate speech which is a you know there's some things that are hate speech and there's some people use the term hate speech and it's just a cheap way to shutdown a conversation do we so the simple answer is we look at conduct we don't we don't look at the speech itself we look at conduct we look at how the tool is being used and you're you're right in that like I said I think when people see Twitter they see and they expected to be a Public Square they can go into the Public Square or they can say whatever they want they can get on a pedestal and people might gather around them and listen baepsae some of them might find it offensive and they leave the difference is there there's also this concept of the megaphone in the megaphone can be highly targeted now which would as well so it's not it's not the it's not the speech it's how it's Amplified and then you have a bunch of people or one person and their Twitter feed is over with only attacking this prominent feminist just consoling attack or calling her a liar calling her this, when do you decide is it harassment when you decide this is hate speech when like how do you and misses a look at the contact a nap so there's a fictional account right person were talking about but in this for instance what what would dictate something that was egregious enough for you to eliminate them from your platform well that's that's so that's the last resort but we like to conduct we look at often times it as you said like the probability of someone who is harassing one person it's highly probable that they're also housing 10 more people so we can look at that behavior we can look at how many times has person is being blocked or muted or reported and based on all those all that data we can actually take some action but we we have to correlate it with the other side of that because people go on and they coordinate blocks as well and the coordinate harassment made in the coordinate Ansari not harassment but reporting reporting a particular account to get it shut down into to take the voice off the service so these are the considerations we have to make but it's it all starts with conduct and often times will see coordinated conduct weather be at 1 turn open multiple accounts or coordinating with multiple accounts that they don't own to you don't go after someone and there's a bunch of actors of people use retweet for that the quote tweet for that a lot as well like hello quote tweet a tweet to someone finds and they'll say look at this idiot Twitter do your thing and then just this mob starts and goes and tries to effectively shut that person down so there's a bunch of tools we can use permanent suspension is the last resort one of the things that we can do is we can down rank the replies so any of these entities behaviors and conduct that looks linked linked we can actually push farther down in the reply chain so it's all still there but you might have to push a button to actually see it you might have to show more replies that you see this harassing account or what might look like harassing language and is this manually done this is all this is all automated automated but how would you like a ranking in the end looking amplification and I'm looking at the network is is automated should be down drank like how do you how do you figure that out it's it's a machine learning and deep-learning model and they just look at how these things are where they make mistakes and then we improve it it's just constantly improving constant learning and does that feel like censorship to you like automated censorship because I mean who who is to decide other than people whether or not something is valid but we're not we're not looking at the at the speech in this particular case we're looking at the conduct likely conducted conducted like someone in fast bowlocity attacking someone else right so those are the things that are technology allows velocity changes how you know to broadcast a message that someone didn't really ask for and didn't want to hear we don't touch if I follow Joe Rogan you'll see every single tweet we don't touch it right but that's an audience that you earn but in your replies page we have a little bit more room because this is this is a conversation that starts helping some people just wanted to drop it and and all we're saying is we're going to look into if I follow Joe Rogan you'll see every single tweet we don't touch it right but that's an audience that you earn but in your replies page we have a little bit more room because this isn't it this is a conversation that starts up and some people just want to disrupt it and and all we're saying is we're going to look at move in the destruction down not that it's hidden but it's still there but you know you just see it a little bit farther down</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> there's there's a there's a weirdness to it right there's a weirdness Title Lending text vertically at anonymously you know I'm in there's so many accounts that are just a nag you know that so many accounts were there clearly designed if you like sometimes someone to eat something mean to me and I'm like what this person's up to so I go to their site and itches them tweeting mean s*** at people they all day long like it's probably some angry person at work and then like I'm just going to find people with him all day when did you realize our when did you realize I'm sure you're aware of it when did you realize if this was almost out of your control in terms of like the scale of it there was other wasn't there wasn't one moment there wasn't one moment that it just felt completely resonant unfolded into the next thing in the next use case and it just keeps surprising us with how people are you know it definitely recently I think we've identified some of the areas of the service that we need to pay a lot more attention to Twitter is unique and it has two main spaces one which is your timeline and those are the people that you follow and when you follow someone they've earned the audience and then it has his other world where any insert themselves into the conversation they can actually mention you and you'll see that without asking for it you can insert yourself into hashtags and to search Indies or areas of people have taken advantage of and these are the areas that people have gained or systems to in some cases artificially amplify but also just to spread a lot of things that weren't velocity that they're not possible before now when this is all happening what's the conversation like at Twitter when you're recognizing this is happening that people are kind of gaming the system like what it how do you guys how do you mitigate it what it what's the discussion or early on it was just pretty surface-level like how we change some of the appdynamics but more recently we're trying to go a lot deeper in and asking ourselves a question when people open Twitter what are we incentivizing what are we telling them to do when they open up this app we may not explicitly be doing that but there's something that we're saying without being as clear about it so what does the like button incentivize what does the retweet inside fights what does the number of followers and making that number big and bold incentivize so I'm not sure what we should know I'm not sure if we should incentivize anything but we need to understand what that is and I think you know right now we we do incentivize a lot of echo Chambers because we don't make it easy for people to follow interest in topics it's only account we incentivize a lot of outrage and how hot takes because of the family Dynamics in the service allowing a lot of nuance in conversation earlier on pseudonyms ability to not use your real name incentivizes some positive things like the last for whistleblowers and journalists to might fear for their career or even worse their life and under certain regimes but also allows for people like example you mentioned of just random Fire and you know spread of abuse and harassment throughout so those are the things that we're looking at and how do we how do we enable more of the conversation to evolve how do we increase the credibility reputation of accounts how do I identify a credible voices within a particular domain not just through this very coarse grain blue verified badge but if you're an expert in a particular counts how do I identify a credible voices within a particular domain not just through this very coarse grain blue verified badge but if you're an expert in a particular topic how do we recognize on real time and show that so that we can provide more context to we were talking to him if you want to engage in a deeper conversation or just ignore or block them</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when you started Twitter when you guys first started did you have any idea there's no way you could have had it any idea what it would be now but is one of things I would try to emphasize the people in the people I got Shooters crazy how could it not be crazy there's never been anything like it before like imagine trying to predict the kind of the president United States uses Twitter to threaten other countries I mean going to be when you first did it well you know we were building this thing for a self and that's how that's how everything starts to use it we wanted to we went to you no stay connected with each other we loved technology as a podcasting we're really quite a few folks but we weren't that passionate about where podcasting was going in our particular domain we just got a lot of competition early on iTunes just released a podcast directory but we knew we wanted to work together we knew we love this idea of one button publishing we love this idea of collaboration we love this idea of being anywhere and being able to what was happening that was that was the idea I mean that that was it and that's what we wanted it to be and I think the most beautiful and also sometimes uncomfortable aspect of Twitter is it we really learned what it wanted to be and the people helped create it like everything that we hold sacred now the app symbol the hashtag the retweet those were not invented by me or the company those are things that we discovered things that we discovered people using and we just observed it and we'd we noticed what they were trying to do their trying to talk with one another they were trying to collect tweets around topics with the hashtag designer Robert Anderson who leads our design in the cash app Hiram Foursquare later on but he was the first one he was actually communicating with his brother and he put at Buzz his brother's name is Buzz and it just kind of spread it wasn't in Mass but people were doing it but what was most interesting is not what they're doing but what they wanted to do with it they wanted to address each other and that's that changed the company completely that changes service because broadcasting what's happening to conversation into being being able to address anyone publicly out in the open which came with a lot of power and also a lot of issues as well hashtags like #fry faster #something weird that's in the news that's that's such a unique way to find things but to go on Twitter and two to utilize that I mean it's interesting that you're that this guy just did it just contact his brother will that what do easy assemble the hashtag was this guy Chris Messina and he has made it easier we made it more accessible we we enabled everyone to do it with the app symbol we made a page that collected all mentions of your name with the hashtag wheel people search immediately so you could tap on the keyword and you would see everyone talking about that or tweeting about that specific #so these things were just emergent behaviors that we didn't predict and they became the lifeblood of the service what was fascinating to me about something like Twitter or even something like YouTube is that there's not a lot of other ones like it there's just this one thing like how does that happen where this one thing sort of gets adopted by everybody and takes over and then comes is overwhelmingly massive platform in this really there's Vimeo and there's a few other videos services but nothing on the scale of YouTube and it's the same thing with Twitter there's nothing on the scale Distributing information and a quick short 280 character form like that I don't think we could plan for it I don't think we could not show it built so that someone said recently to can Palm Springs for an oscillating someone said recently that Twitter was discovered and I think what's behind all that is that it it it hit something foundational it hit something essential and my co-founder Biz likes to save a Twitter can never be uninvented it's here it changed everything but the use of it has been revolutionary and it just a simple idea if you know you could text with the entire world if you could actually reach anyone in the world or anyone could see what you're thinking which I think is also the beautiful thing about about text in the in the medium you can actually get it someone's raw thoughts and anyone in the world can see that instantaneously it becomes a subconscious it becomes us like Global Consciousness and it it gets to some really deep places anyone could see what you're thinking which I think is also the beautiful thing about about taxed in the in the medium you can actually get it someone's raw thoughts and anyone in the world can see that instantaneously it becomes a subconscious it becomes us like Global Consciousness and it gets to some really deep places in society and and some of those places are pretty uncomfortable</div>

Clean up or caught and then got just way carried away and it's unfortunate cuz you think I'm in shape and I do crazy things this guys put me to shame like at in Sam's garage what he's able to do on the bike and just as workout regimen in like just how competitive he is mad he's a he's a world-beater he could be by far will Champion you know there's some things that he said he's so young so here's some things we need to get to figure out everyone takes losses and hoping one of these is going to this park him to realize how good he is everywhere you know and that's just on Fortune statues MMA he's got to make sure it doesn't have too many of those and make sure we fight smart degrees is so good as a wrestler and when he gets that guy hurt he's or something like that yeah I mean that's the other thing you realize like after we dropped and could have jumped on me could have swore mean I can read it to me you know that jump on him and it's warmer and then look for that finish but he's invincible and just I don't know man there's there's things that you kind of figure out when you've been out in the cage longer and longer around the crew you understand there's ways to finish that fight or or how to auto just be a smart fighter that he'll figure out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Wayne County California I don't know that beats life yeah I mean he was 10 weeks along from both hands I was longer but with him it was 10 weeks and he's flying out 3 days a weeks every Monday he would land you would leave Wednesday night train Monday Tuesday Wednesday and that hard right I make sure take like Thursday off and then do my other stuff while he's gone but every week you traveling back and forth f****** dedication he's lived in my house like he's on the meal plans with the calvitto's like he's full bore into it like he gives me is all I'm a very fortunate person to have met Dwayne into masonry control relationship Yahoo grout is it really doesn't mean that's the ideal when you can get a mentor and a student that have that kind of a bond together and you can learn so much and he won't let like we have such a good Bond now to that he won't like let bulshit so I won't be pumping me up for no reason let me I mean I'm not a lazy guy but if I was he wouldn't let me like Miss practice or you know I mean he only back more than anything but he gives me this is true assessment of what needs to be done I obviously lost the sooner we got home and Houston Texans I can come out tomorrow and work out the wall by love to get some working with you some things we should go over with him what did he say about that Exchange music change the things on the mids and maybe I so Francis a whole exchange I think I closed the distance to hard Henry Shooters which type he was a fighter I think he came out differently which was great by ham he's done great things he expected him to maybe run a little bit more and he came out aggressive and so getting used to the distance control you know not always having a set plan and ingoing close combos what I think's going to happen to be able to adjust on the Fly and maybe me and him sometimes we are to set on certain things I'm Reaction Time stuff you know when I need to react to distance change any drag two things like that it's hard to really change anything in that fight cuz I didn't get a chance to see it either and I was so quick now have you talked to Dana or anyone since I know you said that you guys would talk in the future but it's been about what how many days been about a week or so has been to a week and a half after a week and a half now yeah I haven't heard anything since the day after the fight I was texting with him the day after the fight today I've sit down and figure out what the plan is kind of think you know but obviously everyone knows that we want to run it back in and it sounds like they do as well to so well as far as something that people want to watch whether it's a 35 or 25 I think people absolutely like to see that I mean at 35 the big selling point B Henry gets his hand to become champ champ course I don't care like the other belts are awesome all that stuff in the regular recognition all the stuff but to me I want that one that went back I want that opportunity back to even just show how much work and how smart I was and how I didn't get I didn't get hit in and I wasn't fragile from unit 25 I really wasn't like I wasn't like I didn't get beat because I was a 25 lb or I have felt I have no excuses I got beat because I got beat right I have no excuses that I was too fragile being 25 that feel better than I've ever felt in my entire I just want the chance to prove that you know what I mean so that's why I say that I'll give him my belt at 30 Pines babies got 25 again but well I was to take the fight wherever I mean I think I'll we need Frazier right where I need to talk to her and see me this is just that this is the nature of the sport and a guy like him and I think you and you and Cody needed each other so important for actualizing Olympic gold medalist he's a competitor he knows what he's doing right arguably from his accomplishments as one of the greatest Combat Sports athletes of all time the other guys enough of the first guy ever to be an Olympic gold medalist and a UFC world champion which the gold medalist thing I even hold even higher for him than even the obvious EUC Champions huge writing but I rustle my whole life I grow blessing to be an Olympic gold medalist is a f****** huge thing I still think today wrestling the hardest part of ever done and just to see that achievements that's why I almost sold at higher than him being a UFC champion will also the fact that he was beat by DJ he beat beat by Mighty Mouse in the first round he has destroyed his need to the body taken out beating up and stopped and humiliated It Right comes back and what was it like 2 years later and think it was. I mean the pound-for-pound consensus best fight on the planet and the guy that it held add title from the very first time it was ever brought to the UFC he's been the only flyweight Champion until Henry came along so and that's another reason why I want that fight man like you know to me like I know that I'm better than him obviously you're going to give me some if you were going to give me s*** for saying that because obviously the fight they think it went down the way it went down but guess what I'm better than that mother f***** and I want to prove it I want the toughest fights I mean that's why I was calling out Max Holloway I want all the way with Sam calavitta I can do walk around 165 lb percent body fat 100% like this guy man he can stacked away on me can take it off me I can go I have a secret weapon with him Kavita I'm telling you and I could have secretly just yeah everyone he gets home from work he's all dressed up in his Ty Summers we're already there waiting for him and he's don't even change not to throw medicine balls that are faced in his tie and I'll just up from the soup from work you know like he like that s*** Cleveland Park two cars in it we have one one spotrac we have a spot to do my car cleaned and deadlifts what he really has is he has 3/4 by on a 3 by there it is yelling when I'm there working out cuz he's pushing her work out there 3 hours long we're going there's a park across the street and then throw medicine balls at each other and go to head back that last one with pico please get a chance to see what's in that the garage so I guess he Parks his car in the driveway man eccentric and concentric contraction you know you have a strain he's a Cuisinart there's for your shoulder stability you rotator cuffs I mean what did you do to in the wrestling your shoulders take a beating in it because different injuries that I've had I do a lot of band stuff with my stuff bands by just what we having me if you had a nice Keiser machine in there maybe we'd use it but I think the resistance coming back really really want support the further you extend the band the harder ones to pull you back and hands hurt when you have a way down there it's exact same weight going in and out right for the further you extend that band of Harvey make it on yourself cuz I think it was more you can do with it and it's just very easy and take up no space by Ryan a lot of medicine ball work for a core and bar shoulders as well to catching weird angles with keeping her balance would you like a lot of like old-school s*** but in a certain way to certain time yeah and so how does he get all that s*** into his garage they have to pull stuff out into the driveway their stuff on the side of his house he's got like a little Chessie stack stuff into and man and we a lot of it doesn't need much you really doesn't there's a there's a lot of work you can do with just bodyweight 100 pound medicine balls Aussie mix it like the most liked of the strongman competitions there's a big there's a big hill next to his house that he makes his carry these like hundred-pound logs and we at the farmers carry him up the hill and we're doing with a partner when I get up so far I drop my run back and get 200 lb medicine ball at the Sprint up the hill with it things like that where you're pushing your you lactate threshold overtime wow and how does he schedule the training sessions like how does he know what to have you do and when off of our time frame of when we want to off of my heart rate variability and how my body is reacting to our training cuz maybe I sparred and I admits to Harvard Dwayne so I wake up the next morning and he realizes all we got to pull back today like if I push you hard today you're going to go in such a deep hole that's going to take you a week to come out of it to where he wants me to get that really high peak take a day off so that now I can start coming back up again to where if I just continued for for 5 days just crushing it run as hard as I possibly can my body's going to crash hard it's going to take me it's going to be more of a detriment to come out of that hole then if I was taking a break in between those days so he'll schedule they our schedules will change we haven't we have a schedule from the beginning so say I'm 12 weeks out like right this is our plans we're going to do but then maybe I get sick or maybe I've trained to Harvard Wayne the day before so he'll realize all right this next day with some school but easier even if it's my Jiu-Jitsu practice he like maybe just drill Felipe just make sure it's like a little base drill I don't get your heart rate such-and-such which I don't rolled already monitor on but I can kind of just guess you know how hard I need to go could you I guess you could anybody do you know anybody that does seems like it would get knocked off or something maybe for drilling when he's got you doing all this crazy stuff like dad lives in plyos and medicine ball work is there like a logic to what exercises are done when I like how does he look cuz what you doing I was old school stuff like a badass stop but my question is always like when do you do that yes I like when is that when is that done like once a week is that done early in the training camp is it done late like when are you doing strength work and you cuz you were saying you were doing cleans like the week out only so when I'm doing those like a week how I'm doing I'm only a certain amount of reps you know I'm not maybe not taxing my body for as long as I wouldn't earlier even though I'm going heavy meeting with you in two sets you know just to keep my central nervous system strong other than just texting yourself you know are there certain times like these I need to get explosive power work or some days I need you Cadence fast food fast feet cardio work and he has that all mapped out on what days are what what weeks are what depending on where I'm at my fight camp or I'm going 25 and if I want to stay as strong as it was at 35 things like that or I'm going 45 to go to keep my my my cardio up cuz I think was if I were to go 45 minutes put so much more muscle on the Warriors that I'm going to lose cardio running nobody wants to build keep that lactate threshold and me and keep my car deal if I'm able to walk around in 165 lb what do you mean by red light therapy there's a machine that I have in my house is called a Juve it's a big red light it says 682 880 nanometer light that I stand in front of it for a certain amount of time to not only increase my testosterone but to help recovery in my a mitochondria my cells and flush my body out yeah I have one of those in my garage infrared sauna my garage I do big is that thing that there's new ones now they're huge as big as my body on that one to go in the backyard or they have travel ones you can take with you that's really small real reason why I got into it was for increasing my testosterone the ability of my sperm Halle cuz I was I was I was having my session was low and I want to increase it and I saw this I'm through background actually met Browns won the county call me as soon as I get a shout-out he's got the training equipment he's in he's a very knowledgeable variable right guy and you wouldn't like to win guess that when I had the podcast it's a lot of people said I was a caveman I want to increase my testosterone but also read about increasing motility atmosphere must try navigating rough and rubble and this and that could be that could have been my diet I switched so much up that I can't tell you which one it was so you know cuz Sam help me out this help me out me so I'm I'm doing that I'll do hyperbaric chamber all do cryotherapy often to do the hyperbaric chamber only when I need it cuz it can mess with your your hematocrit you know what altitude training as well to I'm trying to high red blood cell count my hematocrit and then when you go when you get into a hyperbaric chamber your breathing 100% oxygen so if I'm in it too much it will lower my hematocrit right but I do a lot of the altitude of music is called all to lab I breathe into it for a certain amount of time this again another program he created the company was around but he created the program that I'm supposed to do to put my body in a hypoxic stay for only a certain amount of time because you can over trainers same as an altitude machine he has me use his called alter lab I breathe into it for a certain amount of time this again another program he created the company was around but he created the program that I'm supposed to do to put my body in a hypoxic state for only a certain amount of time because you can over train yourself that way as well to increase my capillaries increase the date of vasodilation in my veins as well as increase increase increase red blood cells</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I have no idea I have no idea I feel like you can kind of feel the difference in a promotion when you go there getting bigger and bigger right you can feel the difference of course but you see the talent in the UFC's been around for so long and there's know how to do it just made the right move so awesome they want to see how it affects your life like like me I've been I mean obviously I've been pretty pissed off about it and I wasn't staying busy with my business is in my family like I would lose my mind I would like to see that Lexie Brian Ortega after he fought Max Holloway fight looking unbeatable and gets just just touched up UNO Max Holloway just touched mom and we really got to see who the f*** Max all the way the champion he's just a f****** Champion is mine said damn it I love it and I wasn't ready for that yet Cubs neck we got the Darcy at the end of the first rounds are holy s*** it's over but the bell rang and he got out of it but then the second round he jumped on him and grab that Guillotine he went over the top of them right where they stand up and clenched and got it and then came down on it and then had it in the air and it's nasty that is technique is so f****** sharp and he could do that with everything I mean armbars trying to get like a good squeeze cardio to there he comes from you know that Heather and Huron camp and you know from best horian school and we're hoist was from that the Torrance crew I mean that's that's right from the f****** motherland that is an E note is a term that some people get offended by that term is basic Jiu-Jitsu I'm not offended by that all because some of the very best guys of all time whether it's hard your Gracie or Hicks and you don't see them doing like weird stuff it's all very standard it's not in his basic striking Max Holloway Brian Ortega he was basic striking to be in control as a person who loves martial arts for me when I see someone his technique is that sharp, that's what I want to tell people this is why I get frustrated when I see people that are on their back and they're in the open garden art their legs are just kind of sitting there flailing away and the guys got his arms on the ground of my Jesus Christ he's giving it to him he's he's setting himself up and don't know what to do</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> really want to just slap hands punch Knuckles and start rolling it's fun it's fun it's like a fun game you doing so good release yeah but the best way to get better at it is to constantly drill and then you develop these Pathways that are just ingrained in your subconscious and so when you're in that half guard position you immediately go for that underhook immediately you know the path you know where to go instead of add living and thinking while you're in the middle of a roll and when you see guys that come from camps were they drilled only do like one technique of the beginning of the class you'll notice a technical deficiency as opposed to like someone comes from Hixson school or someone who comes from a school is very technical or you know the Mendes brothers or something you know it's just it's so important to look at this look at the sport whether it's anime or kickboxing or to get to whatever it is but to look at it like a like a puzzle and have you trying to figure out what's the best way to solve this and you know what Dwayne for you it's been pretty remarkable as far as like giving you footwork skills and tools to move around and angles and I do not want you guys to drill and train together and really amazing stuff yes stuff that we think is simple and then we go and teach another gym and then there's likely why can you see that again oh right the footwork I've created Charlie's Angels with me and now he created a whole new style it's so funny that he saw that kind of while he was fighting and then after he was fighting is implementing a new Fighters and didn't do it himself and he laughed about it he he he wishes he probably had someone like himself coach cencal video of striking in MMA but I'm trying to convince him to come to Southern California start professional fight team so we can help me create what we do for everyone cuz I want to get on a move on here yeah he does but he also loves being the best coach in the world an instruction manual like the way he breaks down his system really remarkable even when he comes in here to talk to you hell of a system it is not what he wants to talk about what he wants to do like the guy doesn't stop thinking he is he's on top of the stuff he's in a good way good luck with that relax and chill and when I try to work on it now but when you're training and when you look there's a mindset this required to beat the best guys and it's not the same mind-set that's required to get good you can get good and be chilled out relaxed person let's say you want to be a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu that's totally possible I'm crazy you better be like Mike Tyson when he was young Beatles Michael Jordan's mother always thinking about it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> ESPN card because it's that was a historic moment much like like the Cain Velasquez vs Junior dos Santos which houses thought the same way and what's going on but your balance isn't there another girl man on top of course things are going to happen but with the ESPN is really cool the whole lead up to it they film the camera film at like they were around a lot a lot of exposure the stuff they put out was really cool and then just seeing like our commercial for a fight on National Football on ESPN or for the call it you know cuz College was going on and then you see the Nationals are going on you see me like three of them commercials on ESPN. That's pretty cool ESPN is embracing the sport and it's getting into it and now there's a lot of hype behind this and you know I got ESPN plus I was yeah I'm not a sports fan I don't watch sports I don't even know what's happening what are you doing for the Super Bowl the only thing that kind of bummed me out and I should probably would clarify this because I talked about this on the podcast was the Hardy fight and not not even because I don't think the guy should be fighting or not even because I think you know I don't I don't really know what he did in terms of his past I'd I know there's a lot of this lot s*** right I mean he was in trouble for something that was an appeal he got off of it somehow I don't know but I'm always got it from fighting perspective you're watching the highest-level fights you're watching the co-main event he's just not ready for a co-main event now like technically now no way he rushed out and gassed out burn himself out Crowder recovered and it just it's not the way it should be is you should have the early fights are people who are learning Sport and then when you get to the last couple of fights the co-main the man you're supposed to be seeing asssassins like you and Henry food that's what you're supposed to be seeing a lot of entertainment behind if you're hyped up you get pushed up the ladder maybe get title fight sooner than you shouldn't that's crazy it is typical Main Event 100% I was stunned that it wasn't they imagine they were on real there on ESPN now they want to kind of hyperplasia here because you know but there's another fight they could have put in place of that 100% And it is not a knock on crowder or hard either guys out there doing it. They're trying they did their job did their job their fighting the ending was super unfortunate again you don't know whether or not he did it on purpose you're getting punched in the face that stuff happened so fast chaos I mean specially cuz he is Avenue right us he hasn't been fighting for that dress like that stuff just happens like to get the the most eyes on it the people that are watching it if you watch something where there's two guys really aren't ready for co-main event you're seeing sloppiness and guys getting out of gas real quick and you see in all the things you're supposed to learn early in your career so that by the time you go to a co-main event you know you're a f****** ass ass and your ear lockdown and a hundred percent professional you are real elite pro fighter that's what I want to see when I'm watching ESPN that's what I want to see I want to see the best of the best Odyssey world class Fighters fighting with precision and power and speed and knowing how to Pace themselves guys with experience they been there before they know how to recover from think they get cracked they know how to lay back to know what a hold on they know how to do what they need to do in order to win or fight their best instead of like just like you seen thing and it's so many people are seeing this at this point and I feel like we're getting fans are more knowledgeable like yourself and in and people are just like you seen thing and it's so many people are seeing this at this point and I feel like we're getting fans on their more knowledgeable like yourself and in and people are seeing this born understanding technique now tour before maybe didn't matter what bad technique is now he knows where they are going to start realizing like what was that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> TJ yo brother I'm doing good man what is it like now what is this what it but first of all what was it like that night if her people don't know let me just give you the rundown just so you don't have to say it cuz you were involved in one of those high-profile flyweight fights ever be the bantamweight champion drop down the flyweight he went through this extensive training routine to get your body down to a manageable way we can cut the last 10 pounds or so make 125 the flight starts so who do Lands a good shot early there's a lot of lot of action and the referee stops to fight and I was I was shook by at everybody that I was watching the fight with his like what the f*** did and almost Universal like no one thought was a good stop no one goes it's been rough man it's a rough one that won't run to swallow on on multiple reasons you know Elena is a good shot that everything's being overshadowed by this shot that landed behind my ear you know I was over balance at the right-hand I came a little too aggressive that's the way I fight right push me over I was off-balance do a Kik I blocked it and went to throw right-handed credit dip out of the way and is one of those shots to hit you in the head like right behind the ear is an unfortunate situation one of those punches guy takes her feet up from underneath you your hundred percent there but your equilibrium is off you know when he jumps on me I remember hearing the rest a deal show me something until I'm good and I'm never talking to him before the fight in the back of his head like if I'm telling you that make sure you talk to me give me show me something you know that how you talkin give me a thumbs-up or something if you want to choke this or that you know so to be honest I think he was I didn't I didn't know who wasn't he's really an experience watching him laugh as well do jumping around as soon as the commotion and it happened he was looking for a reason to stop you almost but you know I can't does the shot that hit me behind the head and then I'll be to the controversial stop it show it's it's a rough one to swallow you know it's it's definitely been bugging me but I'm good about keep my mind off of things and staying busy and we're back in the gym doing business things and trying to stay as busy as possible so I don't think about it and want to punch a hole through wall every time I walk by one what such a different fight because it was such an arduous task for you to get down fly way too many people look you look great right now your face is full you like but God damn dude I saw you the week of the fight on television yeah and I was like look at its face look like a tweaker yeah yeah you look like you were an ultramarathon Runner after my fights we call myself at Tyler because that's why my real name is Tyler and I go by TJ and Justin buckles gave me that name back at half a mil like at Tyler and eating and being an a****** everything you're going to see it come out of your face and it because I was doing for so long. What was it like being that low as far as your body fat goes what would your performance like physically what how do you feel I actually so I thought the best I've ever felt before I walked out before the fight and that's another reason why I'm just so bitter about this thing is because I didn't get a chance to show the work that I put in I didn't get a chance to show all the science behind Sam calavitta and what he did to my body I was Stronger for this fight then Cody fight I walked out to pounds heavier for this by then I get my last Cody fight what did you walk out tonight before I start warming up a way to 149 and I feel great I feel bloated and for nothing to 149 I couldn't get tired before the 5 in the back I seriously like I've never felt better than this before fight like my mood my energy levels like me hitting message way in the back warming up I was feeling smooth gamer even walking out in the cage and everything felt too good on Wednesday I mean we're looking for doing smile and then I felt awesome and even more of an unfortunate situation I didn't get to really show that inner well I mean hats off to Henry cuz yeah I mean he he did catch you and he is one of the best and help me he's that kind of caliber of athlete is what made this fight so special you being bantamweight champion going down a flyweight you and I think the way did it is probably the only way to really do and I don't usually yeah I mean yeah I mean I guess you were safe because you were only you were like what 1:35 ish the day before I made wait the night before the fight why are we are not the night before weigh-ins so I went to sleep 1.3 pounds over and I floated back she took a shet the morning way in which is insane that never happens and my body was still working I wanted to make the wait night before cuz obviously I hadn't made 125 psi I have to wake up in the morning and see my body was going to do if he's going to give me that extra water, but I made I mean wait super easy man like you don't even wrong the 12 weeks was a motherfuker it was hard it was a lot of work but though the actual weight cut was easy I know hiccups nothing like sandwich told me what to go to bed at he knew what I was going to wake up at he tells me the water loading I'm doing the model X lights and taken in the amount of food I'm eating and so he knows exactly my buddies and wake up and do he's been tracking it for not two years now that guy sounds brilliant I really need to talk to him I'm loved watched videos of him talking about it and seen the work and just what a what a unique individual he is I mean that's why I decided to move back down to Southern California yeah I mean on with my life is wonderful now that people got around me I'm lucky that I have Duane Ludwig just want to try about travel out and train with me out there but I've moved on to Southern California cuz it's an kalavida and I came down to two weeks with him and started noticing like pandas yeah I didn't realize what uniquely know either a lot of people out there who know their s*** but he seems like he's on some new level and he sent me grass that have on my phone if I like he would you like to every week we know exactly where my bodyweight wanted to be at Hughes tell me weights that I'd be at before I would even be there in my body would just do it you know Lockhart or something like that and Mike Dolce and then you would you would hide them almost specifically just for the weak-hearted some nutrition advice he's training you physically as well he told me Milo basic so my long-distance running when I or my fast as low Bassy. He does everything my strength conditioning my nutrition they make my meals that you all my meal prep he told me how much a little Basin you do per week I either morning or night you tell me when I should train it's a everything is complete I don't there's no guesswork in it there's nothing like he told me everything I listen to my heart rate when I'm sleeping the heart rate variability he's told me what supplements to take all of it you know like everything I search the Inn in in that's another reason why it's just so tough that this fighting it. Like really let me prove anything only for myself and who I am but the work that this guy put in you know like I'm going to sit here and brag about him and tell me how badass he is with them people want to tell me like oh you were malnourished you don't have a chin who's the backup for you they're giving him crap all over the place and I've almost filled just as bad for him as I do for myself from it to work you put into it he'll actually how great I felt before the fight I didn't get a chance to show it like I said I walked out 149 glycogen battery ready to go I really never felt better I know man is everything saying I really couldn't believe like how my body absorb everything you know so what do you walking around like now I'm in love with I'm in low 50s right now bus cuz I'm trying to be a little 50s and my body instantly wanted to just or everything and I got it for like 60s low 60s and I was like oh s*** tell is Rockman it was definitely a motherfuker it was I was pissed he ever wants to call me like a sore loser I've never said it wasn't a f****** hate losing more than anybody likes losing and I'll call you a liar you know I think you're 100% correct and Jamie and I have talked about this many times when we know we're talking about LeBron James or Michael Jordan those guys were infamous being terrible lose I hate losing yeah I mean I just don't think you get to be that Elite of the elite unless you're a f****** Maniac I really think that I'm at think about it constantly you know more of those CD guys it's I'm not in the gym I'm thinking about it I'm down on my training and soon as I need to distract myself and also I distract myself with other businesses or think they got going on because I think about it too much and so it's a controversial thing when people are questioning things and I hate losing so you're definitely I thought night was rough man I mean the ride back to the hotel and you know I didn't want to go out anymore they want to eat I just want to hang out my son you know like Ryan just get me away from fighting some you think about my family so we're at right now does a quick stoppage we got a couple nights ago so did I same thing everyone thinks it you know and Dana was saying like a man kid will figure out next couple days early stoppage I'm obviously pissed about it just know that nothing I want this to happen you know so my manager Tiki he's been in talks we haven't heard nothing yet on this isn't what's going to happen love Tiki he's the best good dude to Dad got such a great personality is just a fun guy to be around so he's been he's been awesome for my career I've only been with him for a short while time but he's been awesome for me but he's been in talks with Hunter and Dana and so I'm hoping to figure out something soon cuz I'm I'll fight tomorrow you know like I'll fight him yet whatever way he wants I wish you would prefer 25 because I put in a lot of work I want to show that I know what I'm doing and it wasn't a fluke fluke that this wasn't something but here's the deal even if the fight went longer and he stopped you and you legitimately stop yet he's Henry so who died that's a possibility this is the game versus this is what it is that's why we met so great she's a bad motherfuker and so are you which is why that fight was so interesting he had some s*** to prove he was there that day the flyweight division he did it know what I mean until I had the balls enough to drop down 25 there really wasn't any hype on a flyweight fight then there was another still is anyone ever say that he wants to go outside in the flyweight division then let's do it watching he wants to go up how to really change the game in so many ways. But I mean one of the ways he changed the game was calling himself champ champ now everybody is Cham Cham Cham Cham it is really big deal you know the term champ champ pause the game in so many ways. But I mean one of the ways you change the gate was calling himself champ champ now everybody is Champ champ champ I mean it is really big deal champ champ</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> over regular beef I know there is a benefit but I don't I don't I never can recall correctly it's something to do with the most essential fatty acid ratios yeah cuz green you're going to you're going to have more the omega-6 fatty acids which have been unfairly vilified meaning that a lot of people are just like don't need any omega-6 is don't have any arachidonic acid like don't don't overdo your seeds or nuts or Nut Butter kind of like the orthorexic help world as a whole you know like when you read nutrition and stuff they're like two-year-old Mega threes but be careful Americans have a twenty-to-one omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio but the problem is that Mega sixes that's a lot of those are derived from work called parent essential oils and your cell membranes need a certain amount of omega-6 fatty acids from seeds and nuts and plants and even to a certain extent grains and when you have an excess of a mega threes and not enough omega-6 is cuz you're going so far into the fish category then actually damage is a component of your mitochondrial membrane called cardio life in Nephi make less of that interfere with normal cellular activity what seeds are most beneficial peanuts they're more of a legume than a not a lot of my nuts at Aurora lightly roasted you always look at the label to make sure they didn't put a lot of vegetable oil and canola oil in a little I'm a fan of nuts and in my right my nuts like you. You're nuts if you were going to have to show him right like if you've ever had to Shell walnuts you're not going to eat 30 walnuts cuz I'll be exhausting right too many of them I buy them shelled and ivete fistfuls of them here last night I ate half a bag of pistachios are great for your microbiome to yeah actually had a couple of research studies on that last year that showed it an improvement in the diversity of the bacteria in your gut with pistachios and I just wanted nuts is good for you by product has the fiber content in pistachios but grass-fed vs. grain-fed is primarily the omega-3 fatty acids actually inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids there's probably part of it being that grass-fed grass-finished beef is generally raising Farms using less herbicides less pesticides raising their meat in the more sustainable fashion you know giving it less hormones given less antibiotics that's painting with a broad brush generally grass-fed there's more to it than just the fatty acid composition is just a better meet over all my wealth better health-wise grain-fed beef I will not lie like you can you can pretty damn tasty fatty cut of grain-fed beef fillet certainly time but I honestly prefer the the taste of grass-fed I like the denser meet the dark or meet I like it better just to me it just it just tastes healthier I just might I crave it more you know and when I go back and forth between the two of them when I eat grain-fed it's it feels like like a lazy cow like it's Ya Sushi it's good delicious don't get me wrong but there's a difference of funny cuz I've gone over to Dubai a few Fitness conferences over there and they advertise grain-fed like they want everybody like when you go to dresses like this beef is the finest grain-fed beef Walking Dead are you why did you not like it. Brooklyn waiters going to take me out but then like it didn't like it just something about like to meet just tasted it tasted like it was dressing vegetable oil like something about us didn't taste right maybe I had a poor Peter lugers experience I did not enjoy it that much</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> ring I do my sleep Squad I slept 8 and 1/2 hours last night and I take a hundred mg of CBD I take a little bit of melatonin and I'm just out but yet take a lot of it you wake up kind of groggy when you do but if you're used to that and you know like you get up Shake It Off 2 minutes later you're good to go what's the Rodney is coming over stimulation of the super relax I want to be when I sleep quite beneficial or No Sol CBD can enhancer deep sleep cycles alright which is which is when a good majority of your neuronal repair and Recovery occurs THC allows you to sleep and it actually decreases sleep latency how long it takes you to fall asleep but it does reduce the amount of time you spend in deep sleep right so if you're if you're one of those people whose mind races hyper-charged up when it and then you got to get to sleep at night used THC light like you know hit a vape pen or whatever but know that you might miss out on some of the things you want during deep sleep memory consolidation neuronal repair and Recovery you nervous system repair but it's still pretty decent sleep and you're not getting as much of a reduction in deep Sleep as you would get if you were to be taking like ambien or valium or something that's literally just like a sledgehammer for your frontal cortex that knocks you out of you no deep sleep so if you do that's really like a sleep tracker and test your deep sleep levels you would find that with CBD you don't fall asleep as fast but you get higher deep sleep levels and it will THC you can fall asleep faster but your deep sleep isn't quite as high when you consider that CBD can counteract light effects of THC then that means that what you could try is take THC to lie to fall asleep faster but then pile whole bunch of CBD on top of that and I've done that before take a hit on a vape pen and then take a bunch of CBD and shoot for The Best of Both Worlds you have folks that are taking Ambien I mean that is I mean especially people are doing it virtually every night. Has got to have a profound effect on your brain's ability to recover I think there are a lot of people shooting themselves on the life we're taking ambien or Valium I mean I think to start with sleep you need to realign your body's own internal chemistry and that would be breathwork like I think everybody before they start whatever phosphatidylserine and adaptogenic herbs and all that s*** for cortisol and before they start taking valium or Ambien everything else for for sleep you should learn how to control your physiology with your breath I think that's the most powerful way to do it Pronto your shock or whatever you want to call it like being able to do things like breathwork box breathing alternate nostril breathing even even holotropic breathing like you can go some very interesting places and terms of DMT and by the pineal gland by just doing holotropic breathwork like there's there's a lot of very interesting things you can do with your breath but I think that forgetting to sleep or for decreasing stress you start with the breath and then you start introducing these other molecules but Ambien Valium like in the air of like readily available CBD and all the other sleep compound that we have available like Valerian and passionflower and chamomile and you know all of those are what are called gamma-aminobutyric acid Gaba precursor Hibbett or neurotransmitters I don't understand why people are still taking Ambien and Valium cuz they're idiots this is addicted to it or they just want a pill then that's essentially what it is they want concentrating on breathing in and breathing out concentrating on just the breath itself like really being cognizant of it and slow deliberate brass in and out and in and out by doing that over long periods of time I found that I can I can pretty much count myself out you can but that takes focus a lot of people are not willing to learn how to do that because they want the fast-track out not the sort of thinking is it's reinforced yeah SIM cards in fact you know needs all these ads and all these doctors and different people well if he have a hard time sleeping I'll just write a prescription for parasites in dogs eat grass when stomach issues and I guess Birds now cigarettes in their nest cuz there's some kind of benefit to that and you see animals self-medicating you see our ancestors using everything from me and cannabis to Ceylon cinnamon to the all sorts of different derivatives for thousands of years so it's not like supplementation or self-medication or the or the whole creation of pharmaceuticals is something that's unnatural or not acceptable human activity but once you start used as a crutch I think that's where you run into issues like once once you denied body's ability to be able to heal itself or to be able to decrease stress on its own you begin to rely on these exogenous chemicals I think that's where you start playing with fire I just wonder what's happening to people's minds over the long term use of this stuff where you're not going into these deep sleep cycles and you're using and every night cuz essentially once you get hooked on it a lot of people have a really hard time sleeping without it yeah yeah like that that's where a lot of that type of stuff happens it means the same thing with with what's it called glymphatic drainage like this this new drainage system for the brain that they've just discovered in recent years this idea that you actually detoxify the brain during the sleep cycles and it's even enhance when you sleep on your side then looked as sleeping positions in this thing called lymphatic drainage and when you're not going through proper sleep cycles or your cots waking cuz you're on your back and you have a lot of people have sleep apnea or you'll look at their sleep charts in the frequently wake during the night or that you'll see. Where they just get ripped out of deep sleep that you wake up and you don't have memory consolidation or you don't have the type of neuronal repair recovery that you'd want or you know you didn't you came ashore yourself on muscle repair and there's there's probably a lot that we don't know about just dreaming and its ability to be able to do things like help for memory or make you learning or experiences more deeply rooted but yeah I mean it's it's it's I think sleep architecture is something that just gets super f***** up in a modern post-industrial era we've got access to Pharmaceuticals it just take a sledgehammer to our heads no question about it and it's also there's been a lot of work done on actually going to sleep with a problem this whole idea of sleep on it like there's a there's actually something real to that there aren't some cognitive balancing that's going on while you're sleeping with your mind is actually going over whatever issues you might have been trying to come up with a problem during sleep time during your subconscious you don't want to know how many times now and I'm home learning this as I get older that you delay a decision or you delay reply to an email or delay responding to a text message or what-have-you until you got a full night of sleep on it and the clarity that you get after that I may just basically a thing a little bit before you fall asleep and then you go to sleep and you wake up with such a better answer it seems like walk on it is another thing we know u e make more nerve growth factor and more brain derived neurotrophic Factor when you walk while you're learning I recently gave a tedx talk and I just made the whole tedx talk and I learned the whole thing while I was walking up on the Farm Road back behind my house and just walk up to the forest pop out in the sunshine walk up and down that road and just listen to my Ted Talk on my earbud and get my talk. It's amazing for the brain but yeah I agree dwelling on something before you go to sleep it does the trick if I do that I always have a response the next day that the Kinder less emotional more understanding friendlier reciprocating Good Vibes it's a really interesting how there is some sort of wisdom that's a par friendlier reciprocating any any sort of Good Vibes it's it's it's really interesting it's really a really interesting how there is some sort of wisdom that supported on you while you're sleeping there is and in now what I do is I'll think about what it is but I am a big fan of fiction before you fall asleep and just let you escape to a whole different world I took</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I with your hunt well I mean I'm going through the two elf that I've given away a lot of it to a shot last year every year I scheduled to Elk hunts and assume I'm going to strike out and the last two years I've been very lucky and I got to Elk each year so it's breaking the rules of the secret and Think and Grow Rich you now to Summa going to strike out but I assume hard thing to do to f****** people don't realize now they don't really look at it clap like those clips of me online in the Clippers like a minute long and it seems like I'll look how easy in 4 hours you don't see the hundreds of hours of shooting arrows the coaching from John Dudley all the reading archery articles and understanding what in keeping your mindset clear in the moment it's a lot of difficult to long-haul my boys have their first hunt in 3 months Mankind we been prepping for 7 months they're doing bow hunt in Kona real Hitta My wife she's not there sheet how old were they don't have to pay the 10 so you know ignite they're shooting at about 25 yards just shooting at about 40 yards and I'm leaving in about 45 now don't be enough pulling so I still got a couple more months of training to its really get dialed in but yeah it's it's difficult I still haven't even gotten my bow hunting you know how I spent my last time I spent six days up in the Colorado mountain range in the the they call the Santa de Cristo range you know in and on the last day I finally came in on elk and it was dark and I shot and I missed and that was after 7 days of trying and you walk out or after I was shot your horse out completely empty and it's about 45 yards but you know and you know how it goes you're shaking until dark and anyways though so I'm going to do Kona like that when you your hundred for 6 days and you just check into the woods 20 miles a day and you're exhausted and you finally get that one moment there's so much weight on that moment that it's so difficult to stay focused entirely on the task of executing the shot perfectly and there's methods there's a guy named Joel Turner who has he's got a website called Iron Mine hunting instructor First Responders and snipers and things along those lines ironmind ironmind where she lip-syncs the Pacific Northwest guy and he's helped me tremendously his his methods it's all about keeping a the difference between open-loop system and a closed loop system be able to control it and stop it and stop the process anytime you want and keeping yourself in that versus like a baseball bat swing which is going to start swinging you swinging and the idea to maintain the present NT to have a mantra and he gives you a mantra to chant and to think about it in terms of controlling all those moving so you are in control of your well you develop your own but the idea is to talk yourself through it don't let your excitable mine takeover back and I Ice Age like I go through all the steps in my head that I'm supposed to do I actually modified his and it went to John Dudley's so his he has his own one which is a drawback a name get it done watching to keep it in the other wide is just keeping those things in your head so you have one thing but what would Dudley I go through all the different things that he says like a drawback to no Center the Mead Center the bubble pool to the shot pull pull pull at the shop break in so I go through all those things in my mind but that the whole idea is to not allow the Freak Out the target panic and when you have that itchy trigger finger with the finger trigger where to surprise shop surprise. You're just concentrating entirely on the area that you want to hit on the elk your form is perfect everything's a line in order and if it's not you let down if it's not you let down and try to get your s*** together she was trained to hunt competitions helped me out quite a bit 3D shoot but they do have part of it as like that like an obstacle course race with you give it to adjust a 3D shooting light like a like a 40 Target 3D shoot where one shot might be on facing you but the target behind me and you got a 10-second time span to draw turn and shoot or you got to take a shot seeded through the trees at 40 yards and then within 20 seconds do a shot at 60 yards beverages do that that you should always execute the shot correctly even he doesn't even like this f****** game this thing this technohunt that we we've done he doesn't like that he thinks it doesn't causes Target Panic cuz you only have a brief window you like go he's like he believes that you should concentrate entirely on the correct fundamentals and execution of archery and then with time and understanding of the situation the experience of hunting itself then when those moments present themselves with time and understanding of the situation the experience of hunting itself then when those moments present themselves you're going to execute correctly whereas when you have is like 10 seconds going to turn and behind your back ready to go feel like you are emphasizing all the wrong things that you could do when your hunting</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Indiana Mint MMA much legal now they don't in season out of season gets fine they just they were they lowered the acceptable level or that they raised it rather like what you could have any blood she would basically just can't be high the day of the fight yeah yeah and that's another interesting one I mean that acts especially THC acts on a lot of these mtor Pathways the same things a lot easier anti-aging compounds right like lesser extent axon that mtor pathway and inhibited my but again it's it's short-term with something like marijuana and you also get this pain killing of fact and there was I forget if this was a study or if it was if it was like anecdotal but it's almost like a higher thrill-seeking effects like the endocannabinoid system when stimulated shuts down some of your your your sense of fear when it comes to experiencing a new adventure so you actually do actually go Adventure seeking more and you'll get like Ultra Runners anybody who's competing in a a non complex activity in which they might have already developed the ability to be able to be in the zone right they put in their 10,000 hours of practice and they're able to just kind of check out and go into automatic mode when you combine that with the pain quelling effects of something like don't in most cases like a THC CBD combo is what a lot of Ultra Runners are using I'm not sure what what they use in in MMA right now but ultimately you get a good effect but but the loss of reaction time and the loss of the ability to be able to perform complex tasks which they proved in like flight simulation studies dictates that it's still not that great of a drug if you were going to be doing complex tasks acclimated to taking marijuana are they talking with people will they take of someone who's a sober person and introduce him to marijuana and this is overwhelming effect of it because one of the things that happens to people that aren't accustomed to THC is the Freak Out affect they're not comfortable with the experience after while the way it's described in again this is all anecdotal but by people that are accustomed to it they say you just get good at being high and see the reaction time thing I don't buy because a lot of Strikers part of the kickboxers they train what while they're on marijuana it's very common a lot of it I mean that want to study on reaction time was Don pilots and there's a there's a few more Blinky lights in the cockpit then than a mat so the month or more going on sure but that's the question is are they experienced owners or these people that are freaking out and maybe the reaction times are spacing out and I don't know what the f*** this experience is like and they're divided to have anxiety because you know there's a lot of really over Sensations that come with that marijuana High and a lot of them you know you called paranoia or oversensitivity and sometimes you get paralysis by analysis when you're under the influence those things where they cute versus chronic effects to personally my personal experience riding I like they'll use like a trace amount of THC can buy with CBD like a horde of 1/2 a 10 to 1 CBD THC ratio and I think you know what the farm bill and increasing legality I think this idea of developing Sports Performance supplements for athletes you know who aren't competing in sports that is banned are going to be staring the direction of like high-cbd and then somebody's other novel molecules Relic CBG or CBN CBG CBN are cannabinoids THC 8 is an anti-inflammatory that's totally different than THC 9 I mean lights from orally ingesting Anna from smoking a tornado they actually are not isolating these in Labs almost like a Gannett chemistry and you you can take hemp or marijuana and and you can actually isolate specific compounds and then combine them so you could take like you could take like CBG CBD combined with other terpenes from like whatever let's say lavender and Valerian and in chamomile and make like a like a distress relaxation type of compound or you could do like a like a THC butter THC 8 instead of a THC 9 and combine that with light cinnamon and peppermint maybe some caffeine or creatine or something like that to make like more of a pick-me-up type of compound but I think that's that's the way of the future when it comes to a lot of these these marijuana companies that are developing stuff for specific goals trying to CBD that use it for information especially athletes like it a little bit of THC they seem to think it's more effective you know there's some sort of combined effect of the THC with CBD yeah yeah they call that the the Entourage effect you know when you have all the different terpenes in the endocannabinoid Monday deals at least dozens I don't know about hundreds how many of them ended up with you if you look at a chart of the different endocannabinoids I've actually discovered here to just Google 113</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> for a long time because when you injected it gives you like this amazing tan and they called melanotan is stimulus your melon is that that lady that was turning black she believed that she was in the wrong skin so she was shooting something into her body and she got black like Congo black well I tried it out I tried it out for about a week you try to get black what the side effect of this is you get massive boners that last really annoyingly long time almost like a drug and I don't even know the mechanism of action like I don't know how it's even working basically what is that thing that she's doing with a syringe what the feels like a caulking gun like what is she doing and putting it in their ass it's not I don't but just Google how are women today how are Instagram models getting diaper but I'm curious cuz that's what it is it's what you're using their own I know that some people do that we should know that about cabs that way we can start an Instagram cash Channel again thank you by the way for hooking me up with Traeger coffee rub for I love you and you can just make that rubber stickers you want put that on the ribeye and I've almost switch completely from doing my my stove top sear followed by the quick Broil on either side to doing like a one and a half to two hours smoke in the Traeger that coffee rub on and then just finishing it on the grill the Traeger yeah I did a what it would you call it a prime rib you know EXO it's that you just basically ribeye roast yeah and I did one on the Traeger and I cooked it for like 4 hours at 220° holyshit smoked it more hours gas yes it had I use the Traders designer rib rub that temperature is a super smoke setting at 2:25 and Below okay at the super smoke button and it constantly infuses this pump of smoke look at it like it's like I've never tried super smoke at that high of a temperature vicious dude in the but the Traeger prime rib rub I know it has sugar in it stays too delicious to not but hollyoaks yet when it's in there for 3 and 1/2 hours and it has that crossed on it there was not a word about that long smoke if he tried a beer can chicken on that thing it all beer can chicken rub salt and black pepper work in about half of the beer can out you open up the beer can but then you poke a couple extra holes in the top so you more than I'm still inside the chicken gets even more moist but then when I figured out as if you'd like a little little scalpel exacto knife and he cut open the skin of the chicken around the outside a little bit and you stuff that with pads of butter and then you do you smoke or pads of butter inside the chicken that the skin gets crispy super crispy and so you did it's like think it's like an hour an hour and a half you cook that one and you can't you can't smoke that one very successful like you want to run the girl with the snow, but he can't Soopers but that beer can chicken that's freaking amazing whoever figured that out whatever drunk figure that out as a goddamn genius it works but I've wondered before if there are other things that will work even better then beer we got Jamie it says most cases what I'm finding is either Brazilian butt lift or just like a fat graft or fat injection but there have been cases where I'm seeing that they had to get an injection taken out within a week's because it was causing a problem so I can not that was just fat where you got the fat put into you have to get to take it back out yeah cuz they're going to they're dying to be great then you have this f****** war zone over the last few pox airstrip here's the thing what they're doing is not aesthetically pleasing because it violates our sensibilities cuz you look at the ass and you look at the legs and you go what's wrong here how did you get that ass with those leg they don't go together like if you look at like are crossfitters legs like one of them powerful gals and with a big butt but they also it fits like it's the ass it's the thought it's not entirely disproportion gas when the gas pumps out and it goes these little toothpick legs you like that's gross that's weird you know like what's going on that bull Instagram we may be evolving as a species to find these type of things more attractive though because that's all I do is social media to get a dopamine yet every time you click on the little blue notification button or look at it social media dopamine hat every time you click on the little blue notification button or look at a new photo so maybe we're just going to eventually develop a real appreciation for that type of symmetry will redefine all right no no</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you like science fiction Composites together but when they press that button to a certain distance I wasn't even agree with you the distance things that I wouldn't have the leverage of a long thing so why not make it really long cuz it wouldn't be difficult to swing around like you could stab someone with a lightsaber a mile away why make it so short you have to swing correctly in the engineering kind of thing with him has me crazy about Star Wars is not the lightsabers it's the lasers when they're shooting the gun so Mike why can I see that when I can't see bullets supposed to be way faster than a bullet every reason these lasers are so slow you could duck out of the way of them dead so dumb every single film does that Silent Night look s*** and I just sent you when you watch it the same way when you try and film astronauts and you and there in 0 J and there was move slowly Kubrick was a stickler for Science and for if he was apparently he would do complex mathematics and spare time but fascinating guy that must have been yeah grow old and then send him back to the Earth is a superbeing which is kind of a bad version of a French chateau it's it's it's a weird genre right because sometimes people get things right liked in HG Wells predict a significant amount of scientific inventions in the future a lot or not cuz I think it is you're right they said a form that you can let your imagination wondering address the issue that restriction I think did you like the Alien series I loved it original alien is probably one of the greatest horror science-fiction movies of all times one of my all-time favorite movies but I really like the newer ones as well like I like Prometheus and I really like Covenant that the last one with it cuz I thought the opening is brilliant just going to do it just lost his way and disappointment like the last thing you'd be in the air right I mean we have to be really we have to be really careful Tammany but be not to be contaminated right you know you know what are the odds that you would find a planet that is exactly like even if a plan was one and a half times the size of Earth it would have far more gravity and that's that's really common for a planet to be like just a little bit bigger and then we will be like f*** everywhere</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is this that the big debate right now how long should someone get suspended for and for how long you know how long afterwards should they be considered enhanced like they're giving people some pretty significant suspensions now for steroids like 2 years but you know this is Jon Jones case and I'm sure you're aware of anyone of us yet where he's testing positive for the metabolites for the long-term metabolites for very small dose he's never tested pause for short-term metabolites which testosterone what is the stuff / animal in essentially it's painted supplement and it's not it doesn't have any performance-enhancing benefit in terms of like the amount of the dosage that he's tested positive for but his lingering in his system because the protocols for the brother ability rather to detect these metabolites has increased rapidly over the last year we more sensitive to the point where you know they're detecting me to eat infinitesimally small levels of these metabolites and is also seem to be some sort of a pulsing effect where your body releases these infinitesimally small metabolites and then doesn't so you'll test negative and then next week we'll test positive but only for the long-term metabolites which is an indication there's no re administration of the performance-enhancing drug everybody's mad so many athletes are mad about it and from what you're saying and for this study that dr. Rhonda Patrick highlighted it's willingly taken something one of those like 170 / always a Doper type of things here is that situation is very tricky because she's so good and he's so dominant the people just assume that he's been doing something his whole career you know and when you catch him genetics the best of the guys were taking drugs that's a sport where at least in the time. Where he was competing everyone was doing something 100% they had to go meet all things like that it's not it's not it can't be there too strict that you saw his knocking on doors at 6 in the morning and seeing this cup and you you do hear about positive test but the amount of positive test versus the negative test is over way more guys are not doing something used to be the opposite used to be in the 90s everyone was doing something we were just talking about this in the fight Companion podcast that a big issue is grappling grappling competitions are overrun with steroid users because no one testing and these I mean it's the smell test is off the f****** charge you looking at these guys are just ridiculous just Apple Maps and their training Jiu-Jitsu all the time too so you would think it would be very hard for them to maintain muscle mass as well as beer I trained with her training with technique and drills and cardio and although very difficult to maintain my issue with and then trying to transition</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you didn't know no I like me but I didn't do the carnivore diet for a certain amount of time and test it thought about it too much of a foodie what I did was I tried to eat ribeye steaks every night for dinner so I did like a 33% carnivore diet but there was a study actually that came out it was just like two days ago on that tmao that is associated with got damaged when you're eating at a high Diet Rite when your body takes excess protein and it turns it into sugar right with theoretically the idea being that that might be present because your microbiome is in balance from a diet that's too heavy and meat is it or microfiber it's it's because your biome I thought it was just because of Google Genesis because you your body has nothing but meat your body turns it into glucose know that that would be something different that allowed that conversion to glucose is a different show the T Mao Mao is is that's going to be present if you aren't getting enough fiber or if you buy on is imbalanced but what this study a couple of days looked at with people who are eating like a fish and egg and plant Rich diet and they have high levels of tmao too but they weren't deleterious direction as objective because they had to fiber do you could do a carnivore diet if you were a few population like in Spain I forget the name of the sausage but they like eat the delete the ruminant like delete the intestine of the ruminant and get their grasses and their fibers and their plant literally by eating the stomach of the animal like a cat it's the same issue with like you know messiaen eating too much of the amino acid Messiah needing from just eating red meat would be deleterious but if you're getting Glycine and some of these other amino acids if you're reading like nose-to-tail Oregon medium head cheese braunschweiger just like all these different mixes of meats I think that would be the way to do a carnivore diet yeah that's a lot of people that are proponents of that as well and then there's a bunch of people that there's a disparity between the anecdotal accounts of health and well-being and then blood work is not impressive the people on the car down there testosterone up I haven't seen anything worth it looking really good high blood glucose is another thing that you see I should say that there haven't been a lot of tests done it snowing a lot of people are publishing stuff on it but the anecdotal evidence is amazing it so it gets really weird like my friend Jordan Peterson he's had a tremendous success with it yeah lost a lot of body weight he says he's in his intellectual Prime he said he's never felt better in terms of his energy levels and that guy is he is so rigid when will it always eating is meat with salt on it and drinks water in that is silly it well if you think about it it's an Elimination Diet just like an autoimmune diet or you can say Wyatt and you know I don't know what's giving me trouble soy or wheat or dairy or what-have-you so I'm just going to stop eating all that stuff and switch to primarily meet problem is that it's I want to call anybody out and then call them lazy but it's almost like kind of a very easy lazy ask approach because rather than figuring out how to do it you know like that that sourdough bread it's slow fermented the Rye in the wheat are in there but all the phytic acid that would normally inhibit your ability to absorb minerals is predigested by the lactobacillus and all the bacteria in the wheat so you've got a bread that slower in a glycemic index and it's it's more easily digested with some guy and health right and you put the because it lowers the glycemic index and then you've got the what's it called the I forget the term it's like a glutton digesting enzyme that gets activated with the lactobacillus so that's a smart bread and takes for 10 24 hours to it's not 24 hours but it's like 15 minutes over 24 hours that it takes to make it that's an intelligent approach to food preparation right that's the way that our ancestors were many of the blue zones would have tree boots fermenting soaking sprouting slow food and you can take a lot of these things that would result in your you're talking about Jordan Peterson and his daughter does this as well Makayla Peterson they use that Elimination Diet in which is a carnivore diet to clear up a lot of those autoimmune issues but you could also just render food more digestible or switch to an elimination diet or an autoimmune diet for 8 weeks or 12 weeks something like the carnivore diet heal the gut in turn back to him or all-inclusive eating pattern that allows you to eat dairy wheat plants Etc all these things you would normally damage the gut if the gut is actually leaky so what is it like what what's the process like what is happening when they go on this very strict Elimination Diet they're just eating meat like what is happening to their gut that allows him to have all these pretty pretty significant health benefits a lot of loss of weight increase of energy autoimmune issues like Jordan had some some pretty significant gum issues those all went away depression that went away some of the some of the gum in the joint stuff might be just as much related to the fact that he's getting a s*** ton of collagen fibers or not fiber but alas 10 and muscle fiber precursors is getting a lot of protein I don't know if he's eating bone broth and bone marrow but maybe a lot of glycine so part of it be more fuel on board to repair muscles more to repair the joints but then the other part of it is that when you eliminate inflammatory products that you're consuming like let's say you're eating whatever and I wonder bread and Commercial dairy or or unfermented soy or any of these things I can actually damage the lining of the gut you're creating an inflammatory scenario and I know you're you're familiar with the gut-brain axis and how are our gut interact with our nervous system via the vagus nerve and when you have inflammation in the gut that affects neural stem it affects sleep affects intellectual performance and then you've also got the autoimmune component if you're actually truly allergic to or intolerant to some of those proteins that wind up in the bloodstream in the presence of a leaky got a new plant proteins lectins are another one that a lot of people complain about then you create almost like a full body damage scenario so the idea is you get rid of all that stuff you introduced the carnivore diet and I don't know if there's a lot of components of the carnivore diet actually healing the gut as much as it's the absence or elimination of the foods that were harming it the Bell Brothers Chris and Mark you know I was going to ask their take on it is basically they've never felt better and you know these are guys that workout very heavily the difference between them and Jordan is probably that especially you know Mark is a gorilla or what their take on it is essentially at least the way they think is that most people that are talking about diet they really don't know what the f*** they're talkin about even though you might be able to look at it on paper and you might have these ideas about what's beneficial or non beneficial some people are proponents of vegan diet some people gonna to you know paleo he's like until you are actually physically doing something until you are actually doing something with that died and then you report how much better you feel the people that are actually training really hard those are the ones you should rely on he saying for him personally never felt better never been leaner yeah in a big part of it I mean that's just returns to diet personalization and customization Bowl you know we live in an era where you can self quantify pretty easily with genetics and you can find out what ancestor you came from what blood markers that you have what your gut microbiome looks like and I think we talked about this unless show but there's a side of eating according to your ancestry and the concept of water called Cole like areas around the world where people have a genetic susceptibility to have certain diseases that they don't actually develop those diseases don't actually manifest because of their traditional diet like you look like the Icelandic population that carries the genes that would render them more susceptible to something like depression or seasonal affective disorder but their diet is very rich in omega-3 fatty acids and DHA which we know can protect against those disorders soon and you take to die population in you uproot them and put them in the context of a westernized diet and all the sudden depression and sadd manifests Cameroon Cameroon Africa higher than normal risk for colon cancer but they're eating a diet high in fiber why is it higher than normal risk the idea is that that population probably figured out at some point in human history that if they eat a lot of plants where they eat a lot of fiber all the Sun people don't have as many issues with their: right and then you take that same population again strip out the fiber put them on westernize diet and you get a large portion of the African American population developing colon cancer crazy about the seasonal affective disorder and you got to wonder how would that affect people that live in Seattle the Pacific Northwest or dealing with constant rain I wonder if that would have some sort of an impact on them probably even more if you come from that population I mean I'm going to Spokane side but I'm out in the middle of the forest I'm out in the middle of the forest I get sun from maybe 10 to 2 and I'm on a north-facing slope and I work indoors lot of the time you know I'm typing on my computer blocking and then so I don't get a lot of sun exposure but that's where it you know all these newfangled light panels and headboard light devices and things come in that were actually developed for seasonal affective disorder that actually work pretty well just to keep your mood up if you're working and or you don't get sunlight exposure</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> think is going to come out of that in terms of like real world application for an adult mean what people don't know what Chris Perez please explain it in layman's terms yes a crisper is in my apartment probably so I know it pretty well it's bacteria have an immune system that cuts Invaders of the DNA and what we've done now that's fine just leave now utilize that system take it out and I can we use it to create designer mutations design a gene changes in animals and also in humans so it's a bacterial immune system that correct genes and weasel time now it's some it's it's actually what's interesting about you being able to be taking too many years but this is dial-up a gene mutation you can choose exactly where you want to make it and so I think many villages will know that recently lost your Chinese research field came out and said he's engineered a couple of twin girls with crispr to be resistant to HIV AIDS virus if they're telling you that you got to think that doing some stuff and not telling you about right well you have some kids with giant heads and it's coming y'all's lines and something's going on if you can say what are you doing nothing just eating healthy looking good take care bye and I'm going to tell you yeah yeah so the chance of getting HIV in China is 1080p thought he was ethical to taking the babies from something that's really rare whereas if you really want to do something helpful to those kids and we agreed it was it was something you should do why not make them resistant to heart disease cancer we can do that it was weird that he chose HIV is the first test why do you think they did that it was a very well understood mutation that would if you just destroyed the gene that would work well as with these other disease you have to be much more precise the reason that we signed just got really upset was that he did it in secrecy and then just launched it on the world and that kind of thing because there is a fine line in ethics you want to be doing that with transparency running I think he was hoping to become win a Nobel Prize or be a star and it backfired on him because he just did it in secrecy it backfired in the scientific community's absolutely in a in a real-world and immediate I was shocked how little discussion that was if this news came out in the 2000s but it wasn't what's next on Twitter the new cycle so insane I do when you have a scientific experiment of that nature what's the standard protocol for a scientist whether it is is it the same in China and then Russia and the United States as a scientific Community almost operate under different like a different set of rules and anything else you mean between countries yes I mean you know like Technologies not shared like it was in China is doing something technologically United States is day we have to speculate we have to figure it out but when it comes to medical science by is it the sort of an open book is everybody sharing information or at least alerting everyone to what they're working on or how I know you going with this late I think I do around the world about what's going on under the radar I never countries on North Carolina that are doing research on the radar are preventing people like myself from entering those buildings to have a look at what's going on I'm sure that what's going on in there is actually a little bit broader that we hear about but I don't know how long is it before I must say Russia but I said it in in countries where there are different standards what's stopping a mothers who wants to prevent a child from having heart disease which could kill their child 40% chance Progressive 1000 and eventually you could make a child that could live 200 years once we know how to do it that could be the future that someone is doing something that is beneficial in way but negative another way and if everyone doesn't get to examine the research it's very difficult like if we wanted in the United States want to do something similar to what they're doing over there we would want to have access to what they've learned right we would end so generally scientists share information. There are companies that are government-owned that are very secret and private organizations and that's where it's a little we can just get really upset when companies or organizations don't share information right and what's not really stated but it's my belief is that one of the reasons it was such a backlash against this designer baby experiment and it really wasn't experiment it's not just that it was potentially dangerous and you could end up with kids that have deformities but also measured manner under supervision they could be a backlash like it was against stem cell research and we don't want that again we want to be able to do this the right way this time right it's a particular if something goes wrong with those children type one person could ruin it for millions of terms of editing tools they've become more is surprisingly that bacteria that have the these system so we're getting new ones all the times on there more accurate could you don't want off Target affect you don't want to accidentally me type something that's required for head development until you at work I think in my department on 4th generation did you ever see the documentary Icarus Bryan Fogel documentary on the Russian doping program state-sponsored doping program in Sochi the Sochi Olympics and how they that this incredibly complicated system of stealing the urine and putting it through a hole in the wall and putting fake earring back through is really really amazing amazing amazing documentary but detail this incredibly complicated state-sponsored doping system I would imagine that would something like crispr or some various new forms of genetic editing that that's one of the things that they're going to be looking into that they're going to be looking into things that are going to enhance athletic performance yeah we might need to have it a DNA test to see if you put one of these viruses in your right why you V now you're running like a twenty-year-old right so that that's all possible to write reports for four governments and one of the things I predicted 15 for the next 15 years was crispr being used to engineer the human genome and make a baby I didn't realize it was going to happen within one year or a lot of these technologies that I'm trying to predict happened way faster than even I think it can happen do you think it's possibly happened in other circumstances that they're not going public it's always possible that maybe some human clones running around right now that we don't know about do you think so it's certainly doable scientifically there might be some Rogue nation is doing it by Barbra Streisand talks pretty easy to climb my face is red glowing eyes Yahweh to give designer Tommy Terry what was a friend of mine, supposed to Monta Stanford entertaining the idea of making dogs live longer genetically so why would you want your family member time to live I just think man this two-year-old one day is going to be in that same sort of situation where it isn't until we stray dogs my wife onto therapy dog okay that crazy b**** look at her two copies of one dog Jesus Christ that's so strange how much is get a new dog you f****** nut well do it 9 and he stole third Vine does he look different my wife says sorry these are anecdotes so it was just a therapy dog and he has to go to hospitals and nursing homes and if he has any men according to my wife econ be a therapy dog too excited as running around jumping around pets are shortly one of the companies that I'm working with treatments for pets yeah well you got a Thang hey man live 13 Years anyway you know we had and also we have a dog that has a defect in the five years so it's 3 now so that's the one you're experimenting on all of them but what's the downside what is the downside if your dog is got a kidney dfac that's only going to probably live to be nine name all the dogs going to live to be a thousand years old what was the comeback in the Lotus position meditating a hundred years from now what you do to start talking to you what do you do if you turn a dog into some new kind of thing that lives 30 or 40 years with detail people do you do if you turn a dog into some new kind of thing that lives 30 or 40 years what do you tell people I give your dog like right now you talking about on the podcast and a bunch of people probably going to remember but a lot of people for yet but it's like 15-20 years now your dog still chasing balls and</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> anything else is notable I can run you through it I'm on a Statin for them my grandmother at least according to her had a stroke in their thirties and then yeah it's bad so I'm fighting bad Eskenazi 2 Chainz here that's crazy are you should be told to me and I want to go on a Statin and this is in the days when statins going well studied and my doctor said but you're not old and I said I don't want to wait till I'm old and sick to get this medicine I need it now and I vote for the doctor and eventually he prescribed it and my cholesterol came down with dentist going to the dentist a few months ago and I said I want my teeth fixed my two front teeth normal fix my teeth get them back to how I was when I was 20 no we don't do that we don't do that when you take my daughter right last week yeah but she's young she's got a future the hell is wrong with you sending your food so I said to her I thought you were one of the world's best dentists and she said okay fine I'll do it but don't blame me if it don't work until she can work she was worried that it might snap off Tuesday would do that instead of replace the actual text to my daughter yeah and I said do that to me that looks great and she said no no no she said okay but it's your problem you got to pay for it fine and she did it and she actually said at the end of it is great I might offer this as a procedure to other patients I need before they get older yeah wacky I had a similar thing happened with a torn meniscus a minor meniscus tear and the guy told me well if you were young they would Stitch it up and hope that it would heal I'm like what the f*** does that mean I go everything works good like what is difference what is the difference between me and a young about it and he said something about blood flow you have more blood flow I said look I'm not a doctor but that doesn't make I go I'm working out all the time is a lot of blood going through there like what the f*** is happening and I'm like let's shoot some stem cells in there and see what's up cuz they wanted to do a meniscus you don't want to do what is a menace copy whatever it where they call it when they cut some of the meniscus out I'm like yeah let's just try totally working like I don't have any pain in right now so I think there's a weird thing that they do do when you get to I got my friend has a torn ACL and they essentially he's in his fifties like the late 50s and they sent it told not to fix it I go hey f***** get it fixed week crazy and have a wobbly knee and then like well he told me if I was young girl f*** that doctor go get that thing fixed the recovery time like shut up you just recover you just leave alive a year goes by its fixed just stop just go get it fixed we think the 50-year old is is okay though. Vs 50 is still very young actually there is 78 seven-year-old eight-year-old even though you'll still playing tennis yeah loving life that's that's just the beginning of what's coming if you maintain activity that seems to be the key that the really hard thing is when someone's in their fifties and they want to get in shape now and they haven't been active their whole life that seems like you're probably at their DVD is scratched up back it can be done I did see a guy who was 58 years old who started running marathons in 58 in his seventies is running sub 3 hour marathon and he looks great so it just he just had to take his time and really be dedicated and watch his diet nutrition and next thing you know this guy's an elite marathon runner it is doable what we find in the lab is if we trade miserly in life it gives them the battle much better life span of sure so do they believe it too late will you see that is athlete's like athletes that were fit when they were young and never lost it really maintained and stayed in the gym and stayed active you see them in their fifties and move in their sixties looking great whereas you know it's just once your body to deteriorate it's very difficult to bring it back but if you maintain it seems like there is people today that are doing that is much more common if you go to a gym for instance go to a nice gym you'll see a lot of folks that are in their sick 1077 really active in there all the time and the regulars at the gym and they look great they do so my father is a is a prime example of that so he's an Australian he's being taken care of his body since he was in his early forties probably a little too late but still he's being taken Smitha man is metformin for a while Resort wealth but he's been active that's the key I think and then but I combination so he's now just turning 80 this year you would think study if you if you didn't know his age and he's running around and my mother passed away from cancer so he's dating women he's out every night he's traveling the world now this is the future for four people in their 80s he start a new career at 80-76 what to do if they got bored 6740 had another 10 years of good life so we went back and he's working at Sydney University on the ethics panel for clinical trials and other studies and that's what you want older people with wisdom and knowledge to do to get back. Sounds good to like for you to get your dad hopped up on all these awesome new drugs then you get them working on the ethics panel for clinical studies and then you get them to give you some death row patients so you can try it on right that affect your on to me I know you doing now man you wiggling the system a little bit while you're in a family member active super healthy dad right well I don't recommend eating into my family but they end up demanding it my brother was pretty upset that we weren't giving him any what seems like it's working out really well for your metformin the and what else predisposed condition unit that's an awful condition man that that made me want to think that I was talk to my doctor about it he's saying that that there are people that just have high blood pressure or higher you know higher blood pressure or higher instances of heart disease and their family and it's just a really unfortunate genetic issue it is it is but fortunately we were able to tackle these days it is it is but fortunately we were able to tackle heart disease pretty well these days with blood pressure drugs and cholesterol drugs side effects no question but what about with these longevity drugs that are in development is that shouldn't be prescribed this medicine for Alzheimer's off your liver disease but as a side effect it'll keep the rest of your body healthy as well that you can cancer and only thing that's what's a radical about what we doing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what about the damaged eyes because I know a guy who's got significantly damaged eye from fighting what we talked a few things three things to the mice when is we pinch their optic nerve and crushed it which is a test for growing neurons in the eye and we find it without reprogramming we can make the nerves be just like a a noob maybe they grow back and then we also tested on glaucoma pressure in the eye with increased pressure in the mouse's I and they lose their largely the right side and we can recover that animals are tickled mice that don't see very well and we also seem to improve their eyesight almost back to normal so that what I think will be gone and nursing homes anytime soon. What we are doing is running clinical trial on this issues the plan is glaucoma first but it could work for other damage Witnesses while even broken spinal cords were thinking of trying wow and that's just one part of the body imagine what it could potentially do the rest of us do you feel incredibly fortunate to be living in this Century I do everyday but I would love to live Next Century cuz it's too mean stop right now or you're going to be one of the guys to get to see the stuff get implemented from your actual own research where it didn't exist before like living a hundred years now where you just take it for granted like a trust-fund kid you know yeah but it's amazing what you can do and you'll be here where but good chance you're going to be when you're the one who's going to know so he's My Philosophy I'm not going to let anyone try technology until I've tried it first really you're currently doing the christakis is book I'm sitting here reading this book if I don't have reading glasses on I got to do this a bit of a struggle going to be able to fix that no potentially in a week and you can't delete screen already used to treat genetic diseases in the eye and we inject it straight into the mouse's eyeball this sounds like the beginning of a horror movie yeah I think it's actually an awesome movie it's the awesome part that I'm well if you're going blind right one injection from your doctor and then you take an antibiotic to in the jeans on for as long as you need and get your eyesight back that's not her if we could all that's a pretty incredible how far away do you think you are doing at the humans 20 20 lb safety study we are the future is if this all goes well you have an injection in your vein let's say when you're 30 and then those viruses infect your body and I sit there dormant until you need them so when might you need them you might have a car accident turn them on and turn them on with Chester and antibiotic in a drip or an appeal or you start to lose your eyesight taking taking antibiotic so you put them in your body almost as an inch bossy and then you have the option to turn them on the future actually wow what we do in the mice now with every action we will assume there's some negative consequence or potentially negative consequence right. We always assume that it's not always right with the molecules that we've been testing for years now like Adam and we haven't seen any downside to longer endurance and protection so there is no way the Quints or potentially negative consequence right I will always assume that I don't but it's not always right with the molecules that we've been testing for years now like Adam and we haven't seen any downside to longer endurance and protection so there isn't always a downside to these things in fact you just think in a man is replacing a molecule that we lose over time as we get older it's just becoming a natural process no downside exercising</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> exactly so the stop it in its tracks before it gets systemic white spider stuff on a cruise line for for the virus norovirus even if it turns out to be that safe when I wipe down schools because I was worried about the the negative aspect like what's going to happen like what's what's going to be the blowback right like antibiotics is with created medicine resistant antibiotic staph infections right right right your mind always jump to the worst possible Lovett organisms virus do that quickly how do you do it if you don't know what you're looking for so we can take a drop of blood or swab off the table and we can see all the organisms that are there we can do your microbiome but that's easy we can do so drop of blood will tell you all the bacteria and viruses in there and it'll tell you how to kill it which is great for healthcare because by now microbiology Labs I working when I used to swab urine and poop on plate with recliners Battlefield on that is that's 19th century early 20th century technology grow on a plate wait a few days to see what grows but that's useless for disease like viruses and Lyme disease Lyme disease you know the one from texting you can you find my daughter got Lyme disease and she was really sick she's losing her eyesight it was serious according to a brain and the hospital wouldn't give her the antibiotic cuz I the tests weren't quick enough and they wouldn't give it antibiotic until cancel positive for insurance reasons and I could just give me the give me the DNA of my daughter up fluid I'll test it they wouldn't do that so I was curious so I ran Outta company out of my lab with some very smart buns magicians math magician software Engineers are we built supercomputers to be able to do this to end up with a guy in stand for my friend I mentioned him Carlos Bustamante he's the guy that he's eating trained on mommy's and he did Kennewick man so this technology can be teamed up with what I've done to be able to get rid of all the human DNA had a blood sample leave the viruses live bacteria and then run that through six supercomputer all the DNA and tell you within probably seconds eventually what it is so my daughter would would have a diagnosis within eventually just 10 minutes instead of waiting week wow find diseases terrifying there are so many people are infected with it and I know personally maybe 10 people that have it and a couple that I've had significant issues with it that have lasted for years I know a guy was hospitalized for a full year on it but it's really bad and it and it can hide as well as the problem yeah and it wrecked joints and a lot of countries actually deny that they have Lyme disease is right is a good example people getting feline disease no one knows if it is or not give out samples to us will tell you what's in there what seems to be very difficult with certain doctors for them to tell if they don't see that Bullseye infection exactly so she didn't have a bull's-eye bite and then there's a circle on the outside of it for whatever reason this occurs with Lyme disease but often times goes away quickly so if you bring a person in and they have the Lyme disease they don't have that Bullseye anymore which is what happened to my friend Steve son he tried to tell them that it was Lyme disease they the doctors were incredulous they didn't believe him till the kid had Bell's Palsy in his face exactly that's what happened in our family is crazy and so we're right behind inform a bull's-eye they got any given time but it definitely was very painful thing I could tell it was something going on it was really itchy and I went to the pharmacy and I said can I have the antibiotic you know it's probably cost a few dollars for the antibiotic and they said no we won't give it to you till we see a bullseye and you need to bring the ticket in while I can bring the tick with me so again I'm the doctors and nurses worst nightmare I wouldn't leave until they gave me the antibiotic and I'm glad because I don't want to wait a bit eventually I did I wasn't going to leave until I got it but I don't want to wait a week and I'm starting to lose my did you get upset with him so it wasn't you do motherfukers super smart or work with jeans started spouting biology so that they knew that right you something about it I was about 15 minutes to say mean we looked at a map recently on the podcast of Lyme disease infections across the east coast and the East Coast United States obviously that's where you live is just a hotbed it's crazy to everywhere will it isn't Friends on Cape Cod where it's really prevalent really bad so bad that so they keep the antibiotic in the kitchen drawer Jesus and if you catch a quick enough does it stop it in its tracks so the real problem is when it gets into your bloodstream and you don't treat it long enough or quick enough exactly and to my my daughter needed a PICC line which is delivered at the end of body oh it too long I want to kill them and she didn't have a ring of inflammation but you knew I didn't I thought it was meningitis bacteria in the brain of something holding a leukemia with the other possibility those dirty f****** bugs what can be done to somehow another eradicate those things again one of my friends got friends here crispr system to kill these and so there is possibly going to be the first test of releasing a modified organism the Lyme organism to kill him off wow and you know that's going to cost some new superbug that would be great I just I mean where did Lyme disease come from there was some conspiracy theory website that was thinking that Lyme disease was some sort of some sort of a biological weapon that's probably go check I'm sure but it came out it was in Lyme Connecticut right on the first cases biological weapon it's it's just an awful thing and now there's the I'm sure you're aware of the lone star tick that gives people that alpha-gal disease the one that makes you allergic to red meat just before it's crazy see these things morphing and they morphing and there alot of bugs we don't know somebody just published few days ago that they took them on the skin mouth across the planet different races different foods Geographic geography and they have a hundred thousand different organisms living on humanity and most of them are unknown that's crazy right and all they have to do is just more of a little bit one way or the other way and all the sudden people are dropping like flies and what's interesting is on the scan and in the gut of people in India is very different than what we have different smells yeah and what's interesting is on the skin and in the gut of people in India is very different than what we have different smells ammonia they probably think we smell that but I know this because the weather wrong yeah right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> anti-aging you certainly want people to live longer but you yourself are more concerned with your work then you are with your own personal life hundred percent my wife will tell you that the reason that I look off to myself as best I can when I caught the energy is it would be a bad look if I die from heart disease tomorrow yes the anti-aging guy other than a butt model for others but you know if I if I died tomorrow would be fine with me I'd like to finish my work at least I would like to leave something behind but what I don't want to do is to to be a burden on my kids and grandkids and so that's where the real final frontier of anti-aging is folks that are really really old because it seems like they would be open to try almost anything and if you could bring them back that would be Uber Bazaar right you think we are from doing something like that comes as a shock to people who don't work on this that we're already testing these molecules in clinical trials on elderly people been doing that for a number of years now with some positive results we were getting Ana man and another molecule called I might be 66 my laundry so that the company's gometro biotech and it makes super energy boosters and the drug is called developmental drug is MIB - 626 real effort for diseases FDA-approved and so they're using it right now on Old Folks testing it for safety but we're also going to be testing later energy we can measure actually the NAD levels at molecule mention but you measure that in their muscles and we'll test if that worked and we'll we'll measure across their insurance cuz if the mice that we traded with them and they just ran and ran and ran actually broke a little treadmill in my lap because I Ran So Far and you giving it to them orally or you're injecting into them so it's a little tablet I just put food and put it in their food or something like that have no idea which is which but we had mice running 3 km and then the machine stopped and I get a text from the the researcher hey the machine broke I said the check the software and turns out software was written to stop at 3, because my mouse at run that far before that's long and those old mice don't forget these are my state equivalent of 65 year old human really try it and see we figured out that that the lining of the blood vessels needs in a d as you get older they need it all the time but as you get older you don't have enough so the Enderman replenishes that allows the blood vessel lining to respond to exercise any control blood vessels if you don't exercise and so those mice they ran and ran around didn't get like they build up as much I just didn't feel tired so I didn't have lactic acid build-up right wow so muscle fatigue would be different I wouldn't seem to get that either why we even pissed off an artery and the body responded much better to restoring blood flow would be great for patients have a heart attack now with human beings what has been the most dramatic result early-stage we the molecule that seemed to effectively treat a disease called psoriasis which is the and that's a molecule its skin was pale actually how does that work what is it doing so it's an activator of one of these sirtuins that we found in yeast originally these are too and protective enzymes in the body and their anti-inflammatory and so it worked well against that disease so psoriasis has something to do with information is an inflammatory disorder you are all autoimmune disorders and employment best disorders I believe some really interesting cuz I have Vitiligo don't see them little spots on my skin where I don't have any pigment genetic my grandmother had at my grandmother's sister had it I wonder if that would help me really couldn't say was it called again which one the drug that was tested 2104 work on psoriasis study in New York know what other what other things had really dramatic results on humans while we not there yet we don't have dramatic results is there anything promising results on humans on elderly people don't have dramatic results and is there anything promising results on humans other than Eminem and yes there are out there until I mentioned earlier where the drug rapamycin which is too dangerous to try on normal people that drug has been tried on elderly people and it boosted their immune system in the same way that you see with calorie-restricted mice and so that that was an early signal that you might be able to reverse aspects of aging and the elderly with that truck</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> sometimes leading Labs is about 20-30 for the same field of study they're all working with the same molecules in the same parameters not everyone works with molecules but what I can tell you is we get together in conference about discovering Eugene that extends lifespan and a new molecule it's working in my store sometimes in humans well now it's growing when I started it with a backorder biology antioxidants Etc I was very lucky to start when it was really small and stick it out those fair amount of criticism in those days what how so it was like a lot of my friends my supervisor said I was insane that's not a thing that's not biology and scientist in the lab that I joined Lenny Crunchies lab to students adjust are working to figure out why yeast get old and I joined as the third senior person to join and all the other people in the in the lab door about 18 19 people they said you are not when he's lost his mind he's working on Aging that's not a thing you should be working on what we do which is understanding of genes are regulated by told my mom and I said I think I made a big mistake here I thought this was the thing the guy and everyone he says he's nuts me while you were right you got to take some risks in life that's one lesson yeah but that's an interesting one right because you were a young fellow he didn't really totally know it was pretty lucky cuz I'm in Australia right I don't know what people are saying about this lab should work there but always been fascinated with aging since I was 4 will now though with all the promising nudist resuming date they have to be eating crow as it were those people I go ahead f******* I was right you don't call him up in the middle of night drunk and I definitely forgive people too much and then had some pretty big animals along the way but I try to be nice is it because research and sort of scientific work so competitive yeah it is it is in his disbelief that someone successes or failures not really that. the case but show business to the weird sort of a mindset it's very limiting mindset right and also and this may be true in Hollywood in science if you come up with a new idea when you're young you're young thug and you're upsetting the status quo revolutions was just had it had it right you wrote in the 60s about chemistry and physics it will attack you and your chaos and you just have to get through it and fortunately breadcrumbs book and I knew that this was normal but a lot of people around me was saying owner of people saying wrong and it's controversially don't worry controversial I'm like controversies right let's do more of that and if it's not controversial I want to do it because the people who are the Old Guard or upset they didn't find it themselves or they upset that your new findings will make their work irrelevant yes it's probably better but mostly it's it's that they worried that their lives will be have been in vain if what is not true right yeah there's a visit amazing documentary on the Sphinx where these geologists are talking about some of the water erosion outside the area of the Sphinx and they're saying this points to the fact that construction was thousands of years older than they thought and you see this one egyptologist freaking out he's freaked out like what what happened to this culture you talking about like cuz apparently they would have predated the known dates 2500 BC would have it made it like seven thousand years older than that because it would have to be back when it was rainfall in the Nile Valley and you could see this guy's ego kicking him because he was a professor he'd been teaching egyptology and he was freaking out instead of examining this evidence like not like talking to this geologist who studies rocks and erosion is really steadfast is a Boston University geologist dr. Robert schoch and you know he's saying this is evidence of water erosion and he's like shelling it and even showed it to a bunch of other geologist they all agreed and this guy this egyptologist this documentaries freaking out like wow that's what happen when you think your whole life's work is horseshit yeah can be able to eat yet it's really coming but what I've noticed is it the really successful scientist some people in life brake change it doesn't mean that that guy is a loser it just means he was acting on incorrect information based on what they knew before I mean should embrace it and say look what we know certain things were build a 2500 BC like the Great Pyramid that's been pretty clearly established but it looks like there were some ancient structures that were there even before then let's would now we have new things to study they don't look at it that way though with with Biology almost back support the theory is that there's a textbook and that's the Bible what I try to teach my students is complete forget everything you just learnt and what's important to know is that most things we think we know we're not correct they going to change of a Time old dairy change Newton was wrong but he helped us get here expect that we only know no point or 1 to send them of what we need to figure out and a lot of what we can strong anyway so even if you have to pay to stay or expect that it will be overturned but you can at least show us the fact that you've helped us get to that point but without Newton we wouldn't have quantum physics well for someone like me hearing you say that it's very promising and it's it's it's very encouraging but I always thought that scientists were always going on just data like the all they cared about was Data all they care about is what is correct that was what was crucial that's what's important this is what they talked about this with his study when I found out that scientist would would ignore information or use their own personal biases against information or attack research because it somehow negates what they've done is very disheartening for someone is not a scientist you know the Eagles in signs to feel well we just got a gene control aging and molecules like Resveratrol could extend health and less when it was it was brutal I get up and get his patients want to say you are wrong size crap and where are they now do you call them up in the middle of night this to him up you don't have a glass of wine yeah yeah I was like shitt I can't walk anymore just have to outlive your enemies so easy way that must have been a tough time though for you as a young man and you know you're hearing this from these establish scientists and part of you must have been like the thinking like cheese are they right sure you have to entertain that that's what we do but you go back to where we had data interpreter probably shouldn't of journals and it was about how resourceful works on that sir to an enzyme that I mentioned and Pfizer came out with a paper that said it's all wrong and I had people call me up saying and it was nice knowing you I'm really sad for you but it's over ya bad that Sepulchre luck we had some data already from interesting and it took another thing for years to the bottom of it but it turns out in the end I was right but there were days when I said screw Humanity I couldn't be bothered getting out of bed if this is how I'm going to be traded for trying to devote my life to the betterment of people's lives it's tough finding anybody who's in a position in the career like that has to have gone through a really hard times it's just discouraging from a non scientist who relies on people like you for someone like me who relies on the folks like out there doing the hard work that you would face that sort of the best way to describe it would be ignorance it's okay to sign such a challenging Theory that's what I didn't know what everybody is trying to do but to do it in such a public end and vicious controversial it was vicious it was definitely vicious even the word that used for vicious which is really hurtful but but they're wrong m*********** yeah that's supposed to publish that paper I do think about needing that person again but it's not just that stuff you can run out of money people I mean and what was the high you were right when you got to push forward it says you got to get lean cuz you not going to get government funding for a while cuz people think that you are a failure God damn that's crazy. I would imagine around like was there a moment where it turned around and move toward yeah there was one day when it when it will change so that the earlier date early date it was that the enzyme we can meet title change the enzyme so that it wasn't going to be activated by Resort 12 and we found that mutation now that just technically don't take Link technically means that we could change the enzyme in a way it wouldn't work so we didn't put that non-working enzyme into a cell and now we have a mouse I work and give it Resort all and if it works it means I'm wrong if it doesn't work in blocked by that change in the enzyme will probably right and that's what we did but the real the real change was that there was a company that I started that was making drugs the one that killed or at least seem to control psoriasis and they had made these very synthetic molecules that we're not related to the plant molecule Resveratrol and I said to myself into the student was working on it if I braced you if if the change in that enzyme also blocks the drug then we're onto something because that means two separate groups working on separate types of molecules different people different system ol get blocked by this one little changing the enzyme then we're right and and so he walked over to the company. The molecule through it on the enzyme and it didn't work on the mutant and that was me rejoice in because I could say there was a universal activation mechanism on this one enzyme resourceful works the molecules that the company work and now there's an interesting thing that just came out from Spain that metformin the diabetes drug may actually work the same way as these other molecules by activating our favorite enzyme the sirtuin why and how how much time were you in the dark lands it was a couple years of hell right if it gets so bad because you've got this tight-knit group of scientists and have live meetings and you present your results and usually a very supportive trying to help I have one guy saying to my student David doesn't always talking about you shouldn't work on this it's been proven wrong he was dead Against Me In My Own live on paying his salary and it's okay to be constructive but within my own group now this other guy that used all these other vicious words about you where's he at now not sure I would know I would know no I don't have time to look back on your phone and nicer than me yet you know what in science cuz it's very collaborative and your your enemies are reviewing your own work if you build up too many enemies you want survive good but it still has got to be beautiful to come out on the other end and be proven correct and actually be at the Forefront of these emerging Technologies it is what I do is I pause and I remember how hard it was to get here and how fortunate I am to have made it this far and I'm working with hundreds of collaborators around the world to make this come through this idea that we can really treat aging and prevent deterioration so bless. I have an app on my phone that I've helped engineer what's up it's called Lula l u a what is that it's a little company that we bought in New York and nurses and dentist use it to pass medical information around but we use it to share information between scientists around the world and coordinate activities between companies you know I think I mentioned to you that I've started a few companies but I'm trying to build our companies that are the 21st century version of a company that is actually has a decent reputation in the world I think it's pharmaceutical companies without Reserve do not have a pretty bad rap I'm trying not to fall into that trap but I'm also trying to use 21st century technology to not become too bureaucratic as well within your organization that's what the luau app office us</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and I don't go through airport scanners as much as I can and have x-rays these little things do you think those are bad for you those the new ones aren't they like a radio wave but the old style ones that were banned in Europe I was going to ask and I said I don't wanna go through the skin on the got quite upset cuz it's a bother but they said you know it's just as much damage to your body as the flight and so I said why do I want to double it your DNA the code of Life the epigenome is what regulates and reads those jeans at the right time today and so if we knew about DNA we know how to read that you know I'm pretty easily we can do that now on a Mars bar sized device in a day the epigenome is quite a different thing that you know me and the closing agent is not that you're losing the DNA structure you know having mutations you actually changing the epigenome which is the the reader of jeans to put in all the way come back disc people outraged know that she tried to copy that a thousand times this how much left at the end so that the compact disc information is the gym the epigenome is the reader of the CD that little laser that goes around and what I think is causing aging is not the loss of the digital information but it's the Retard the analog pot and that's like a cassette tape it eventually runs out what we going on really is it yourselves a losing ability to read the right the way they did when you were 20 and that's basically noise informational noise that gathers overtime until we end up with when were 80 is a compact disc or dvd that's scratched so the reader cannot read the right jeans at right time and the cells become dysfunctional and what we working on it how you polish that CD on a DVD to get that information back again and you could do that I think that's really the best way to reset your age when posted yet. We're working on ways to actually reset that genome actually get back the information that we want headphone with 20 so what is happening to the epigenome when you going through those scanners well what we found is the biggest. Dorothy at the genome is it a broken chromosome DNA break and run about scanners that's just an abundance of caution but an x-ray will damage your DNA no question even going out in the sun and we think that the cell's reaction to that break having to unwrap the DNA from its chromatin we call it and then rewrap it is what eventually disrupts the ability to read watching it right place so any damage is essentially a little scratch on on the DVD and that accumulates overtime so being out in the sun does that but being out in the sun also is beneficial your body produces more vitamin D play preppy witches what's good for you when you're young comes back to bite you in your old so you might look good and feel good and get vitamin D when you young but the accumulation of these scratches on the epigenome and up formula and Australian originally in the stadium Now American and Australian grow up in the Sun and I can tell you that most Australians look older than they should O'Neil's on over Australia what's that all about what you do. What is the world to close well that's one of the first things I noticed when I went to Australia was there's all these son cancer warnings skin cancer warnings everywhere well if it was trying to get some form of skin cancer and you look old but if you have an x-ray you going to damage your organs you can accelerate aging I believe in your body and it happened you caught avoid double-strand breaks happens all the time the trillions of cells in the body in that happening all the time so is a problem flying flying is even worse but we working on his how do you get back that Regional information into the cell and make a cell not just believe it is 20 again but actually be 20 so what do you do when you reprogram them there was set of genes that we we and others have found three main ones that when you put them into a cell or evening to Emmaus they become younger again whoa how far do you think you are from implementing this on human beings will set their attic late you doing to yourself. You could do it to yourself theoretically I wouldn't do that cuz I'm not crazy we need to figure out safety I want to become a giant tumor his is what we doing I agree with you that we want to do want to see what happens if you give him a free pizza or something there on death row right if you're there already murderers do you want to be the first one to me and on my laptop throwing I want to know what I'm saying if you're going to kill somebody like wouldn't be a good idea to like oh hey will give you a four hours of TV a day so that we want to shoot you up with some stuff going to make you younger I'll just give him a free pizza or something there on death row right if you're there any murderers do you want to be the first one to me and one of my life death row in the death row but I'm saying if you're going to kill somebody like wouldn't be a good idea to like oh hey will give you a 4 hours of TV a day but we want to shoot you up with some stuff going to make you younger if I was on death row to go do it see what's up</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> look at the world but where are the people live in the longest NY well it's debatable there were these Blues on to think many feel the same as well I've heard about those, but there are Pockets that have great genes but they also have great diets and lifestyle so it is the island of Okinawa in Japan and by the way I used to follow the diet felt really great couldn't keep it up but those one can you keep it up I had kids and I'll meals turn into pizzas and yeah unfortunately but I'm getting back there now that my kids are teenagers but the Okinawan they live in 200 fairly frequently it's not one in a million it's a lot I have what green leafy vegetables and that seems to be the secret and there's a they were selling their mineral-rich diet they remember they were selling it was like a big thing for a while Coral Calcium and they were using that as an example of why the okinawans the living so long do you remember that kind of remember right yeah but yeah still got it better calcium from Coral or something a man might even be wrong about that but I just remember reading about the Okinawan sand that the speculation that they eat seaweed as well right that's a good job over the last few years at apron that off and the intermittent fasting I think is probably one of the best things I've ever done in terms of you know just maintaining energy levels maintaining body weight that kind of stuff here or more strict animals actually even need something once they live longer and the most robust way to to prevent cancer jaquez I'll time is in a mouse and so do intermittent fasting is just a way of making this calorie-restricted diet so what what is calorie restriction its would you sing what you would your doctor would recommend for your body but reducing impact about 20 to 30% so it's quite extreme that's not pleasant I tried that for a week gave up too hard but intermittent fasting like yourself it's doable it's not always pleasant but I think that's the best way to do it and with the works just as well as calorie restriction as calorie restriction which is pretty much always being a bit hungry now what other things are you looking at in terms of mitigating stress or what other factors are there that you have to keep an eye on gas Chris's bad one I try to take life in my stride don't get too worried about it remember what's important so my heart rate really goes up even under a really extreme so I can</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> if you have any about the startups that are actually taking the blood of young people and in injecting it into the bodies of older folks so don't think there's a scientific reason to say it won't work and the scientists were involved or so my Great Khali's people never done it but I think it could work out there for me with neurological disorders already startups and I'm involved in probably 15 Starbucks right now what we're trying to do it to treat diseases that aging and even rare childhood diseases because you can't treat it aging as a business model there is no disease called Aging yet but the future is a better way to go about this is to find what the actual molecules are in the blood kitten Kaboodle yeah but you you said this twice you think aging is a disease or maybe perhaps should be treated as disease are classified oh absolutely think aging should be classified as is it we should think of it as a disease why shouldn't we everything else that goes on in the body of the time that's bad for us is considered disease aging isn't considered but why is that a reason to say so it's natural we should just deal with it we used to say that about cancer and we just said about dying for an infection when you say it happens to 90% of people in developed world what happens the other 10 paid I bypass I guess okay so they die young painful just to watch this poor guy walk you know hunched over and just struggling to move at an incredibly slow pace that seems like a person with the disease it is and imagine if we were on a planet now Island where everybody lives 300 years and we show up and you and I in our life was trying to look older writing I can look it up and say what is wrong with you guys need to treat you and urgently we need to call list it's only because we all tend to go through this that we think it's acceptable but I would argue with the biggest threat to the Health Care system is the biggest threat to the world economy actually is the inability of us to treat people in their old age keep them healthy now some people look at it a different way and their consideration is that there's an overpopulation problem as it is and folks like you want want to walk around live 300 years old have a gang of kids you can create a mess right well I three kids that's enough that's more than I was going to have but yet you have to do the math. How much would the population growing I'm actually working with the number of people to try and calculate this really a problem I agree with you that if this comes and I would actually say when is, when does, doesn't it companies working on drugs The Sciences here so let's say it's coming anyway so we have to deal with this how we going to deal with it will let Festival understand what the future looks like we can't look backwards when I cuz no one's ever invented this stuff before so I can look forward what's the weather look like there's a population it's not as bad as you might think if you stopped aging today and everybody just went on forever Haitian quotes right would be less than the rate of immigration now that's not like I'm going forever of course but what we find is at people healthier especially in developing nations they have your kids so the calculation shows that it would eventually taper off so human population will take off about 9 to 10 billion people and then stay there and that population will be the happiest healthiest people in the world people become more affluent in society becomes more urban people will have less and less children and the population will stabilize that the theory behind this right I'll actually education is Mega part of it as well women's education is the main thing but also just being healthy or the wealth of a nation and buy women's education do you mean extended education so that they they pursue careers is that the the idea or is it obviously most people understand how babies are made like where it where is it where's the education contributing to a lower population well so my understanding is that the first thing you do if you if you educate young women is that they can make choices for themselves and they're not just suffocated do most men would like to have more so sing tsunami so to speak thing Japan the average farmer in Japan is 65 years old that got a real problem John is about to head that way too and I'm going to drag the economy of the planet down and it's been a real problem going to waste so much money on keeping older people alive for the last 10 20 years of their life with dementia Frailty I could be trillions of dollars to 50 trillion dollars just in this country alone that could be spent on figuring out how to solve global warming better education the environment saving to the 1/3 species live lost in 20 years is a life with dementia Frailty that could be trillions of dollars just 50 trillion dollars just in this country alone that could be spent on figuring out how to solve global warming better education the environment saving to the 1/3 species that are becoming threatened that that's why I think tackling aging isn't a selfish act it's probably the most generous act that I could give the planet</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> doing personally to make these drugs are reality but daily I do intermittent fasting it's not what you eat it's when you wait took most important for longevity really and what when being when like what's on the best doesn't actually matter if You Ain't Alot in the morning or at night I like nighttime eating but you need a. During the day at least if your mouth probably hungry and I put your body in a defensive mode bus to keep us healthy why does calorie restriction and intermittent fasting make animals live so much longer and we can we figure it out alive part of how that works in that way making out with molecules is the is the idea that you can mimic it with molecules and it'll be as effective as intermittent fasting I didn't molecules we better when we had them onto a healthy diet and exercise come on to the mice do you also add them on with intermittent fasting and is there an additional benefit are we do the first molecules but we from red wine that molecule just got it in my 30s at least looked at aging what we showed was that if you give it to her house there was healthy as a thin Mouse baby just as long as they get heart disease and all the other bad stuff everyday let them skip a meal every day so that they will fit every other day and that combination of his virtual plus every other day feeding we had the longest lifespan we'd ever seen and it was so it was additive same with exercise if we give our latest molecule cold in a man to a mouse and we exercise it it'll run even further than it could with either of those aligned that's not an excuse to sit around and eat chips and watch TV it over man's healthy lifestyle we get naturally so in any are you seeing a benefit in addition so is the idea to compound all those things together exactly right so just about myself so I I do I eat healthy I try to skip meals I also take supplements and if I close to my colleagues are in the field of Aging for anti-aging is as people call it take anime every morning what is nmn good questions about 20 years ago letting Durante in a team of Varsity Mighty discovered a set of genes that controls Aging in yeast cells just brewer's yeast where you find beer and bread and proteins are called sirtuins and there are seven of them in our bodies five and yeast and what they do is they protect all openings on the planet plants bacteria humans deterioration and disease they're like the Pentagon they sense when we're hungry exercising we put Molly jeans into Isola for a mouse that live longer between 5 to 20% longer and so we can get these genes are responsible for the effects of dieting and exercise which is great what that means is we cannot make that with molecules so animated one of those molecules so is Resveratrol that you can think of birds virtual as the accelerator pedal for the sirtuin jeans and the enemy is the is a fuel and without fuel Reserve coolant works at Andaman is the gas in the car I've heard Resveratrol blue cinnamon a new molecules is commercially available some people start selling it on the Internet it's related to an AR which is sold by a bunch of companies and are nicotine my driver side is a supplement that raises the levels of a molecule called in 88 NAD to work without them out of work stacked if you don't have an ID in your body you be dead in about 30 seconds it's a really important molecule that as we get older we lose an ID so by the time you're fifty like I almost at you have about the Hoff levels once we had when you're 20 so that's not good and wieser tuan's they don't protect the body without high levels of NAD so what a Nintendo's and this other molecule called in our which both you can get on the internet the body's levels of NAD back up to youthful levels again and if we give him some ice these molecules tea tomorow saurian to wormsloe least they live longer and they serve healthy now what level are how many milligrams are you taking of these things so yeah and a man is is something I get from for myself out of not selling anything so I take a gram of Enderman in the morning based on clinical trial has been showing that that will resonate with or without food yogurt that I make myself at home just to oh yeah that that's going to last me a few decades and I also take at night some metformin which is the most radical thing that I take which is a prescribable drug for diabetes Metformin mitt met met and prescribable Drug so you'd be to have diabetes I do not but you take it for for preventing cancer heart disease Alzheimer's an aging method formin and social studies of 10,000 people anymore it's been showing the people who take Metformin if even if I have diabetes are protected against other diseases of Aging even Frailty and some more scientist is likely to extend your lifespan it's just that the FDA doesn't let you have it for aging aging isn't a disease yet so do you have to get diabetes to get it or do you have to get a sneaky doctor well when color sneaky typically have to be convinced cuz I don't keep up with the literature and it's off label okay and how much do you think of that a gram of that as well which is about a low-dose but some diabetics type 2 grams so it's not crazy it's extremely rare that you can tell is a stomach upset and I get which is actually helpful if I'm hungry I lose my appetite but I think the downside is extremely low and the upside is anything's better than what's coming and what is the mechanism that metformin is operating on okay so that so this is the great thing is that are the last 20 years we have figured out we kind of figured out that there are Universal Regulators of aging from yeast to warmth of mice and humans nor three main Pathways that we figured out respond to exercise and one of them is cold ampk and this is a target metformin and so I'm active when I take metformin I'm activating my NPK which will send out the troops the sirtuin by mention that the second of the pathways and fight a Kahneman and resourceful for that and then the third one is called mtor which is a pop when the body responds to how many amino acids how much make your eating and it will protect the body if you get just the right way and is only besides eating low amounts of protein the unweighted to affect that Pathways with a drug called rapamycin which is which is a little dangerous to try and is is used for immunosuppressant so it's not one thing that I would recommend and I don't take it so this is your daily routine along with what would kind of like Diet why I try to not eat too much it's pretty easy to overheat so I try to skip one or two meals a day I avoid sugars and carbs try to run once a week I do workouts on the weekend like you like I love so nice I like to put my buddy in some temperature stress I do hate and then I jump in a cold bath back and forth that works well for yeast we can do that in the lab at night they leave is all that normally going from Savannah to cryotherapy cryotherapy just up but you haven't done at all today will take you down the street there's a great one because it's there's different kinds and some of them are from the neck down where they using liquid nitrogen the other ones they actually freeze the air so when they're they're using the nitrogen to freeze the air and they're pumping an air 204 degrees below zero and you're going to do about 2 minutes I do 3 because I do it all the time but it's awesome I do three and then I take 10 minutes off when I go back in for another three it makes sense and what you doing to your body when you do that we think is to activate think longevity Pathways like this or two wins and his to activate your body's defenses against aging aging most people at parties will tell you all antioxidants New Radicals mutations that is all for the most part incorrect that antioxidants cause DNA damage no that's that repairs DNA damage offenses against aging so as we discussed it or as people disgusted as an antioxidant that was just a mild form of antibiotics and an accident but it didn't so much more right and we know this because they can create a yeast cell or a worm or Mouse and then you knock out the gene for the sirtuin Now resort will doesn't help the animal anymore that's interesting because when people talk about wine good for you billion dollar industry but what fun is that the molecules in plants like was virtual produced by plants because the plants are benefiting from the stress we collect hormesis a little bit of stress is good for you what doesn't kill you makes you stronger kind of thing and homie says was discovered about 60-70 years ago when people with spraying herbicides on plants in a little bit of herbicide actually made them stronger and we think that these molecules in plants are similar but they make the plant stronger during times of stress so if you stress a grape that's for wine making you get great wine but you also get a lot of Resveratrol and so when we ingest that Resveratrol from the plants we get the same health benefits for the plants are activating this or two and five ways and we have the soto-innes and I activate office as well so low-carb low-sugar any specific type of protein do you limit your mouth protein yeah I enjoy in mammals just as much as anybody but I try to avoid them for the main reasons one is that this tmao molecule that seemed to cause heart disease it might be damaging the genome that's my recollection with omnivores or Predators I think the red meat is the culprit right so are they giving this to rats or the given this too was a male study again so different from humans or possibly one of those 3 on Jigglypuff ways and you don't want that you don't want that don't want that cuz I'm poor as a bowl two cents times of adversity and stress and hunger so why do people see a performance benefit when they consume branched chain amino acids really good question so in the short run just like taking testosterone it will give you performance benefits but we think in the long run it'll actually come back to bite you power plant branched chain amino acids come back to buy in the branched chain amino acids will activate the Central Parkway and when we do that in animals we actually we purchased at last been so it's the opposite you want it keep those levels low perform better currently you would see you think especially something like amino acids natural part of human body you would think that we official you're adding to your body something that needs me you would but but what you should consider is that it's a trade-off there's a theory that probably correct it's the some Tom Kirkwood to record the Disposable Soma and our bodies want to do one of two things even want to grow really fast and reproduce fast build up a lot of muscle cells divide at grade in the short run a child you can run but actually that expensive hunkering down and building a long-lasting body that's a trade-off overtime and so animals that go fast and reproduce fast like a mouse will only have a short lifespan or as a whale that grows slowly and reproduce slowly will live a long time so the idea is your your limiting your calories is a limiting your carbohydrates are limiting your protein you're limiting your amino acids but you're ramping up and all these beneficial molecules right things these Pathways that have evolved since the beginning of Life to make us live longer during adversity so we can Thrive when X come back but he could do take into consideration quality of life versus length of life like is there a like a sweet spot near that when it's hard to ask them ice how I feel but 5 when X comeback that should you take into consideration quality of life versus length of life like is there a like a sweet spot yet it when it's hard to optimize how they feel but they would you test them</div>

Maisel popsicles bump into the particles of matter in the detector everywhere but it doesn't interact with us very weekly train tracks through Gravity the the archetypal Costco but everywhere that doesn't interact strongly neutrino so we do know about neutrinos we detected those and that there is something like sixty billion to centimeters squared / second passenger your head now from the Sun pretty much occasionally one of them bumps into something and we can decide those cuz there's so many of them Dark Matter encompasses an enormous percentage of the universe universities normal Masa styles Cindy forms and stretches and it very precisely tells you given the stuff that you put in it how much does it stretch and how does it stretch and the the measurement we have is a distraction so so we we observe observe responding to that stuff that's how we discovered Dark Energy so we noticed that the universe is expansion rate is increasing so University yeah I've been that my one of my friends that Brian Schmitt got the Nobel Prize for that and then I talked to him and he said that he's a postdoc I think of the signs of young research and he made he's making measurements Supernova the light from Supernova explosions which is so bright that you can see them billions of light-years away expanding it stretches the lights to change the color and he knows he has a discrepancy in the universe that the expansion rate is speeding up this being speeding up from thinks of like 7 billion years also has been speeding up so he thought he said that you thought it would be the end of his career. Be a laughingstock and he got the Nobel Prize cuz it is wow that you can't see what you've done wrong then you publish it now when he received the Nobel Prize in this concept started being discussed what was the initial reaction to it allowed in Einstein's theory and it was Einstein's original theory equations for Juiced it initially because Einsteins equation strongly suggest that the universe is expanding or Contracting and not just sad that so even before we observed anything Einstein had a theory that suggested that the universe is just no static and then actually really strongly suggested as a beginning the theory itself suggests that as a man that goes George the Metro it works independently of Einstein but the same time in the early 1920s before we even knew there were other galaxies beyond the Milky Way and they noticed that the the equation suggests the universe might be stretching and so he wrote to Einstein so is a Belgian priest so I think I'm going to roast about this kind of mind but I think that he was more predisposed to accept what the equations with telling him because of beginning and origin for priests is really a nice thing cuz it tells you the creation is this allowed turn into the equation which is the almost the stretchy tub kind of contract to know something can I put something into making stretch if it to balance it all out so it can be tunnel and you can't you can't make it so that way but eats a tried it they took it out and called it is biggest blunder taking it out Universe this table the Mist what equations was screaming his other theory was screaming through which is that no the universe expands or contracts and he missed it right so I think that's probably why in fact but it still dominates in the universe now and it looked and it will dominate even more in the future so we think that we're in the universe that will continue to expend essentially doubling in size of a fixed time scale which is about 20 billion years forever unless something happens</div>

So different things I know you want to find out stuff you're right we just want to find out stuff then you send Robux but as far as expanding actual civilization and bring it to another place one of things that freaks me out of people get depressed about living in Seattle or you going to live on Mars I wouldn't dangerous thing to do they still got to Wyoming and beautiful places and Colorado and yeah something about the history of Miles not quite a lot about history of miles and it's suddenly clear that that was Walter oceans rivers and that Walter is almost certainly still there so I would say that's the thing about miles is quite nice relative to everywhere else other than the earth account go to Venus if you just met with 400 and something degrees and 90 atmospheric pressure and then somehow or another in the future that they were able to get back to Earth your body would have a real problem with that right there is very still Grandma but yeah two different places on Miles that is very deep tricycle helles which is a big impact Basin another bossing the he's so deep you could fit Everest in it so you put Mount Everest in the summit of Everest wouldn't say something like occasionally on the floor of that crazy sometimes it can be 20 degrees</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> really I have that what did you like a Event Horizon about their their concept of propulsion that you almost like space would be flat you would fold space over and you would intersect those two points and you would be able to travel vast distances instantaneously right about doing a terrible job of explaining I'm sure but is that concept that people actually considered general relativity social Einstein's relativity space and time and so it really is results about before it's you mentioned space and time is a sheet just imagine is a thing that's literally sheet surface and all this and that space and time to match my energy so if you if you simply smashing will be the Sun so you put a big spherical ball of stuff in that and the warp space and time such that the nice straight lines something to traveling minors on business route at warp space send into an orbit and that's why you can kind of see things that are behind the Sun so light bends around the Sun traveling through space it's just rolling minding its own business through the Cubs face so an example would be you might say what I owed the space Labs can I give rice to somebody looks like a force gravity so the best analogy I know of is to think of walking with your friend do you walk in straight lines you don't change direction you didn't do any accelerating for the straight lines with lines of longitude on the surface of the Earth so as you go further and further north you got clothes and clothes together maybe carry onto the pole you bump into each other but nothing's happened but no one's moving on oh yeah so so you can so all you have to do to those folded kind of geometries did you have to try and specify hat why you would put the master and what kind of stuff you put to make the geometry fold in that way and you can do it you can do it so you can you can write down that geometry just called so you can do that to to have a Walk Drive the question becomes stuff would you have to actually put into the real Universe to make it walking that way and it always it usually turns out that it's the kind of stuff that doesn't exist so the geometry exists that you can you can you can do it and you can do the calculations and you can see the Walk Drive you can construct wormholes that connect distant regions of the universe which you could use a time machines can do all that in the theory in nature you got the right stuff to do it but that stuff is not real those two things together like it tends to be weird stuff like an stuff that has a negative pressure or something like that sir stuff that has physical properties but it just bizarre. No matter or energy that we know of in the universe has to make to make the geometry Hampton but it's conceivable in theory that this could exist even though it doesn't how old is a good example so that would be quite literally it was toast on the surface of the Earth so you fly to Australia from LA and you have to go quite a long way around the edge of the tunnel straight through and get that quicker and then as we said we don't think that stuff exists right the second set of theoretical bits of theoretical work if you had the Wormhole then what would happen if you tried to travel through it and what seems to happen is that is that they become unstable the moving anything tries to go through a feedback Nobel Prize flashy if the gravitational waves brilliant black holes and time warps way talks about the answers we don't fully know but most physicists think that even if they existed they will be unstable and as soon as you even trying to transmit information through them send a bit of light through then they would be so feedback and they collapse and then ultimately the reason we know absolutely and we don't have one so we don't have the theoretical tools to be absolutely sure that these things would be unstable or don't exist in nature but we strongly suspect that they don't machine when Hosni count Bill time machines that if you send something through it would destabilize it and if it didn't destabilize it how would your physical body deal with the stress of that it doesn't have to be that you can you can build them that's called the tidal gravitational force it's just like the moon's the tidal effects on the earth which is quite small but they still race tides on the oceans so that can be a if you think about something like a black hole that could be massive difference in gravitational pull from your head to your feet and so you can stretch you out but you can you can you can write that you almost have to be destroyed I see that have to be destroyed up anything weird happened to you would you have to have some something protecting you some Force some some sort of a false roof I mean</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that the known universe is larger than we can observe one point is that it's an expanding and we always see the same radiation out there so the glow of the Big Bang but there's some reasons and the one from the theory of inflation the the did the what the best way to explain the universe to properties that we say is that is very much bigger than the place we can say Cipher example we measure space to be what's called flats I don't even say what cause life is flat so if you imagine slices of space let's imagine slices at different times so you just slice the universe the opposite directions of like a saddle or bow and we can measure that I'm really measure a receipt solutely flat and that's a very unusual thing for it to be like it requires because what Einstein's theory says is that the the shape of space that the Cubs your space and determined by the stuff that's in it that's basically Einstein's theory of general relativity weakness precisely the right amount of stuff in the universe to have a completely flat universe and the explanation the most favorite! His universe is way bigger than the peace we can see by looking at One Mile Square vs Big distances clear on the Cub surface and that's one of the ideas about the universe and white he is to be the way that it is because he's way way bigger so we just wait a second a little piece and that's why it looks flat and that's one of the ideas when you say flat like that my brain doesn't understand this because from our perspective when you look up at the Milky Way you see all these stars all over the place so if you're saying flat like a wood how much height and what are you saying so terms of like the way to measure it the best way to think about his face cuz then we can't picture it okay if you did that the angles wooden adult 290° all you can draw Circle and say what was Pi Pi Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter that's only true on a flat surface is different if the surface is curved so you can Define flatness when you're saying flatness how what is the height and what is the width like if you're even talking about it as if it's a table there must be some sort of a dimension to it correct the same applies it's just a generalization of geometry then say you can pick a place we can picture it in two Dimensions but you can you can draw you can quite literally could imagine sending light beams out we do this can I hear now you can see that it's the most distant object you can see with the naked eye and it's about to two million light-years away which means the light took 2 million years to get to us so it's a long way away but it's very big so into the universe a billion light years away almost back to 13.8 billion years ago which is very close to the Big Bang so we can look so light that began his journey before they were galaxies and that's it the oldest light in the universe which one of the one of the a piece of evidence I don't believe in the Big Bang dancers where you can see it that light it turns out that their social structures are ripples in that light which we can use as a ruler to quite literally as a ruler on the sky and then because I light in traveling through the universe we can see how that rule has been distorted as as the lightest travel through space and so we can infer what the space is flat so don't have it if you like just from that measurement</div>

Nuclear Physics wow and I was reading something about the the weight of of that stuff but like a sugar cube like what what is it what is the actual weight but depends on the sugar cube Neutron style material which is 100 million tons weight of quark-gluon plasma in almost incomprehensible you got something for you billions oh my God a cubic centimeter would weigh 40 billion tons good Lord as many collisions per second does you can generate and then they have a collision Crossing lace we can bury it but it said something like twenty-five nanoseconds The Mulch and you haven't make it interesting things like eggs Popsicles or whatever else may be out there waiting to be discovered that possible discovered that could be within the reach of the LHC and if this one that was in Texas had gotten built and it was more powerful than the LHC you have even more opportunity to do something like that these things are created by these collisions how long do they last fractions of a second so that the general rule physics impossible physics is it that the more massive it is basically the heavy things Decay into light things and so the only the stable popsicles are things like electrons and some of the clocks and it helped quite some time clock to stable things but everything tends to Decay very fast being used to measure it so what you say Collide by saywecanfly protons together and price on the got loads of stuff in the ugly ones and the quacks she got a big mess Festival so nice to be soloed bottom and top arm and strange reason they're two for the coffees at there is which identical in every way except the heavier so that the child in the strange clock and that's it and a heavy electron called him you on the telephone and another happy event drunk all the time unhappy ones decaying to the light ones with the points when you make them then outran very long and just answer your question what happens is that when they Decay they threw that decay products into a detector so we take a photograph of the Cascade of popsicles that comes from these came from now when they five bindings unexpected particles what happens then there's a study of them then there's two then everybody gets together and go okay what the hell is that what is that what we do so we want to know with a Higgs particle that we know what it does is it gives Mastiff everything so fundamentally the thing that gives Mass to all the other things in the universe at the most fundamental level so electrons for example and the up and down quarks eggs another reason we exist yet we got right back we wouldn't exist if it wasn't mass in the universe and the Higgs is ultimately responsible for that mess I keep the seed is it worth from the Higgs behaves what want to know is you want to know how that thing behaves and they went to see what a study is so you want to make a lot of them so you can take a lot of pictures of it and study a lot and say exactly how it does that and so that's what we doing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> children's scared the s*** out of me yeah when he talked about it like he he talks about it like we're in the opening scene of a science fiction movie where he's trying to warn people and then they don't listen to to the genius and it goes south so it depends on this iag article out special general intelligence which is like What We Touch by Ilya human-like capabilities things to do it we haven't got them I mean miles away so the moment artificial intelligence his expert systems and very focused systems that do particular things you can eat them it's not what you might call middle-class jobs in the UK so white College jobs it's not actually people interested Universal basic income to sort of replace money that's going to be lost because there will be no jobs for all these people otherwise we have just a mask attached to someone's head necessarily this is kind of interesting because it hits that kind of intermediate level that usually escapes so you're right one of the answers used to text there's an example with a robot Factory okay you can have it but you pay the robot the same as you pay a person and then that money goes into funding Universal basic income agreed that the idea of its every-night style general intelligence taking over the world is miles away and then so whilst we might stop thinking about the regulation it's not going to happen soon is the general point I think so I would disagree with him on that I think I think it's too far in the future of the moment Titanite on the way to the laser near future we're going to be able to download your Consciousness into a computer you talk to computer experts it like this no way we're miles away from that exponential way where we really can't visualize it we can't even imagine how much advancement will take place over 50 years those 50 years something's going to happen that radically changes our idea of what's possible and I think he'll on shares its ideas well that it's going to sneak up on us so quickly the one it does go live it'll be too late system is to create jobs faster than it destroys them so you've always got to remember that is it government and its regulates is if you're going to align Technologies into the marketplace it destroy people's jobs it is your responsibility to find a way of replacing those jobs or compensation those people as you said he got break down so just need some meaning like they just giving them income I think is just going to makes my speculation but we can create Mass to spare even provide them you provide them with food and shelter they need people need things to do so it's there's going to be some sort of a demand to find meaning for people get them occupations give them something some tasks let's it seems to be one of the critical parts of being a person so we we need things to do that we find meaning in the only things we know of that have meaning that fine meaning and share meaning and believe in that we're going to need something like that if Universal basic income comes along I don't think it's going to be enough to just feed people and house them they didn't want something to do if you know a person is a you're doing something for an occupation in this is your identity then I'll submit occupation becomes irrelevant to the computer does it faster cheaper quicker going to have this incredible feeling of errand just not being valuable utopian so the version of this is everybody gots to do what we're doing now is make a living so thinking and creating the job that you don't write you can do the thing everybody want to do that I'll just everybody at the mindset well because everybody had an interest like that if everybody went on to make pottery and painting and doing all these different things that goes really wanted to do and their needs are met by you know the universal basic income money they receive every month but toy there's a lot of people I don't think have those desires and needs and to sort of forced send on to them at age 55 or whatever it's going to be I agree it's a big challenge but I think that in concept at least it's inevitable that we do have some sort of an artificial intelligence that resembles us or that resembles something like ex machina if people choose to create that we choose to create in our own image but that's very Godlike isn't it God created us in his own image I don't know that when I when I talk to people in the field as you probably have most of them say Do not to do it Byron that capability will see ourselves Willows will see their systems beginning to emerge and I will think about it I think 200 years ago if you wanted a photograph of something you want to picture something you had to draw it mean there was no photography 200 years ago just think of that is almost inconceivable no automobiles no photography something close earlier than that right you go back 500 years you have almost nothing it's crazy how we been quick it's so fast I mean that are streaming this so they're in their car and they're listening as they're driving on the road maybe they have a Tesla if they have an electric car they're driving down the road streaming two people talking with ones and zeros that are broken down and is some maybe they have a Tesla if they have an electric car they're driving down the road streaming two people talking with ones and zeros that are broken down and is some audible form and you can listen to it in your car that is bananas we've been quick so quick</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> well I love the way you communicate this because it takes into consideration human nature and like I love Dawkins he's fantastic you think he's very very very valuable but he likes to call people idiots and the problem with that is people go f*** you you're an idiot it like is it a natural inclination when you insult people to argue back and to sort of dig their heels in and you don't do that and I think that's very important and I think that I like talking just gets frustrated from all these years of debates with people who is Educator saying ridiculous things he's a bit of a curmudgeon and only seems to be softening as he's getting older kind of softened a bit over the years actually because now I think at this point both in the US actually end in Britain and then some of the countries we are angry is United States cuz he's United and everybody you got the United American flag that you no sense of belonging in the country we should go to preserve and so I've stopped actually enjoy picking fights with Deepak Chopra on Twitter peaceful means well 818 combine all of us especially people like those you have a public voice we need to defuse some of this angered because otherwise it will consume everyone yes I tried very hard to evolve in that respect and just get better at communicating ideas and get better at understanding how people receive those ideas and I think that's theirs it's easy to get lazy into insulting to insult people I want to entertain people that's the whole I think in terms of discussing ideas especially that are so personal to people like religion Ivory examined the way I interpret these ideas in the way I talk about these things at the babies that have babies have done is 952 I think it was and Robert Oppenheimer did them in 53 I think it's fascinating you can get the transcripts online that free recording at the five-day tights over the other four and you believe it what do you raise them thinking in the way that nature full size you to think can be valuable in other areas and if so that's an inciting itself the great thing the unique thing about science is nature full size you to think like that have an opinion so if you think so sometimes it is a point like object May behave like a billiard ball thing to a ball that bounces around but sometimes it has like an extended thing like a wavy think a nature full size used to hold both ideas in your head at the same time you know this is a complete picture of the objects a description of an electron and he said that's the valuable thing about quantum mechanics he is valuable to be forced to hold different ideas in your head at the same time it's really teaching you not to be absolute Test example uses his cuz I think it was but you think that the individual is the only thing that matters and that's it but actually of course to have a function in society you need to make sure that we can waste it one way or the other but you need to hold both ideas in your head at the same time he said that cuz I thought that's what we talkin about subsets of what's actually happening you come on the side of the world by being an extremist yeah to hold all these views in your head that so often on this podcast because I talk with people I agree with and disagree with and I always try to put myself in the head of the person that I disagree with I will always try to figure out how they're coming to those conclusions or where they're coming from and I think it's so it it's so important not be married two ideas I got a conversation with someone about this and he said sometimes you change your opinions a lot I go yeah I do I do go back and forth no no no no no people need but it's as cruel as it seems they need motivation then and I don't know I bounce around with these things but I've tried really hard as I've gotten older to have less absolute opinions I'm still alive cuz I thought that the power they've given to the politicians asking ball would destroy everything didn't think that it would control the most valuable thing about science is the realization that we don't know and he said he said in that statement because science is satisfactory philosophy of ignorance when is the open do they open Channel he called it so if we want to make progress we have to understand that we don't know everything I'm have to leave things to Future generations and we can be upset and then we can change our minds and he said that that that is a great what last line of come exactly what he says what he said to communicate the volume to all future Generations that's the point that's what freedom of thought means what means freedom to change your mind blowing facts and that's what democracy is you think about it a try whenever system admission that we don't know how to do it Bethel change every 4 years will change the president years will change the president why because the president doesn't know how to do it that's it that's the road to progress you certainly better than love so much about Bertrand Russell and about fine there was how human they were they were very human me finding like the play the Bongos and just chasing girls and was addicted to Tobacco he would talk about how he wouldn't fly unless he could smoke like he had to get us was back when they had smoking sections on airplane I am being without tobacco so strange with a brilliant guy to be addicted to such a gross thing no then you've got no job do you have to be naturally comfortable with not knowing it was one thing I I really do think we was how do we begin to patch a country's back up again one of the reasons I think an education is to teach people the value of uncertainty but not knowing it did not weak right to not know it's actually not to know and they'll be afraid of its religion is to say that you know when you do not how do we begin to patch a country's back up again one of the reasons I think an education is to teach people the value of uncertainty but not knowing it should not week right to not know it's actually not to know and they'll be afraid of it with religion is to say that you know

		<div class="paragraph"> Azalea that we all understand, Define is that a emerging prophecy that that has to be much if you got something this intelligent enough to replicate itself and leave them right when you are intelligent I don't know the answer to that but it could possibly be and does Consciousness have to have a local origin like does it have to come from a thing like if you think about the cellular communication. If you send me if you're in England can you send me a video from your phone and it reaches my phone it's getting to me through space is going through the sky it's like literally from a device not connected by any wires or anyting coming to me if if there's a possibility to create some sort of global intelligence through electronic that's non-local one piece of it falls off does the same it just repairs itself or figures itself out but it's the same Consciousness existing on a global scale through some sort of an electronic Network that instead of the what the idea that you and I have that Brian and Joe or do you have your mind I have my mind and we we exist as intelligent being separate from each other but instead of that that all of it is connected and that all of it is something that we can't even conceive up because our brains are too crude like trying to explain to you know Australia pithecus what a satellite is look at you but they are a colony of things that are autonomous in a sentence in the communicating with each other so I don't see why you can't scale that up in principle do you mean of the body it interacts with matter because I'm moving my hand around so whatever it is it's something they interact very strongly with matter but if you look at the history of particle physics in particular which is the study of matter we spend we spent decades Megan high-precision measurements of how matter behaves ninja ranks and we look for for example for V force of nature 704 force is gravity and that's what we know exists when we look for another one with ultra-high precision and we don't see any evidence of it so I would claim that we know how matter interacts at these energies the room temperature and I'll be done with no how matter interacts very precisely if you want to suggest this something else that interacts with matter strongly then I would say that it's ruled out Tri-State usage rule diet bikes for him and released this is extremely stressful and you would have to jump through a lot of Hoops to come up with the theory of some stuff that we wouldn't have seen when we observe timemaster interacts that is present in our bodies and presumably believe in the soul so that means that interact strongly with the master that is you really carries a pen we know how light interacts and we ruled out anything but the most subtle further interaction so why would I claim a joke similar argument actually so used to cut to him as well as roughly the same elegant so if you so this energy that's interacting with matter even if you are not moving at all if you're just thinking it's interacting with the matter that encompasses your mind or your brain or your nerves your neurons that it's something in there that's interacting with matter what do you like it or not so even just a simple thought process or a dream is still so it's interacting with Matt obviously cuz it your will isn't even if you're not moving if you're just thinking and you're completely still was not totally possible cuz your hearts beating in your breathing and all that stuff but if somehow or another you were able to isolate just the thought the thought themselves are still interacting with matter because they're interacting the brain itself so there's something in there that something insurance with the physical structure of your body and end and I would say there isn't that we so that's the woo-woo version is that the brain itself in the body the physicals of the the spiritual self you are merely an antenna that's tuning into the the the great consciousness of the universe then you have to answer what we know what we made of that we know how those popsicles behave and interact so why did it is not in any way you interact with that stuff cuz we everything that I'm doing right is interaction between that stuff in me such a very strong interaction with matter but we don't see it in all our Precision measurements but food for whatever reason for people there is some incredible motivation to find a Divine something or another that's there's something greater than this physical being that there's something what do you think that is like what is that compulsion that being human the answer to the finite beings right we should just clusters of atoms as we said before the very rare but we understand roughly have it how they came to be and we have a limited amount of time not actually unfortunately that the laws of nature The Beatles to be immortal immortality is ruled out by the laws of physics but also the basic physics of the universe going from The Big Bang to where we are today then the physics is driven by the fact that the Universe began in extremely altered state Susan very highly ordered system and it is tending to Oldham tell Dad system at the moments enesco the second law of Thermodynamics is that basic Common Sense thing that things go to s*** complexity emoji for a brief. Of time that the evolution of the UN is that you got. In time when there's complexity in the universe the stars and planets and galaxies in life and civilizations but they are they exist because the universe is decaying not in spite of the fact the university existence in a picture is necessarily finite limited and it is a remarkable thing that that complexity is got so far that there are things in the universe it is a remarkable thing that that complexity is got so far that there are things in the universe that can think and feel and explore it and I think that is Vance if you want an answer to the meaning of it all that you are part of the universe because of the way the laws of nature work you are allowed to exist but you're allowed to exist for temporary for small amount of time in a possibly infinite universe</div>

They're starting fights with people and they have zero idea how to fight the swing at people did you see that one guy a guy swings at this guy with a bat with a baton the guy catches the Baton in his head snaps back and his head bounces off of concrete when he falls down it's awful to watch like what the fuc made you think you could just hit a man with a stick cuz you guys disagree with each other not even after 5 but I had to be somebody's Auntie. They sound like almost swishy swishy is just like any other group of people they give you a community or whether it's a criminal organization or what you know what whatever it is fall in line with the sensibilities of that organization and then you do what you can to support that organization you're a valued member and then you know you start wearing the f****** ski masks and hitting people with sticks and everybody practicing karate in the park cuz I think they're going to be able to defend themselves the whole thing is ridiculous but because their life has no value outside of it and when I grew up I always thought that people in the left were peace-loving that what that was what the the the the knock was there but you're seeing now people in the left like these certain factions of them not all of them but people are calling for violence do violent pacifists ironically I've ever seen a more punchable face kid with the Maga hat like Razer eidolon drone have you ever seen a more punchable face empathy for young people to like young people that that don't fall in line with their ideas they don't give a f*** the right the f*** that kid punch him thrown in jail</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> detective with my eight year old and my ten-year-old still I didn't realize how transphobic that f****** movie is the boiler alert the whole premise is that it was Ace Ventura Pet Detective finds a tiny Ruby at the bottom of this dolphin tank that is missing from a Miami Dolphins ring and he finds out through this exhaustive search that the one guy who he couldn't account for his ring was a kicker who f***** up the World Series or those the Superbowl rather so in the movie at the end of it the reveal is that Sean Young is really diss football player who wants to get back a Dan Marino because Danbury to go psycho because the world hates him because he blew the kick so he's a guy pretending to be a woman in Ace Ventura made out with him and just like every other cops are throwing up everyone's throwing up directions to did anybody can get those in an afternoon but what about this and he pulls her pants down and then he goes by and then everybody sees her and she's got her legs together so you can't see your penis and then from behind you see her junk is pressed up against her butt cheek cuz she's tucked her penis and so the cops all starts throwing up and then cop start cleaning cops at made out with her start cleaning their mouth off to start chewing giant while they are at the end and he points to the fact that Sean you look they all start throwing up look everyone's throwing up this is Dan Marino's throwing up and also the Dolphins freaking out everyone's freaking out it is so insanely transphobic maybe someone woke left might disagree with you right now you transphobic for defending this horrible cisgendered heteronormative and I guess this is a great thing I need the remoralization project is working because when I saw that I'm sure is I don't know what year did that come out I want to say was before I came to Hollywood transphobia was not a thing that's good is the Overton window being shrunk too small how do you feel about the flag yes or no I don't know that one with that one this one they yanked the Dukes of Hazzard off television forever because the Confederate flag is on the roof of the generally did not follow that you cannot watch to heathermoor you cannot watch it it's not on television anymore used to be on TV Land all the time can you get it Skynyrd like nineteen seventy something and they have a vagina that I thought in the bathroom other bathroom the in the background that was there like Southern Pride this idea of Southern Pride it was okay to have that flag I'm face play for trying to get when it comes to the realm of Art and movies and books leave it alone try to leave it alone as much as possible generally a very good strategy don't want to be in the book Banning movie Banning TV Banning business because the guy's name was Jim that was the name in the book cuz that's how people talk back then and I think we need to keep that stuff as a time capsule to show how racism was so yes yes important to show the progress like Ace Ventura like you she likes for Trans people for history coming on from you Joe Rogan about the country just like any other country but it is a democracy and its trying best in a really rough neighborhood and we'll go like I want you to see what the occupation looks like like I think that's something that's really important to see to get a full picture of it I was fascinating because that was kind of a vacation trip to but that's such a unique culture cuz Thailand is run by the king orc if you can criticize the king your your f***** like you're in real trouble and his pictures everywhere everywhere those pictures of him in the throne like wearing like super nice clothes and look good but the people are so kind they're so friendly and they're always smiling and they have you know there's a lot of people that you'll into that have very little yet they don't seem to be having a problem with that they wear flip-flops you're on the highway there's three people on a motorcycle has a baby in a basket and I'm not bullshiting it's so on you and you know me and my family we had we go somewhere we always have long conversations about like what was interesting about it for you like did you think like a twenty-two-year-old to all girls into me about it is first of all I love exposing his little people to different parts of the world so they get to see like what this is like you know like we we are like show on the map this is America we're over here crazy and just to realize I human beings are the same but different or the same everywhere but there's a different way we choose to interact with each other and one of the things that happens as we fall into their way when we go there like we go to Italy we say gratzi you know we start the I try to start running stone crab I think that's why I said it's like sent like hello take good morning yeah and but they all say that and everyone makes a lotus flower with their hands it's so common everywhere you go people greet you and they do this and it's such a warm friendly peaceful way of greeting each other and so what are things we talked about I was like you know everybody's like way more friendly and like greeting in this thing about class B their hands together they all agree to do it and everyone swear it's like unique pattern that people can fall into and people fall into all sorts of patterns they fall into like really aggressive patterns of the honking at people on the road and driving real fast and then they fall into these peaceful patterns and some of its dictated by culture some of his dictated by climate some of his dictated by the economic situation in the world are in but it's it's such a weird trip to go to different places and see like okay yeah if I lived over here this is how I rock it that you were in flip-flops and shorts and and I did I get around this way and this is the kind of food that I would eat and tell me the real spicy because you know you kind of have to have those spices actually protect against bacteria because they're they're at they're actually antibacterial was it did Grant f****** amazing we took some classes we learn how to cook over there yeah it was amazing was amazing but my allergic reaction to some of the bugs over there and get and yukino you think like what about diseases that kill people than

They are at the curb well the fat chicks emotion very sensitive you can't you can't cross them because people are realizing now that they can make an impact things that I read cuz he's doing his thing in Pittsburgh he was doing the Improv in Pittsburgh and this lady who wrote the article wrote that he's making people put their cell phones and bags much like comedians data challenge Joe Rogan do she is my name to he did have done it before but I only did it when I was filling my Netflix special didn't want people put the material at work I was releasing the special it was too much of a pain in the ass but the only reason why I was doing it had nothing to do with this she said because they know words can offend I want the consularized I'm going to put it on Netflix amount of laughs with the minimum amount of of people getting it the wrong way right so this at all about worrying and sitting upright listening to it and maybe there's a better way and you can't do that if somebody releases your s***'s right these people that don't know, Dee and they're saying it's like you've no idea what the process is like you just don't and if you if you do you would respect and appreciate right and the people that are Comics that don't respect and appreciate the process like that's where we are now make an impact you can have a reaction just like the people yelling at her you know that did she said she said oh my grandma to be rolling over in her grave and they can have some sort of an impact we're going to get Louis CK banned from here you know we're going to get Nick depalo kicked out of this club you can't come to this club you talk negatively about women and women's empowerment you know that didn't she said she said oh my grandma to be rolling over in her grave something and they can have some sort of an impact we're going to get Louis CK banned from here you know we're going to get Nick depalo kicked out of this club you can't come to this club you talk negatively about women and women's empowerment</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Sam Harris podcast very f****** interested because they're they're talking about what we actually know about the data and where it's coming from and how these people are doing this and how they're setting things up yeah that guy when I talk about him again that clip of this Russian who is a former KGB guy explaining how it works is going down exactly what kind and Putin is occasionally guy don't cry shh it's this idea that Trump's working with him is f****** well I don't know about that I don't think he's worked with him to undermine democracy but I definitely think they've got some business dealings mean they were offering him to Trump that's not illegal to Penthouse in Trump Tower illegal said I don't do any dealings with Russia I don't have any business with Russia he definitely did this is not true it won't we'll see we can pull it up with spider all the things look at my salon., social media I don't know but I'm not I'm not claiming to be any sort of an expert in legal proceedings I have no idea but that's why I called it dershowitz I think she was working with Trump team a day cuz I don't know what's making that claim I don't know the exact who is Saint inaccuracies you doubt the truth you think this all lie that is made up the factory last lot of lies about what the definition of a lie just mean they can't lie the total figure visiting to 7600 so you think they just made up all these lies with Hillary and you can go to go to Fox News and then put all that pull up an art gallery was inaccurate whataboutism is a whataboutism bi when someone talks about something and instead of refuting with facts Eagle yeah what about Hillary what about Bill Bill did it to what about this Hillary in the Washington Post I think they they they rig the primaries against right I'm with you statement like that and then said this many inaccuracies when Bill Clinton was in office so I think a lot of our or Hillary I'm so whatever I'm sure there was some inaccuracies but first of all when Bill Clinton was in office they weren't they, Obama's I don't know but that's a whataboutism me I'm saying we're just talking about Trump you were saying the Trump doesn't lie and they're saying you lies did he doesn't write I'm sure sometimes when you talk in that lies 1900s that mean the dossier what dossier the fake dossier Christopher Steele that they use to get the fisa application call the folks tell me a story is everything Trump has done what is the story The Steele dossier that Hillary used they went to court and they went the DNC office is Christopher Steele was a British guy had connections in Russia that was all in the Steele dossier and their application to get a fisa warrant to spy on Trump during his campaign that's fact that's not me being a right winger that is fact okay but the fact that but like that you don't know that. I remember that now when Obama said it would help care that you could keep your Healthcare in all that give me an example of trump with that big of a lie well listen I told you I'm not at all politicians lie salon.com gotten more done than any other Administration okay this is Ally so true blah blah blah okay and be safe okay so I'm just reading what it's in front of me said that he intended the UN moment to Garner a laugh that is repeated his claims seriously since okay so he says that my alternative the Administration has accomplished more than almost any Administration in history the country so this is just that legislation Trump aside plenty of bills and first use of President Barack Obama in his first two years has significantly more sign significantly more okay this is just one thing I mean I'm sure there's many many other things that you can keep going over and over again I'm with you I'm not saying lying bullshiter but I'm just saying all the sudden they keep score when it went as opposed to how much you realize you're a lot bigger is about her f****** server in about the Steele dossier but that is huge that is getting under covered like nobody's been Watergate when they unmasked General Flynn that that that dwarfs Watergate conversation frequent to call Trump a bigger liar than every other politician is an exaggeration I don't know either but I think the way he lies is unusual I think it's the number of usable unusual you don't think so he he exaggerated statements like that is an exaggeration although he did do a lot that's for a couple years would never get credit for it and I won't unless you watch Fox News you're not going to but would you agree that as you get older you become more like more conservative know I was always a bit of a dick I thought it was no I would say that was what do they say about a few young young and conservative you have no soul no heart old and liberal girl you have no mind here and I like that I love you as a person you're a great guy I like you alot always happy to see you but yet you and I hear get a little heated. This type of this is politics this is how divisive politics are ever even a person like me whenever I would never f****** I would never leave here going no you know I'm a lot of people out right yes yeah I'm not afraid of it. Happy birthday to bad vibes and bad feelings then this is one of these but this is one thing that makes people tow the line the fear of this kind of altercation the fear of this kind of like you don't want that from inside your party so you right you start using they and them you start thinking that everyone should be able to use any bathroom that they feel like they identify with you start you start going along the it's one of more interesting things about politics is that if you tell me that you are Republic and I can kind of guess your stance on God I can kind of guess your stance on being pro-life pro-choice second amendment rights like all those things for the fall in line and it's very interesting very interesting how you use sort of adopt not you but people sort of adopt a whole group of things when you decide you're Republican or Democrat right I don't but see I don't think I follow that you are Republic and I can kind of guess your stance on God I can kind of guess your stance on being pro-life or pro-choice second amendment rights like all those things for the fall in line and it's very interesting very interesting how you use sort of adopt not you but people sort of adopt a whole group of things when you decide you're Republican or Democrat right I don't but see I don't think I fall into that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's why people come to it yeah you can't get the truth from the mainstream media while trying to explain to a friend who was talking about doing a podcast deal with a network sounds like stop I can't do one thing that you can have when you get it could be mainstream it's free of everything up free of any influence and you're going to let a bunch of pencil pushers and compressors they're going to tell you what you can and can't say which direction can and can't go you know they're going to try to influence you but isn't Google doing that now with conservatives like shutting down Dennis Prager you going into business with them where you were podcast you're free and independent probably the only thing in the world where you can be completely free and independent still reach millions of people who really is the only thing in the world bungled what I'm saying Google on YouTube right right and people like Dennis Prager religious right guy is and she'll get shut down on YouTube and shut down what happened to him cuz I'm I'm completely ignorant about this is the first time I'm hearing about that this is going to go to the Supreme Court so they pulled and so they took his page down they said he can't have a a page on YouTube anymore yeah you remember what it was about not specifically but I know it was labeled hate and if you listen to this guy for 10 minutes to the most congenial fair-minded you know but he's he's Jim Douglas Maria's he's actually her who is he's a he's an intellectual from England who wrote about wrote the book or about immigrants in Europe called The Strange death Islam in the strange death of Europe and he's basically talking about how people from these countries that have immigrated into Europe are changing the culture of changing the culture and there's all sorts of you know games and things are happening to didn't exist before and people developing these communities of like-minded people that didn't exist but I know goes on and he saying that this is you know this is fundamentally dangerous but the he's saying it from a point of perspective of understanding the actual facts involved and talking about the situation and people that don't respect homosexual extremely Antiquated not aligned with European values in modern Western World right the Heat and Sam Harris had a conversation and that conversation got flagged on YouTube it got flak someone put it up in there do you make it like a little watchlist what is it called when it was a call of the list you can we put it on YouTube on your channel where you could the playlist get so he puts it on his playlist and he gets a computer a community guideline strike against him for putting up his conversation between two intellectual conversation with this lady YouTube and it will why why would you do that why why does that get she was both hate speech I go to hate speech and you talking about to intellectual having a discussion about a real thing is happening right now in Europe you're saying hate speech if you listen to the podcast has used just facts or just the way she said it power but it's also a lot of irresponsible power power but but bed but my point is that cracking down on people who lean right whether it's Twitter yes and I'm 100% And that's a big f****** problem hate speech what's the name of the alphabet how about when you disagree with a liberal or whatever you're arguing with it always while you're a hater they would keep saying that and that's what it turned into to get you just dissed a great you're a hater now that you're a bigot or racist 2-butene agree with Obama's policies you're a bigot or a racist and and that s*** works that that's been working for the left the years but now that the social media Google controls almost all the information that's why it's so dangerous so it look up the appraisal is the first example that comes to mind 18 or something like that and they were fighting and having a lawsuit against that saying that what they have in their videos or not shouldn't be behind that like that wall whatever that is they also then but this is my point you have to go to YouTube to get the store yesterday they had ads blacklisted from Spotify so they had to ask that were initially approved and now they have been disapproved and they haven't really explained soaps of but his page is still up you know Corolla. Yeah I believe asking about it yeah well but the YouTube page is still up it's ups is it right now bro just got a million subscribers I don't know about a backup Maybe no I believe you so my point being is he's big top big tech companies a question conservative very very very cool the way to go about something like this one is not to shut them down to have a debate exactly and that's not happening well you know what you saw the Google memo you saw what happened with that guy when he provided all this information about one of the reasons why women don't get into Tech and they labeled him as a massage in it woman-hater that's all he said he was brought up a numbers of males going to science and math he didn't say women not good at it and he got f****** can from operacje you can't have anything that's fascism if it disagrees with the Orthodoxy they'll come down and you didn't even if it's factual like James D'Amore and you could clearly back it up you could look at the the actual numbers I put a page-and-a-half in there on strategies for encouraging women to get an attack if you was a real massage working for hold them are why we doing all this research if you guys completely ignore every time it comes out right like you're pretending This research is not valid This research is its its scientific information that shows that certain types of people are more interested in different things we've known that forever that's why boy toys and girl toys are different cuz boys and girls like the Google memo bright that was what started off now all these intellectuals came to his side they look why we doing all this research if you guys completely ignore every time it comes out right like you're pretending This research is not valid This research is its scientific information that shows that certain types of people are more interested in different things we've known that forever that's why boy toys and girl toys are different cuz boys and girls like different s***</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> into this recent Sam Harris podcast and it is f****** fascinating how much Russian troll farms and all these fake accounts and what they're trying to do and what one of the things you're trying to do it when Jamie was saying was that that kid with the Maga hat with a Native American beat the drug out of them was posted by this website that turn down for real troll Farm but it was in Brazil was it was a blogger in Brazil they just going to ask Twitter what's going on with this account and by the time that ask them it just suspended accounts gone but you said they suspended account because the account was a fake account thought it was supposing as a California teacher they trying to get people again up truck but you're doing that intimately people need to understand that this is actually really happening and do we need their help a podcast about this where they talk to people that actually worked in these troll farms and that these people were they they would both be left-wing and right-wing as one of the things that they're talking about on the Sam Harris podcast it's I think it's called war of information but they'll pose as like pro-choice people and say ridiculous yes like over the Opera hashtagme are in there they're heading but they have nothing to do with that they're just Russians and they're just trying to get people riled up and you see people jump on board in but I was talking to that we were talking about but he referred me to this Russian guy I can't remember his name but this is a clip of this Russian guy who worked for the KGB defected over here and he's explaining how Russia does that yeah this is back in the 80s when we do it to everybody doesn't they all do it everybody doesn't they f*** with the system in any way shape or form in order to achieve a desired result that the Russians are the best weapons almost got third world and a brutal dictator that's all it takes is a far as the economy and everything like a third world country how much effort they put into sewing discourse or Discord to getting people upset with each other to starting arguments and to saying things that are going to upset people in order to get the right versus the left yet to look like to undermine from the inside it's really interesting it's weird that works but it makes sense that works sneaky a strategy you think CNN does just as good a job really do really interesting that works but it makes sense that works me to sneaky a strategy you think CNN does just as good a job really do but you're so right when you cannot solve</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> for refuses to apologize in a infuriating interview like he was just absolutely flicking stories okay offended as Hell by those kids and I'm a big old bleeding heart Lefty for sure I hate those those f****** hats but like at the same time every teenage boy is a f****** idiot everyone you know and like it it's for those boys were standing there doing their school chance while these that there's a long video on the videos 2 hours long I haven't watched it in the segments of it you see those Native American guys walk up to those boys and chance with with their drums so they're all there for different reasons so the boys were there for the March for Life which is a pro-life March right there from a Catholic school and then the Native American that was theirs for a different reason sort of marches going on and that's all that's our right as Citizens but it's just that they're all the Lincoln Memorial together these boys did not have like a good chaperone like now they yelled they said something like it's not rape if you enjoy your joy in an assembly once we're a friend of mine was in like in Chicago different doing a play and they were doing like a scene from the play on stage and a woman would come on stage and behind the worst s*** I can imagine what's the worst thing rape so this kids going to yell something about Ring it's it's a children need better supervision at a global scale the f*** they're even demonstrating about to really have a good argument about it and let you bring kids to a pro-life demonstration have them chant and yelder schools songs and and put on Maga hats like the whole thing is so f***** up its really if you put in a room together and talk it out we I think we I think we would mano-a-mano with the same thing I love people but I hate people it get around people too much then those Gap days we just you can just recharge appreciate people you see him that you're on the way to Comedy story like I want to f****** go right now but it's like that with therapy comedy sometimes and the gym sometimes I don't want to f****** go but everytime I'm glad I did it. what about this is that they want to Doc's these kids and Paula address out there a river that ever ever adults that are you know f****** 50 years old really know what they're doing whereas these kids because they're white or getting chance after chance after chance but I don't think I should be ruined it's like I feel like we we we talked enough about it these kids did what they did let's move on situation like the consequences of social media the fact you can take a video of someone doing something incredibly stupid when they're 16 years old but like I see if you just standing there and someone comes up to him beating a drum how are you supposed to react I feel like they incorrect but I saw the kid was standing there and that guy walked up to him just two hours there's a video of these people that's 2 hours long and the video that I saw those kids were staying there chanting and that guy walked to those kids and was beating his drum if that one specific kid walk down but still I instigated it by walking to them beating the drum not always that that guy got in that kids face and beat that drum inches away from his face I thought that kid walked up to the to the Native Americans I walked up to the whole group okay CNN that is just full of holes and it doesn't match up to the video doesn't match up to what happened is like you can pull pull up video of pull that article did you try to find that article to CNN article there was an article about the article that I read either way High School my God Twitter the things you would say on Twitter or SnapChat or any of those things I mean I did not grow up like you know my parents generation being mildly racist if you're white you know I grew up pretty woke as the kids say in Portland Oregon so but it was also it's funny we had we had we had right wing Nazi groups moving in when I was in high school gangs from LA and then from Central Oregon and then further toward Idaho you had you had this discussion a Metzger who had like a little bit little Camp you cook on party in 15 American History X was just like that drink free beer and they play punk rock music skinhead group or whatever it's it's it's a community first four people and that's where they look at it first but I just feel like they're all they walked up to him being in there bang in the drums the other guy walking up to the kid and there's up to that kid and got in his face as clear as debt and he walked up to that kid specifically got in his face there was a certain amount of separation between them he walked to the kid and got in his face was beating the drum so hit when they're doing the whole thing is so strange so strange because what are you supposed to do when someone walks up to you beating a drum so there's the kid the kid standing there and the Native American guy now walks up to him completely violating us-based now imagine if this is a man doing this to a woman you would say okay is violating her space 100% this is f***** up an aggressive and that's what this guy's doing is singing this kid's face it's a little kid and what is a kid supposed to do I don't know walk away should you say I'm sorry that someone in the past stole your ancestors land what it supposed to do but I mean it's just approaching because of people mocking him beating a drum inches from his kids face it's the f****** hatman that goddamn polarizing stupid Hey that has a much closer to him he's put the drum off to the side so we can get closer to this kid's face means expecting the kid to walk away I don't know but the kid doesn't do anything but still keeps blinking because the beating of the drum is so close to his eyes it's weird the whole thing is very weird just added everyone else walked away but what does he have to his face I think you would walk away probably beating a drum of death Batman the Native American man rightly felt like he was being mocked yeah and then his traditions and his is Heritage is being mocked and Eddie's little kids but the best way to communicate your singing a song a Native American song and he doesn't know what the f*** you're saying and you doing in inches from his face and they made it out like this little kids at cont and even raise the Aslan had on his ever seen a more punchable face like mint I can feel my stomach make a fist from like this just don't want to see this but you know like it's like that dude that that that that kid at the Cubs game who had the game in his in his earphones and he caught the ball which the outfielder was definitely not going to catch anyway and they blamed him for the Cubs loss of the series Nana's for that kid out stop kid like you ruined it and it was kind of a wider stand when you're playing Major League ball one mistake could mean the end of your career and your family. get in the traffic can we see that video of the guy catching a ball that game I think the difference is that kid to reach into the playing field I mean I think I think I remember literally did he took it literally took it from him in the playing field a little cont he's got spray on them people through gears on them probably</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> well written by these angry women about Louis CK's come back and some of them have been going to his shows and writing about nacho and one of them that I read today was from this woman and Pittsburgh what I thought was fastening she said that he has heat doesn't allow people to bring cell phones you know they have those yondr pouches we put the the woman's rationalization of this was and it should be included me and Dave Chappelle in this that we use because we know that words offend but we don't want the consequences which is not what it is at all now it's you don't want people sharing your if your material online because you're developing and you're touring with it and jokes are surprised the difference is you can hear it over and over and over again it doesn't lose any the thing you are supplying diapers right and there's like a very specific punchline about a diaper and then they already know it they know that punch Leon and you're working out how to get that punch on and how to set up the bit but someone leaked the audio already touring right now with that leak set yeah which is weird right like what all that stuff about the Parkland kids and I don't know if he's still doing those bits but he's doing some of those bits about losing all the money and about how he bought it watch like those bits like this woman reference those bits in the article with that means that she went to the show and he's doing the material from the leak which kind of has to do because if you wrote an hour over the last 10 months Riley's been Hiatus what what does he do like what is touring is he going to tour with a whole new our get the f*** out of here it's almost like I will say that aside you know like I have my problems with Louis and and what he's done and everything but overall I'm on the side of of free speech and in terms of being comedians we can't allow you to come in and fill Marsh it or the recorded no matter who it is because it's funnier than you. In all fairness if I go to see a movie I'm not a movie maker but if I go to see a movie I think it sucks I should be able to say all the movie Blue true but you're not allowed to go on set and film it yourself while they're filming while you're also not allowed to Bootleg it and then put it online to go to jail but like The Comedy Works has where you coming with your cell phone they put it in a locked pouch you get the combo to get it when you leave I was doing that before I did my Netflix special but I was only doing it to really because I was tightening up my my set and I didn't want any of it getting leak right before the Netflix special but once I filmed it then I stopped doing it because I was like it's too hard complicated and it's just like the internet is going to be the Internet is just make the show better though too complicated and it's just like the internet is going to be the Internet is just did make the show better though you know where did make it better Miami I'll realize the Miami people are there such Champs that they just kept getting up and walking out and said to check their phone you would get up and go out to get their phone to come back and so they were all just like popping up and down</div>

I know I think about fighting fires for 10 hours you make $10 that's insane but is that but knowing that slavery that might be worse than slavery because $10 an hour isn't even going to buy you food that's what I sent Walmart to work all day then you could feed yourself so y'all anyway I appreciate you saying that cuz that's true and it's not just black eyes is poor white people I almost wish I could have a convention went to say we got the same Masters if you're saying this right here more than 2,000 volunteer inmate firefighters volunteered including 58 youth offenders are battling wild five Flames through California inmate firefighters serve a vital role clearing thick brush down to Bare soil to stop the fire spread do they get better service activate the get out earlier no they don't think nothing I don't think so I would hope they do but if we're Panama dollar out what are we care but we're like we are the public should be up in arms about you not run too cuz when you're when you're chopping down bushes out there when there's a fire going on but where you going you know something else we doing our prisoners as cruel and brutal we put people in a box of 23 hours a day yeah let him out for an hour to walk in the space yeah you driving me crazy with their senses to the point where they're going crazy absolutely they get Solitaire I have to talk to you about Solitaire and they're just there for themselves you know I'm being a Georgia State Corrections for anyting UCLA play play point guard for the school and I stayed in school I know his dad like a f****** player I can play any basketball I should be sitting there quietly reading the paper just like wait to get the f*** out of here man cuz I don't know what to say s*** I don't want to go to prison thank you.

		<div class="paragraph"> what is what was the was the initial premise and how much of it did it change until what once you got the production and what you started filming it could have been but it would have been a parody of a very real thing I was attempting to do and right now I'm talking about crippled Cola what it turned out that turn into at Netflix was a real in-your-face simple and plainly shot documentation of the possibilities of Barbershop arguments right fundamental Barbershop argument you get to say you know the only thing that separates Al Capone from Joe Kennedy is Al Capone got caught and eventually Congressman Joe Kennedy went on to produce presidents but they both have been Bootlegger people say s*** like his barber shops start my guys and again giving it a shot and give it a try I thought of that s*** at 15 years old I started trying to figure out how to do it 10 years ago Daniel and I got it done eight nine years later and and now you have this and that I say that just to say that Brian koppelman the Creator billions is a brilliant writer to me and he's a freezer friend also but Brian has been putting up lately these just encouraging things telling writers to write stuff is getting bothering you don't think it's good to write to to push yourself to push the idea forward and I've been taken by the inspiration for that because Daniel Daniel Weinfeld and I wanted to call Riders and co-creator and development is over 10 years now I know how to do it how to go on a room how to get it you know it won't take me 10 years for the next one but it was worth the struggle you know it was worth doing that it was worth tweaking my ideals were critiquing my idea to be like the first time it's not it's not we should be because I was nervous as s*** tonight before it came out about everything and it you know what scenes were shot how'd it look the production value in now seeing people get it and unlike a lot of other artists not have to call yourself a genius to tell people every artist has a chance every comedian thinks they're f****** Richard Pryor and some part of your mind you have to think you're great or why do it you have to believe there's greatness in you right but I never wanted to be I mean I just never want but to see it because I always thought the idea was genius like f*** that s*** you were real people that used to come on just tell me if I remember watching that show as a kid looking at motherfukers like places like Iowa and Kansas and I wanted to approach it I wanted to approach people in a very I'm here right in front of you kind of way now to bug you not celebrity Michael Morris the people knowing the rapper play me an opportunity that people can say is genius and I'm going to say I'm humbled and honored with your f****** right and it's genius because I'm engaging people at a regular human level not at the level of celebrity or powers are used to being engaged but one that allows them to fully open up I haven't seen it on TV since some s*** like real people do no I haven't seen revolutionary TV like The Jeffersons or you know All in the Family or mod and I think that the world is getting scary and p**** to be honest you know not to disrespect pussies pussies are tough but I think that something needs to be done is the best compliment I got on this restaurant has been like Ambrosia Ambrosia for heads said how's it feel to has more thing to show on TV and it's dangerous because it unites people doesn't separate people who gives you alternate advances in the ones you thought you had it for so you think it doesn't solve all the problems of Rapid up pretty at the end give you some options to doing some s*** to think about and it's funny as f*** imagine Netflix gave you plenty of room in terms of interacting with them about the material I can't help you like no one can help you as a comic is not another person like an executive is going to help you do your best you got to you got to be looking at yourself ruthlessly and you'll figure it out so they trust you so I would assume they did the same thing with you yeah yeah perfect beautiful world beautiful world it was the opposite was 50 f****** Cooks in the kitchen every pulling this way.</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> have less children in the population decreases as the world economy evens out and so that we reach like a point where we can maintain a sustainable population but how does that still happen without mass genocide form a sterilization I don't think they're saying that I think what they're saying is that as people become more educated and more affluent and more successful as more organization takes place people work more and have less children when they have less children the population actually slightly decreases give me the f*** more people who f*** more have more children night night that just I like that's one of those stats from me like that might just a might just be talkin about particular class of people there still sell it 7 billion people are we going to talk about going cuz when you go like it does that happen is that is that it we going to Universal pay Universal pay would be fine Foods Universal effort if everybody just put up the same amount of effort I would agree with everyone getting sent without mass genocide of sterilization and more wealthy as as City spread out what happens is less those people have kids and they have less kids this is just a study and this is the ideas that how do I get to solution solution for billion people I think the argument as they keep expanding is that these cities needs urban areas that as the society sort of evens out globally whether it takes a thousand years or a hundred years as things start to even out people will be more like Los Angeles and last last less like poor place at Calcutta but what I'm saying is like poor person Calcutta you got a bunch of people walk in Los Angeles the point if it ain't no turning around we might be we might be but we also might not be and I think it's not a bad time to be optimistic visit people look for better and better Solutions but but like Jacque Fresco and the Venus Project talk about money with society's what are political States and things of that nature Chomsky talks about you know essentially all all countries oligarchies and s*** so like what's the radical departure from this saying that says it all in your mind like what's the Joe Rogan United Nations speech previous the world but has plenty too pretty to improve on I probably will I think people are getting better at life to getting better at all all the things and government will come along with it then we're going to get better at things we understand each other better we communicate better is I'm optimistic and I think with all these incredibly intelligent people that are looking at the problems the world in terms of carbon in the atmosphere or pollution in the ocean people are already starting to work on Solutions I'm really optimistic that that it's there's at least a potential for to figure out some solutions to some of these problems overpopulation is always going to be a weird one because you don't have the right to tell people how many kids they can have you meet somebody that 10 kids and the most f****** amazing family ever what what what do you say This Is Where It gets weird but but it's not a cut-and-dry issue it's not a one or a zero it's like yeah there are too many people and yeah you probably shouldn't have 10 kids but you got to f****** awesome family so hey have a good night man yeah what the f*** to do</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> live in harmony with nature in a very different way you normally they kill for hunger and I mean they ain't can't kill for reasons that are non hunger-related things that they do so we know that's a part of us but I think we evolved from something that didn't look like us here but we exhibit characteristics and if you pay attention to all the top scientists to have been studying Revolution they're all pretty much in agreement but there was something that we were all similar to and they all branched off at a bunch of different ways to Maiden to keep finding new forms of people to yeah I saw that I just stopped precursor something it was shelled essentially where they can I see an immediate right there should have been very good in theory but yeah I think I think that's that's a possibility aliens were hanging out at the moon so you can go see and say yo straight f*** the s*** out of it got out of there and the next thing you know you have war and pestilence and violence and probably and MMA in joints but one monkey that accelerate past way past all the other ones like one invention the invented how did communicate and abilities that have an opposable thumbs ability communicate and then start advancing soon as I start talking figuring out ways to express itself to each other and then they start making things and they're Off to the Races the next thing you know how about a thousand years later the world's different show it's like this thing erupts and then discovers the world with his s*** and that's how do you subscribe to the theory that we just maybe a virus in the earth may be getting rid of us the reason you call a virus something it's just an upward that's been assigned to a living organism in a system if I buy medical science I mean we all know what a virus is it's a real thing it's amazing these brilliant people discovered it and come up with vaccines to stop and prevent them but it's a some sort of a life-form really centrally if we looked at the Earth is being a living organism and we should be sure it's certainly can make an argument that it's a kind of a life-form that it's a host of massive amounts of life the life you would think that maybe some of those things would not be in harmony just like some of those things in the human body are in the harmony write your gut bacteria is off or you got a cold because there's bacteria in your body that you picked up from a f****** yeah bathroom somewhere whatever your staff assure we are the virus to the ocean cuz we don't even think about it before we were we were something that crawled out of the ocean right you know people that figured out how to get out and capture fish Mansion if you could see it I'm asked if you could see an image of how many f****** fish were out there 200,000 years ago versus how many are now it's like they live next to a vampire that just keeps sucking the life out of it I bet we'd killed 50% of all life in the ocean maybe the best thing human beings could do for the Earth is is to in humanity viruses are there for a reason to me but it all needs to exist needs to be some sort of a balance where was trying to eliminate bad things maybe they do serve some sort of weird f****** purpose even in that we fire purpose is he out of</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> everybody feels like work like that and everybody feels like we just got to get out of that neighborhood complaining about gentrification when the kids that are leaving these neighborhoods whether they sing dance rapper not or just go get good jobs and Kobe just human beings you should be re-entering your neighborhood you should be buying houses or pieces on laying their most impressive things who plays John Stockton and I don't know if it's true or not but I read a story that he actually bought a house right on the street you grew up in so in the offseason he go back and sent me home with his kids so they had some type of normalization to their life you we should be doing that you know Tiana have bought properties together in the same neighborhood we grew up in developing things like restaurants and stuff I like to see more athletes and rappers become the merchant in business class that way and I like to see people who grew up in neighborhood move back to those neighborhoods they grew up in like like the typical iconic American Dream you know you can build a you do another 8,000 square footage in the back of a frame house if you want to but you shouldn't be going to 50 60 minutes outside the city and then complaining about the plight of the city because you took yourself away you took the Talon in the resources away do you think that everyone should feel that way though or is it mean you feel like you have to be committed to the city that you grew up in or couldn't I just get the f*** out of there and go somewhere difference nothing wrong with getting f*** out but yeah I think you should go back and support and yes I got tell kids you know how to do that kid make sure they replace you with those University or another if you grow food you know you don't grow the same way and you have to you have to give that Lana break retail let you know I'm saying say neighbors your whole life but skate anywhere but you do have to don't sell your mother's house rent it to your cousin but don't don't sell your mother that piece of land was worked for the blood tutorial the saw it mean something and it should and and for Working Class People especially it keeps your neighborhood in communities more like the ones that made you be a good human being so I think that there's something I moved to the other side of a move to the suburbs most people are most people marry somebody they knew you know I'm saying my thing is make the best of it don't let it keep becoming the worst a man a mr. John my wife and I are barber shops people don't know we own these things, Shay wash and groom shops we have one at State Farm Arena Atlanta Hawks play at flagship store on Edgewood Avenue Edgewood Avenue was once an Auburn Avenue once the centers of black Atlanta in terms of Commerce in retail and money Atlanta life insurance are you guys Google something this big time s*** you know this isn't the old Narrative of we've never had nothing cuz that's not the truth still is on this street used to be owned by African-Americans a storefront in there their children after these people. Also the buildings off and sold it for cheap and I know this because many mr. John who has a grocery store their stopped me one day he said you know Michael after we're gone in this neighborhood fine everything's different they're going to come along and say that white people stole this from us he said it's not true he say the children of the people that were here left and they never came back cuz they didn't think with their parents bill was good enough to kill me because that is not just black people us Americans. We have gotten to a point where we are unappreciative we are entitled and we don't think what happened before us was good enough so we don't treasure it we honor it we don't we invest in it that could be a farm in Milledgeville that could be a house in Adamsville but we have to do a better job of appreciating ourselves creating our community and then preciate not Greater Community and you have to re-enter you have to re-enter if I that you have to be a part of whatever gentrification happens to make sure that your steak is still there and then what you care about for memorials until perspective it represented their my uncle my uncle John black and it was a huge influence died and had a five-car garage where we're needed transmissions and stuff and I beg my aunt to sell it please I don't want you I know they're going to come the Beltline is coming out Scoop please sell it to me I didn't want my uncle's building you know for to go to strangers and become you know an apartment complex or something and I walked in your building I seen your building I said wow I know what I'm going to do with it now I've had it for like 3 years now it's just I just had it to do what you would like depressive I was building my office is right and I'll figure out a way to make a lot of money off of it I mean I've already made a lot of money with you and leaving me to buy it but it's important to me that has his neighborhood turn it's a hipster land cuz it's definitely get used to be black if I just wanted to make sure that there's still some chocolate working class in there and sometimes you're going to go buy coffee and there's going to be a muscle car and I'll figure out a way to make a lot of money off of it I mean I've already made a lot of money with you and leaving me to buy it but it's important to me that this is neighborhood turn it's a hipster land cuz it's definitely get used to be black if I just wanted to make sure that they're still some chocolate working class in there and sometimes you're going to go buy coffee and there's going to be a muscle car and lots of marijuana smoke blowing out of it so they'll know that you know my uncle's nephew still in town</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> sound gaming jobs and identities needed for extremely happy that I'm crazy but I'm sure if some of them were trouble but for a lot of them they finally had a sense of purpose they just been taken into this place as family so they made Utah He's they basically made a town all the media portrayals of Enlightenment and all of funeral people talk about mystical experience he had an India it's always that part of the world that emphasizes spirituality and the idea that the Hindu religion is a is a more ancient more complex spiritual religion as a figure is the white jesus figure out why people creature that has enormous power right it isn't same for anyone to believe in a deity that doesn't look like them right but in the black community we're just in love with Renaissance paintings and Jesus as wide as f*** all right so we have the same infatuation that you're weird hippie Aunt has with Indian men with long beards and their mysticism we have that you just help me understand where he creates a fake religion and convinces you know white middle-class people to follow Jesus Jesus of motherfuker like a man imma get me a shirt that says white people once a walk and and what I mean by that is Western Civilization it is this is the latest phase like many empires and civilizations there was a time where Mali in Africa and Kim and have her with the biggest nations in colonizers on Earth later Persia biggest had systems in right now the West has just for the last thousand years or so has been kicking and dominating ass a lot of what we see on the news between the west and what we call the Middle East now what was once in the western purse right Western Asia white jesus Springs out of that and kind of goes everywhere and colonize is everything so you know the church pops up with candy for kids Bibles for you and by the way we're going to be gone awhile but we going to leave this guy here on the wall so you know what the ideal but God son look like so God Son looks like a Doobie Brother consultas God God looks like Jim Morrison yeah it was really Jesus were probably at a guy with dark hair and curly. Curly hair and you know it and brown eyes that was saying s*** that the government in the church didn't like so they knocked in the f*** off why do you think that each race looks for someone of another race to be their advisor because I don't think people trusted Divinity in themselves you know I think I think that once you understand that as human beings we really only look different because of subtle differences and atmosphere and change and you know who you mix but I think that all those books that are moms paid Oprah took sellas of self-help and inward-looking Reverend Ike had told my grandmother generation that in the seventies you know what I mean and I think that was scared to turn off the lights in at some point see something divine within ourselves because once you do that that requires you act differently and I think that people need to be told what to do not that they actually need if they want to be instructed you know versus knowing org going on a gut feeling or experiment and getting something wrong you know my grandfather was one of the most kind moral men I've ever met he was always gentle chill he grew up in between 14 and 54 when I was born and he had experiences that he had learned to regret and he had to help with that become something that by the time I was a child he was Raising me my grandfather was divided in my eyes almost really not because he was perfect because he was genuinely good and moral but as a 14 year old boy who have grown up fatherless who dropped out of school in the third grade and who at who understood that I must protect my mother's and sister's he refused to people that got anyone even adult to the point of putting a bullet in you know what I mean so I think that a lot of times we're afraid to see that Divinity ourselves also because then you have to the darkness and you have to deal with that and it's easier to get instructed by someone else and it's easier to see the evil is outside to it's easier to see that is something that I can't control it just happens versus compliant I'm complicit in it and it's also a consequence of being one of the things that bothers me the most when people talk about people to commit crimes or think about people that commit crimes so much of who a person is a consequence of things that had nothing to do with them absolutely they could have been born and it neighborhood horrible parents been abused sexually and physically and and by the time you get to them that broke their life is already a message that shambles wrote and for you to try to think that they are going to look at life and just figure it out with no assistance whatsoever. It's crazy. We haven't put more of an emphasis in finding the spots that are the ghettos in the terrible neighborhoods in this country and figuring out a way to build them up at make it even we know right away we know unequivocally where jobs and commerce are present and Economic Opportunity and prosperity occur just a dramatic reduction in Lemonade Stand game by yet we do not put resources into building institutions that will create algebra Norris or work on a soft skill so the kids can be working out around production houses Studios we put that money into prisons use prison labor to undercut things like call centers and things like that that jobs that mean that factories may need and what we are doing a disservice by doing it and I always say we because we looked at leaders and blame them when so many times we allow it you know we allow this to happen by not paying attention and not voting will allow it to happen by not raising my voice even though we know someone in prison and saying this is wrong you know the last people I don't believe just for the record I don't believe in the abrahamic religions I'm not into but the books I read that are amazing graphic novels I can treat him like a like a graphic novel so it's right and when you look at the people who Christ died with writing it was using he was up there with these the last person he say before he got hot in here was a thief was a confessed deep with him and you know we going to go on this together that's that's an amazing thing so is your savior or Messiah you need to be thinking about who he spent this time you know he was with liars and thieves who's in the streets used to people who likes to be prostitutes and I think that if we start to turn our attention to those places and we put our intentions and good there we do produce on the out on the other side better but as long as we look at religion is something that makes us holy makes us clean watch this about sins and and we become Pious in that I think religion with something something that's forever kind of harmful it help to create that and I think that that that believe in that some people are good something something that's forever kind of harmful it helped to create that and I think that that that believe in that some people are good and evil doesn't allow us to say what what could we do to fix those ghettos to fix those depressed area codes for every ghetto where I'm from every ghetto that's in a city in the South I can show you a mountainous region with a trailer park that's just as bad for sure and nose and nose and nose kisses are a life better than Oxycontin addiction and intermontane to 100%</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and acting like they are so I think it was a little bit of that but I think at one point in time it was a little that a lot of rappers would look at guys like Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash and old-school gangster country guys Waylon Jennings Willie Nelson Johnny Cash Allman Brothers Midnight Rider and you know whipping post that's radically different then you just singing about your forwarding and you know in drafting on Saturday every day I smoked a joint woke up and laughed and listen to that record like every single day I just wanted you guys to know it didn't bother me any my wife just told me to shut up we went shooting a lot more and we play Allman Brothers Whipping Post every morning because I had to remind myself that this is normal that you're being dumb like this publicly because you were disagreeing with the system that people have agreed to that you don't agree to and it's okay not to agree so Holland Brothers really got me through that segment is stop me from punching a lot of boojwazi black people in the face you're a proponent of your your right to carry a gun of all our rights and amendments but in particular you on the 1st and 2nd Amendment rights matter to me as an African-American as an end as an American first foremost as an African-American I've only been free 55 years our parents were born in apartheid and as an American we are we are country that broke off from what we felt like the tyranny of a monarchy and we did that because farmers and guns there to wage guerrilla warfare against at that time when the largest armies and navies in the world so I ordered by continuing to be in the spirit of the host farmers in the continuance of Crispus Attucks the first person to die in American Revolution was a black man your soap for me I would dishonor those Patriots who started this country and Crispus Attucks I would dishonor the lineage is an African-American whose only 55 years in the Freedom by giving government my contact I shot something I believe in government is people part of the problem with giving government anyting is that they're just people they're not something special Flawless absolute give people power over you in this I mean this is not saying we should stockpile guns and point them at the government but if people have guns it's way harder to just take over sensible to ask that s*** happens all the time and other countries that does happen absolutely occupied I think what we need more of is people like you that are that are a reasonable very educated in the matter of your particular person who comes from a place where they don't expect that argument come from you always think you know you think about Democratic people overwhelmingly being appreciated by the black community and you always associate them with being anti-gun yeah that's a common thing steps out and says no no I think it's a disservice to take this right away absolutely I didn't support it and fight for it I've been I've been an African American 40 40 something years now right I have known Democrats primarily my entire life I'm from the south in particular Southeast Alabama Georgia Florida I have never known a black male Democrat that was working class and did not honor weapon not that so I'm going to follow examples of my grandfather's I'm not going to listen to Arctic in their rhetoric about the arm in the population agree that we would all love it if we never needed guns I rather not needed and be prepared to have it but this isn't normal in my part of the country as not having straws and being able to smoke in public in places like La is it it just it's not that big of a deal do you know you you know in my in my mind say household should have five contrite you shower a revolver a semi-automatic perfume your wife carrying out in public a shotgun a great all-around going to have whether it's burglars or should have Rifleman to your defense against tyranny or just the f*** off on Sundays and show your homeboys and stick their butt what's what you should not do is give up your right to own yeah or using my people that's the thing about using them on people is that it's so rare but so horrific and so so common for something that's so horrific and everybody's against it but I don't I don't understand how you would ever by taking guns I mean you have to take all the guns away to stop that from happening how are you going to do and how you do that of course not the right regular people should probably not do that he's like how you going to get those guns in the criminals you're not you're not going to I'm shooting about start taking my 11 year old girl Michael shooting because I want them to know what they do if they see a gun so we've already went through what do you do if you're somewhere you see it. How do you how do you get out of that situation get all the kids out of that situation and I don't know all that comes with it taught how to shoot a rifle right because they hate it for a reason. to have big programs in public schools to make sure that children new firearm safety so my mother school and other schools benefited from that I don't care if it was just that sheet of paper that told you gun safety before you went in the rain that was just a piece of propaganda they did that was better for the overall public so I tend to say As Americans we've gotten away from stuff like trades and school we've gotten away from different options beside funneling are kids in the college that we've also gotten away from basic training such as balancing the checkbook basic home economics and how do you make lasagna and stuff like gun gun paint gun shooting and archery I think that if those things return to public school you get a safe for more confident student body you get a reduction on things like bullying and b******* you get an increase on his self Propel interested children and you start to me to grow its collars that Excel you really how is it going to stop bullying just by knowing that more kids know how to use guns I think that if those things return to public school you get a safer more confident student body you get a reduction on things like bullying and b******* you get an increase on it self Propel entrance of children and you start to me to grow its collars that Excel you really how is it going to stop bullying just by knowing that more kids know how to use guns.</div>

But they also make examples out of the popular yeah I just found out what the what the monkey on the stick segment with was apparently monkeys and hitting her wow out so farmers will kill a monkey and put his head on the six other markets in Ohio this is dangerous to do right so essentially famous people need me you Luther Campbell when he Brews you know Rodney Dangerfield Andrew Dice Clay Richard Pryor anywhere become is something to symbolize what will happen if you dare step out of line or social order so you your head being on a stick is is less about actually charging you for crimes and more about keeping the wrestler public and fearsome mention a lot of times we don't want to say that but it really is like to Live Crew come up right there in the yard and thank God Luke fault I can remember Channel 2 or 5 ABC or CBS in they were there getting off the plane in my town I'm a kid watching this one up 12 13 years old and the news reporters just went TMZ Style just put it in their face and I can remember brother Marquis just pulling up a Playboy magazine United States Constitution when it in matters of freedom of speech I got a chance to see it fought for and exercised right there before me is I was learning about an interesting that really what we're concerned with two is visuals not concerned with what people write down what we're concerned with what people say but we're not like you could write that in a book and no one will you could write his lyrics in a book and no one will get mad at that book something about them singing it and people singing along to it. Like this is that we got it. Nations falling apart we have stopped songs vibrations humming you know what meditation your hump you know that Rhythm changes things you do and it opens your mind cleared you you know what I mean. You know had it not been for an artist like Lil Kim would you have feminism in the way you have now would you have women gladly celebrating their sexuality and bodies if it wasn't for her she never gets the credit time I think she doesn't get women know that it became safe for them to be sexually aggressive in free because of her the women that you know we're coming of agent in our time but I don't think in retrospect cuz wraps young you know 45 46 years old I don't think that I just think it's getting to the point where we appreciate what we do what we've accomplished so little Kim is going to become more celebrated as the years go on her Trina you know Kaya Choice boss like so many hip-hop Inakaya Joyce boss like so many hip-hop has been a very fair game the women a very long time you know but whether people want to know it or not you know you have you've always had to call and response records and Hip-Hop I get on the baddest mother f***** in the world and then the girl pops up behind you now motherfuker around forever so they always promoted equality because it made money and makes sense and women</div>

really took you on a track or will you want to strip it was a street track that they had right there on Woodward so they put up the blocks and you take off Jake's beautiful but they're not they're not that great at corner and that's a still a giant car big are ya Mustang and Camaro going to do better in the corner for sure remind you more than any of those other cars though of those 1970 cars in a really has that that shape is more iconic if you look at a 1969 Camaro 2019 Camaro you like I don't see it that's not the same thing but Challenger really does look like that old car has killed it I mean passion project absolutely nailed it yeah I know they did they made a great-looking modern muscle-car the other ones are just great looking cars mean they they are still muscle cars but they don't really think you don't really think about the old days when you see him do you guys make some f****** great builds to you know you guys have done some really sweet custom builds like you were telling me outside that the longest you do a bill for is 25 days we've got it down about 25 from 32-inch when we started so when you see a car on the show if it's a single episode of the day we built that car in the 25 26 days that's crazy start to finish paint interior 7 years now and 130 of them that you know we just got a process in in the crew that I have at the shop now is unbelievably phenomenal 25 days we're done that's insane but what about suspension or you know Art Morrison chassis or something like that I just take some planning so literally what we do is we build the car three times is that how we're going to build it and what kind of parts were going to use what kind of suspension wheels motor where we put all that down on paper and then if it works mathematically for the project we want to do then I go find the car they want to find the car we ordered every single part and we don't start that car until every single thing that was on that list is in house has been checked and we're ready to go the builders I've seen take 7 months 9 months a year it's just a shot for set up differently and maybe one or two guys or maybe they've got kind of assembly programs going on or what have you but we get in there like you'll love our building right now we're gonna 77 International Scout and started with a really nice one or and white striped plaid interior I mean the whole ball of wax whack the the chassis. 400 put in a full Chris Alston Chassis Works chassis the only two wheel drive and it's all 2018 Hellcat 8-speed automatic Jesus in it and slammed on the ground but it still removal top and what is a great California truck I can guarantee you that they're doing that with one of the I think it's a Superbird I'm one of those one of those iconic Mopars from the late 60s early 70s they're doing full Hellcat chassis in the whole deal with that not really that these cars with horsepower figures Everybody Was Kung in production yet you had the Resurgence of Shelby are there it is there's Jonathan towards that thing that's good looking that is like literally like trying to have a block like a city block on Wheels they take around a corner with a long neck yeah for sure I have not but yeah yeah I'd like to have a tricked-out won Gas Monkey on it with bigger monkey on the tail somewhere yeah for sure now when you do the shows and you bargain people down and then they watched the show to people ever get pissed a few and they were just excited you know that we were going to be doing something with the car and and there's always that element of of the sentiment to let you know it was their dad's or was their mom's or grandma's or whatever they want to see it go to a good home so you got several different kind of people they know you're wanting you to not do anything or if you're going to fix it up we want to see it you know all kinds of things like that but nowadays it's it's a little more harder for me to get a decent deal because people see what you sell them for after you fix them up then they get a little upset they can but I mean they don't understand them out of work and time and money that we put into it most of the cars that were building on the show now we're putting it Elite 200 Grandin and sometimes as much as 300 a good plan executed what must be like a thing now because the show that people want to get a gas monkey Bill car they do but how would I say this diplomatically it weren't for employees vendors and customers business would be great we don't do a lot for the customer until we build it for ourselves and then we sell it to them but as far as coming in off the street we just like building what we want to build holding our skills and then we find a buyer every once in awhile have guy come in and go look I can this is what I want but I can I won't call you I won't come in there with a new steering wheel all you know that's why I A lot of times cars do take 7 months or a year until it still a business decision I'm trying to build it to where I think it's going to do the most of the most money at the end of the day and stay true with what's going on as far as that particular car and what's going on in the marketplace and technology and what have you and we do get a lot of calls where people come and go okay I want that exact same thing sometimes if you do buy cars and then just sell them without doing anything to it right yeah that's what we call RB story so you know will have them bring it in maybe just puts whatever but usually it's just clean it up get it running sell somebody else to dream because not everybody can afford a fully-built car ride and where they want to do it themselves so we get him a good project I don't think people realize how much money is involved in a fully-built car</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> all daughters and I have friends that are women and I have a lot of friends or women in the world stand-up comedy and I often time see misogynist s*** online that shocks me and wanting things that shocked me was there's a guy that I follow and we talked about how his wife it was a thread on Twitter well-thought-out very smart guys a lawyer and I was talking about how his wife gas tank so weak take every time he gets his wife's car she's always out of gas like what the fuc why do I have to get gas for you and then she explained she doesn't get gas because she gets harassed and it creeps are out and about that the messages he was getting from men calling him a cock wine making of course it was going to go there and he told me direct messages you know saying all kinds of crazy s*** to him because they not only are they in denial that this could be a situation where their mother was in or their wife or their daughter maybe they don't have a daughter maybe they have a bad relationship with her mother maybe they just they had so many bet you know if a guy has had so many bad interactions with women and he's not very smart and he's just decided that women are evil and you see anything that's hey guys maybe we should look at it in terms of like how the woman looks at it like that's real those guys are real and they're out there I was at a gas station the other night at 2 in the morning I was coming home from the comic store and pulled into the gas station and there was he's gotten that bulletproof thing with his thick glass debit card and I pull in I get out of my car and I hear yelling and I hear him going hate black you're not a f****** bank teller a right because you taking his job so seriously make $10 an hour and the guy says something is no money on the card so f*** you there's $800 on this car and it's friend from the car saying something and I am nervous okay I mean yes to in the morning I'm nervous and I'm like f*** and I'm like what if this guy turns any of this aggression on me what if he decided he's a f****** a****** and he's probably drunk or high or something Tupac in the morning and it's him and there's another guy in the car and I'm so nervous and get the f*** out of here you know don't run out of gas but just get the f*** out of here get gas tomorrow during the daylight and I'm a man and I'm looking at these two guys and I'm saying okay if some s*** goes down if these guys don't have a weapon or some s*** goes down I'm going to beat the f*** are these two guys they look like they don't exercise but they're aggressive they're angry or stupid my god dammit all my Spidey senses are going to get out of here go get out of here and like an a****** I decide to stay and pump my gas but when these guys were yelling at each other I literally went around the front of the car instead of the this back way because there's a shorter path for me being exposed their view some hiding behind my truck while filling my tank and I'm a man Chili's two guys right I honestly thought where the story was going to go is that you were going to go over and tell them that I was thinking but I didn't want to get shot and think you would have did some people die I know now I'm saying certainly way less worried than a woman if I was a woman and I pulled up and I heard that guy f*** you make $10 an hour bro f****** relax and get the f*** out here I was on fumes though raising two daughters made you so much more aware of this stuff in the past I would have met you and only thought of you as a 34 year-old person now I look at everyone as a baby that's how I process things and it made me way more compassionate way more understanding and way more patient with people because I now I say okay when I meet this a****** at the gas station to the morning that's berating that guy will why is he will because probably his dad the f****** piece of s*** his life probably sucks he probably dumb put on drugs into his young he doesn't have any smart friends they don't have any money to get gas to the morning making poor Life Choices there's a lot wrong here he doesn't have any discipline his life he's never gone through any sort of trials and tribulations that taught him about things isn't just didn't receive life lessons probably didn't get a good education here we are and I might have to kick this guy's ass cuz it's 2 in the morning and he's threatening he's loud and he's probably going to be allowed at other people look at him the wrong way he's just f****** toxically stupid be loud at other people look at him the wrong way he's just f****** toxically stupid but he was a baby he was a baby on point time so I don't want to go over there I don't want to I don't want to create violence I'm thinking he's just going to driveway and eventually he did and that poor guy who probably is probably making just a little bit more than $10 an hour it's stuck in this f****** cubicle is little glass box with his a****** berating him at 2 in the morning</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> who's experienced Kathy Griffin has experienced that public shaming has been publicly shamed herself in the most horrific way has a base of a the live underground and now she's saying shame him name him and docks it I don't understand that more more committed to their side more committed to their team the only way you're going to get any support if you have been attacked and isolate not alone is the deep deep into the team again like how do you get back deep as a team again you got to be rabid you know and that's part of it it's it's a natural reaction that people have to sort of signal to everyone else on the team they're all in their fully committed their even care about their f****** career I'm an activist that kind of s*** happens and it's it's people that want love that's what a lot of it is they do recognize there's something wrong that they are reacting to a real thing the reason the overwhelming reason the motivation for this kind of overzealous reaction is often the signaling thing so they want to let everybody know, they on the f****** team man you know in Poland or in hungry right now 16 year old kid who maybe have no idea what that had signifies well I mean people like one of the sort of wisdom of Criminal Justice Reform right is it which I believe in is that we shouldn't try kids as adults and we should forgive we should have greater generosity and mercy forgiveness for the crimes of a child even if they've committed them those same people are the ones saying document shame him generally politically well you're seeing that now and this is again there's never been a dachshund before there's no doxxing right how long is doxy been around a decade let's go crazy and say the first dachshund was 20 years ago that's a blip right that's so recent so this is not a the people really had to balance out in their mind when to do and what not to do it they just do it people have no idea what that looks like you've experienced it or watch someone you know experienced it it's it's like it's like an abstraction cuz he's a little puppets it's it's very it's piss poor thinking and it's everywhere and everyone wants to feel like not being a part of one of the tribes is it extremely lonely position and you get cold all the bad names people want you to be a part of their tribe and people don't want to be called bad names and they want to feel like there any name group emotionally I totally got that when you got a president that's so polarizing and you have an opposition to him that's so there's so much momentum in opposing him and I think this is a giant wedge in between these two sides and then you have that hat and that hat that kid wasn't wearing that had a guaranteed like 20% less hate it would be bang his drums get the f*** out of the way I saw that like come on you can expect what you can't just beat your drum in the kids face like inches from the kids face pretty amazing the restraint this kid had to just smile and the idea that you're going to judge this kid millions and millions and millions of people going over this right now that kid woke up that morning he had no f****** idea he was a kid in a cult okay then a Catholic cult school and he's going weird things to March for Life for people trying to kill babies going to stop me from killing babies right to go there and is it is black Israelites calling them the fagets and there's these all these people calling him names and and then all the sudden guys beat the drum in front of his face and we're supposed to which was a DOCSIS kid now cuz he smirked that's that's a crazy impossible lack of empathy it's impossible to defend unless you hate boys but you hate all boys cuz boys are dumb like 16 year old boys are almost universally dumped they all they all grow up to be men some of those men will be your best friend so when those men will be amazing some of those men would be so happy to see me see me to give him a big hug okay that's me I was a stupid f****** sixteen-year-old everybody it's not good for society to take this trend and run with it and in this what is that what people do now you know you doc sixteen-year-old turbocharged has the right like that I think people are not quite understanding that Dynamic if you are someone who you know is frustrated with Trump and his maybe moving to the middle and you know imagine that person it's easy to imagine then you see this and you're like those people being in charge of me visceral reaction I just I don't think they're understanding but like implications of what they're doing I don't think they understand they do maybe they did a person to the other side the person that sees the far-right and sees repulsive racism and bigotry Build That Wall f*** these Mexicans f*** those little kids that you should have known better they're all illegals that kind of person that pushes people towards progressivism APUSH his people towards much more liberal and socialist ideology like f*** that gross nest in the same thing could be said for some this is a real poster that antifa is sending that they were putting on a wall on walls and and fence post initiate in the Pacific Northwest and it's actually kind of hilarious cuz it's so stupid I'm going to put it up on the screen but it it says alright and it's like telling people to not date white people propagation lights is propagation of hatred of Russian homophobia sexism transphobia racism in ableism so are we supposed to sterilize older people are finding it and posting it online someone sent it to me right a lot better than most people do you can't just say go punch people when razor eyes one says have you seen a more punchable face that is so f****** dangerous because you're almost saying go punch this kid I saw someone else I accidentally favorite something I didn't mean to favorite favorite even read comments but somebody pointed out that I favored a really Preposterous tweet honest it said the reply from the school was pathetic and impotent name these Kittle that's Kathy Griffin here's the one that said this guy said God damn it I can't find it it was basically saying no need to hear it is a face like that never changes this image will Define his life no one made no one need ever forgive him the blue checkmark by their name no one need ever forgive him a face like that that is virtual signaling in the most toxic form so so dangerous little nervous I'd like to see him with a samurai sword pose a good over two years ago and it's supposedly is like a troll I would say that if I was a person who's like far right CIA psyops type s*** this would be worth so Through the Looking-Glass hear that post that I just read you that's a real post about this guy is unredeemable know any never forgive him that's just as bad in my opinion is that supposed to say don't date white people it's all crazy the basic basic virtues right that used to be normal right leg stability right civility has now become for some people a code word for like complicity with Nazism like if your if your sibling you believe in Civility and you believe in you know treating people decently and with giving them the benefit of the doubt like that that word itself has become a code or signal in a negative way and p**** like I doubt even saying it I don't know you know I I just these basic virtues seem to have been like swept away and I don't know when they when they got lost in the epoxy was Trump I think the chance of Build That Wall it's not an accent concentrates on and it's not just that it's there in a political battle right now because if they get him to back down off the wall then you know he looks like a loser when 20/20 comes around he looks less powerful those people there's that for sure but there's also this he's so egregious like everything he's so he saw that guy build it back because he's broken something or he's signifying the fact that it was broken one or the other I think that he was both a symptom of something that was broken and we didn't recognize and now he's further catalyzed that Brokenness well I think both sides have to recognize that the other side has some points that's one thing and then I think we also have to treat ourselves like we're all family and we're on a big team cuz that's what really are if we really are the United States of American I mean what what is it what is a country if anything we're supposed A-Team the idea that were separated and we're two teams in this one team the real differences in terms of like who gets elected like how it's going to affect your life involved business involves some social policies involve some things but the way we interact with each other on a day-to-day doesn't involve that all that has to be fixed first the way we think about each other on a day-to-day basis that used to be a time where you could have a conservative Fran and you could be a liberal and you could be a f****** long-haired hippie guy and he in you are a good hardworking person who didn't let their Longo crazy your next-door neighbor who is like a Goldwater Republican we talked to you and you would go how's it going Mike what's going on with this case and this and that and you know a professor could live right next to a cop and they would be friends and one would be conservative and one would be liberal and it would make fun of each other a little bit and read each other a little bit and that would be the end of it that would be it wouldn't be this this Civil War that were experiencing right now right now just hopefully it stays that way but it's it's it's confusing is confusing cuz there's a lack of a frustrating lack of empathy that when I look at human beings and when I look at people that aren't seeing what everyone else is staying or they're not seeing things objectively and there are rational and overly emotional I always assume there's something else the running from I always assumed when I see someone the lashing out and insulting everyone around them people that aren't seeing what everyone else is saying we're not seeing things objectively and their irrational and overly emotional I always assume there's something else the running from I always assumed when I see someone the lashing out and insulting everyone around them assume it's not the people round it's something internal there's something something maybe some existential angst they're fighting against some realization of the futility of Life whatever the f*** it is</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> set of all time there was a an article that I read about they were they were manipulating pleasure as it turned out its I swear I started reading it from a study on rats they do this thing with rats where they provided they figured out a way to give rat orgasms to figure out a way that like jazz up the brain shock them like they they need to do anything to get this area where they can have these orgasms and it would have them up to 2,000 times a day it would just not just all day long and in reading that male and female turn turn away they did it with a gay man while they were doing this this is in the 1970s there's a couple different studies that they did one of them they did with his gay guy where they try to stimulate certain parts of his brain while they were showing him heterosexual p*** and they were trying to convert him into being heterosexual and apparently they had some meager amount of success with this where he engaged in sexual relationships with women and apparently even enjoyed it and they did something to deliberately stimulate a part of his brain that would excite arousal and try to connect that with with heterosexual p*** and made him orgasm made him masturbate to orgasm while they're doing this and showing him straight p*** the idea that they were going to reprogram as mine massively confused about what makes you have an orgasm and one of things that happens is you get you can have gay experiences when you're young if someone does something to you in imprint upon you arousal at a young age with with gay experiences sometimes even heterosexual men will get aroused certain gay images and gay things because of their past because of that like Chris Brown's talk about that is influenced by your environment which is your jeans and you know this is very taboo for some people to discuss even though it's really fastly major taboo areas of exploration and when you start looking at like what makes a person gay or straight whether it's nature or nurture whether it's a combination of those things with it so much just radically gay from the room or whether someone's erratically straight from the womb these these studies where they were trying to they were trying to turn someone with science and they were trying to turn someone straight it's crazy it's very you couldn't do it today that you never be able to do it today I believe it was 71 they did hell yeah it's I'll send it to you crazy it's crazy widely criticized but heavily studied and now the woman they did it to a woman to date these stuck these this woman had a problem with painkillers and so they figured out a way to wire her brain I'd be criticized but heavily studied and now the woman they did it to a woman to date they stuck these this woman had a problem with painkillers and so they figured out a way to wire her brain</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> but that is the real the only saving grace of the concept of white privilege is that we do have to recognize that some people got a really good deal and some people got a really terrible deal but the only reason why white privilege even something to consider is that racism is real then why white privilege is not if the world is Barry Weiss or or Twitter everyday could be totally irrelevant and what we would be concentrating on is you know who's making the best buildings who's making the best music what what what is it with the contributions to culture we wouldn't care about if they were coming from Asian people or West Indian people we wouldn't care you're no privilege of all kinds that's useful it's actually useful to think about that what is not useful is to say because you were XYZ thing therefore you're out there for you have no stake and therefore in fact you have sort of less of a claim on truth and morality gentleman who she didn't do her research instead of arguing the idea or discussing these ideas and she said because of your white privilege is blinding you and he was like he gave her rope to you know to me like as a person does Jiu-Jitsu he liked it gave her room he gave her a room and she went right into the choke she is sank the choking herself she explains it even further he said I hate to break it to you but I'm black she must have just felt her whole life all of her intellectual credibility just go f****** blush flushed down the toilet like oh my God you just got exposed and this is what people love about Preposterous thinking Preposterous thinking if it's given enough time it's eventually going to slam into a wall and that's what we saw we saw a truck with a f****** brick on the accelerator just slam right into the wall because she thought she had a path that you couldn't stop and this is the it's like if you're playing chess but you have won super powerful moved that it works it's not like a rock or a queen no that's no rules I just kidding I just did that's what she did she had the super powerful thing and it didn't work and it didn't work because this guy was a part of the very protected class that she was part of and she tried her a shortcut to just missing people of who he is he had the Checkmate haha and it the whole world went haha because we've all seen that but if you can't say anything if I was having this discussion with her and she said because of your white privilege I got to say okay unpack that I f****** hate that word unpack I hate it cuz it's always brought it's always brought out by people who really aren't unpacking s*** that is explaining to you how their idea Trump's your ideology and it's almost always like this Preposterous way of describing things let me unpack that for you oh f*** you don't Target me the way they would Target a black person that's a hundred percent real people and I don't think that's the real problem is not white privilege a real problem is racist actual racists that's the real problem and if there was no racist that white privilege wouldn't be a thing it's only a thing because of racist and it's only a thing with racist without racist doesn't exist the problem with African-Americans or or Asians like this is a weird one right like the Harvard thing we're Asians are denied entry into Harvard with the same standards that white people like it because of racism because they're good because they study so hard and they do it in the language Wesley Yang on this he's a really interesting writer about this to book a book of essays called I think it's actually called The Souls of yellow folk this year I'm connected by the the work ethic that this in these these families and the humbleness and the destructor the way it was almost expected that you never brag and that you work harder than anybody and I had a friend who was he was on the u.s. Taekwondo team to to compete in the Olympic Games he was working on a school work he was going through his residency so he's probably working on school work 10 to 12 hours in between classes he would put his book bag on dude Phyllis bookbag up with with books and run the stairs at the University up and down and then he would come to the gym at night and train and then you would travel compete with the world team and all the all the meat while he was in college he was it was school I mean have one tenth of that works at work ethic it was it was impossible to ignore and he was so spread then and so tired all the time but he kept working and he would talk about his culture and he would talk about his family and what is it was that expected of him like he's a man in my house like that you just f****** did it like you don't you just not there's not like how I feel tired today f*** you get up go to work and but that attitude as allowed so many Asian people that discipline and and and just this culture of performance and of achievement where it's so it's so cherished that is allowed so many Asian people to excel in in Academia and the fact that Harvard somehow or another steps in and says we're going to get more difficult for you because you work so hard that is so crazy and so weird it's so weird that they as this I mean if you think about if you think about institutions of Higher Learning Hobbit is the first if you think about institutions of Higher Learning Harvard is the first one you think about number one number one I called graduate from Harvard Done Right Harvard and two of them so blinded they will be racist against the best performance because they're performing to Wellness a disproportionate number of them in the University</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I would not show after mass shootings here you know like I was in Pittsburgh like right after and I was because I knew the rabbi who was doing some of the cleanup and because of religious reasons and and but like it was really crazy to me hello down it wasn't like you couldn't take it I was there with a photographer and you couldn't take any pictures at all of anything you do and there's a real lockdown on showing people cuz you don't want to terrify people but I've wondered would it prick people's Consciousness about the reality of what gun violence looks like you know like the Carnage like the people that I know that saw it said it looks like a war zone and would that change public policy and would that be a positive thing or would we just become numb to it like we become numb to everything else I don't know there's a very good question I'd never in favor of suppressing information even horrific information I was a big critic of that during the Bush Administration when they passed laws on whether or not you're allowed to show actual coffins just coffins you weren't allowed to show coffins being flown back I felt like that that's a disgrace that's it I mean you should if you if we're going to consider whether or not we want or we should be able to understand the real consequences and one of the best ways is to not just get information in terms of text text is very difficult for you to conceptualize when you would seeing American flags covering coffins and you seen hundreds of them and you realize he's of your neighbors these are your neighbors children this is this is people that you you know and they're dying over there and you can't really eat it you can't wrap your head around why they're doing it and it whether or not it's right whether or not we should have been there and then whether or not they're actually work weapons of mass destruction Iraq whether or not we're in the business of nation-building whether or not Ron Paul is right or whether or not other people write with who's right the only way we're really going to get a clear picture is to see a picture to have an actual picture that's why I thought about this a lot because the shooting happens then it becomes a #then it becomes a t-shirt but it becomes of memorial memorial concert I mean it's like actually sickening like the the choreography of it and I think what's lost is what it looks like and it's Rabbi in Pittsburgh who is really amazing describe to me what he saw and I'll never forget just a description of what he told me and I wondered I wondered a lot in the wake of that and I'll think about it with the next shooting happens with any difference at all waking people up with f***** up as you said when the next shooting happened to those guns who are not only mentally unwell sometimes they're just evil they want to kill people and they want to be famous I mean a million reasons but the fact that we are living in a culture that seems to worship people's freedom to own those weapons more than human life seems crazy to me it really does the argument against that would be this look like the real crazies believe that these things are happening and they're happening because of the fact the government wants to take away our guns this is the real crazy they are making these people do these things that the worst worst aspects of our society whatever you know fill in the blank with whatever left-wing conspiracy that you know whatever person whatever Boogeyman people that they are somehow or another either using it like Manchurian Candidate type influence what are the factor doing they're getting people to do this and then even creating false flag for these things happen. So they can take away guns this is the I mean that there are these false flag events that they're designing to get your guns that people are training people go out and kill a bunch of people so they can take away your guns so it makes them more rabid about their support of the Second Amendment and they they they feel like they're being attacked on all sides Syfy call Joe Rogan questions everything and one of things that we went into was why people believe in Chemtrails why people believe that the heat of jet engines which causes these artificial clouds when it interacts with condensation the atmosphere increased you know how to create artificial Cloud CT contrails some people believe that these are that someone's spraying something and that this weather control from these commercial jets that they're you know somehow that is his gigantic conspiracy of all these people involved and this is in some way either doing weather control or the controlling us or mind control depends on who you ask and I remember those we were kids yeah I don't intend it starts fueling this paranoid idea that there's his program going on and then there are real programs that the government is considering to combat global warming where they talk about spending reflective particles in the atmosphere different why do people believe conspiracy theories what is it in the nature of certain people that I'm just so fascinated by it when you see something like the most horrific ones like Sandy Hook Sandy Hook false flag what would be the motivation for someone saying that what would be the motivation the only thing I can most plausible I guess would be capturing an audience like getting people to believe in you is some sear behind the veil that are projecting this in terms of it in the media deeply chaotic and seems to lack a logic and people are desperate for a system of understanding the world and conspiracy theories often seem to like offer a very very actually like an incredibly simplistic explanation which is there's this Secrets it like it is always a secret thing but the plan that the public doesn't know about General music no one really that the wheel the real thing is that I mean haven't we learned that from the Trump presidency right like institutions are just made up of people like they can fall apart if the people that take them over are irresponsible crazy venal narcissistic everything that were saying in the Trump Administration I think like if it's if it's just people people can also change it not like there's a secret hand that we need to get to just elect better people rational cuz if it seems like if you if you read Steven pinker's work and people that study violence and endanger and Society over the course of history that we're certainly on an upward Trend even though violence and in fill in the blank currently on an upward Trend even though all the aspects or culture today in society in crime and violence and in fill in the blank, but there's more understanding is more awareness of that is safer safer world today than was a hundred two hundred years ago in terms of your own existence</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> they believe and what they believe some of them is extremely disturbing especially when it comes to Jews so I write this column and I'm like Hillary for it by the left one of the leaders of the women's March this woman Bob Bland wrote this letter to the New York Times where she calls me it was amazing I want signed what it was oh she calls me an apologist for the status quo racist ideology and the white nationalist patriarchy time is a man who called Judaism who calls Jews termites to close Judaism about a religion who says that we should burn in oven by the way is a misogynist homophobe also the leaders of the women's March or associating with this guy and had the Nation of Islam security protecting them I mean this is like the most sort of retrograde hate group and yet for calling them out I was called all of these things think that part of it is the fact that in intersectional left-wing politics Jews have been whitewashed Jews are viewed as sort of the white privileged power and part of the white patriarchy unless they genuflecting say actually know we you know we abhor our privilege and all of the other things that you're supposed to say and there's something white half of the Jews in the state of Israel for example are Arab and from Arab countries that they were kicked out of a 1948 I mean the idea that Jews are white is this Canard although I'm an Ashkenazi Jew I'm my family's from Eastern Europe I have white skin but I don't think of mine I have white privilege but I don't think of myself as white person I think of myself as a Jew first and foremost so it's a complicated identity but I think that it's weird it's whitewash by these people and I think that anti-semitism isn't taken seriously and doesn't read because people perceive Jews as having privilege and Power in this country which largely they do but the fact is that the actual statistics show that more hate crimes were committed against Jews in the past year than any other minority group the FBI is like sounding the alarm every other day in Crown Heights and in other parts of Brooklyn random Jews who look Jewish right to her acidic Jews or just beaten up for being Jewish and get everyone's because they're the imperfect victim will they're also very isolated they're very they'd there they have their own tribe they stick with them they look different they dress different but police officer assaulting someone you know what I'm saying most insulated inside their environment are there Community there's also what I'm going to say is these people that are that you do here saying anti-semitic things they're equating American Jews Living in America with the policies of Israel and what is real doing with Palestine and that somehow or if you're an American Jew even if you're not even political you're somehow another complicit with atrocities are going on between the Jewish people in the palace in it collect any kind of conflict and this makes it reinforces their idea about you being a part of this age group but there's an obsession on the state of Israel like if you were an alien that landed from outer space you would think that the greatest oppressor in the world is this tiny State that's a size of New Jersey will say nothing about the Genet generally about the genocide of uighur Muslims in China they say nothing about any number they're literally being put into concentration camps enormous story and it's like the fact that that's getting note that you don't know about it and then people obsessively talk about the state of Israel is If It's The End by the way state of Israel says lots of things wrong but the idea that it's among the worst human-rights tragedies of our time are you kidding me it's Insanity I don't know the reality of what is going on in Gaza I don't know what has happened with Israel and Palestine I don't know so I'm not going to be the person that talks about this but what I do know but I do know from people that have gone there like a b Martin who came back with some pretty horrific stories I think there's a lot of terrible s*** going on a lot of awful violence and there's a lot of Despair on the side of the Palestinians and I don't I don't know who's to blame for that but many people blame the Israelis they blame the Israelis for treating the Palestinians as if they're in this one area of the world is essentially a large prison has to say about this but I think one of the main problems that we have in the way that Israel is covered is that if you have a camera lens and you're only looking at a tiny piece of land right you're only looking at Israel proper the West Bank and Gaza Israel to some extent is the Goliath in that situation but if you zoom out your camera just a little you see that he's literally surrounded on all sides by genocide or regimes like in the form of Hamas in Gaza who's Charter blames the Jews for fermenting the French revolution's the Russian revolutions both world wars and says that it wants to kill all the Jews that's what that's the government of Gaza right now I spoke to a mother who fled Gaza recently okay and her family's house was just destroyed who was it destroyed by hummus not Israel you never hear those stories so I'm just saying it is a very complicated politics but when you see people obsessively focusing on this one state and the crimes of this one state to the exclusion of actual dictatorships in the world who are killing their own people you have to be suspicious if I have to realize that they are there they're alone out there you also I do wonder what is the motivation for so many people focusing on Jews what is it what do you think it is as a Jewish person what do you think the motivation for this kind of racism it's crimination against Jews and wise tolerated why why can someone like Louis Farrakhan tweet that Jews are termites in his Twitter account stays up girls write a lot of big-time what it is you're asking me why is it still with us it's like the mystery of History like that is that is deep I mean that is something that goes back to the New Testament pay the Jews were blamed in the Book of John and Mark I mean we could go to Matthew for the death of Jesus their role in that story at least According to some of the books is that they convinced the most powerful Empire at the time the Roman Empire in the fall the governor of Judea Pontius Pilate to kill the Son of God that becomes sort of the template for the anti-semitic conspiracy theory there's there's a confusion about what anti-Semitism it's right it's not just hate not just like this hate of a group Reese's perceive themselves punching down against a group with lesser anti-semites perceive themselves as punching up against the secret cabal of Wylie operators who secretly control the levers of power that is a of anti-Semitism and that begins with this group that's able somehow to get the Roman Empire to kill Jesus now the Catholic church disavows this in 1965 which was you know an enormous historical event but that template is still there and you see it play out writing who who let us into the war in Iraq it was the Jews of the Bush Administration you can see it play itself out all over the place and right now in the demonology of current Israel has sort of been made into the Jew among the Nations you're not allowed to say anymore if it like the old school anti-Semitism right like I grew up in a place where there was some country clubs were Jews couldn't go into them that frankly that's not dangerous with dangerous is the kind of anti-Semitism that says you know this one state in the world of all of the almost 200 States that's the one that doesn't have the right to exist that's the one that should be dismantled that's actually dangerous to Jewish lives right now unusual group in that it is both a religion and a tribe yes it makes us very hard to understand in the Contemporary landscape cuz we are not just a religion do not practice Judaism thing the Jews are sort of slotted into and it makes us easier to understand but then arnara sort of national identity or people that are tribalism is left out and that's an essential part of who the Jews are fantastic stand-up comedian he's a rabbit atheist but he's also very Jewish and he has a new hour that he's working on right now they're going to film called Jew which in itself the emphasis is the emphasis is not on what you believe the emphasis is on deeds and almost doesn't matter what you believe it matters that you follow haha which is Jewish lot and matters yordy that matters all these things so it's possible to be a good Jew and not really think about God that much which is very strange I understand the christianaires much like follows the whole deal is worth the whole deal why do you say kind of astonishing the blindness to this because imagine leader of the women's March said something like you know I think Louis CK is the greatest comedian of all time even though I disavow XY and z sing that he did how fast to let person was kicked out of the leadership of the women's March would be like minutes I think there are certain things that get people outraged and other much worse things that do not and I'm fascinated by why that is do you think that if it was a white person that had this opinion about the Jews that it would be more scrutinized I think that it is much easier to fight anti-Semitism when it comes in the form of Richard Spencer yes because then there's liberal consensus right about him do you have a green light to criticize exactly it's much harder when someone like ilhan Omar the new freshman Senator sorry not Senator the new freshman congresswoman from Minnesota who's like this incredible American Dream story comes here at 12 years old Refugee from Somalia wear the hijab is a mother is the first woman of color representing Minnesota like obviously I want to cheer her that's my reaction to her and yet she has tweet that you refused to apologize for where she says Israel has hypnotized the world may Allah awake in the world to the evil doings of Israel I'm sorry that's a classically anti-semitic Trope even if she said it unwittingly and by this point you should have known she should educate herself so it's very it's much harder to crash lies that but it's an untenable position to say that you can't criticize someone for their ideas because of their identity very big thing to say you should be incredibly specific if you want to say it's evil you should say what's evil and then open that up to some sort of a discussion or debate what is he describing a general is very much for calling classic anti-semitic canards explained that to people which I think is incredible what do you think if I mean if you want to be objective us step outside of your Jewish identity what do you think is wrong with how Israel is dealing with the Palestinian situation because this is the big criticism of Israel the only criticism really that's the big one the big one so what do you think they're doing wrong the untenable position that they're in is that they are occupying another people that is what is going on in the West Bank and I've been there many times and that would many Palestinians I really educated myself on this the problem is is that and by the way it's not all of Palestine there's all the Westbank there's areas ab&amp;c it's a really cool if we have to pull up a map it's pretty complicated thing there places where it's much more autonomous and the PA is in charge and it really varies depending on the air so the big criticism right is that they're occupying and other people and that is corrosive to the state of Israel sort of morally like to it to occupy other people on the other hand what happens if they pull out of the West Bank tomorrow right I'm for a two-state solution ultimately ending the occupation but if I'm real I have to be honest about what that would look like what would it look like in Gaza is it now you have a terrorist state lit right at the border which is ruled by hummus it is quite likely but that very same thing could happen in the Westbank no let's say actually actually should pull up in that blind let's say is real does that then like the whole of Israel proper is something like three if it looks to miles wide is the distance between like to a car I more like the end of the West Bank in Italia or Tel Aviv and you see how small that is hard to even conceive of it if you were in charge of protecting the security of the people who live in places which by the way 10 years ago when the year after high school when I was living there there was a suicide bomb exploding up in cafes around the corner from where I lived are you going to subject those people to that risk and that's the that's the actual question facing the government of Israel which by the way I'm extremely critical of and if I lived in Israel I'd be voting you know center-left in Israel for sure but that interfacing and then if you zoom out and you pull up a map of all of the countries around it I just want like look so it's okay actually the one you were on was good because it showed if you zoomed out it had everything to of Egypt there then you have Jordan which is teetering then you have Siri than you have Lebanon and hezbollah's on the the southern border of Lebanon which is constantly which that's the real thing when people talk about this fantasy of why can't I just look like America why can't there just be a democratic one state solution first of all no one there wants that they pull people constantly but the second thing is like really what that's going to look like if we dismantle the state of Israel or is it going to look like in Norma's Bloodshed the likes of which we see in a lot of these countries surrounding it like someone once said to me that if you want to know the word for you know a Jew without a military it's because he's okay it's easy it's the people it's the minorities in the Middle East who have been absolutely destroyed and overrun and this is like it's I don't think when Americans talk about this part of the world they fully appreciate the sort of absolutely painful and hard decisions and the grappling with violence really you know what happened to Jamal khashoggi in that Saudi Embassy that's like normative for this part of the world so the fact that Israel has somehow with all of its laws managed to eke out a western-style liberal democracy frankly the only place where you and I would feel happy and comfortable living like why we never talking about that I think it's very difficult for people to find the Forum to discuss it the way you just did and did it to really lay it out in cold Stark reality what is the solution what is the solution I mean is this is no magic the solution right now is to do everything possible to build up the Palestinian economy to for Israel to build relationships like right now it has a very very positive relationships with Egypt which gave back the Sinai Whitted one in the Six-Day Six-Day War I believe gave it back to Egypt for a cold piece which its had it has a good relationship of all things who would have thought was Saudi Arabia because of their common enemy you're on I mean things shift their rapidly as for the Palestinians the solution is to build up the economy make life better and support people and movements inside the Westbank that are genuinely non-violent and those people exist it's just frankly oftentimes their murdered by groups like Hamas and their bodies are dragged through the streets if you're accused of being an Israeli collaborator in the Westbank you know what happens to you or lynched no one talks about the no no one does talk about that would you be open to discussing this in this sort of form with that woman from the women's March American domestic pet text to a foreign region of the world like in a way that this is talked about a lot it's like the oppressor the oppressed the white the black no that's not what's going on I don't think people understand when they talk about Israeli Jews that half of them are Middle Eastern like half of Israeli Jews are Arab you know there's no appreciation of that reality they think that Israel was just founded you know to save the remnant of the Jews who weren't destroyed in the Holocaust and yeah it help for those who survived but then once the state of Israel was established there was a mass Exodus of the Jews from all of the Arab countries where they had been living as second-class Citizens where they were either self deported because we were living it as I can class citizens were they were expelled again. Exodus that deportation never talked about I would be happy to talk about this with someone from the women's March what is the what is the response currently like what would it would have the current position that most people are taking about that woman in about the women's March in general because of these things because he's an anti-semitic statements I think a lot of people in the past few weeks thanks in part to Meghan McCain have 5 minutes on The View with Tamika Mallory and Bob land and she did an amazing job selling them on The View the view is what state in the same way that the image of the Lincoln Memorial so powerful during Alicia sort of accepted it and interrogate them but it's our job to be skeptical and criticize a lot of people but again I wrote that column in August 2017 and it took until now everything in that Colin is the thing people are talking about there was also an amazing 10,000 word Expose and tablet magazine a Jewish online magazine they did a lot of that works did reach a Tipping Point the thing that is I see a lot of my friends on the left were Jewish grappling with is that they so desperately want to be a part of these movements that they're willing to sort of check their identity at the door in order to gain entry and my thing is any Progressive Movement that's asking you to check your Jewish identity at the door your full Jewish identity which is acknowledging that we're not just a phase where people we're not just people that like have matzo ball soup or something bigger than that that's not a space I want to be a part of they would never ask that of any other group Why Us why why do they ask that. That's what the real question what I was saying before which is this misunderstanding if you see the world in an intersection away okay not is intersectionality was originally meant to be but he looks Cinemaworld a function does a caste system and the higher you are on the victim scale at least on the left and it's reverse on the right right on the right it's like white cisgendered men are at the top on the left there at the bottom and the Jews are somewhere close down to there at least in the way that the left the left I mean this part of left were talking about friends at least for now perceive the Jews to be the Jews don't have a place in that victim scale because she's so much success because they can pass as white because of Any number of things and so I think that's a huge reason for it which is a huge reason why I think intersectionality is a dead end and why we need to be talking about ideas and not identity right like that that is the thing about America that is so amazing and like I know it sounds cheesy but I really feel it that makes us so special we are not a country based on blood makes us so special we are not a country based on blood and soil we were a country whose National common identity is based on ascribing to a common set of ideas that is what we're about and so any politics it's insisting from the left or the right the know actually what we are is this warring set of groups competing for scarce resources absolutely not to me those kinds of politics or an American</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> crude tools like we're trying to perform surgery with hatchets f*** man how do you get to those people and have that discussion with all those people I mean in terms of there being too much to talk about and cover that's where I do think that seems like the New York Times can make a real contribution because we like it there are adults in the room deciding what the important news is that you should pay attention to at least I wholeheartedly you're going to learn about the genocide of the weaker Muslims in the New York Times Like if you really read the New York Times every day you're going to know a lot about the world and you're going to understand that the government shutdown is a bigger deal than what happened in the steps of the Lincoln Memorial if you're just trolling through Twitter which is hell like every person I know Twitter Snapchat or whatever like my youngest sister how she gets her news know that that's a real problem I don't know how to solve it other than tell people to subscribe to newspapers would still have some standards and would still let me make a mistake correct the mistake how many of those who loved there's a few about fight there's a boxing match between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather or Conor McGregor Floyd Mayweather School them but the end it said that Conor McGregor's face was swollen and bleeding and he was knocked through the ropes and I said you can't say that cuz everybody saw the fight that didn't happen in this crazy time where everybody is crying out for fake news you can't say his face was covered in blood when there's no blood you can't say that but don't do that we correct saying all the time but how do you stop it from happening in the first place how do you spell be hard but we do the difference with the New York Times and any number of these other places is that we say we made a mistake and we correct his heart that matters that article well it wasn't I don't necessarily think it's getting hot in fiction lady they applied fiction to an actual sport event which I thought was bizarre but I think it's important what's important as you can at least get a better version of The Facts there then you can anywhere else I see and I don't know if it's because they like nihilistic getting up using trumpets language to describe the Press what they don't see would they don't I think what they don't understand is that the loss of trust in the Press is a symptom of the loss of trust in lots of public institutions the who you know the World Health Organization just came out with this terrifying report we're like one of the top 10 threats to Health in I think the country and you should we should look this up is getting vaccines people who think vaccines cause autism in are not getting vaccines the stakes of like loss of trust in public institutions doesn't just mean like you're going to like ripping your comes bottom line it's like a threat to all of our health would quite literally being very very connected so when I see people gleefully celebrating like the fake news of the New York Times I'm like a better alternative right now that's what I'm thinking not you but I agree to a pre-formed opinions and you lock in you start saying fake news this is and it's also it's exacerbated by the situation that we find ourselves in what people are really buying newspapers anymore you have to get people to subscribe you know I subscribe to several on my phone computer and that's how I digest things now or an iPad when you use think about what they have to do to get those clicks you know and you see these weird like nose not a knock on Forbes I think Forbes is an excellent periodical they're great they they they write some really important stuff but almost every month they will write this super clickbaity thing about cell phones like it comes with an ass surprise the new Galaxy S10 as a nasty surprise and if so unimaginative nasty surprise articles that iPhones and iPad you are unbiased new giving them an objective perspective on exactly what's going on as soon as I might be nothing when it comes to Galaxy S10 or whatever the f*** that they're talking about this has a nasty surprise but but it's it flavors your perspective on news question times and these people are fighting for their life journalist and people and contributor to these websites and news and newspapers are fighting for their life because everything is dropping off the revenues are down the Revenant and then like what what replace what their supplies bloggers who's who's looking at them that they have journalistic ethics and standards that are like what we would expect from they don't they don't they don't have to and this brings you to the Infowars brings you to the infamous Infowars thing right now are fighting about this is this is the whole shebang like if if some of that news that you're getting any traditional venues is fake it is dangerous if any of it is clickbaity of any of it as deceptive</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> if you're having me very fortuitous your timing comes right in the middle of this big hubbub about this Native American Elder and this young boy with one of those stupid f****** Red Hats on that a slogan like makeamericagreatagain would be so divisive as somehow I never like that that would be like make America great again with sounds great hat with white letter sits there ever been a time like that where an object like a red hat with white letters was so repulsive to half the country yes well I mean some people see it as the equivalent of a white Hood aware of all the implications of wearing a hat problem with that is Kanye wears it right I agree I'm just saying there are people who really make that are paid for their opinion that are calling for this child's name and address or calling to Doc's him and publicly expose him this is a child is 16 is that what he is he's 16 years old and one of the things that was just so amazing about whole brouhaha around away like this perfect encapsulation of our outrage culture right because people saw tiny clip of this video and it was like a Rorschach test this morality play of what would it look to be was a group of mostly white kids from Coventry Catholic school I think it's in Kentucky and it look like at first glance that they were smirking and smug and happy sort of shitted and grins on their faces and that they were rounding this older Native American man and I have to tell you I had a visceral reaction to it the second I saw it like so many other people I was like this is you know where we are in our broken culture and their bullying this guy and here's the rise of their I had all of those reaction the challenge of what it means to be a journalist is to not see people as signifiers or stand-ins just based on their identity and that's what like 94 95% of the score did they sort of left to the leap to assume that are visceral reaction was accurate when in fact when you actually looked at like the 2-hour video of the whole interaction would also included this group of black Israelites are Hebrew Israelites they called themselves it was not that at all Native American man had walked up to this group the four other guys have been heckling the group beforehand calling them crackers calling them say calling the one black kid in the group things that can't even be said so was just far more complicated and what what was really really disheartening is that the out the initial outrage was enough for the mainstream press to report on it like Twitter is kind of become almost an assigning editor for places like the New York Times And The Washington Post in the Wall Street Journal and then when the actual truth of the thing comes out when we move past the outro Michael they have to sort of write the follow-up story to the fake outrage to begin with instead of backing up and say we made a mistake right what adults you know people with blue check marks on Twitter we're saying things like this is the face of white patriarchy the sea Emerald kit for wood raised as one said I need names shame him Doc's him how do these people not understand the implications of that so what happened over the weekend was that the eunos Lucy detectives on Twitter found a kid who they thought was the kid in the video wasn't actually the kid so there's the actual kid who was Doc's the family was harassed everything that we now know happens in Utah recycles another kid who looks suspiciously like him who was not him at all whose family there's an amazing and heartbreaking Twitter Thread about whose family was in the middle of a family wedding and need to spend their whole weekend fighting off these mobs who were trying to destroy them and it wasn't even the kid in the video that is really horrifying to me that that's where we are and the fact that adults who should know better or fermenting this and don't how thin like the sounds heavy but like the veneer of civilization is like they're taking a pickaxe to it it's just I just found the whole thing to be terrifying I don't know how you felt very unique moment because it's so public and it's so it's so prevalent in whether it's Twitter or Facebook is everywhere and it's sort of embodies everything that's with a lack of nuance and with people taking one side versus the other and sticking with it with not confronting their own personal biases with looking at these things through the eyes of this is the enemy I'm on the good side they're on the bad side let's get them and also this this distorted idea of what it takes to would take to be violent like this idea of this punchable person like calling for violence you you're hearing a lot of this like this is one thing that troubles me so much about the left my parents my parents were hippies you know I grew up when I was a little kid we live from age of 7 to 11 in San Francisco during the Vietnam war while the Viet Nam war was ending I was living in the middle of the hippie world I always felt that people on the left or like these well-read kind compassionate people but somewhere along the line within the last few years people on the left are calling for violence this is very is very confusing to me and it's it's this frivolous social media call for violence is not an in-person be there boots-on-the-ground call from it's a very strange call for violence punch Nazis I'm hearing this all the time they're putting Jews in the concentration camps I'm with you but when you call a guy with a Maga hat on he wears one of those red hats and he's just an a****** he's not see now some guy who maybe he's not that educated want to be a contrarian sees all these liberals that are complaining all the time so it puts this red hat on and now he's a white supremacist and a Nazi and you want to punch him like okay that's what a lot of people in very high positions of power in this country at least in a culture actually believe and they don't understand the implications of hollowing out words like that I know this personally right cuz I'm called alright I'm called an apologist for rape culture I've been called everything I'm a Centrist okay I'm I'm a Jewish Center left on most things person who lives on the upper west side of Manhattan and you know it's super socially Liberal Liberal on pretty much any issue you want to choose if I'm alt right what what words do we have left for people that actually are that what words do we have left for people who actually are part of a sort of racist blood and soil nativism is rising in this country and around the world that should terrify people that are using that language in the sloppiest of ways I really don't think they're seeing the implications of it when when you're just keyboard Warrior and you're just tossing the stuff out so much of it is about signaling to your tribe but you know that this thing is bad and I really don't think people are understanding the implications of this and don't think it's a stretch to imagine something like this happening a week 2 weeks a month 2 months from now and someone actually getting killed Charlottesville of the dialogue on both sides violent talk it's so disturbing and so unnecessary especially when it's disingenuous like calling someone like you alright or me cry, I get called all right that Jason that's when I got here that we're all the time I go left on everything basically except guns testing for guns and you should have to go to lick you have to go through a f****** you have to take drivers ed to get a car licensed how come you don't have to do any you know you don't do anything to get a gun like you once if you're not a criminal you just get it done like you don't have to know how to take care of it and clean it and say safely handle it you don't have to know the ethics of use you don't have to do anything I forgot who it was because look it up but prime minister conservative got rid of the Catholic school boy incident it kind of signifies something broader that's happening which is the Erasure of the individual which is just I think a horrifying problem in our culture like what actually happened was a one-hour incident on a random afternoon in January between a group of individuals right but instead in our why was everyone there I don't know why the Hebrew Israelites were there but it's DC like there are crazy protesters all the time you know the Lincoln Memorial play my sink and then were converging of the Lincoln Memorial around there's no there was a teacher there and they did ask the teacher at one point in order to drown out the heckling of the Hebrew Israelites I hope I'm getting the name of that group right could we do a school cheer to kind of ignore them and they did that and I think they did that with permission from the teachers at one point early on it was rumored that they were chanting build the wall but no one has surfaced any evidence of that was so well that's what I heard from the Native American Elder when he was talking about an interval in a video he said they were chanting out Build That Wall right and they're also trying to make their friends laugh and their assholes and they're just being silly and stupid a total nerd in high school I saw the face of the main kid in that still photograph and that video and like the 14 and 15 year old Amy would like enraged really like I was like I see the face of so many kids who said the nastiest things to me and who through friends of mine into garbage cans like the Blake disgusting bullying was it because you said you have to get to the next step reaction to something is not the truth it's your emotional reaction and anyone who calls himself a journalist like your job is to figure out the facts of a case not to make this into a kind of identitarian morality play and the fact that so many people in so many publication did just that and in fact when the real facts surfaced just kind of sort of dug their heels in and we're basically like well he's a stand-in white patriarchy BuzzFeed writer that said it's the look of white patriarchy his face you're really going to put that on a sixteen-year-old that's enough to me it's a denial the individual is very cruel when you're 16 years old you're basically a baby you don't know what the f*** you're doing you're incredibly susceptible to the influence of your peers around a bunch of other boys you not around girls cuz you know cool girl can you go some black irreligious school right that this is you know you want to really be a social justice Warrior you really want to save the world how about you do something about the Catholic church and we want to go after R.Kelly which is great but how about the Catholic Church how about the number one kid f****** organization of all time which of these kids come from that cult imagines that was not the Catholic Church it wasn't said Scientology we would be getting all the kids are part of a cult they went there they're part of this weird cult that suppresses sexuality amongst its priests and encourages that with the placement of these pedophile priests in new places in order to get away from whatever crime that committed in the area where they were initially established this is what the church is right when they travel all over but it also is good people this is the this is where you want comes into play good people there's a bunch of people that are Catholic because they want a better relationship with with god of the universe or love or whatever they feel like it's a good moral framework for their children they take them there they believe in the Ten Commandments they believe in this moral structure for society to lay down by what they believe God is great people that are involved in the Catholic Church those two things right so these kids are a part of something that's way worse than smirking at a Native American with a drum and in my opinion being a vibrant burn when I was 16 I was a fool I was a dumb person. Polly know I was bullied you trying it out you know you don't even know how to talk yet you basically just learning words and this kid with his guy beating the drum inches from his face he handled it I believe way better than I would I don't think I would have but I definitely was a f****** idiot and I was 16 but you know you just went in and who knows what's going on bad day who knows like if you have anxiety about the future your girlfriend broke up with you you failed the test or what else that is like reasonable thought Center in Center left and even the center rights reaction to it with accurate that he was a little a****** that he's a racist homophobic transphobic hates immigrants and every single thing does that deserve to be news but a sixteen-year-old kid with those views smirked at a Native American Elder especially my timeline on Twitter and on Facebook on an everything this was way bigger news than day whatever it is 30/31 but the government shutdown or people are having to get on bread lines to feed their families that are happening right now in terms of our culture shift and when these things that come up in opposition to what many people believe is a beneficial shift to a more Progressive more responsible culture when these little hiccups they get addressed negative dress rapidly and I think it's because people are aware but things are changing in this almost like unprecedented way if you look back finally historical record for human beings ever been what we've experienced over just a past 10-plus years of social social networks and social media and the ability to spread information very quickly with a YouTube video or a Tweed or whatever in these these exchanging information is very different and because of that culture is Shifting at a hyperspace speed it's just a turbocharged for sure so I think when something comes up I think is like there's one get it exactly it's not logical it's like it's like road rage you know why you get road rage one of the reasons cuz you're going fast okay you're in a car and you're nervous your your heightened senses so anything that happens it gets magnified like someone's mother f***** in my lane cuz you already jacked up to 8 because you're in the car going 60 miles an hour something like this comes up this rapid pace of change which is almost impossible to keep up with right with the new cycle and this constant wave of change and information when something comes up people Road raging on this kid I mean there's truth and facts and not allowing people to be standings for group you're not a standing for anyone Austin wave of change and information when something comes up people Road raging on this kid totally that's why we just have to I mean there's just lots of things to say but continue to insist on truth and facts and not allowing people to be standings for group you're not a stand-in for anyone your yourself you answer for yourself I just I find that trend on both sides really really scary</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think deplatformed Infowars instantly I think I support that because I don't want like in an age in which people don't know okay like a fifteen-year-old clicking through their Roku doesn't necessarily know the difference between CNN and Infowars and New York Times and MSNBC don't have bias he's obviously but Infowars promotes conspiracy theories and do I want a fifteen-year-old kid stumbling into that and thinking that that information is on par on a level with actual facts the problem with the real problem the problem is you don't know which ones are real but some of them are real the Gulf of Tonkin Vietnam War iorwerth at Sandy Hook Sandy Hook for sure happen bunch of kids died in these are horrible he's a horrible evil conspiracies the problem is it's horrible without a doubt and you know when I saw the Media Matters clip that I never seen before I saw it recently the one that shows every time he brought it up towards a lot of things. The pressure it starts it has to be a realization that he knows that really did happen but there's a giant group of people out there that still believe it didn't happen and they still confront these parents even in court and they call them crisis okay but it's it's I know I'm curious what you think their own what do you think of Roku taking in Fort Worth off I think we have to decide what what is Twitter what is Facebook what is YouTube the position that most people have is these are private companies they can make their own rules this is just like CVS deciding but if you use you know if you drunkenly yell the n-word out at a black police officer that they don't want you as a newscaster anymore what you know this a public account or private company that can make these distinction if you take a position an anti-semitic position publicly they can they can decide what we don't want you on the air anymore and then there's other people that think freedom of speech in this form is is so important and that the answer to bad ideas is not stopping those ideas it's good ideas it's good ideas confronting those ideas and you see it all work itself out that's that's the does the other side of the coin to see other side of the argument the argument that we should treat whether it's Twitter or YouTube or any of these social media platforms as a public utility that you should be able to distribute information the real problem is with all this is that it's very messy there's this is a nuanced issue there's a lot going on because when you do decide 2D platformer someone for having an awful position and false conspiracy about that most people going to agree with you but the question is does it stop there and doesn't move on to you or a person who believes in white nationalism what does that mean while I believe that black pride is fine but I live also believe white pride is my what about those people where do we go with them I mean this is one of the things that it was a paper that someone had put together an article scientific data will they would basically say if you were up something to someone like to be alright</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what's the word for things that you get better when you're not come over and the classic example is the immune system so the immune system is an incomplete system it's a miracle of evolution that we have this system for making you antibodies but it doesn't know exactly what to be reacted to that has to be set by childhood experience and so if you keep your kids in a bubble and you use bacterial wipes and you don't let them be exposed to bacteria or crippling the system the system has to get knocked over to get challenged has to have to learn how to expand its abilities and so so this is why peanut allergies are going up there was a really shocking part of your book that's right it's stunning how fast it happened to please explain did not nothing that looks like a nut nothing but has to work was crazy how defensive they were about nuts and as we reading the book I thought back on that and I said wait a second like why you never freaking out about nuts and the more we freaked out about it the higher the allergy rate goes and it turns out there's a study done in publishing 2015 where the researchers noticed that the allergy to nuts is only going up in countries that tell pregnant women to avoid nuts and they thought well maybe that's why so they did a controlled experiment they got about six hundred women who gave birth recently and and whose kids were at higher risk of an allergy cuz they had eczema or some other immune system serve issue so about three hundred of them or told standard advise your kids are with the peanut allergy so you should not eat peanuts while you're lactating and keep penis waiting your kid and the other half were told here is an Israeli snack food it's a popcorn with peanut peanut powder dusting on the outside give it to your kids starting out in 3/4 months whenever they're ready to eat and so any monitor them to make sure they weren't you know fail reactions or silver or strong reactions and then at the age of five they gave them all a very thorough immunological tests and of the ones who followed the standardized 17% had a peanut allergy they would have to watch out for peanuts for the rest of their lives and such a high number because these work because these were the half that were predisposed but giving peanut powder 3% just 3% had a peanut allergy at age 5 in other words we could almost Wipeout peanut allergies by giving peanut powder to kids and it just a few months ago and science the front page article was on doing that and so again have an actual severe allergy if that's your child yes but that's what the science article was that exposure therapies are being tested and they are the most effective people cuz it was someone on the plane that was so allergic that if you eat peanuts and you chew it and it's in the air it could adversely affect a person are the most effective sleeping with people so they didn't want us to even eat peanuts on the plane cuz it was someone on the planet was so allergic that if you eat peanuts and you chew it and it's in the air it could adversely affect a person</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you first do them dirty was a little younger know yeah yeah want to start smoking pot and then psychedelics came after that yeah I was around a lot of eye because of the fact that I was a comedian and then also because of the fact that you know I was relatively famous back there not. Famous famous but like I was I was on television I found something so people would want to turn you on to things you know I can't you know when I would go to parties or meet people and they would you know say hey Mana. you know and it came out of her dad EMT in like and then there's a few different things that would happen and you would be around these people who have gone to jail for it or you know that we're like real psychedelic heads and once I was around a few of those I realize it will there's a whole nother world out there and then I discovered Timothy Leary and John Lilly in the the flotation tank became of giant part of my life and then you know Terence McKenna Dennis McKenna and all that various psychedelic Wizards that are out there are the sort of expressing that there is there's a whole world out there that you're not seeing it's like we're living life inside this very strange tent this very thin membrane tent and if you just unzip that tent and step out the entire Wilderness of the universe exists but most people live their life inside this very thin wall tent and they think that that 10 sort of defy when's the actual universe itself when it's it's so small and so limited is there a chance that you open that tent you don't like what you see in that you f***** your whole life up because I think that's most people that prevention about sure doing that like people that have like legitimate mental illness mental health issues and did the argument is correlation or causation right in the argument is does the Psychedelic drugs cause mental illness or do a certain amount of people already have mental illness and I think it's much more likely that the percentage of people that are schizophrenic remain static because if you if you look at it like this the number of people who smoke marijuana or also skip mirrors the number of people are schizophrenic. So it's not that marijuana causes schizophrenia set sit one out of a hundred or whatever the number is they just have this issue this and for those people it's critical that they avoid psychedelic drugs that they avoid marijuana and then probably even alcohol or men even maybe a bunch of other psychotropic drugs as well because it could you've got an imbalance just like someone who has a liver disease has an in Balance just like someone who has disorder can't breathe while someone is cystic fibrosis or someone who has any number of disease you got kind of think of it that way there's an ailment of the mind and so if you add this unknown element into that ailment like 5 grams of dried mushrooms like what you might never come back and then there's the question the other part of your question is is it possible you could open that tent and not like what you see and f****** your life yes yes even if you don't have schizophrenia or mental you might never come back and then there's the question the other part of your question is is it possible you could open that tent and not like what you see and f****** your life yes yes even if you don't have schizophrenia or a mental disorder you might have a view of the world that's untenable with experience that you have under the influence of psychedelics but that might mean that your view of the world is b*******</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what am I to do I went back and revisit some of these songs but I realize after we record them that's why I didn't see that they were my songs because I recorded them away that I thought other people with Bond use them so I went and re-recorded about I don't know five or six of the songs that were already here and then my buddy evidence from Dilated Peoples got involved with me and we recorded a few of these rap tracks and it started kind of coming together in a kind of started coming together in a similar way that the original Whitey Ford sings the blues record that that's why I kind of also name what it is there's a lot of similarities and I feel like I just pulled everything from every part of the toolbox that I've learned from since I started you know what it was that Ice-T years or the House of Payne years are in the Whitey Ford years I just drew on it all and trying to see when I can send in the eight years of life it's not like a literal representation of what happened to me but it's an emotional journey of like all the kind of feelings and s*** that I like it's it's it's it's my best record you know but eight years right here so I'm never been in a rush that's a big statement that it's your best record ever streaming or people that are signed to record deals that are getting a small piece of what the Masters getting on the master you know you've been streaming is viable for someone who owns them take a million streams equals out to around $8,000 for what that is too up to a label like it would be around 8 is about the equipment about a grant and that doesn't sound like you know what thousand guys that or people fancy or whatever nice chunk of change by David Crosby was tweeting about how bad streaming deals are but that is because he has a bad deal with every doesn't know his master yeah if you don't know if he's like recording a deal for another record for the record company and I mean that he's older songs how the hell they do things it's it's just it's amazing they're sort of survival instincts how they figured out how does it what are they a tables are signing podcasters now because of streaming streaming like you should be getting checks from this job I don't. stop streaming I just doesn't have to be with a streaming service you you should have a digital company that is representing in this collecting all that if you don't documentary because it wasn't full length but it might have been just like a little like feature like it within a news kind of segment thing about how the you know the original videos that were huge on on YouTube or like a kid biting another kid and like their original first for the longest time the most played video on YouTube was the Charlie biting the kid or something viral videos you know me so well I mean I haven't changed the music business is what changed YouTube you know because they caught on like itv's doesn't play videos anymore and nobody's buying records so we got to sell you know the old the whole thing for the longest was like when the bottom had really fallen out for a while of making any money money off of actual records was like well you can bootleg my record and you can download my record but you can't download t-shirt became sell the lifestyle self the music became background music to the dean everything else it was a part of the lifestyle in the car is in this and all I want you to do is really go by this limited edition t-shirt that I'm selling you right now you know right that's what that's the game changed into instill that you know that's why the f****** in the troll ISM and all that because people want eyes on them so the next thing they had the opportunity to sell making sound do these 360 deal and pocket the rest I was up to me and then after that my dry your job is a labels to sell that record my job was a hit the road and go tour and I go tour for a few years and it first I'm not even making money touring you're giving me money to go out there and tours call tour support that used to be and that I could get added on to your bill you didn't get paid no you get like money for tour but like it wouldn't cover like a bus and a band and all that so that the label with supplement that we what they called tour support which would also some part of the debt you owe the label but as you built your live audience your guarantees would go up sooner or later you can stop taking that money and then your record sales would pay that off hopefully if you were doing well enough and now you got your own stream of Revenue with live t-shirts all this other outside s*** that it's yours that's that's what it was when I came up now it's like that's not a deal at all Baker Brothers nobody was paying for record labels working and give you a half a million dollars just for your record because nobody was buying records they want to sell your t-shirts to it's not amazing don't they figured out how to stay alive like that just because they always knew the people going to be needing it always is it all boils down to this to somebody one day like they had so many opportunities to be the music industry had a moment if you remember there was like some kids that got in trouble for downloading ridiculous amounts of music and their parents were being held responsible because the news wasn't good the movie industry never backed off of that kind of s*** they told you we're going to f****** sue your life off you just people I would have spent up to it at on a record $200,000 just on the making studio time whoever's got to be involved Engineers producers 200g and on top that's that's minimum we were to spend on a record and then it gets you go out and people steal it but if I philosophy was if I downloaded your s*** and I liked it I would go I'd go buy it me to buy guy if I if I downloaded it was trash today I looked at as like a taste test that's okay okay maybe if more people lay down to that the money was retarded how much money was in the record business and they let it all go down the drain because they would they thought they had all the answers and they thought it and it not with money and what could they have done to stop it I have to go buy have some wait till it was too late movies like The Experience is not as good apple music Save the Music Industry like a pelippers iTunes why didn't the Reckoning streets like they were people tell them this is coming and I didn't mean to interrupt you but they could have made iTunes first not called iTunes but like the record industry itself should at digitized and been ready come up with their own version of iTunes find a record deal with just 12% of Revenue 43 billion dollars a year was the most profitable year since 2006 the listeners are spending more money than ever largely on streaming and live music with consumer spending totaling more than 20 billion dollars last year while yet artists aren't feeling the increase of that 20 billion music industry entities such as record labels took home 10 billion Physicians taking home just 5.1 Billy with the majority of the revenue coming from touring and concert sales it's amazing that's amazing that these that's like a parasitic industry like you they don't people don't necessarily need them the way they used to need not not like they used to I was going to just play Devil's Advocate and say what it used to be that I'm the guy to put up all the fun if I'm the label it go I'm putting up millions of dollars in advance gambling it on you now when you win you want to take away my lionshare now f*** you now it's totally different now you can this on your own yummy you can start an Instagram started YouTube start this and you can make beats on your laptop in your little rapper right is not the guy who does everything everything he's done is his own s*** online sure but you don't believe it so many viral music hits you know they get they get big online just cuz kids share it and they like it and then it becomes gigantic like what the music industry that the industry that the labels have nothing to do with that right know that there's labels that are doing their thing out there that actually know what they're doing in marketing I only seen 5.05% of what you know he's do because he has been in the game long enough you know and they started out with their own label they started the beginning Roc-A-Fella Records Was independent so that's the kind of you know those guys are never going to lose as long as you know they can still make music that people buy even if your record is successful the second record it's not like you're going to be able to be independent in the second round of the deal you the only Force ever align right usually I mean it used to be I think the standard would like 8 but that's it that's it's it's this misleading because it depends on your phone to there's also like you know if your first record is very successful and you have a lawyer that has anywhere with all your renegotiating before you do second record things you learn first album to do anything like what I signed bands like in the sixties if I could know they had a plan like by album three and four years where will beat you know they build artist that used to be and are they actually used to nurture and f****** take care of a band for a long time and watch them grow you know that's the way it used to be until that you know that whatever was I maybe the 80s or changed the album in 1999 had a record deal with Warner Brothers kamodo did the book the whole deal like I died went through the whole record industry business and there was always a comedian or two on labels I don't have that anymore because Tommy albums yourself that you definitely can do it yourself but for some strange reason I don't have that anymore because comedy albums that you definitely can do it yourself but comedy albums just aren't that popular anymore for some strange reason it's also</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> go see go see the show cuz this one was it is a lot of people doing that right now I don't know if that's bad is I mean yes it is but then does not open the door for the the people that are going to be like that like look less people out there really actually trying to get ahead of people that are going to try to succeed you give people money and okay you don't have to go for coffee or flip burgers or you know clean up that bro. Whatever you going to do for a living you can follow your passion I don't think we're going to find some exponential increase in the number of people inventing the wheel I just think they did it so you could be a lot more people farting under the blankets or something I don't know they might do right but the only good that I think could come out of it is it less people are in abject poverty and less people are desperate so it might reduce crime lazy people but you might also have less people that are inclined to steal things or do something that's illegal because their basic needs are taken care of they went on strike but it talked about the problems at this school district has and I don't know whether the statistic is right I read it numerous times I was so surprised by 80% of the families that use the Los Angeles Public School System are at the poverty level or below and that means of course also that they rely on the free meal assistant right at the school provide which is kind of important story the schools are closed right now until your kids aren't getting the chance to eat because that's the only chance to get to eat but that number was stunning I meant to look into it do more research to see whether the article in the newspaper so it must be true then go on to college 12% and it was a similar number that never get out of high school and it's even worse in a place like New York City public schools so I guess the point being is a public school system is dogs don't know what to do they're not doing it the right way they don't guidance I never learned correctly when they were young and a disabled parent that walks into an errand jobs and most people live here in California 25% of the nation's homeless people it is crazy and it also talked about how a lot of those people they work with their home was right the cost of housing and so you got people that have a job but they live in in the cars right because they can't afford housing weather is in San Francisco or San Jose and it wasn't where I was at kind of do this thing where you you're monitoring this issue motivation so you're not creating another follow-on generation complete slack asses then I think that's it that's a really valid point I might concern would be people that didn't appreciate it and people have felt entitled like they felt like someone owed them that money you know when you're going to have that mean this is the is the biggest problem people have a socialism and socialist attitudes it some of these kids to come up right now they look at what they call income inequality with don't look at is effort inequality like some people put in more f****** work that's not smarter they figured their way through the game better than you have been doing it for 50 years or whatever the is a system sometimes you know set up so that once you have some money you can get more money what course the f*** it is if I have somebody I can invest that money and make more money even family and I've got some friends and others who we just translate pissing and moaning about this place I had and I'm taking I spent almost all my life over and shoot holes around the world and I there is no other place I would rather be as a country and I know that's jingoistic or whatever but honest to God I still believe and if you go someplace you talk to somebody and in some fifth world they will also add my experience has been anyway maybe you're listening and your experience is different but that's the way it works they'll think if I go to America if I can get to America and I work hard I can I can be successful and that I think is still true and that's what I worry about with entitlements and instead that make kill that belief and you're right income inequality that's but it's your right you work harder not doesn't always happen but life's not supposed to be fair I think it was maybe supposed to be but it's not fair so sorry I was just supposed to be live let me see your point in and then out and I agree with it is I think that the real concern is that people don't appreciate already how great they have and what incredible opportunity that have and if we give them more benefits with less effort than you're going to develop more of this attitude we find disturbing which is people that don't have an appreciation for literally the greatest experiment and self-government the world has ever known him would need to be looked at I guess it doesn't interesting study about about college and graduation rates from college for for disadvantaged folks you know that voice again why they made it easier for you no tuition assistance right so the idea was we wanted to expand the college ability for everybody which is a great idea right but what they found was expanded opportunity for everybody but over the pass decade decade-and-a-half fewer people from the lower-income categories have been graduating so what you've done it you said come on special operators if you lower the bar the course so I'm going to change the regulations and so if you change the regulations what they found with the college was if you if you increase that pool people going doesn't mean that they're going to be successful and now what you've done as you've kind of Saddle them with some college debt and they didn't graduate so they still learning what high school you know graduate earn and a 10 in the system doesn't work and so I think sometimes just the idea of throwing money at the problem or or not helpful if we don't think oh and then assess the results so but yeah that that that whole Marine experiment I think they're they're catching it laid in the chain and I think it's good to give people the opportunity to succeed in to advance themselves but if you really want to dress it as a systemic problem you got to get to the root of it which is these unbelievably horrible neighborhoods and these these toxic environments these kids are growing up and being abused and being scared and bullied and terrible piss-poor Haitian you know first through all the way up to high school that's mean that's really where you have to dress it mean addressing a Jess at the college level and giving them the opportunity to get into college making it easier for them it doesn't negate the terrible Foundation that's been laid by their life but I think we had this idea that knowledge should be for everybody yes you know they're thinking okay wow look at your you know some countries in Europe have free tuition and pay itsuno it's relatively prosperous and there's nothing wrong with that but at the same time and I think we don't we we don't assess the cost and the overall efficiency of an idea sometimes and so we just assume and you know open it up let everybody go and somehow this is going to work right to our advantage and the honest God answer is no you know I think somebody is better off sometimes you don't going to becoming a plumber you know you maybe maybe not honorable living it up and X you don't go into becoming a plumber you know you're maybe maybe narbeh living right he's always out for hunting season and</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you're not my friend Adam was here the other day we're talking about Toyota trucks and he didn't Google Toyota trucks just discussing it and he said since then his mentions have been filled with these little advertisements for Toyota trucks how's that work but it was incredible that you could take a piece of paper put into a system it would like take that information was on that piece of paper and now it was on a database that you can access and manipulate voice recognition is no different and sense that so if if if for example if I had to switch it on and it happens to people all the time walking around their house they'll say something and go couldn't find a result for that but do you want to listen to Ella Fitzgerald whatever it's always on listening right and you can do that with anything like this TV right here if you wanted to if you knew if I knew that TV was going to go into the office of the Deputy foreign minister of a country hostile to our interest I could turn that thing into a receiver obviously and if I could get my hands on that before delivery that's a wonderful thing now I've got this in there and it's like the old days when you would have to go in on an operation and you know you silent drills and put a device in the wall now deliver the tv now I get a video to a good for me so it's always on in innocence and so regular phone that you get if you just buy an iPhone and you have Siri turned on so we can say Hey Siri in it it turns on that phone is always listening to you but it could be yes could you do that as an intentional operation sure is it happening because Apple wants to do it and they want to get better understanding of consumer preferences and thanks I have no idea that's that's above my paygrade but I will say from an operational perspective sure yeah you would not operational perspective right but like it would kind of be scandalous if we found out that apple is listening to everything that you say and they're sending them information to these companies and then they're trying to sell you whatever you were bringing yeah it's really everything but it's only one step above what they do anyway I mean if I go in here and I search Toyota in the same situation I'm f****** inundated with Toyota mentions right after work so it's it's like the next iteration of that and I suspect that people would you know that some folks will be out right but I'll bet people would just live with it. We seem to be willing to give up a lot of s*** as long as we don't government doing it if it's Google lawmakers want them to stop selling that information see where the eyeballs are right so you looking at me that bill was looking at me so that's a success right I've scored a hit of you and that was the old days was like you know how how many clicks are how many Billboard they got a camera ability for that billboard to sense it again pedestrian traffic to understand you know people's interest and to further refine so that they can sell it better back your outdoor advertising interactive this is putting your phone directly up to us this is like you committing that there is also what he's talking about 2 Samsung that was it only Samsung phones maybe just a Galaxy at the Galaxy ads but if you can do a one way that transaction can be I used to be putting a bacon fried investigation see how you put a beacon on a car and it was low clumsy but it got better and better as you go along you know now it's now it's it's it's it's pretty remarkable but you can also I think about the electronics that existing of in a current vehicle a new vehicle you can every one of those has a unique signature so whether it's the tire pressure indicators you know how you get in your car and it says your left front tire is low particular signal signal for that car left front tire is low night that's particular signal if I know that signal for that car I'll bet I can find that car right and it's like it's the same with all the other electronics that exist within a vehicle at War just in the s*** that we carry around they've all got some kind of signature so for whatever reason because they're getting accustomed to it and then not shot by Eminem</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> he's named Laura Loomer the lady who jumped Nancy Pelosi's fence camped out on her yard you know what made me think Nancy Pelosi own that house where she getting all that cash net worth now I was weight loss she's worth a hundred million estimated but that's like I don't know if it's one of those online at work Oprah's net worth or median net worth net worth is okay kind of person so it can't be anything higher than sis something so it's probably not more than 180 South Clinton Foundation 220 $3,200 what in the holy f*** is that house that she does have a big wall around right over that son of a mess she's a parkour athlete have to nowadays I think that that I think I leave my theory is any way if you want to be a paid contributor for a network knows I'm at which network you got a stake out of position that involve some crazy right you got to be like you rather get be all in for President Trump or you got to be all out if you live in the center that ain't happening but nobody wants to hear from anybody in the middle because that that shitt not picking up the ratings at all reasonable middle whatever workout is if the two ends are so f***** up and they're fighting so hard on the opposite ends like someone's like got Shirley's got to be a reasonable middle and then someone comes along with almost like people screaming for it right now it doesn't seem like you were screaming for occasionally taking a shot of each other throwing a hand grenade and nobody is making any any movement so I get how do they shut their how they stop the shutdown you can't if you're not talkin if you're not if there's if there's no effort it's not going to happen so everybody's looking at this right now I'm thinking you know where is it go it's affecting the markets it makes us look like morons that others aren't written look at that Germany's having its issues you know everybody's having some some some problems but you know we didn't need to add to the noise John Stossel had an interesting video that he put out where he's saying what this does actually highlight is that there's a lot of things that the government doesn't really should probably be privatized we wouldn't have these issues made sense to me but I don't know a lot and one of them would be a course National Security terrific in a collection of federal taxes okay fine that say they're going to do that regardless but otherwise just stay out of my kitchen I don't know so that's why I've always been surprised me that the Republicans you can't sit around and then try to tell people what to do with their bodies or who can get married who can't get married cares by just don't don't hurt people be a good person get on with it I don't need to celebrate your life but just do it I really don't care I don't expect you to care about my lifestyle I don't care about yours but the Republicans have always stuck their nose in this in your kit you can make that argument for for wanting small-government and in all this if you just want to step into people's bedrooms all the time it doesn't make any sense and I think the only reason why they do it is because he gets people excited they get to run those who to vote for them I think when they take these positions it's not like these are really having an effect on their lives or some more stand that they must take because God wants him to do it I think they do it because they think that it's going to get and it's going to shift the pole one way or another and it's going to get people excited about them possibly making some sort of a difference a day feels going to significantly affect their position but do you ever get to the point I don't know what weather that's going to happen but you would think that you've got the right and left they're not going to shift right that's not going to happen but a small group in the center so at a what point of the group in the center for the put their hands up and go right how about a third-party that's legitimate but something that creates it a little bit of a different Dynamic and we're never going to get term limits so that's been tilting at windmills but maybe and I'll maybe we get that multi-party thing going that again okay I'm just trying to Skype with crab close yeah pretty much yeah yeah he was a half an hour on National Television he bought the time to explain how you're getting f***** today and explain taxes and explain all these different things and and people like wait what that's how it works it's good TV Taco Time it leaves a half an hour on National Television he bought the time yet to explain how you're getting f***** to you and explain taxes and explain all these different things and and people like wait what that's how it works it's good TV</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> did Trump brought up recently is the JFK case and releasing some of the files and they wanted to redact the information that pertain to the people that were still alive now I want to know what what I don't know what you can say for what do you think about the JFK case do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone I can see the father of all them sort of incident Apologize by calling and all those situations the Kennedy assassination and MLK Martin Luther King's assassination those are the two that I understand more than anything else why they blinkered why people don't believe this s*** that they've seen a why they did why they have concerns about it Martin Luther King more than Kennedy I believe that there was something that it was still don't understand who else was responsible and who organized and who who assisted in that right I'm tired just think of those two that's the one I've got bigger questions on the Kennedy assassination I think that I think that Oswald pulled the trigger I think in his mind the reason he was doing it was for the greater good of of Communism and to boost his image Soviets and end it with the Cuban regime do I think that he had assistants I don't I don't think so but I could be swayed from that with with better evidence than I've seen but I understand why people are so dumb getting on it right because it was a massive Eventbrite had sufficient training you did not have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out is a different era and we don't understand it in today's terms but when you get right in that position and look out that window and look at the shot that was taken and you know what was involved in that I was not a few know you've shot sounds terrible but you know anybody and his past ties to the Soviets do I think the Soviets were pulling the trigger on with the mafia I haven't seen it in that convinces me that that was the case I think that Oswald felt like he was doing it for them or SUV was going to prove himself in that regard but again I understand why people duck in the MLK one Martin Luther King I just think that I don't think he acted alone what makes you think that I think that criminal right who was constantly getting picked up for the ships he was doing and ending up in jail he was a mess right there was nothing clever about him and then leading up to the assassination he cleaned up his act like he went from looking like a two-bit you know criminal and I'll to a college professor basically and he had cash she was able to purchase a vehicle and he kind of went off the grid for a while he went on his Drive Off the Grid and he behaved in a way that he hadn't up until you know months before this thing took place and then he ended up in Europe now and I just something tells me that he had assistance in some fashion I don't know who or whatever but that's the one that more than any others that I've looked at make me step back and go we don't know the whole story hear the Kennedy thing I again maybe there's something out there that we just haven't turned over it's always a possibility but yeah MLK I think is it is that's the one that's most disturbing I need to go look in especially if you think that something was going on look at his behavior is brother for what for a shelf in a series where we did a kind of investigative look into this and if you if if if all you do when you're when you're looking at this is to look at Ray's behavior in that year leading up to the the assassination that's the that's the interesting for me most interesting part I mean put in contacts with everything he did up until that point which is basically against the two big criminal couldn't stay out of jail and then you get this and you get this change in behavior in this change in appearance in this steno sudden ability to me know something that he wasn't up until that point I guess everybody can change but that was that was the most striking part for me there was plenty of information it wasn't like he couldn't have gathered if if you say why not he acted on his own well okay yeah what's their information yes the leading right up to the day before there was talk about do you know they were news reports showing King at the Lorraine Motel and you know coming in and out of the room you know that he was staying yet and so it wasn't as if you couldn't gather that information on your own you know but it was again it was that behavior leading up to it and I'm not a conspiracy guy Britax Frontier too much yet. You know every conspiracy hold water so but this one was disturbing in that regard what that's worth I really enjoyed the show so that they didn't pass America Declassified with it looking into conspiracies I really enjoyed it right I really thought it was fascinating and I get why people feel that way Kennedy for sure Kennedy board game from there that's probably the most of all think so cuz we looked at their the grassy knoll Su and the possibility of spotting the other day that move aside from the bullet fragments and but you don't see that missing from the bullet it's b******* and end elements of it that you look at but collectively maybe there's something else out there maybe there is an end we just haven't uncovered or maybe this will prompt you know some additional information who knows but anyway it's it's fascinating s*** but I do get it because it's so it was such a seminal moment right and nobody wants to think of something that bad that horrific and that's the country in that fashion maybe there's something else out there maybe there is an end we just haven't uncovered in or maybe this will prompt you know some additional information who knows but anyway it's it's fascinating s*** but I do get it because it's so it was such a seminal moment right and nobody wants to think of something that bad that horrific and that's only like the country in that fashion could be done by one one guy Mike Lee Harvey Oswald</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I guess I keep going back to my same point which was I I don't see people play with pitchforks and and you know the Torches going down to complain to Jeff Bezos that right now Amazon collecting massive amounts of data or T-Mobile and Sprint and all these are mapping our location as we move around probably raise nobody's interest for the most part know that article that you just pulled up and it's because yeah I'm too it's open till 5 but you know what should we be worried about when I table with your boy without mostly is state-sponsored activity by countries whose interest almost never align with ours now include China certain Clues Russia on the s*** that they're doing China has a policy information domination which means they've determined that the next War the next Modern large-scale War it's going to be one by Whoever has control over information so where are they putting all their resources trying to know that they're not going to build a military that's going to be able to reach around the globe the most part although there if you know they're beefing up their resources what are they doing and it's space so I don't want people work we're kicking the present in the ask and laughing about space force because it is funny right but the uniforms would be amazing but they they talk about this but tryna honestly believes and it's putting our resources into into space what does that mean wolf their anti-satellite technology that they been developing and working on and continue to work on the whole point of that is to take control of communications and surveillance abilities whether it's ours or Allies and in the event of something major that happens so they would have the ability to shut off or silence now and if you do that developing out of they have developed something that did that were there working to get the Next Generation it's like every nation that has the resources nobility understand that and is doing the same it's not like we're not right what what is their excuse was I should but they don't have an excuse they just they understand they have the right to do it technology today there's the start treaties there's a nuclear you know convention that we have with Russia which is in the whole nother interesting topic because we're right now arguing with the Russians over over the latest nuke agreement that took place sometime ago it's coming up for Renewal sometime soon get your two years from now and the Russians have been cheating on a previous agreement so we're in about to try to say we're cheating on the new ones that's an interesting thing to be watching but there's conventions that try to you know control that the numbers for Warheads are for delivery mechanisms missiles or submarines whatever bombers but not for this new world cyberspace still trying to figure out what war is an appropriate response create treaties that will allow that but right now I'm trying to put back there again. That beat on China but I'm much more concerned about China for our national security there are much bigger concerns than Russia is Russia's punching above its weight and potency of Putin's a dick no doubt about it and they've doing what they always do witches metal in democracy that's been their methodology for ever since they've been around an all-in-one the oil prices so you know are in the Twilight they really are sucking went so yeah we got to be concerned with why shouldn't understand that their interests or never align with ours you know for the most part maybe we tried to imagine they were with Syria and Isis and everything but Russia's only interest there was maintaining their leverage and increasing it and not not losing their military foothold there that was their primary interest we mirror our values and we mirror are interest on other countries and so we imagine to somehow we're all in this fight against ice together so much bigger issue and we should be focused on that and the song the greatest ministration is so that's where I say look at you can't just keep complaining and bitching and moaning because you don't like President Trump there's certain things that are going on that you should be willing to say that okay that makes sense maybe I don't like the messenger but that part of it makes sense is it his personal item because of his dealings with China from the business world that he understands it better that he is more concerned with the imbalance of the the trade I think what happened was what do I know of this is speculation so but I suspect that what happened was he came into it focused on the trade imbalance and as he was sitting there and talked about the trade imbalance more of the conversation from the National Security Council in from the agency and others in terms of saying well yeah this is the reason why this is a the long-term effects of of their theft of intellectual property this is why in part they've been successful in these areas so I think they would probably more more discussion talking about their economic Espionage and testify pee in that became then an issue for him but I think initially and still to this day I think the big issue is just he wants to try to create a win in terms of the trade imbalance Russia seems to us here domestically leaks for myself when when I think about it and I think about the The Narrative that's been sort of delivered to us that rushes this military danger we're worried about Putin taking over other countries were worried about Putin's power the way he kills dissidents the way kills political opponents and journalists we think about China and even with the Huawei arrests were like no one seems to be concerned it doesn't seem to light any Bob's over here I don't know why that is except it's more like a thug and visual right right and he's been very clear about wanting to try to rebuild the Soviet Union so whether it's Crimea annexation of a door where the taking over eastern Ukraine maintaining a position and Georgia whatever it is yeah he's just more in-your-face he's like Tony Soprano so we can look at that China has always been sort of this thing right and so you know because and if I won't change but yeah we absolutely should be dealing with China all the time but I think that they've always kind of been viewed more and more sophisticated fashion maybe cuz Putin is a soda in your face and he's always good at it he's very successful because she's a smart son of a b**** but he's I think he's pretty easy to rate right he's thuggish and he he Longs for those days of the Soviet Union so we should understand everything he does because of that is because he's the heat he would love to rebuild the Soviet Union and so we shouldn't be surprised by any sort of aggressive move that he makes against his his neighbors and we should always push back and to be fair this Administration not to beat their drum but the actions they've taken against Russia despite the fact that you got people calling him a puppet of Putin are more significant than the previous talk like what is done the sanctions against you know key individuals and companies within Russia as an example what's the toughest thing I've been placed on Russia ever the provision of weapons and and assistance to the ukrainians the previous administration City right now. Do that back that's that's a good thing right that should be done pushing back against them on the on the 2011 deal right and sorry on the under the previous I'mma start deal prior to the 2011 teal and calling them out and saying with your cheating on this and you've got to be held accountable I miss certain things there that that makes sense then that don't add up if you talk to somebody who says what he's an absolute puppet you say wall case of Puppets so why or is he doing certain things that seem counter to Russian interests and they'll save well because he's smart and he's like I didn't see its he's playing he's playing a long game here and I'm thinking okay maybe maybe who knows but I haven't I haven't strapped on my tinfoil hat yet to get to that point so no I don't know I don't know something or maybe was business dealings maybe it was people peeing on a more have some compromising information about him that was always just the fear right said they knew something or maybe was business dealings maybe it was people peeing on them or if they had if they did not</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Huawei yeah it hasn't gone away no it hasn't gotten away it's easier if someone just got arrested yesterday people yeah people so so backstory fascinating is fascinating I can definitely disappear down to one of them is the way that they're dealing with China right now and yes the trade issue is what can cause you to miss ability but again the previous administration the Bush Administration Clinton Station that lots of lots bread from former presidents are they all acknowledged the China privately was not a fair trading card this administration's at least trying to call them out and call him out on the Cyber issue 2 on their on their arrest after the commercial property so anyway Huawei supposedly owned by the founder and however many employees Huawei is by the way the number one telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world and their the number to seller of smartphones right they are bigger sellers smartphones an Apple so it's Samsung Huawei Apple 4 and so supposedly companies owned by the founder and his daughter is the Chief Operating Officer Chief Financial Officer arrested at the request of the u.s. she's up there on sale right now extradition hearing and the reason was because supposedly she lied about Huawei stealing for the rod and they were busting sanctions by dealing in providing certain types of equipment to a run now this this this past week we had a Huawei employee whose now been fired by Huawei in Poland arrested for Espionage and along with him is a member of the Polish intelligence service I'd who retired now I am it was not working for a French telecommunications company but was arrested also for Espionage related to Huawei and related to this individual who up until just recently was working for Huawei Huawei claims innocence and says what we have no idea and the founder just came out and gave this big speech and said I would never let the Chinese authorities tell me what to do and I would certainly never spy on anybody using Huawei is capabilities and technology and probably thinking what the f*** you talking about this for Huawei and beds their telecommunications equipment throughout the world so it's in our allies military operations which then are connected to ours right in terms of communications and transfer of intelligence and information they're everywhere and they chose Poland they've been in Poland for about 10 years old and has a very important NATO Ally so I'm taking a long time I realized but what I'm trying to say is nothing happens by happenstance the Chinese don't operate that way so the Chinese authorities some time ago years ago looked at it and said yeah this makes sense right we've got Huawei which by the way the founders of former military people's Liberation Army engineer he said they looked at this and they thought Poland that would be a good beach hat for us all right because there are key elements of NATO so let's go. so they started burrowing into Poland striking deals in Indiana that basically the most important foreign relationship now Corporation inside a Poulan and they're fully embedded and it had access to this point to Nato Communications and now the arrest of these two individuals and people will still despite this and despite their past despite their their their theft of information from everybody from ussteel to the Alcoa to Lockheed Martin Dupont all the times they've been stealing information people will still go I'd you know I don't make any sense I don't see why the Chinese would act that way and I don't see why would a bad idea because of the fact that were tied in with our allies with Poland and with Canada and with us you know that gives them access to us so for someone on the outside look myself is trying to look at this and you say that Huawei stealing stuff like stealing stuff from u.s. steel how they doing that well they steal and also Huawei one of the things that they do is by having access and embedding their equipment in your Communications infrastructure that gives them the ability than 2 in in a simple way in the tap-in ended up package intercept information right through NATO channels all they need is that one in right that's it it's like everything else is like fishing individual hacker sitting in somebody's basement you know he just needs that one Avenue he needs to get one just click on that email that give me the pathway in so went when Huawei is able to embed their technology into you know polish Communications and we're now connected because of our NATO alliance that gives him access to us France to jump whomever and equipment in Poland with the guy who was arrested person was arrested was responsible for the provision of telecommunications equipment to government facilities that was his job and the guy the Polish guy one of his last job for the until service was Communications thanks and they are very good at developing operations like this and so they've been very successful so we'll see but it's it's I'm glad that the current administration at least it's calling them out I don't believe it's misleading to change their behavior that you know and we'll probably get some sort of deal with airplane 2 years ago they agree with President Obama to stop their cyber Shenanigans and they didn't so they just change the way that they did it I think it is important to make a stand right you have some of that the tech people are saying that they think it's Preposterous when they were talking about the ban on Android phones some of the tech people say that doesn't make any sense but what you're saying is it goes far beyond the actual phones itself and its really the the mission of the actual company itself yeah I'm saying and other important Chinese companies soli privately-owned and or have the ability to tell the Chinese authorities that they will not spy on their behalf it does not happen it's just not happening you have to you have to go a long ways to come up with that sort of naive viewpoint that says that a a Chinese company is going to put his foot down and tell present she absolutely not we will not do anything to harm another nation's country our company they spent different Generations now decades jump-starting their industry in moving up there the food chain on the global economy by hoovering up everything possible out there so someone like a tech wizard got a hold of one of their routers can have they been able to detect something in there that doesn't belong or some sort of a back door or some sort of a way that they could tap into so I give you or you know you were apple and you were sending you no data to Raytheon Severn you're going back and forth they could tap in through that has it been proven that there's a device like that yeah I former NSA director McConnell back in 2015 I think early 2015 came out and NSA came out with an official statement it said every major US Corporation of any consequence has been attacked and exploited by Chinese and we have never ever not Chinese malware within their systems wow that was ever four years of being software right right right is there anything in the hardware itself in a sense that yes in the sense of like trying to remember the name of it but not doing very good job if you have access to our understanding of physical Hardware then you can affect easier you can affect physical control of systems right so stuxnet remember I don't remember stuxnet was engineer software that was able to Impact Physical equipment it took control of those systems because impart whoever perpetrated it had much better understanding of that gear right or had access to that gear and that's what that's an important part of of this and it's happened several times since then and I'll let you know I'm not disclosing anything because it's been written about I'm sure it'll be a movie at some point but that is that's a concern I'm far more worried about a company like Huawei with its integration into Allied our allies telecommunications systems that I am about to the individual sale of phones and you know what that means that look you know Amazon all the others I gather more data on the average American then you know the US government or anybody else is doing it that's a concern I'm far more worried about a company like Huawei with its integration into Allied our allies telecommunications systems that I am about to the individual sale of phones and you know what that means that look you know Amazon all the others I gather more data on the average American then you know the US government or anybody else is doing it</div>

I am through cars and hidden compartments and they brought it in through boats means they're there you know they're basically asking people spelling beans as to how the exact operation was was functional that didn't seem to involve people carrying it over the border on backpacks and now want to go is mon El Chapo's Lieutenant is cooperating with me yeah and he's now she's a hundred million dollars at the outset of his term so when he was president he is waiting to take the seat according to this this Colombian trafficker who was working with Guzman with Chapel pinion I don't reach out to him possibly through his campaign manager of How The Story Goes My friend which was then according to this again I got to Colombian trafficker you know how how legitimate is he you know then you know the money was transferred opinion that though and opinion at all those people are saying that's ridiculous look we were the ones who tracked him down and I escaped in all 48 x or whatever he escaped and then but it's always been this this talk about how Chapo's arrests were orchestrated right by in that so that they do the military the police were involved somehow there was a coordinated effort and it doesn't we've been that underlie groomer you know it possible possible but if he did get a hundred million dollars you think El Chapo be free Jesus Christ of a hundred million dollars and get you free seems like a lot of cash just moved offshore immediately apparently was according to this witness to this cooperating witness you the money was delivered this may be that the part of the story that doesn't hold up as delivered to his campaign plane or something in this campaign manager took control of it and then they whisked away and the weather going to hole in the ground somewhere takes out a little at a time</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> white sticks that would just say so 800,000 American workers that work for the government or not getting paid so there are month out many of these people paycheck-to-paycheck they don't have medical Necessities they don't have food people rapping a ration off their their their insulin to diabetic I mean I'm here and he's Horror Stories the lines of the Airporter around the f****** Block it's chaos and seems like there's no end in sight and it seems like Trump is just content to just tell hold this position but if both sides are content older position seems f****** crazy to me it is absolutely fact of a longer-term shutdown and so they understand that and the Democrats you know talk about it every minute about how this is a terrible crisis and so you would think that if both sides feel that way then get something. Look at the Democrats approved in the past recent past Monday's Democrats voted for fencing barriers they've seized on this term wall if he had started his campaign by saying we need to improve our border security and find fixes to an immigration system that is both fair and secure and efficient if he had gone with that it's a worry bumper sticker but if he had gone with that we have a different conversation right now we would but maybe would have a different president as well well I get it got to walk still simple build a wall Castle it's such a visual Real Madrid supporters I didn't even know they exist in the numbers that exist it's like he uncovered a rock like you flipped a rock over and there was an ant colony of Rubes in there and just sheer numbers just like whoa but we just tired of being told they're idiots and they came out in force now you can't tell you can't talk down to people this is for the Democrats can't keep talking down to people expect at some point and I got punched in the nose right now and they're still talking about all the people that supported Trump and he was talking about them all being losers and alcoholics and illiterate and like man you're talking about half the country no lesson learned right now that's with no self-awareness and that's that's the story of every election I think going forward is you know you've you've got the urban centers and you've got everybody else and everybody else feels as if they're getting kicked in the ass and so but but at the same time you think we should be able to do better right we should and certain policies that they got great but everyday another you know tweet that seems a little dysfunctional everyday you know some misstep everyday some self-inflicted wound shouldn't happen not in the country this size not not where we got this much talent and skill and capability so I don't know what 20/20 is going to bring but it's all we got were in for a hell of a ride between one of the bigger moves this gets resolved one way or another and who comes out at least the visual is the Optics are that they're the winner yeah that's it seems very critical because of the Democrats win and somehow know that he abandons his idea for a wall abandons the billions of dollars that he's been asking for for this wall that gives them momentum we kicked his ass with that wall and we're going to kick his ass plus he keeps them all in lockstep and she's done a good job so far of keeping the dams in line and that's why they wanted her back in at least the Old Guard wanted to know because that's what she does well aside from fundraising so you know I have a feeling that he's asking for whatever 5.7 billion dollars in the scheme of things at the drop in the bucket Schumer Pelosi and a wide variety of other people vote in the funding for border security including fencing in various but they are done not going to budge off of this including fencing in barriers but they are done not going to budge off of this so what the hell does that mean does that mean he's he's being pushed into a corner where he has no option but to declare a National Emergency use funds elsewhere so that he can say I finally got it done and look the Dems didn't do anything but you're I think you're absolutely right whoever is perceived as the winner of the ridiculous situation yeah they're going to beat that drum all the way to 20 20</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> pull out Syria first of all yeah yeah Northern Syria today as a result of a bombing up their credit for it so they're there was a patrol Personnel in Syria and for the most part what are they doing there where they're providing guidance training they're assisting with targeting and because the the airpower is incredibly important over there right now and so we are our Personnel are very much involved in selection of identification of targets for the air campaign and so we have these two thousand troops are President says he's going to withdraw then some of the members Administration start walking that dog back right saying right away but yeah if there is just never really such thing as a routine Patrol with there's a patrol and it got hit the military's not releasing a lot of details because they haven't finished notifying next of kin but number so far indicate possibly for service lost and that's going to refocus I think Congress and hopefully the White House on what the hell's going on the problem I've got with it is in terms of withdrawing we could stay there forever and not accomplish the task right if the task is to finally defeat whatever that means radical Islamic jihadist Isis that s*** never going to happen not in our lifetimes we're not going to get rid of that mentality that that ideology so it would seem to be sometimes a bottomless well of recruits that they can draw on their ability to morph something else has Al-Qaeda did ovary depending on you know how successful we are at campaign against them they're like piano again it's a it's it's like your step on roaches over here and they pop up over here so I think it's the biggest problem I've got is is that if we leave we're not we're not it's not like we're engaged in firefights everyday with Isis over there right we've left that to our allies and our allies most part up there in the north of Syria are the Kurds in the current have been our allies in one way or another in that part of the world for a long time now and it played a very important role and we have not been strictly honorable over the over the years and terms of how sometimes we deal with them if we walk out we leave then early Juan turkey I guarantee you will be in there in short order to kill as many of them as possible cuz that's just what the Turkish authorities are going to do they honestly that they couldn't be happier with the announcement that we're going to leave because that opens the door for them then go in there and from their perspective Stamp Out the Kurdish Alliance that have been our allies were the only thing our presence at small presents and I'm not minimizing it but it down two thousand troops has been what prevented them from doing that so that's that's the number one issue I've got the other is I have no idea why any president or vice president or anybody in in the government ever not this Administration ready in ministration ever thinks it's a it's a good idea to say we've defeated the enemy when were talking about radical this month we've seen it over and over again from previous administration from the Bush Administration we've done it it's against a self-inflicted wound at the cuz now what's happening now the media is not focused on the fact we've lost service and they're focused on well just just the other day they said we defeated Isis and the vice president today said the same thing and there's no benefit to saying that but also to make sure that these radical factions don't become more power and then eventually affect us and attack us and so we can keep an eye on what they're planning what they're doing is that the other than accurate it's exactly what I mean if you look at the reason we went into Afghanistan right if we go back almost yours and that was because the Taliban allowed Al-Qaeda to establish a beachhead in there for training and 4 Communications and for finance and for plotting and planning attacks outside of Afghanistan against us and our allies that's why we went in there aside from just seeking Revenge I will see what's the route that out we've been stayed in our thinking somehow we were going to turn the tide of history and create some pseudo Federal democracy there so that didn't that didn't work but the reason now for being in Syria is yes we we done a very solid job of beating pack Isis removing their territory and degrading their ability to operate but we haven't stamp them out we haven't defeated them yet they're still there and so we've been providing the support and again in form of weapons Hardware gear resources training and most importantly, combat Operations Air Assault and that's been critically important if we leave I have no doubt that Isis will find some way to rejuvenate maybe not in its current form but and maybe not in the same exact locations but they don't feel more cuz that's what they do they just they just find a way to adapt and we already know what's happened in the past when we when we left a rock we saw what happened with the rise of Isis so you know I do I want to stay there forever absolutely not but both sides can make a valid argument one for staying one for leaving my I think best argument for staying in the in the certainly short midterm to ensure that everyone doesn't slaughter a bunch of car to have been working with us honorably you know I don't know how to say that so we'll see what happens very interested to stay in Syria for example that is so many levels to this but they've been there for decades. it's not going to happen unless we want to go to war with Russia to kick them out of Syria that's not in our best interest so is it in our national security interest to keep troops there to fight and try to minimize Russian involvement in Syria I I don't think so because we're not going to ship them off that dime without going directly at them it's in their best interest to stay and every nation action its own best interest are we going to shifter on we got to keep a Ron from forming too late for that they've already got a beachhead there that they're not going to give up and so you got to set those issues aside see what what the hell are we doing there are we are we there simply because we have to you don't finish the fight against Isis well at some point you got to say you know I guess I wouldn't say that we've defeated them but I think we would say yeah we've degraded them sufficiently that we can we can Now operate from elsewhere and then we can operate from four bases and in other locations where we're currently you know pays great but again I can come back same thing that you know we've we've worked with the Kurds is this in our national security interest well no I guess it's not but there's something that tells me it's the right thing to do and then maybe sometimes that's enough and all that we should we should not let everyone have his way and also long-term wouldn't it be in our best interest to honor our commitment and make sure that we protect our allies so that in the future other allies would be more willing to cooperate with us because they understand once we're committed were fully committed we stay I would stamp something yeah so what's the benefit of getting out like the people that sing think we should get out like when when Trump said he wanted to pull out like what's his thinking I don't think it runs thick like deep I think it just I think it's during the campaign he talked about stopping the endless Wars yeah I'll do that in today rethink their the withdrawal or do they accelerated when they had the buildup in Iraq and it was highly criticized but then it was very effective like it did do what they intended it to do like I did knock back the enemy if they decided to ramp it up worldwide would that be a solution to any of this or is the opposite is it better to actually ramp up our defenses domestically and just stay the f*** away from all these people yeah well eventually he can only I mean you can only do so much I think on the domestic front and then you know if if they gained sufficient ability and strength seen that from past attacks I think that then don't come after you will come after us and that's just the way I suppose that's going to work but I don't disagree with the notion because it's it is hard-pressed I would have stayed in Afghanistan frankly I don't care whether they've increased their literacy rate by 2% of built another road whatever doesn't matter they don't they don't know what the hell we're trying to sell them right so I don't I'm not against the notion of getting out but this one too tough when I guess that's what I'm saying is that the Siri issue is I'm real conflicted because of the currents and and what they've done on our behalf in the past and then how they've suffered and knowing going years and years back you know having dealt with that issue two and a half decades ago a long time ago with the Turks in the cards knowing how vicious that could be and I don't trust her to want as far as I can throw him out a window so I think it was a problem that we need to we need to make sure we've talked through thoroughly before we just say shorts get them out of their you know what the hell we shouldn't have now we can be there but like everything else and I don't trust her to want as far as I can throw my window so I think with that there's a problem that we need to we need to make sure we've talked through thoroughly before we just say sure let's get him out of there you know

		<div class="paragraph"> between camp and broccoli at his daughter's hand and people saw him and went to grab him take pictures I told his daughter and then grab the hand he's on his daughter and he just went off on this dude he's like the nicest guy ever Roxy always great I guess it's fantastic oh my god dude why don't you grab me like what the f*** did I get my daughter your man and I'm Brock Lesnar Strat off people want what they want and they don't care I just don't see him fighting again I'll be happy if I was wrong I think you definitely wants to get back in there again mean I think he has some some fights in his mind that he would like to get back I think you mean 95% of division 2 picograms no. He's a f****** freak did he could cramps that's as my reference for f****** steroids Pecos Pecos so hot right now. He's such a freak how about the test results for Lesnar showed up then went away on their website mistake I don't know why I do not know I thought just some sort of shadiness there technical issues online block Brock Lesnar drug test number discrepancy in the mark hunt fight correct Mark soon for that so he had in the UFC when did the Jon Jones usada thing they tested and positive correct like what are you saying I buy by the way did test negative after the fight even for the metabolites so he for the picograms afterwards and after the fight numbers that what they're saying is that what he what his body has in it is a response to this Tara Thai detecting like anavar in his system with are detecting is it some tablet detecting is the body responding to the fact that this steroid had been in his system previously yes but they they do delegate okay we want you tell me why it's a joke this is why it's a joke because have you ever heard of any and before I say all this Jones is I think whether he did anything or not he's still the greatest man on the planet he doesn't need to stop doing to me cuz it's a joke is because the greatest fight on the planet ever enter the octagon has all these issues there is too much of a coincidence to me he has plenty of issues outside of that when you say all these issues you mean steroid issue first one being the Dominican up with the first one being the excuse of the dick pills okay but but it was like they actually got the dick pills they tested them this is all documented is it today. What they found were the precursors that can be found in take pills so if it's clenbuterol dick pills that he took and they had it in them correct so that means he's so they don't sweat in the amount that he had in his system what they're saying is the only way that could exist is to retain its supplement the way they tested him before the way they tested them after the what the small window of time where he was positive for that thing to be no performance-enhancing benefit them to take something in a microdose or whatever and that in such a small amount that it had to be a tainted supplement they got them the actual supplement that he took the dick pill supplement it had it in it contain that second he got punished for that this is not like a steroid that he took where made him a better fighter or made him a better athlete so to play devil's advocate here so that that stuff that comes in those dick pills and you can get from other steroids but it happens to be in those days nothing I'm saying you can do that that's true but it's in such a small amount in his body and it wasn't in his body before and it wasn't in his body after which show that it was only in his body and extremely small amounts for a small window won't take them out yet but a small window of time so it's not like he had it even like this stuff which is a metabolite which is showing a response to the body the body responding to the steroid why does no other fighter have any puke this pulsating effect really well that's not true mean the other fighting hair tested met Frank Mir tested positive for something at 2 years Tom lawlor textbook Frank Mir didn't go through the same steps that Jon Jones did he didn't provide them with I forget what the exact there was something that John did also that lowered his a sentencing in yes operator with usada yeah or agreeing to cooperate with you Sada yeah we're just cool with that and I don't even know what that means I don't either but I ask you this if I agreed to you Sada to be an informant I was undercover it's knit hat stitches her act unless you're John that no one can beat you out so you're fine but the thing is the only way I can inform you something that is not that I know of I can inform you of just off that's like you lay sheet that was what I asked Nowitzki I was like if you didn't do anything wrong like and what is he going to offer cuz if unless he took something that you know what you're doing like if I'm an informant for the FBI or for the feds for cocaine right now I know my cocaine going to get Joe Blow that makes my f****** Express so we can get the guy to know the ins-and-outs of cocaine that's on my God they have a conversation with him and he says he can provide them with information with how guys are getting away with passing drug test and how would you know about that unless you're in on them and I don't either I'm just saying to me all of it is a little too much of coincidence that the best fight on the planet that has these issues the best fight on the planet Earth also ran away from a hit-and-run smash into a girl and broke her arm he also drove his car into a tree he's a reckless person who a lot of chances and he does some at least in the past has done some things are not very wise this could social under That Could Fall In correct order to begin to play devil's advocate of anything or guy who was that loosey-goosey outside the Octagon might have taken some performance-enhancing sings cuz that would be the similar traits but could have except in this situation it doesn't line up with the facts of what he took in terms of long-term top light shorter metabolites and medium-term established. The only the only lonely long-term metabolites existed which means that whatever he took he had to take a long time ago not a problem with this is this all comes from that guy Gregory test what I'm talking about is the study that shows these metabolites is all from this one individual this guy Gregory tank off who was the man from that documentary Icarus used the Russian doping the state-sponsored doping program he's the one who established these tests and the ways doubt she's test is very highly criticized by people because it's and metabolites on himself and this has not been done on any peer review test outside of his research it hasn't been duplicated the problem is it's not legal to perform these sort of tests on people in America you can't just shoot people up with the legal steroid in America and find out what it does to them in but so they don't know they do that on Shelby Wacom up with a bunch of steroids teen for real you would do it yeah I don't know man I'm maintaining open mind but I'm not accusing anything but that again for me and this is just me it's too much of a coincidence coincidence 42re some red flags from a guy tried to two independent scientists outside of Nowitzki where I was sending guys information they were sending me back or sending them all the work that they did I send them all the relevant studies and one of them who was suspicious initially after reviewing all the stuff decided it doesn't seem like it's likely that it could be possible that he could have actually cheated he said it's more like he did during that time more likely that the actual the tainted supplement excuse is and by the way the team tainted supplement I'm using the air quotes supplement was never provided that supplement was never provided so unless they did it to you Sada Sada didn't want to release it the number one question was was it cocaine that was tainted with creatine that was the that was where people thought it came from because it's really cochranton Nowitzki when he was working for the government that would be a really common thing that creatine was used in cocaine to cut it because it looks like Coke and cuts with Coke to normal it's not toxic so they would always mix and cheap creatine with cocaine to make more coke make sense make sense and that's what that's what Nowitzki believed that's not what he believed but he believed that was a possibility I've heard all sorts of possibilities yeah actual truth yeah well you know we're not going to know that I think we know as much as we're going to know unless John comes out was John retires and so like if I had it I had a doctor and he would stick it in my fingernails seeing it slowly release some of my advanced microdosing get caught it tarnish your legacy unless it's like an MLB thing but so many people are quick to jump on the he's a cheater bandwagon I'm like man get got you to be careful with careful with that be careful that but also be careful with that but also you should be suspicious you should be suspicious. I don't think that if when you solder Nowitzki go it's all good man it was a dick till you cool man I don't I don't think you can do that well they lost a lot of money to do is to say he was cheating you know he's busted how much smoke here from it's okay to do that what it's not okay do is to say he was cheating Hughes but you know he's busted he only reasons why they have the stuff in the system that the</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> crazy fight but he was so nervous from that fight from the Steep a fight that he just did a terrible he just couldn't pull the trigger fast do a little more think he's the best in terms of what he's accomplished I think they doors the best heavyweight of all time turn to what is a compass maybe maybe you can make the argument for 4 BC over Doom because we're doing beat them but I think for Doom BF a door that already been through the wringer and pride and you know they all the chaos over there I mean he had been those Wars with f****** Crow, but it was still the aura who's the first one where it where you realize you only know because Brett Rogers I took a little bit out of that and he starched f****** prey on them but before that he had trouble with them it was it wasn't an easy fight it wasn't an easy fight effusion respect brat right he did a Prokop like I mean your Crow Hop f****** punch and leaped and size did you put his skill-set with his frame now into the the the pool if I don't know if he's the best but they are paying at his time when there's JDs and he's in his prime and Brock Lesnar he's beating those guys what can we do to people he would overwhelm you in a way that look like you were drowning his cardio in in Pace was insane insane like they took so much out of Junior both of them both of them paid the price listen to who's the Box you just had on from the rematch with Canelo Triple G just takes so much out those guys. They're never the same unmute I'm usually on the same thinking path is that from a cat those guys go out again we're never going to get it like a product I can for sure mean it's it's specially the third fight that was crazy people in life best heavyweight of all time he's the greatest terms of like his accomplishments he defended his title more than anybody he didn't fight the best guys in their Prime when he fought junior junior was definitely passes promise knocked on him right now. Jordan turn that are by far the best LeBron right now by far the best bright it's significantly don't know each other so that's that's the question about like why why is there no talk about him fighting again like why have they not set something up we know that's the firefighter humble Blue Collar dude he's going to put in work comes to fight all the time so Derrick Lewis explains turn it down steep a fight Derek says they wanted me to feisty pants short notice I wanted some time off I was still fights to pay but not right now not so soon especially if you're fighting guy like DC who's more of a wrestler then go into fights deep a I know I wanted some time off so they're try again steep a fight so they were trying to get them for the UFC's Brooklyn especially if you're funny guy like DC who's more of a wrestler then go into fights deep a I know I wanted some time off so they're tracking steep a fight so they were trying to get them for the UFC Brooklyn car this weekend was that this weekend but it's smart of Derrick Lewis when you go DC than Steve a the compete to worst matchup storm didn't get paid yeah YouTube eating</div>
