		<div class="paragraph"> if you go to the Congo you got to go walk through the stress that has that giant chimp living in it do you know that the belt that the bundle huge 200-plus pound Champs images of dead ones see if he can go to theirs if you just Google Bondo ape there's some really good to see that one upper left-hand Corner Jamie yeah but that picture I don't think is real I want to say that's fake Congo's giant Bondo ape that's the first evidence of one they were found they they shot this thing and they took pictures of it but I believe that was in the 1930s and then they got another one that they shot at an airport and these guys are opposing with this thing thinks he can find out what that's it at the bottom the very bottom that right there bang look at that go go full-screen the larger so that is this thing that call the Bondo ape and has a Crest on its skull like a gorilla yeah yeah it's not like I did not disclose not shaped like a chimpanzee skull and so go back to the picture please that's okay but because it's not a very clear picture and he's got shot this at an airport and the hog onto I mean the men behind it I don't know how big they are but let's assume they're tiny and they're 5 foot 5 that thing is 510 yeah yeah probably well north of 200 lb champ but that's the cool thing is this is a weird subspecies that's only in this I think it's called Billy in the Congo and they call it these are called the bili ape or they call it the the Bondo ape but it's an enormous trap photo of one of them walking upright and it's about 6 ft tall upper left-hand Corner that one yeah they said by measuring the stuff around it they think that that is a 6ft tall chimpanzee walking through the f****** jungle nasus guide there's a guy named Carl Armand he's a I think it's from Switzerland the wildlife photographer and he spent a considerable amount of time trying to find these things and take photos of them because of all the descriptions death of the natives have these enormous chimpanzees mainly got video of one of them eating a Jaguar they don't know if it killed it or who found it dead but the local is possible but now they have actual video of them not quite chimpanzee when they first got I'm pretty sure they thought it was a hybrid they thought like a gorilla f***** a champ but can I borrow and then now they think it's a totally different subspecies of a chimpanzee so there is Forest so that's where you got to go bro give me the sun. I think the Congo itself is wider than the United States I think there's more land mass in the in the Congo just an amazing and CBC documentary on the Congo from many years ago but they spend 29 x 29 x big in the Congo okay stop. 200 and 342000 square km but the width of it I think it's the with 75 million people images of f****** giant chimp living in there and all kinds of other s*** all all sorts sorts have you seen that shoebill bird that lives there no oh my God the five foot tall dinosaur of a bird is an enormous face spaces like this big and it looks like like it doesn't look real like walking around with the weight of the shoebill will you look I'm in the eye and you're like what the f*** is that is that real that look like the most ferocious looking bird it look like that right there yeah David Attenborough first discovered went to Madagascar elephant bird went extinct how long ago were the eggs were about it about was half a foot with a football Ho Lee fuk I need for big but I came across the elephant bird egg shells they're about this steak is well maybe quarter half a centimeter in sick and thickness and they just scattered across the southern beaches of Madagascar thousands holyshit they're huge how many years ago they went extinct how many of these things have been collected North America the terror Birds now f*** that 7ft tall murderous carnivorous birds that couldn't fly running around North America Birds he's searching overtime in this episode traffic and you just had right there Jamie in the middle yeah I think that was like a a CGI documentary that they had done on one is virtuals I only one click David dangerous as well you know we talkin about people that believe in witches and people that believe in witchcraft like Pac-Man you almost had to have some belief system to keep you going cuz you had no idea it was around the next corner so these Terror birds were alive I believe in human beings are alive right when did these things when were these things alive if I had to guess I'm going to guess they died out million years ago 62 to 1.8 million years ago 62 million to 1.8 temporal range covers from 62 to 1.8 million years ago so I think it's 62 million at 62 years ago do stuff live in living with the camel spider yes giant blob thing Avatar residential short faced bear rdr2 way bigger than a polar bear and super carnivorous they think it might have been the thing that kept human beings from successfully navigating the Trek to the Bering land mass where they went extinct they're huge picture of a guy sitting next to a recreation of a short faced bear and it's it's so big I think people probably hunting them off they don't really know to get an image of a short faced bear that's a ridiculous animal that I don't even know existed until a few years ago oh man you just would not Venture Out imagine how big that is a cartoon comic book version of a bear but you can't believe we're looking at this thing we're literally this thing standing up these gentlemen it was just assumed there somewhere the neighborhood 6 feet tall this thing is their entire height plus a couple of feet so double their entire hitesh Desai plus a couple of feet crossword DQ exert their head this thing standing up and they're at their heads are like right around where his hip bone is although he is on a little bit about 15 feet maybe stay more ridiculous it's ridiculous as it is without him being on a mound why do you have them you trying to make it even crazier it's crazy enough but super predatory yeah African lion that used to live here</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know all that power already like why would I why would he want to be the president just seems like such a f****** hellacious job unless you really feel like he can fix things or he's really going to make a ton of money from it I mean this the guy who played towards the end of my life I was so weird it's so weird cuz it's it's another version of what many people did with Obama in this weird way in that when Obama got in office there was all these are really really irrational people that said all kinds of crazy shouldn't buy a trump was amongst them he was a birther remember for the longest time he was convinced somebody convinced him I don't know who convinced him I don't know if he really relinquish didn't realize he was wrong or if you still hold on to the idea that he ever really believe I don't know you know I don't know but you know who started that whole birthing Hillary Clinton yeah she did that's right that's something was even forget it was during the the campaign between her and Obama when they were trying to get the nomination in 2008 he's Muslim and you know and Trump is ran with that yea or a lot of Republicans did too cuz you know why I guess that's just how they play politics they have something like that they just run with it just so strange to say similar to the name of the guy that crashed those planes and it's ours and somebody have a Joe really good well Road joke I don't know who it was though maybe Tony Hinchcliffe but I mean this is almost as a similar reaction I don't mean it's less it's more rational or less rational what I mean is almost like the energy of the reaction like the energy of the birthers and the guys who were convinced that he was some sort of undercover Muslim and then he was going to get into white house and try to take America down from the inside like that feeling that the amount of energy that way is mirrored now on the left maybe even though you maybe the past I would say probably I might not be right cuz I might not be remembering it perfectly but I feel like the energy on the left of people getting mad at Trump is more powerful or more there's more to it than the energy that I saw four people in the right the water bomb at all but it might just be my memory yeah cuz you know most of the people who were talking s*** about Obama were pretty old write write in a lot of the people now that are pissed are really young so they're more likely to take to the streets and yeah smash things and hold up signs and act wild and s*** and Maze people and they were the protesters, came the next day but wait when Bush was inaugurated the protesters were all there the day of and you-know-who Bush couldn't even do the little traditional walk down the last few blocks of the the journey because there was so many protesters people were just throwing things at the motorcade and s*** so I mean like this is not unusual but that was towards the end I think we're thinking of different ones okay I think I my memories f***** up but I think there was one towards the end where they had planned on having him walk down some long stretch yet they had to abandon it and get him into a car is that the same Towers so right after Clinton same as what you see now because people that had this Democrat and power for 8 years and they thought like yeah and I thought Gore's a shoe-in cuz Clinton popular same as like Hillary's a shoe-in cuz Obama's popular but you know a republican ended up taking it and and they just freaked out and it seems like I'd always just happens I mean like this kind of like backlash like it always is kind of sold to us like this is new this is my all wow look at what's going on now in this crazy what crazy times we live in but it's going back at my memories of the past and it seems like this is pretty par for the course I think you're right now that I'm thinking about it's almost like we go through these like cycles and if a president gets passed one cycle removed from his his tenure then people forgive them they forget and they change their opinion like Reagan was kid Reagan was a pariah like people were so upset about Reagan there were so upset in there was the Contra versus Nicaragua trial that was on television with Oliver North and we're finding out on TV like whether or not the government had sold arms and lied about it and weather and then you know that the whole Dragon thing with one that Reagan sold arms to Iran the great Jimmy tingle hilarious dad comedian Boston has bit about it cuz they was when Reagan start a claim with Alzheimer's or when he claimed memory issues which turned out to be true and you really did have memory issues in to probably get at a time but they asked him did you sell arms to Iraq's that I don't know and chimmy Tangles like mr. president if you ever sell to people who hate us jot it down is like make a note put it on the refrigerator today I sold arms to people who hate me you to hear him say you have to realize though like America's always been a huge arms dealer in we're constantly selling weapons oh yeah I mean like if he if he didn't remember why he did it it's probably because there were just so many other transactions I don't think the president personally get involved too much in that sort of stuff but I'll probably more country sells weapons all over the place and we continue to do that my point was at like eight years later he was the great Ronald Reagan 8 years later Clinton administration everybody's done with Clinton getting his dick sucked in the white house and all that craziness and and then as soon as that's over people start reminiscing to Reagan it's really interesting it's it's really interesting how we do it and so now Bush went through this. Of being hated and he's out of opposite Obama goes to his. Being hated for 8 years and now that an even more unreasonable Republicans office along to the bush day skip doing interviews and like remember this war criminal now he's okay he's Uncle Bush super import what is that protest during the Bush Administration yeah it just happens over and over again and people think it's new and you know for something I think I guess it's it's the country just has a short memory what a crazy show this is what a crazy show we're watching the battle to control the world a political theater working together behind the scenes and it 90% of the issues they agree on they just make a big spectacle of the little things they actually disagree on too you know distract us with a show whatever yeah you know distract us with a show new look America look look at us we're fighting we're fighting have they stopped paying attention Okay now we do the Real Deals who we going to bomb who invade you know who we going to sell weapons to whatever yeah</div>

Seems weird because like he's mr. like I'm going to go like he just Patrol janky or the other day cuz I thought that was funny his his impression of Jen Krueger is f****** fun it is pretty spot the one that he did when he played Anna and Jake back and forth I didn't see that it up he'll let us use it like I like Steven Crowder I do I really do I think is a good guy I just he's a little bit heavy on the right-wing he gets a little silly it like this like the status of any sense of humor about it I was very seriously for some reason look did I already got to be able to make fun of yourself I recently sat down we did this spot we went and watched a bunch of Young Turks videos so we can put out the special drunken peasants versus The Young Turks video we we shot about 5 hours of us watching Young Turks videos and just tearing it apart and one of things I noticed is what jenkel do and and watch for this if you ever watching this s*** he'll have his panels say something that's like super crazy left-wing like someone will say it like animals say it or one of the Steven or whatever or whoever's got on Ben mankiewicz whatever they'll say something that's real far left-wing and then it'll cut to jink and Jake will have more of like a moderate left-wing opinion and then it'll go back to them and they'll immediately capitulate to Jake like so I don't know if that's like by Design or if they're just they feel like they need to capitulate to him because they're scared of him or something or or what is definitely a lot of emotions going on there too so a lot of emotion in the way they describe things that some people I think at least initially connected to that but then they see where it gets problematic if you dealing with any like really serious issue and you want to debate justifacts like and have your ducks in a row Harris debate like most people that was like the first like major chink in the changcuter armor I never know how to pronounce his first names when you said that way I was like you kind of user agreements and they don't handle the best way they could and then those things escalate and they come sound and then it becomes who you are and then you defending who you are and then you're always trying to argue with people about who you are and what you've done and like that's when you're gone yeah that's when you're over the top it's like you're talking about s*** that's happening in the world that's all you're doing that's all any of us are doing what you're doing is you're talking about s*** so if you got a bunch of people listening to you talk it's just talking about s*** the end of the day you don't get any extra points because more people are listening or more people are watching your point isn't more valid your point still has to stand up in the marketplace of ideas yeah then yours is just as valid as his is just as valid as mine if the delivery system is a bigger delivery system it doesn't mean that like everybody has to stop and take you into account because you had more success in this market and when him and Alex Jones battle back and forth between who gets the most viewers and who has the most liked holyshit this is ridiculous like what when did you see when Alex went on to this game King on that's on for talking Alex Jones did you know it's important that guy Jimmy Dore there's some good stuff stuff to put some really good videos up he's done some really good work. played a very deceptive version of the Milo clip and he credited us basically as a podcast and talk about us like we're doing this podcast from a basement somewhere or something that a podcast like yours would like if it was more than that he would have to say the name of the podcast ending of a lot of media did that to us there was like the transcripts of the Milo episode where was like and then unknown host said this like f*** you supposed to be like journalist but then had stuff of yours where they didn't even I didn't know that I thought they'd all the s*** was coming from my podcast cuz I got a text message from my friend Chris McGuire informing me of all of it and so I went and I said well this isn't even my podcast and then I realize like he was on your podcast to and they combine the two different lines going to stop people say like he was on Joe Rogan's drunken peasants podcast like wow people are supposed to trust you for information the media is a f****** joke well the media now is is total f****** J's like a few places we can still trust like where I'm hoping you round the answer the goddamn f****** thing any of these institutions have to say that's what I like like Ice princesses like I mean I mean is smart really</div>

It showed the bodega for you and above the law his Aikido skills were very legit he was very legit weather not that stuff's really not that's the subject for debate whether or not it's really effective when you look at other things like wrestling and Jiu-Jitsu is it the most effective way to grow or Judo is the most effective I know it's not but no one knew that back then and he at the time in the 1980s and 90s was a world-class martial artist he just had a style but old didn't really prove to be the best stop but so did I but I always doing tiger this is hard to kill a lot of people doing Kung Fu a lot of people doing things that they thought were legit but they really wants the UFC came around we found that all this is not the best way to do it.

the people that love to dress up nice and go and behaved kind and and and see all the people in the community at the church there's a good feeling that people get from going to church but the fact is connected to that is it's it's so insane that it's still there it's so insane that it hasn't been rooted out but this is still a giant problem and relatively few people are going to do like a relatively few like you know who they wanted they wanted that ratzinger that Pope ratzinger that's one of the reasons why he had to step down and other reasons why he stays in the Vatican I was reading some article about them bringing up charges of crimes against humanity against it that other countries wanted to do that because this case to ship kids or he's to ship priests to places where they wouldn't get in trouble at the others one guy was accused of molesting boys and so we ship them to this place where you work with Dad death kids a molested over a hundred deaf kids so what did you do like you who shipped a child molester to bunch of people that wouldn't be able to talk about it well but you'd be able to get away with it easier there if they settle a case that means it doesn't get prosecuted right so that's why they won't go to jail is that why they haven't gone to jail I don't understand it Jenna Court like they don't keep Prosecuting I guess if you make us like the person decides to drop charges if there was a guy mission where everybody for the most part is like a humble around them and scared of them and they have power like I remember when my grandmother died we went to a funeral and the guy couldn't remember name my grandma's name is Josephine he kept calling her Geraldine and the priest who was delivering the service we had to interrupt them sites Josephine and he was like annoyed but they interrupt him so I can yes Josephine like he he changed the network he didn't even know her name and when he's there to deliver this God's message for the last you know last time the family's going to view the body and he doesn't know her name and when he was corrected he was angry at us like he had these Gin Blossoms all over his face he's just some weird old guy who got tricked into this very change life and now it said attend and he's been living with robes on supposedly being celibate so f****** life while people kiss his ass pretend to be something special because he talks about the word of God but you just seen that one moment where he wasn't even embarrassed that he said the wrong name he was upset that people were correcting him cuz you don't correct priests so he's used to that so there's no one checking him there's no one checking them at all everyone who goes there is in this state of worship and they're the ones who deliver the word of God dressed like Wizards like they're the only people in society that are allowed to dress like Wizards in modern American society they dress like f****** Wizards and we'll like yeah that's how he father dresses father dresses like a wizard like but you know how people going to look back at that and go why didn't they think the outfits were weird why didn't they think it was silly that this pedophile dresses up like a wizard and you're not supposed to say anything to him what is that like what is what what is what the outfits the fact that all that s*** still around I just know where in the Bible that says priests have to dress like that no one know where the whole thing is topaz are its you wearing stuff that made you look like you were very special to really poor people 500 years ago that's what you're wearing you wearing stuff that would impress people that do any better than probably couldn't read and so before Martin Luther translated these the the scriptures so the people can read it like a phonetic language before that people have no idea what the priests were reading they just relied on the priest they relied on the priest to tell them what the word of God was now so they could read it for themselves and Martin Luther was saying eat yourself to call my God play something Used to Be Alive until I can really remember they would say something cuz I remember I be 5 years old in the f*** are they aggressive I believe I believe in God I believe that my father was in heaven I believe that I punish it then I got to do is the Catholic school and not just f****** I'm completely because I believe but I didn't believe on the tail end of it if it was supposed to be loving lies is non smacking me why is it not hitting me with a f****** ruler what was the underlying and then I saw the anger in their heart and it turned me off completely like I didn't like it today I'm Still A Guy some boards when my body goes like to go through f****** Church you know but I don't hold it I remember selling cars and Boulder and a guy came in and we started talking and he was 50 wasn't a good-looking guy look like that f****** guy in Hammock I want to hear old chick with them obviously have to take a demo ride I figured out that he could f*** her and s*** somewhere that cuz I've been eating I realize that he was f****** her she was like his receptionist to

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you bring up some really fascinating subjects and we were talking right before the podcast about social media and how weird it is that you got lumped in with the alt right for a comment saying something along the lines of that you find what was the exact quote something on the highly intelligent people seem to which not saying they're good people. equate them with the skinheads and neo-nazis carrying the tiki torches in Internet discussion groups I know some of them former students and some of them are highly intelligent but that's not what people think of when they think of you start that movement I had a fetus but so many people jumped on it as if you were endorsing the alt-right is an exact quote you were just basically saying something one wants of a lot of intelligent people that are involved in this privy to the truth that the establishment can't handle you can't handle the truth and since it was never discussed in the open there are no counter-arguments to some of the most toxic interpretations and so the alt-right can run with the never never having been in a forum where these things are debated and criticized put into context they take like one fact and then they draw the most extreme conclusions if these things were debated in the first place that you realized average differences between men and women and a lot of psychological traits if that's quite taboo and intellectual circles for I think bizarre reason women's rights depend on men and women being indistinguishable whatever trade you name that men on average are better at than women or vice-versa there are a lot of women who are better than a lot of men or vice versa. So you can't really judge an individual from the average of that there was there sex also even though there are some traits We're Men score will better than women there someplace where women score blue better than men and that that's the complete picture but the thing is it if the entire subject is out of bounds you never get a complete picture what were your thoughts on how the subject got out of bounds cuz it's it's very confusing to me that certain subjects like the differences between genders are so taboo when they seem so obvious and you just could go to the mall and just look at the way the men dress in the women dress you wore the some obvious distinctions here fit men with intellectual in women we're not in women were governed by their emotions and there we thought too much it would take blood away from their ovaries and that woman they wouldn't be fertile and then maybe I'll miserable really like crazy stuff and has a reaction to that in the 70s when the second wave of feminism became prominent it became almost an article of faith that there were no differences between men and women and so if you say that their differences between total non-sequitur because fairness is not the same as sameness obviously women should have equal rights to men whether or not they're caught exact copies of man or have distinctive profile as men have a distinct profile but it was just a mistake to to complete the issue of women's rights with men and women being identical but that's the way it kind of shook out and it became kind of an article of faith in in a lot of in some feminists some liberal circles that many women have to be identical and they aren't that means you're Trader youv2 to women's equality obit about out of my art when we're looking at the reaction to this though what was strange to me was how many people seemed like they wanted to jump on board and criticize you and I think a lot of it is almost like to take away some of the potential criticism of themselves like it's instant claiming of the moral High Ground virtue signaling and it's just very disappointed when you see this from intellectuals and college professors and it is better too much trouble from from my peers and among the professor's grad students under a couple of trolls who who who ran with it the buy a large the mainstream reaction was it was almost a sign of the New York Times put it that social media is making us stupid subtle discussions does discussions that involve Nuance like complicated issues that are complex that they require a long-distance sort of description of the issue and a very complex sort of take on these various differences between men and women and the alt right and the left and political breakfast something that you can smash into a very short soundbite and completely cover your take on things all the more reason that they shouldn't be taboo because he I can't discuss them then the only interpretation you can have as a simplistic one if you could bring them out in the open and you can start to have that discussion</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm going to do podcast and him with subtitles in Spanish that I'm bringing him up here on Friday in Spanish with subtitles and then I'm going to bring him up here on Friday and willing to have a 3-way about Cuba what it was like the rest on the whole thing if you don't mind it would be a real haven't met you can really throw him out of the Oaks Rush agua or Russia and you train and that's why a lot of Cubans are judokas because they go to rush and learn Judo why so he will tell you how they shipped him off and it'll just tell your mom like we'll take him tomorrow that was what a lot of people did George St-Pierre success and wrestling in the Georgian wrestling college or in high school but he trained with a bunch of Russian Nationals in Montreal and apparently phenomenal wrestlers they have this incredible wrestling program like when you see when you see nurmagomedov the way he malls people inside the Octagon like what in the f*** like that is like a perfect example that likes style of super hard super technical wrestling they're so good at it this so many lomachenko used to be a wrestler videos it looks like he's got like a Gyan and it's him and some other cat and he's like 11 years old or something like that but his father put him in everything his father made him you know lomachenko is literally one of the most technically beautiful to watch boxers that's ever lived with this guy used to wrestle to okay is this him wrestling with somebody yeah this is one now we can still do this s*** this is like pretty recent like you showed some of his wrestling moves but the other one was him when he was a little boy like he's really tactical man he knows how to wrestle this is legit I can you see the way he's moving his body is not faking that he's done that a bunch of times and he had this one when he's a little kid man it says Greco-Roman wrestling exactly sure what it is but he gets his kid and gets behind him and send him for a ride so he was he's always been an amazing athlete like in every I think there's there's something to that there's something to his father had an idea to crazy ideas father took him out of boxing and put them in a dance for like several years Ukrainian traditional dance style apparently they were talking about it on one of those HBO shows but for four years I think he just danced imagine that as far as like you want to learn how to box you got to dance and now nobody's got for Clerk people did ballet did you ever think of the GSP but you know me on my PS3 probably f****** not ballet but he's one step ahead of you at every turn like he knows what you're going to do right while you're doing it he's moving in the way that you can't move he's in front of you and then he's not it's crazy like he's the one of the most Technic boxers I've ever seen it just an amazing stylistic achievement like what he can do with his body his style totally unique I mean every but a lot of guys have done it a lot of guys have moved in a lot of guys have done it but he doing it at such a high level such a high level that it makes people confused guys quit in their Corner they like what in the f*** and I really think a lot of it probably had to do with his father's cross training and it particularly with the dance I mean think about how effortlessly he goes like Steps around guys I mean he's got some incredible control of his feet but it makes sense that like you would learn how to move your feet in a specific way the weren't the way you weren't learn how to move your hands in a specific way right like think about a guy like Floyd Mayweather write his hand combinations with his upper body there so precise is 70% or 80% lomachenko's probably perfectly proportioned for his style with his ability to move but also also his ability to box and hit you well he's got both things going on at the same time with Next Level angles so that's why I was saying what I was hearing back from them in the early 70s was like they just took you away from your family that I was part of your training you know your then they put you in there go ahead and do you know what you train them like their army have you talked to you about this I already have graphics on the podcast I figured that I put them up and we'll do a podcast whatever one of those movies people think of unique okay there you have it because his his English is too rough for me and I know what he's trying to say in the frustration in his face Buick Romeros back see if you can find these nuts</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what the UFC card for this weekend so I can see who's on the card for that what's the line that you're on right now so you can little bit plus-plus 1054 under so I guess the money is on the over right now it's - 135 in the f****** money being yoga with people like it's very slight though okay look it up this Diego Ferreira is the favorite over Anthony Pettis play home the given right kissing she's a favorite Holly Topman she's very tough paint is one of those chicks that like she's had some last second wins like against Ashlee evans-smith one of those like wild is endings in a female fight she gets her know Bulldog choke and chokes are unconscious with blood spraying out of her forehead it was a wild finish man CD find that finish Ashlee evans-smith. Raquel Pennington finishes Ashlee evans-smith so right now what is that look like Donald Cerrone against, what's the money look like I don't understand moneyline I don't know I would I would be just talking out of my ass you better hundred bucks on Irwin and he wins a fight you'd get to 60 so you collect 360 and if you bet $100 on Conor you have to bet 320 bucks to to win a hundred on Conner - 320 the only way you can win this weekend is with Connor and you see, going in there knocking about in the first round in the Yonder but if, if bucko wrestles them and it goes five rounds I don't see a lot of people back in Connor in the old kind of looks so good that people expecting kind of going that this is how I can write out this is Raquel Penningtons fight so just go to like towards the end of it is wild fight then and Ashlee evans-smith is the woman who beat Fallon Fox the transgender fighter she stopped her in her fight right before she came to the UFC this was just a wild fight man these girls were going to war and so at the very last I mean I think it was like the last second of the fight she's locking her up in this Bulldog choke and this is why it is spraying Rahat Ali don't show the finished UFC a sneaky like that they don't ways to the tap or The Knockout like I don't get it guys I work for you I love you show everybody that choke why you hiding the choke and you want maybe she was a time constraint but she got her in this Bulldog choke blood is squirting out of her head and then at the end of the the buzzer she lets go and the girls out cold and it was just like one of those play see something that's just Primal this moment in fights or just Primal you know it sometimes those moments like they're almost surreal like when Francis ngannou knockout Alistair Overeem crazy fight I almost wish more people knew how tough rosenstreich is UCC to fight with Alistair Overeem and he go well I'll store was kind of out pointing him and then he caught house to slip in really would like 10 seconds left to go to fight and he was Obama broke his lip open that's true we still absorb everything announced throughout them did never look like he gets shook it all we're talking about a guy in Dallas knocked out you know it was the K1 Grand Prix Champion knocked out Todd duffee and pride up and knocked out on boys and he needed your boy that f****** the Great White Hope you know what's his name does the allister of today he's got a long career that he's just as durable and it's big as he was when he fought Brock Lesnar is really two different guys at this point but still roses strike is a f****** beast he's so strong man and he's got legit kickboxing skills it seems to me it seems to me that Conor McGregor has an advantage in being able to close the distance and in maybe a speed Advantage this is a perceived thing based on seeing them fight different people Cowboy when he's at his best is remarkably well-rounded and I think he's more well-rounded than Connor I think cowboy has a lot of tools that people forget about particularly his takedowns or excellent Cowboy can submit the f*** out of you he submits a lot of people he's nasty off his back he's got Wicked triangle I can see give this one to the ground Connor getting submitted by cowboy in a triangle what I couldn't see is Cowboy getting submitted by Connor and a triangle I can see I can see Cowboys Dominicana I would I don't think it's impossible for Connor to submit Cowboy but I don't see it I think Connor can win by knockout yes he's very fast yet his left hand is a f****** piston and he's sneaky and he's got nasty uppercuts and he's Killer Instinct when you have you heard you f****** bombs on you and Eddie Alvarez fight is the best example that Eddie Alvarez was a world-class fighter and Conor McGregor took it to him like no one has ever done in his career tuned him up made him look like he had no business in the in the cage with them now for Eddie said he just fought a bad fight and I believe I'm in the 82 World fighter but the point is in Ingo time Conor McGregor handles pressure is better as much or better as good as well or anyone has ever lived has pressure so well this is Floyd Mayweather with an uppercut in a fight we so outclassed he has zero boxing matches and he's fighting the greatest boxer of all time in one of the biggest pay-per-view cards ever it's nuts right we can handle pressure he lost that fight because floors are way better boxer but he handled the pressure pressure gets Aldo talk so much guess in front of them flat lines in 13 seconds perfect punch perfect execution left hand before that steps back he Dives in with the Left Bank catches them coming in its perfect Under Pressure he's not the kind of Grappler that nurmagomedov his he's not in that category terrified of and at least made into the fourth round right was in the fourth round submission and he probably wasn't really prepared for that fight you think about how much time you've been off for MMA how much time you've been working on you know just boxing and then spending all that money to be made like a hundred million dollars the question for me is who is kind of right now is is Conor McGregor the same guy that knocked out. When he was a Savage is he the same guy that knocked out Diego brandao is he easy is he same guy that knocked out Jose Aldo is he the same down knocked out Eddie Alvarez or is he just some new thing cuz all this money and all this Fame and all this attention and likes to party and what is he now if he's the same guy and physically there should be no reason why he hasn't he hasn't taken a terrible beatings even then never coming off why you stopped him to choke if he is the same God physically and he decides he wants to let the fuckingworld know that he can still do it in how much money you have in the bank he wants to let the world know he's here to f*** people up and he's here to reclaim his crops if he goes into the fight with that attitude I mean we could certainly see a Resurgence the question is always been whether or not a rich man has the motivation to work like a poor man and he's a very rich man we don't know everybody's different Mayweather fought hard to the day he died or is it she's going to the day he retired and Mayweather when he was during his career was rich like from a couple years and he was rich he was rich so he was always rich and still fought like the best in the world and still trained like you have to train to be the best water type of gaps was he taking them between fights guys this is been a long gap before it's not fair it'll bring a real world again what you heard me telling Jamie was basically this in a real-world Cerrone last 5 fights beat Al iaquinta though and look real f****** good doing it so he's lost to the gaethje fight and he beat my pairing which was a really good fight for him cuz Mike Perry is a big scary guy throws bombs so beat him lots of Leon Edwards I think you was sick coming in at 5 but you know lost either way and beat Yancy Medeiros in a while I'm just saying that in the real world my people looking at them I don't think there's going to be that easy of a fight I like it I like the over I love the older I don't know I can't pick up that side yet yeah but I love the old but I can see everybody back McGregor win round one and something crazy happened I mean in a perfect world you know maybe his chin has been a little suspect lately Donald I don't know I don't think so look fighting the toughest guys don't look everybody's chin suspect if Darren till is smashing your f****** nose open with an elbow that dude's an animal and he's big as f*** when Darren till fight Cowboy he's so much bigger than him there's a difference between a really big welterweight and a guy who came up from lightweight there until the giant dude that means nicknames the gorilla so here we go the young tough guy was talking mad s*** but there's a giant difference between no disrespect to Hernandez and Conor McGregor Conor McGregor's used to those Bright Lights man he shines he shines as bright lights give me the question is really just whether or not he has the motivation to train and fight like a f****** madman again like you did when he was younger when he was smashing people in for cowboy It's whether or not he can survive the early storm I think getting his leg kicks working would be very big Biscuit take that long stance car takes that long stance and he fights right leg 40 fights out bar and if Donald can f****** that right leg he can figure out a way to attack that right leg needs the body coming in got a void the punches though he's up there with but I guarantee Woodley's will leave him doing some wrestling takedown cuz he knows that's where the money is really has a big fight coming up with he's going to fight Leon Edwards and Leon Edwards is a dangerous man it's like that's a that's a big fight and Leon Edwards for whatever reason is not known as much as he is skillful you know he beat Cowboy like you said and he's the guy that got that crazy bra with mods without backstage Boswell that's the guys are tough tough tough guy super highly-skilled guy and Leon Edwards and Tyron Woodley there's a very high-stakes fight that a lot of people are talking about my daddy fight for the number one Contender because it's tiring emerged or of Leon emerges and it's and it's a big fight and it didn't the fight goes well that person is almost certainly at least considered other than Mazda doll who's the fan favorite and the rematch those are the two possibilities that the rematch with Kobe new smok other than that you want to see you want to see the winner of Tyron Woodley and Leon Edwards it just makes sense make sense of doubt be the next one or moths but all those those that's how I would look at it there's a lot of options for that division on Beats boy and decides he feels great this way he feels confident now dedicated he wants to make a run at the f****** Champ there's a big size difference between it was mine and Connor Usman is a big person he's got a thick giving is f***** to I think Mazzio's in The Sweet Spot he's not too big or acid kill himself to make a way but he's obviously knockout welterweight easily he's knocked out a lot of wealth which I mean the the Ben askren want his f****** Preposterous but of course just even the beating that he's putting on Nate Diaz Boswell can f*** people out there 170 I think him versus Connor would be insane Scott wolter easily he's knocked out a lot of welterweights I mean the the Ben askren one is f****** Preposterous but of course just even the beating that he's putting on Nate Diaz maza.com f*** people out that 170 I think him versus Connor would be insane</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> remember dog being a f****** kid on a Saturday and watching dude come Kim and Mancini f*** out of each other cuz that was live done ybc absolutely the reason why they changed the number for $15 12 after that guy died what was that again remember today that's crazy on you Area February of 83 guy was a tough motherfuking Ray Boom Boom Mancini but the topic motherfuker this is 1979 who is 21 years old is this a duck who can fight so maddening killed somebody when you're 21 years old in a fight that is Hardcore man that's a hard pill to swallow what was the ABO things and then also probably probably how to make weight a lot of deaths in boxing apparently happened in the lower weight classes new one of the reasons is that when these guys actually entering fights a lot of times are still dehydrated they would dehydrate them so pretty bad in the Wayans to get to whatever weight class it was like 1:34 but he probably weighs you know 134 in quarters when he weighed in he probably walks around like 1:50 ish or something like that and they dehydrate themselves is very difficult to rehydrate the brain apparently it's not as quick and easy as it is rehydrating the body and even that takes some time so most of the deaths in box have occurred most of them still very dangerous even for the heavyweight division there was a guy wanted to a coma Russian guy in a in a fight a few years back but in a lighter weight divisions they think it's generally when people get more more more likely to die from fights and I think it might have something to do with cutting weight but it's also like really skillful people punch each other in the Gerald McClellan fight it's a good example. There was I too because Gerald McClellan who was just a straight-up murderer when he was a light heavyweight really struggle to make white man real bad and then one fight with Nigel Benn Nigel Benn got off the deck and look like he was out and made it back into the ring fought his ass off and then started taking it to Gerald but this don't come Kim right here again yeah and now it's the end of the fight after Ray Mancini stopped him everybody's copy and then the guy slides into a coma wind up dying so he's sitting there like so he's he's really battered they think again I think it might have something to do with cotton weight it's a f****** horrible horrible way to go man but killer be killed that's what he signed up for I think it might have something to do with cotton weight it's a f****** horrible horrible way to go man but killer be killed that's what he signed up for that way too</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> try to make a move on you know ya when you work a couple times from five towels the scariest one once when I was 13 when I was 13 I was in Boston what time it happened before but a library and save me I was like eight hose in San Francisco and I was really in a Monster books back then was in the monster movies Monster books and was looking at these books and creepy dude came over to me and you said you like Monster books and I said yeah and he said well I have books in my car if you want to come see him I said okay eight-years-old those dumb sorry walking behind him in the library and screams out Joseph you get away from him he just got out of jail all my God they got ran and I ran to the library and she hugged me and I was crying so very scary no number one box on that f****** an hour and a half and then Below in a guy pulls up in my ride yeah I get in there and I still remember how he acted like from the beginning of a minute I got in something wasn't right as energy wasn't right and he's already had he thought he had pray will kind of clumsy he was clumsy and at the light he want for the boy you like playing basketball D1 football only touch my dick like he slipped and Kelly crazy if you like it and Joe Rogan f*** with that was basic and I always think about that like why didn't people approach right I knew today looking back I still remember three guys in my high school teacher that would come on as a basketball group and I found out and I always doing a little weird about not married and up and then years ago somebody said yeah he was sucking kids dicks at the field s*** I had a guy slope Lane at a lake who's the guy that used to run around the lake and talk to some more fishing probably 13 me and my friend Josh particular would go this one Lake was in town and fish there all the time and this dude will come by all the time and visit he's always friendly start-off real normal what are you guys up to catch the fish like a Southern accent seem like an old gentleman and then a couple times he came when it was just me and then he just shut down next to me talk to me and I was naive I was 13 I just thought he was a real nice guy like almost like a older brother type figure it's going to give you a good advice you talked about coolshit it was a teacher who got kicked out of his position for some unfair reason he wouldn't really be specific about it but he said they didn't like the way you taught and so anyway this dude just becomes my friend like nice and slow nice and slow brings me lunch even went to his house and then one day I am fishing and he's drunk and he tells me he loves me and I said I think I said something like I really like you to it goes you know there Can't Be Love without sex and I remember thinking what was like what did he just what happened and I remember thinking what a dummy I am I thought this guy just liked me he was I was his buddy but he's going to teach me things just like teaching people just really smart and I had my hand on a knife I had a Swiss army knife from the little red plastic ones know the ones with the I'm something like f*** this guy might beat the s*** out of me and raped me here in the woods like he was bigger than me and he was always jogging you know it wasn't in bad shape and he I told him get the f*** away from me and he told me to not be upset and then I left I got a way he didn't chase me you know he didn't want to be violent he wanted to trick me and he wanted to rape me he wanted to trick me into f****** on my God real lucky that that was the case but then years later I got a letter from I'm at my house that was creepy cuz it showed up in the mailbox like it figured out where I moved to and sent me a letter and it was like a real like friendly and professional like a real Professor like a scholar I don't even remember if you ever apologized but it was real weirdos like we dodged a bullet how many guys did a like that but aren't nice they just want to get you close and then rape you that's much more likely probably not is some horrifics s*** man with Puerto Rican Nelson I went to his house that's my name that's what we call him he was born arica and his name is Nelson and I think he raped guys with a black dude black friend who that would come over there and then they give you a beer and all that s*** so he took you in as a you like p**** I pick it like you always say you want to see some good p**** and then that's how it started going to bring you over there you go in and start with the point first look at your weed and then introduce top black friend told I said his black friend just looked f****** retarded like his afro was cut weird he had weird hair and I remember him distinctively speaking about the Rock of Gibraltar I had just come back from African movie young kids like why it came out like a week later Sunday Allgood asked what his name you manolia TMNT asking if he could suck his dick so what like what are we doing here do we call the cops or do we talked, and more like now let's just play the guy cuz he was selling as weed he was like a bartender in the city of miselis weed and then he pursued 2.0 thing with us he said you guys to understand that and then he talked us into he like I'm going to f*** my girlfriend come over Alyssa we will come over there at night and listen that he would leave the window open and it was his girlfriend and him f****** and she would be saying give it to give me milk Daddy and then one day we actually f****** went back then he got normal I think with the misunderstanding with the one guy he got normal Mad Mike the next summer was when he would come out and play football with us with a robot or no wonder where I would like what the f*** is this guy doing like you went to Desperate Measures introversion and I think mrs. and Ani said something to him you can't be doing that around here with your dick out and these are non I just want to get exercise or something like that I would like what the f*** is this guy doing like he went to Desperate Measures and perversion and I think mrs. zanotti said something to him you can't be doing that around here with your dick out of these are non I just want to get exercise or something like you told us I'm with and that was the end of that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and you would think it would be if you're going to hang yourself from such a short distance it would be even harder to get a fracture like that right cuz you not like jumping out like an old western movie like Clint Eastwood movie where they would hang them Hang Em High so the one thing that they also had an ear as he left a note the note said like there's like four things it's at first that the sum of the name blurred out but it said this person left him in a shower lock for an hour but then said someone else gave him like burnt food and then bugs are crawling over his hands in his throat no fun but there's a ballpoint pen like the one I have in my hand sitting right next to him like if you knew he was on suicide watch you wouldn't give him a ballpoint pen that he could kill himself with he could have just use that to kill himself and I can explain it by bringing in some some new witness somehow this is actually a different video showing a couple different things than what I saw this why I didn't see this arm thing I didn't see the pictures sorry 60 minutes thank you thanks for getting this kept me in a locked Pittsburgh regular season games board kept me in a lock strap shower stall for 1 hour neck or someone I don't know the name sending burnt food giant bugs crawled on my hands and then no fun and then they're sending any ballpoint pen is next to it that he could have stabbed himself the neck or whatever you know you know high profile Cal stripe yeah I don't know it's bad to say either way if you don't know and I'm guilty of that hundred percent I might that guy didn't kill himself I am talking s*** though I'm not talking in terms of like people have to understand this is really important just have to talk s*** and hopefully if you f****** you correct it and it's funny I'm not a science expert but when these guys are saying that the guy died by strangulation is always points a consistent strangulation that takes forever to get the pictures and then there's the video cameras didn't work and is the second time he tried to kill himself and he's a high-profile witness in a really really really important case involving pedophiles at the highest levels of government yeah I wouldn't I would think that that's the kind of guy you wack what's up with the sneakers that kids are wearing their have a f****** a green tag on them I was it was explained to me or we tell the Boomers Now is it going to rain today leave that on my f*** you not leaving this stupid plastic tag on now you don't leave that on it would it would people do that thing is huge their cumbersome they look dumb but I'm on their shoots part of the Saints you should go up to his f****** kids just cut that off and go know we're about to go to war and stupid this is probably a plot by the Russians and the Chinese and the Iranians to try to make sure the orchids grow dumber and dumber main thing there's two things that are really really kind of happening in that region one the traffic the trafficking of Fentanyl and heroin and all these drugs through one of the main drug routes up into the u.s. and there's a few factions fighting over that region little Salazar which are small cartel faction that has Allegiant just to see lower cartel and the Linea cartel which has historically been in control of the Zealot Suarez so they're both kind of buying for control of the area a few hours before the massacre actually took place there was a bunch of fire fights between these two factions in the area so one of the main theories is that these Scruples of Mormons basically were kissing mistaken identity, driving into some of the areas with there being protected by some of these people that's one Theory the other thing that people kind of need to think about is that the largest mineable mineable deposits of lithium on the planet right now are a few hours away from her that Massacre took place and that is something in that region and there's a lot of interest in that space and control for that space and they're not mining it currently there's probably a bunch of projects in play right now I was so they've identified the deposits yeah people to look up the numbers but it's it's the largest mineable deposit of lithium on the planet and there was some sort of deal in the password Canadian mining agency was going to have rights to it and the mining agency was fought by the check by chinese company so again after that Massacre a lot of things happen a lot of the negotiations happened that called that deal was one of the things that got killed after that situation no night so it's it's it's it's an interesting area there's a lot of things happening there that's going to put a tremendous amount of pressure on the cartels and somewhere right well operation usually has industry around it which is perfect for the cartels no extortion protection rackets drug use in the area from the workers I blue pill with the f*** out of my don't try to get my son into conspiracy theorist I'll get him when he's like this more than anything he loves you more than you love school and then after school till about fun and he decide what we're going to do today we're going to do karate and then we're going to cuz he's all the baseball to and then we're going to go to the batting cages my boom that's it we got a karate batting cages that I go teach Jiu-Jitsu then the next day he'll say I'm going to take a relaxation day the last couple days throwback amazing and then we'll watch some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle he's all about Teenage Mutant everyday it's a different thing what he wants of you learning from like the pain of your childhood and like doing all the right things I just the opposite with my son my dad

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I guess the other reason that people are on my case to some degree is because I have made a strong case which I think is fully documented by the scientific literature that there are intrinsic differences say between men and women and I think the evidence or not this is the thing that staggered Mia said no serious scientists have debated that for like four decades it's that argument was done by the time I went to graduate school everyone knew that human beings were not a blank slate biological forces parameterize the way that we thought and felt and acted in and and valued everyone knew that the fact that this has become somehow debatable again is just especially because it's being done by legislative Fiat they're forcing it to me is now mandated the female sports teams were funded to the same degree that male sports teams were funded in American universities but it's being expanded out so that if there's any differences in any areas whatsoever between the genders then the universities are being taken to court and like 200 of me last I looked about 200 Sports Vape Way Beyond that yeah it's it's it's become an equality of outcome issue fundamentally there was an article that I sent you one of them was from I think I got it off of digg.com but it was Jordan Peterson is having his moment and we should ignore him when I send this to you and there was one of the party citing the study that showed very little difference or more different well it depends on how you define the terms first but they're more similar is what are the differences and how do they manifest themselves in are those manifestations important so here's an example if you took a random woman out of the population and a random man and he had to bet on who was more temperamentally aggressive if you bet on the man you'd be right 60% of the time but you'd be wrong 40% of the time in the difference right it's not 90/10 well they're more the same yeah except so then let's say Nona let's play a slightly different game let's pick the one in a hundred most aggressive person from the random population while they're all men and that's why all the people in prison are men so even though on average men and women one of the problems is the difference is at the extreme or where the difference is really start to manifest themselves until you can have a small difference at the level of the average butt out at the extremes it starts to make a massive difference so let's say to be a Google engineer which is hard right because you not only have to be an engineer but you have to be interested in things rather than people that's a huge difference it's like men are more interested in things generally speaking and women are more interested in people generally speaking that was still a lot of overlap between them but that's one of the biggest differences between men and women's been demonstrated cross-cultural it's also very big difference in the Scandinavian countries well isn't that great even though it's a relatively large difference but at the extremes it's the same thing almost all the people and all the people were hyper focused on people or almost all women and so how does that play out in the world well in the Scandinavian countries it plays out this way but 85% of nurses in Scandinavia are female and about eighty-five to ninety percent of Engineers are male it doesn't mean women can't be Engineers that doesn't mean men can't be nurses it also doesn't have anything to do with intelligence but it does have to do with interest and the differences are big you like that the one that was pointed out the first question is well what do you mean by big and little there's more overlap there's more overlap between men and women there is difference on virtually every parameter okay fine are the remaining differences significant and how they play out in the world is overwhelming 115 points is about the difference between the typical college student and the typical high school student okay so it's not a massive difference but if you go to the extreme say well let's go look at people who only have an IQ of 145 which is kind of where you hit the beginnings of genius-level like the Jews are overwhelmingly over-represented so relatively small differences in the average can produce requires a fairly sophisticated grasp of Statistics but when were talking about things like differential outcome in the workplace then you have to take a sophisticated statistical approach to it or you don't know what the hell you're talking about and unfortunately many of the people who were talking about things like gender differences they have no idea what they're talking about it's like they inhabit some disembodied universe so the review was poorly written at best and did not was showed it very poor grasp of the relationship between group differences and economic and practical outcomes so it's not just that it's deceptive and there's there's a need in some way on that side this side of the debate the anti Jordan Peterson side to label men women as being virtually identical when there's so much evidence that that's not the case and what you're saying what you've never said one is superior one is inferior what you are is a guy who is pointing out the reality of the difference between the various types of human beings and you've been very open about the extremes about you but I am well aware of the extremes I deal with MMA fighters I know a lot of female MMA fighters as aggressive top is any man you're ever going to meet in your life and I know a lot of men from Comedy that are Meek little guys who they're not nearly as aggressive as some of these female Fighters like there's I think one of the beautiful things about freedom is that people get an opportunity to express himself in a way that genuinely them and whether that is like our friend Alex Honnold free climber who is like climbing up these fantastic mountains with no ropes or what's a female MMA fighter like Raquel Pennington who's just a tank and beat the s*** out of people and that's what she loves to do all of these extremes are available to people because of Freedom this is not as suppressive thing stopping people from choosing the path I don't know if you saw the most recent slip up by the CEO of YouTube I retweeted it today they were talking about why there's not as many women in Tech and she basically said they both her and they CEO of Google said exactly with James D'Amore was saying in his memo they completely f*****-up they tried to look at this this is goddamn they responded with a lack of tackles could go to James D'Amore tweet just go to the what I retweeted and what he said so there was a study published larger they go look to see if I read this right I don't know how to say her name is Susan Wood's I'm sorry I don't know how to say her name w o j i c i c k I said that women find geek email Industries as opposed to social Industries not very interesting and Sundar sites research on gender differences this is what James D'Amore wrote in his memo that got him fired and this in my mind if I was a lawyer for James D'Amore be like oh well look who we have here this is Checkmate and he wasn't very happy about it because he knows literature at the end of the seminar they ask for feedback call James D'Amore is an engineer so when you telling engineer that you want feedback the engineer thinks all you on feedback and you and you want like facts and stuff right cuz that's what feedback would be like don't do more went and wrote this like Thoreau memo and gave it to me said well you know what I think you're some feedback and then he got no real response from the diversity people and then he posted it on one of these internal boards at Google where people can discuss things which people at Google do all the time it was perfectly reasonable for him to post it because he didn't get a response from the diversity people thought well let's see what other people think and then it was there for a long time until it was leaked into the outside world it wasn't like the more was trying to expose Google for for what it is he was just doing what an engineer type would do would someone asked him to provide feedback because he's not thinking politically he's not thinking oh they just want to hear what they already said he thought they actually wanted some facts the wrong guy turns out to be pretty damn tough but he's very smart and a very kind God when you sit down and talk to him he's not a sexist he said he's a guy that's talking about facts in fact he wrote more than a page-and-a-half I believe on the strategies for getting more women interested in attack is not a sexist remember the author but they were looking at Junior High math prodigies and they're they're pretty equally distributed between boys and girls but by the time University came along the math prodigy boys they tend to go into the stem Fields but the girls wouldn't and it didn't because they locked ability cuz they had Stellar ability it's because they weren't interested and it turns out like the interesting turns out to be a big one so with personality alone if you measure men and women personalities and then you add up all the differences in personalities you can tell with the boat 95-80 percent certainty by looking at a full personality readout weatherperson's male or female she'd be wrong 25% of the time something like that but if you had interested that you can get up to about 90% And so you know what you say well are these differences large well individually they're not that big they make more difference at the extremes but if you add them up then you can almost completely differentiate men from women so by that token any interesting actually turns out to matter a lot like it's probably the most important individual difference that has been discovered between men and women at the psychological level and has real decent explanatory power because you might say men have a slight Edge in spatial intelligence and that's why they were represented in stem fields and women have a slight Edge in verbal intelligence this is debatable but literature, indicates that and that's why they're overwhelmingly the majority of fiction readers for example is that the reason that there's differential represent in the stanfields it's like not doesn't seem to be it doesn't look like it's an intellectual issue which is also what the more pointed out by the way he never said once that this was a cognitive issue but it's a matter of choice matter of interest and women tend to be more more people oriented now saying is this is also being discovered in chimpanzees and other primates like if you offer baby like cars or people like toys like dolls the males will go for the thing like toys in the females are go for the people like toys she see that in private and you think was not surprising it's like really tiny infants and you have to be really people-oriented to do that because a tiny infant isn't unbelievably demanding social relationship and it's a primary relationship for about two years unbelievably demanding social relationship and it's a primary relationship for about two years and no one so women are tilted towards the kind of temperament that makes that possible it's like well it's not such a shock really that's such a surprise</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Jon Jones vs Francis ngannou why'd you have to go there dude what that's going to happen for sure we allow and Gunnar to get the press that he deserves like it delete to pump him up in a way that he deserved to make Arizona worldwide Superstar for six years and he developed a strike by the way in a sand mine when he was a child doing child labor considered Thunderhead I think it's everybody did there's not a Man On This Planet Beach dungeon we never seen John we just have to lose weight we never seen John where you know he's not maybe Jon Jones is really the best 240-pound heavyweight in the world he's just been fighting until 2 and they did come together would like a physical plan you know for like a Cain Velasquez right if they're going to they're going to look at like what's the best weight for garlic Cain Velasquez there probably like 2:40 Jon Jones was raised in one of you look at the six just go down the line from Carlos Condit like I don't know but he's that would be an interesting fight it he's just too small I think isn't he is he too thin well he's a solid 30 lb lighter I think walk around the John and that's why so they might possibly might be star I'm just his dad might be so it's not that outlandish it's not that outlandish on the way to physically get up to a certain weight he's a beast for him and that holds Jim they won okay what what way is the right way is it to you too big at 2:30 cuz you be 220 and 220i you faster like when you have the most cardio when what's the f****** point of diminishing returns you're probably one of the greatest talents a heavyweight division just just train real hard and was 240 but like this eBay stupid 238 but like he went to when he fought at 1:35 against of Hunan faded the next Friday came in later like they're you know American Top team's like listen to bring your body weight down a little bit let's figure out what's the right formula here and that's why a big camp that has a lot of experience of world title fight and nose like seeing so much because they can look at using O'Brien I don't see you as a 70 as he was in 55 I think we got to get in nutrition order like what they've done like think about what with what's happened with although just with the introduction of a nutritionist 135 what do that's that's all about optimizing all your possibilities you know by the end of this guy's like Jon Jones you don't have to do that that's it I'm going to heavyweight secondly kunsak think about that and would you say his brothers are better athletes and John and one way or another or is that you can't say it when it when it comes to what the NFL requires his ass has used to but he would come in for John's camps in the whole John down anyway so it's great gene pool is coming from and you know I thought about this theory about got to grow up with brothers and feed their asses like Matthews one of the greatest welterweights of all time want to things about him cuz he had a twin brother that was exactly him they have an MMA fight in the Grass at a family picnic family picnic there they're all hanging out in the backyard of a house to all the families around with f****** Red Cups their hand drinking beer and these guys are beating up each other everyday that big motherfuker is right next to you and you don't shut when you have to wear it like Chris Weidman same thing as well good name for a podcast broscience where a person to talk about bulshit and you don't have to be an expert on it and do it anyway anyway, Bro Science then you have a free pass</div>

Now go through Camaro or go through Kobe's or go through Woodley's ordering Tales passed by the pony is world-class skills and ridiculous knock out power he may or may not how to beat those guys cuz you never know but he's definitely in the conversation from me what I look at ability my look at what you can accomplish the even though he's responding Q7 are he's a big motherfuker many sets of series Power truth you can't say he's the best that's true but you can't say he's not world-class I think that got nothing.

The system is designed to bury the degenerate Gambler like from from August 15th Daddy's Secret Obsession that weighed 600 bats in Scrabble and a $3,000 Monopoly buying you have no idea like 7 months I played this f****** ugly game channel that I would start I knew the action I knew that you had a bet on Monday nights and try to win and you know what I lost every week at all these people who sell your information listen Arch Lisa f****** game lost Pete Rose batting lost even Michael Jordan that lost his room is that that's why he was asked to play baseball for a few years because it was a cover-up again I did not write this this is just things I hear on the road everybody has a f****** Bubba gambling grabs you f****** weird weird for a long time I'm playing Scrabble that would call up the Parker Brothers hotline big Mobsters would to dispute the rules and have them explain and what was going on Cafe you know gambling is a f****** nightmare and once you get caught in a web and you and Joe Rogan shutting me down then I start putting back with Jamie and then pretty soon I start plucking dipping into accounts and pretty soon now you're done now you got forced into a bad head I told you that I was a backer on the road for a while my friend Johnny be when I started making money doing stand-up I put together a little bankroll and me and him would go places and Gamble and he would win or lose you know sometimes you win sometimes you lose but it was just being an action was fun you know that kind of gambling but I was never good enough to like play those guys but I could play like people that will like my level and he bet like 20 bucks or maybe you want to get crazy belly 50 bucks I never bad like a lot of money gambling on pool but it makes you think more makes play like way more serious it's good free game and if you can have a friendly sparring partner they play like friendly games like maybe a race to 7 for twenty bucks so it's cost you probably in any city pool halls I don't know what the rate is per hour but they got to be like at least $25 an hour for a while to break it down for me I walk into a pool hall with Jamie why exactly make money and why is it that the people the room passing money around and how does that money get the first who's real simple everybody puts like you put in I'm in for a hundred and leave my boyfriend like everybody put in on one side pool in money and you know and then back to sky or they might be betting on the side they might not even be playing the game there's always Side Bad Side bets are probably more like you had a bet if you had a like a big pool game write in a they used to be a place called The West End Billiards I think in New Jersey West End I think it was called was he find West End Billiards it was a world-famous pool hall we would take the drive from from New York to go down in New Jersey to this famous pool hall that would have these like serious high-level professional play there and real high-level huh all of the country girl there for big money games Yu-Gi-Oh there and watch people play for $5,000 $10,000 in the best in the world would be there all the time I got to play against some of the best in the world that killed me but I got to play again them against them look real good guy or Earl Strickland or Johnny Archer and I'm just Joe Rogan barely could play it doesn't matter I put my money up enter the tournament I can play against you don't get invited so that does Joey Diaz come on the side and go listen I'm putting three to one odds on this and this guy is coming in from out of town and he wants to take a crack at them while he wants to pay $100 that's okay then you have to think how many barrels do we have to pull all your money together okay we got four barrels that means if you want to play sets we can lose four times so you have to be to lose a couple gain a couple like if you got to really play a guy out he's got to play 10-12 hours going back and forth and back and forth and the next day you go there in the morning you playing all through the night I don't know what the f*** they were on most likely some sort of amphetamines that was a big thing in the pool world for awhile guys would just break each other with gambling you just it would be about who quits it wouldn't be about who want is very rarely about like like you would you would be you would be frowned upon highly if you left on top of your head by five hundred bucks and you want to quit me and and I'm still ready ready to keep playing I still got money man let me win my money back if you just walked away nope I've got what I wanted I'm going to leave now like that would be you that you'd be good called bad action as I got two kids I got to get up at 7 and go bring it to the pool. Playing that kind of like gambling Laurel Canyon no more so I got to go the long way and I get off on Victory just to see it f****** always fell with the generous I'm petrified to pull into Epsom pheasant places were home to me great you've been on the 101 have you seen what that place is that where you took me there a couple times to eat we did, their member Hollywood Billiards you took me that was Hollywood Boulevard it's f****** a building what is it now the golden next time it was great walking. That whole area is completely that's what I meant crazymax Everly top of the food chain play 12 games I might win a couple am I get lucky when a few maybe I'll win 4 he's going to win way more he's going to get to 12 for sure quicker to be a terrible bet the bet would be how many games do I get to the bat if you say you'll never get past three in a row and I'm not exaggerating forgettable came with me. You don't forget I was going to Italian place yes that place is amazing and that's what I'm saying he he would break and run out on guys they would just get frustrated they be like what the f*** man they just get them get to shoot we watched him whose gambling some guy and when the set was over the guy was just pissed off because Max's wouldn't miss crazy just watch him a chance and play like the top of the food chain guy and gamble with him if it's just watching the difference between a kid who can play a little pools pretty good versus the world championship caliber poolplayers so precise technique is so clean and its angles are perfect and effortlessly moving the cube on the table how to play pool not that I didn't already play it before I met him but he taught me how to play it way better way better he made my game way more technical he was explaining things that I was just guessing before and he was explaining what was wrong with my Approach and like what was the blitz what's a better way to do it he's a wizard when it comes to technique that I need to make a living going from pool to pool hall or no way cuz he's not good reason artist to fortunately for Max he he makes pretty cool artwork like like to see some of it's probably on his Instagram no no no what is like mesmerizing he finds like the most beautiful pieces of wood and combines them together and they have to have a certain harmonic frequency like you drop someone has a cement for just like think things are you want to hear a certain sound from the would otherwise he won't use it he's like finding logs on the side of the highway and s*** and recognizing some weird hardwood that no one's ever used before he cuts it up and make you out of it the wizard like his chooser Aces many as you want you know sometimes you don't make them for a while make some for his friends won't let me pay for one I have to have to pay for everything just to not feel terrible he's like the nicest guy ever play some f****** pool too so I don't even know when this podcast started before we started percent to do most of it online and Banks I like you know they have Supreme Court on sports betting is he trying to get sports betting you problems but we all do 17 States also with them on this I think they want to do it and then they want it again so he would want he opposed it or they want it again they want wedding again because they have an NHL team in Vegas that's always been like the logic is that they'll be some issue whatever you can't be betting wear their Sports being played someone will throw the game everybody's whatever you want</div>

like pieces of and I wasn't a lot or just chunks plaster three or four pretty significant pieces of plaster fell off of the ceiling is rain came through at the whole deal with the ceiling came out and somehow or another she had this idea in her head and it could be because she knew that the ceiling was f***** up and she knew it was raining hard as far as going to give him anyway or she might have had intuition of everyone's always convinced it was intuition everyone's a little bit sidekick chemical New Jersey yes in Newark New Jersey had a monkey named Chichi and chase you a bite everybody

right don't deceive anybody don't tell each other then you will be so into a certain area that I wasn't into my account starting to look into the Bible remember the first got back in my 2005 when I was like full-blown like that but you know against religion or not dude what are you doing dude you showed me the way and now you're looking in the Bible goes I know it sounds crazy but you got to look into it too there's this isn't just a book with crazy Fairy Tail this is some real s*** of the times of the people that live back down as best they could tell it translate it down over thousands of years absolute truths in the Bible and is some great guides to live your life but there's also some nonsense Christian Christian well the mainstream story Ranch Lutheran are being don't you know I think I don't know I don't know I don't know I didn't think the energy in our body go somewhere there's something that makes us you know like I can I can feel certain things like love or intuition stuff like that that there has to be something you know I think I'd go somewhere I don't think there's a heaven in hell has some really good advice on that he said as if God is real it did really does you really do have that kind of gratitude and humility that you're you're being watched over by a loving God is a benefit to thinking like that about doing the right thing how do we get the people to do the right thing and I believe there's a God because a couple things you know when that when I did DMT I went into I thought okay there's more there's way more s*** to this reality this Dimension that are not there into your trying to find out what we're on and what what this is all about and then you look at the Main Street I think someone created what we're at whatever you want whatever you think this is in consideration this is something I don't believe in simulation is there evidence but if you look at probability theory was that guy's name that was the the the guy Nick Bostrom we talked about it in-depth and he said according to probability theory is more likely to win in a simulation is real then the simulation goes on forever in the space that everyone thinks it would be a part of leaving at like computer if it's not like it could be one of the facets of life like we could be creating a simulation just through culture and society and that simulation is literally how we enter into another dimension we're looking at it like it's some nonsense simulation could literally be how dimensions are created the created creativity and Ingenuity nnnn Innovation over long periods of time with millions of people working in conjunction it different people to figure out processing power and coding and all these different things and next thing you know you've got these there's there's these virtual reality places like we have an Oculus out there that you can put on all these games it's really fun but there's some virtual reality places now that you go into a warehouse and you go through this whole thing you know there's a there's a place that's in Disneyland and there's another place down the street called sandbox you play games oh there's that there's an arcadis VR arcade at the Westfield Mall in Riverside it's called us one right here but don't you think if I was not right in the head to be ways there for me commit suicide by just thinking the snow hole simulation if human beings keep going we definitely will create a simulation it's just a matter of time so if that's the case how do we know that we're not in one already and we really don't everyday we go to sleep and everyday we wake up and we assume and we have faith that all that stuff that we remember is really how life went on before we're awake but we really don't know really don't know when you blackout and then come back to who the f*** knows what's transpiring who knows where your Consciousness goes who knows where you are Dawn 8 Hour seems like a second all Senor froggy couple minutes to wake up and boom we're that time go where are you who are you you're assuming that all of the stuff that you know and all the stuff the experience is 100% real but what if it is real what you mean if the simulation is real is it real we are on this Earth within a hundred years away from making something that's indiscernible from what we experienced everyday and that's inevitable it seems like just how people do it and what I'm saying is that might literally be how your Consciousness transforms into whatever next stage of existence or is we might it might be something that human beings do like a caterpillar makes a cocoon and becomes a butterfly human beings make crazy f****** technology and I think that's one of the reasons why we're so invested in everybody loves the things they love shiny things especially the new ones all the other newest car at the faster the newest computer has better graphics issues as all this stuff as we're paying for newer and better s*** it's fueling all this Innovation which making crazier and crazier technology until artificial intelligence until we create something that you can't turn off what you owe you download your Consciousness and you just you just you know you can't download schnitzel in a simulation might be is that when we open this up with sufficient power and technology and processing power whenever you are might go into this thing that's a bit of a bummer though right I don't know I think about it like let's say when you're a hundred and finally technology against download your Consciousness into another body you just keep going like man that's his head this is it we don't go on its that's depressing as f*** them it's kind of fat mean what are we thinking and talking when you thinking of yourself like you but use it when using the word I I am going to do that so I'm going what does that mean like where are you you're you're you're in this strange being that's got a finite life-span it's not really that long if we're lucky down to f****** the the poorest people in the world everyone's guessing it's all weird it's all real weird and it's all we're going to die in the next generation is going to pick up in the next Generation after that was going to pick up my put life is because of technology and science your you know that the average lifespans going like this more information you can look at history you can look at how long we've been here at the more they start they just found another asteroid impact from 800,000 years ago locate the crater in the library I'm watching on YouTube this it's becoming these people are or realizing like there's only been a short amount of time we're human beings have been human we've only been human for a half a million years at the most. So she have kids you know and that your species is going to go extinct you think all the good times you had killing muskrats and cook them over the fire with your kids and and hiding from Jaguars and show you think all those good times like this is we're not going to be us anymore you think of this is a computer simulation at what point like when did it start like an 1800 the 1600 200 a D 5000 BC when did when was the beginning of the simulation City baby no more crazy there's a video game where you literally created Universe create a plan and you put things on in like Jimmy was it no man's sky is like the big bang means that the entire universe the smaller than that of a pain at one point in time. what how do we not know the universe only press start on a program that has billions of years ago out of nothing everything exploded me a million percent so he was in only people who are higher up and people have money saver in a simulation yes they got me. I bet you there's not one dude we're going to make Duncan I think it's a simulation dude with the thing about a guy like Elon Musk who's one of the proponents of the simulation Theory sing about a guy like him is he's got enough resources to relax a little bit but also he is involved in technology every day and part 1 of smart people and he's financially stable so he can stop and think and think about things in a way where he's not he's not overburdened by be like he has stress is for sure and obligations for sure massive ones 3 giant company but what he doesn't have is like survival stress survival stress about be like being poor or being in danger without brazo the level of his IQ is so high right he's on a different frequency to might be too smart there's a lot of things where when he speaks I go but I don't agree with them you know I like that plan once I start seeing like organic matter like a body parts and they watch it under like some computer or numbers and stuff then I be like that means everything that's physical you're experiencing in a simulated way so it could be everything it could be like if you are if it's just your mind experiencing things that you're mine translate as being physical Sensational why would it have numbers and I do and maybe we do live in a simulation I think things are a lot weirder than anybody wants to admit or or or or so much information the internet and other smart people just overthinking everything and there is no stimulation live your life it's over man lights out could be could be closed could be could be something that's because we want to hope that our contributions are permanent and we're going to we're going to somehow or another come back in another life kids coming to playwright you seeds else out that the way you treat people in the things that you rub off on other people start to carry it on</div>

It was a job asleep to that's what he started she's got serious arthritis like really bad and it helped it right and there's one thing that human beings been eating since the beginning of time like this idea that human beings are herbivores it's pretty much nonsense one of the main reasons why we became what we are they think is because we started eating meat we started getting better access coating for cooking eggs and figured out how to harness fire and then through hunting started getting more devious and started thinking and have a better critical skills and then eating mushrooms I think all those things but that's just I talk too much about me that's that's your trigger percent of the population of the planet Earth eats meat this is what vegans are as very loud and very vocal you know that they want to make it look like what your body feels like when you eat things everybody's body different everybody's body reacts to nutrients differently to processed foods we can all agree that is not good for anybody and then I killed most of the sugar most of the b******* and then before I went on his diet I got off the rails little bit too many too many carbs too much pasta I was eating like f****** Subs mommy has a lot of calories like you going to run some tamhane Stout type miles to burn off that s*** but so all the different things that can f*** with your health and all the different ways to make what makes you feel good what makes you feel bad depending upon your biology lifestyle I'm experimenting you know so this is my experiment for the month just meet for the month so far this is the most amazing thing I was just no carbs before you pray to eating carbs or some form of carb are you if you were born with spiky and days like this that I would love I love pasta I would make like elk sausage in a big bowl of spaghetti it's a good bar with your whole Dale knife-like think of it this way how awfully would you want to get laid if every time you got laid you gained 20 lb she's not enough f*** this dude or I'm not feeling great was really boring about 5 days in but no like I said now it was today the 9th so today is 11th Ave and there's no problem I know what I'm doing my biggest issue I put on weight switching December was the road cuz whenever I get Philly cheesesteaks or your kids Pizza Hut just it's just so you know she'll be more disciplined it's late to get done at 1 to a.m. yep I just figured out yeah people did eat like this though there's human beings are eating like this for long periods of time maybe I do they didn't crazy like any was he like this Native Americans of Comanches they like this Comanches barely ate anything other than Buffalo</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I'm happy you're back but I'm not happy that there was a motivation to bring you back based on the violence you know the violence that is going on between the cartels and it was the Mormons and then there was we were just talking about this other person that got shot because they ran a cartel Roblox basically in Somali Buzz a lot of the cartel boobs actually make they build their roadblocks in the on the state and local roads and according to what I heard from some of the people that I know they're this family ran one of those roadblocks they didn't know if it was cops or not and they apparently decided to run the roadblock and the cartel guy shot them what should someone do if they encounter cartel roadblock slow down I mean if if if anything I would probably avoid traveling to those areas that's the number one women's usually know and I've actually gone through some of those myself yeah and it's it's all about their there they're looking out for the for Rivals moving through their territory they looking for government Personnel may be spying on them and usually usually they'll just shake you down for some money and they let you go on your way unless you have a 4 by 4 truck that can use for their you know their own purposes which is how they might take your truck yeah specifically in Tamaulipas 4 by 4 truck that are commodity for them they use them for their wrong going down Turf War all right especially someone else's that they don't mind getting shout out I mean most of the truck so you see any went that are armed up armor or they have the rifles on top or usually stolen vehicles all of them are so in vehicles and a lot of them are the Americans Crossing into Mexico truck stolen I in in in Tamaulipas you see the video and and in the cartel guys come out of the car they grab the the the the owner of of a pickup truck they get him out of the car and take a cellphone leave it on the sidewalk because they are very aware of all the SOS technology and they take them inside of inside of another car and they take the truck and you thought he would think you know it's it's because he did something or he's he's involved in something let me go a few blocks later and just took the truck it was all wow now resources and acquiring resources for their for the war basically nice of them to let him go but I think most people in America are just now waking up to the chaos that's going on down there I think that the Mormon assassination was a real wake-up call but I think people are paying much more attention now we we talked about this Iran is like 5 months yet a lot of the stuff we talked about those five months ago kind of that's how things progressed we actually did mention the Mormon can meet us down there which was kind of eerie yeah and we talked about the possible designation of cartels as terrorist groups Terry action against them and then there was some sort of negotiation with the president Mexico and what it what do you think went down there so I mean this is just from what I see and from the how things traditionally happened down there Mexico currently has a current currently up a leftist president now there is very to the left so much to the left that he recently gave Eva Morales the deposed leftist president of Bolivia asylum in the country and there's been a lot of venal Pro left political stuff going on in Mexico basically as soon as the designation Threat by the US came down there was some sort of negotiation and a lot of things happened after after some us officials went down there and talk to the government among them ever Morales is out he's he went to Cuba apparently and then went to Argentina so he's not going to stay in Mexico former head of the public security under the Calderon Administration which is two administrations bath the president Calderon is the one that started the drug war he was arrested for cartel involvement and basically receive money from the cartels he was going through his immigration process and he was actually asking for full citizenship and they got them online through the authority of the immigration authorities he said that he never received money from the cartels apparently he did a lot of it I'm so all these things happened after after they walked back the threat of designating cartels as a terrorist organization so there has been some action so they must have made some negotiation where trumpet said listen we're going to do this and it said hold up stock one of the things that the current president creating a national police force National Guard is is what he calls it which had already kind of been done before but you don't change the name change the uniforms change the packaging and it's a new thing right he want he wanted the Army out of the drug war because of the casualties when mounting on both sides and he said it wasn't a military should be a military operation and he ran on a platform that would call David Russell's noble gases which means hugs not bullets but Jesus Christ amnesty for the cartels was basically kind of the main theme of that so you got into Power first thing you did militarized police forces and create a National Guard and is all in try to dissolve the federal police and most of that the National Guard force was designated to border patrol duties on the Mexican side so some of them went to the South of the Border South Southern Mexican border and some of them went to the north when were basically to stem the whole illegal immigration crisis with the Caravans that's what kind of happened it was a kind of a collaboration between the US and the Mexican Government so that was one of the key points of collaboration that they had and when this whole designation thing went up that was kind of like a bargaining chip to the Mexican Government had with the US and the rest of the things that kind of transpired afterwards so you know it's pretty interesting how a lot of things happened after that. down there and how they walk back the the terrorist designation so the terrorist terrorist designation would mean that Trump would have some sort of incentive to invade Mexico it would open up the possibility for military direct military action against the nation that destroys also targeting finances or anything related to cartel activities would be targeted where are the cartels keep their cash it's it's it's a it's right now with a myriad of things Italy Diversified long ago so it's not like they're keeping very cash you're not in any container container somewhere in the in the jungle like Escobar you to do right but still finding some some like rotted cash from the 80s they putting their money in cryptocurrency that it real he's like legit companies with a clean their money that way real estate hotels property on the US side so they're also investing on the US side of the Border as well so you know money's it's it's not you know what's on under the mattress work you know giant stack of cash in the rooms and what kind of banks do business with the cartel while how did they negotiate that I'm not going to say names but that's been a few cases of pretty large banks that have been involved in in in money laundering for the cartels recently look it up easily but you would think you would have a designated cartel you would have cartel designated as terrorists so now they're Banks involved in funding terrorism so that would change things that's you know there's a lot of things that would happen you know something some of these consequences of the people talk about as a terrorist and centrioles down their things that they kind of don't talk about is that if a terrorist designation does happen most people seeking asylum in the US from Mexico now have a claim running from terrorists in in Mexico so now they can claim that as far as Asylum seeking people can claim that now it's a different thing the main argument a lot of people say is that cartels aren't the canopy considered a terrorist terrorist group because they don't have political aspirations the problem with that theory is that we have a lot of political killings by cartels in Mexico where they shoot the Katerina ones side of the political spectrum because it's not good for them so they influence politics they also pay off a lot of politicians out there and they also examples of the new generation cartel from Guadalajara giving out Christmas gifts or groceries to the poor basically doing hearts and Minds type tactics in the area are clear political movements right now so you know well that's that's in classical the classical definition of that is a terrorist group that's what they're basing it on I think the cartels and in a narco-terrorism is a thing in itself it's a new phenomenon that should be terrorism should be reclassified to include it I think you know most people that live through that type of situation and that type of man. Pepper are in the Country Buffet think some of these cars out threats that have flooded will call it what it is situation in that type of berry in the country but facing some of these cars out threats that have flooded will call it what it is</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and you know you'll get to a point where it's going to be I think in my life there's going to be some sort of arm into MIT intervention Mexico at some point really so you anticipate almost like in a Civil War I think something's going to happen in Mexico is going to destabilize it so much that the US won't have another option but to put boots on the ground probably that's I think that's that's where we're headed into the problem and again another the problem is that the government is part of the problem so you can go down there and negotiate with this government but six years later going to be another government and you got to renegotiate with them and also use you Palm grease yeah and then you put all your faith in the military and the military gets compromised you put all the faith in you and the Mexican Marines and then they get compromised and I will who do you have so it's a stomach don't tell that to Trump use as an excuse we can't count on them we're going in I hear I mean I wonder where it all goes as it is obviously growing very fast it's obviously huge incredibly powerful and it and it affects I mean I'm up here now and I could see the effects of it up here walking through La seeing all the needles on the ground go into Seattle seeing the same fentanyl laced fentanyl laced heroin that I saw in Shantytown sound effects of it throughout so you realized quickly as somebody from both sides that I am you realize that they're realistically there's no there's kind of no border when it comes to this problem it was brought this doesn't respect the border wall but submarines will do around couples will go under it drones will fly over it and it's a it's a it's a problem that just keeps producing an effect and I think the majority of the United States citizens are completely unaware of the complexity and the depth of the problem yeah I mean it is I think most people seem to be around thing right now most people know more about that going on that's what's crazy to me invading countries that are really barely affecting us there like a 17-hour plane flight I think I think I don't I don't want to be at a Damas and predict stuff at a Damas but the fact that we have a lot of lithium and tomorrow is going to be a factor for the reason to clean it up good baits pretty important to pretty important resource El Chapo's son that's why I think a u.s. gun is going to have to put some boots on the ground on their wow you had to make a bet like there's a betting line Vegas like how many how many days how many years from now where they be American soldiers deployed to Mexican I'd say 5 years maybe in five years really I mean we are on we just passed this past year has been the most violent year in Mexico in recorded history really and it's the first year of his administration of this new president white who's been trying to hugs hugs hugs and not pull itself out in the last scene of this instead of that his it's been his first year and you know that give him a chance he's he's he's doing whatever you need only the most violent year in history but then I go down there and I have a lot of a lot of my friends that are still down there people that have trained still down there and I hear from them directly like I have some young kids are on the and our media which is like a federal police worth it that the trolls all of Mexico and some of the federal federal police guys they tell me like I said we're they said or you sign a new contract to be the one another no and lower your pay and all the all of the stuff that all benefits will be gone or you just stay on here in limbo and just stay at the base and lotto and we're staying at the base so it's nothing nothing nothing nothing is being done and it seems like the cartels are just taking over and they're making a shitload of money and you're not making any money my dad says the real crazy thing about it right there if the the government is asking people in this sort of already compromised situation and environment asking them to work for a small amount of money to go after people that are making a tremendous amount of money and you're going to be a war with these people these people they're basically your neighbor's yeah and also you go there with a federal uniform by far the federal government you going to a community where the federal government doesn't do anything for them the church is made by the cartels, told me the road Christmas was brought brought to you by the cartels they they are good guy so he's got to come in here like you guys like one of those either one or we're not going to so that's you know it's it's it's it's it is a mess. Mess wow could boots-on-the-ground actually fix anyting I mean I'm not I'm not I'm not a military expert but there have to be some sort of outside force that is completely uncompromised by Cartel money and influence how long for the compromise those people well when you put the Marines On the Border a few of them got picked up on smuggling people from the border so yeah smuggling people from the border so yeah because a lot of Blood Ties to Mexico</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> members when you combine all the cartels how many members are we talkin about that's that means pretty hard to put a number on how I will say this more than a million I will say this they defeated the Mexican Army in Sinaloa when they captured and then the Army gave it back whole situation and it was like but I remember that was happening and I was getting asked questions about and it was life it was all of a sudden just popped off the basically is supposedly the official story from the Mexican Government is that they send a special police unit to capture him right which is completely false I think because you don't send three five agents to capture one of the heads of one of the biggest Sinaloa cartel sells night since pretty much by chance they've spotted this party people are on there and they went there all the sudden Chapo's son is of the capture of the sun you can see it and you can see the surprise and really how the agents are kind of uncomfortable or fearful of what they just Dumpling on imagine usagin stumbling on one of the America's Most Wanted individuals of here I got to put him on the ground are going to handcuff in the video you can see that they Point their rifles at him and he calmly takes out his gun and hand it to somebody inside of the inside of the house he was in and walks out and kind of try to negotiate with the people outside the federal agents are trying to arrest them and you can see that the agent for like oh what did we Stumble Inn on all right so that happened they grabbed them they reported back to Mexico the captured him he started to announced the capture and his brother his half-brother archibaldo basically called in all of the enforcement from all the surrounding towns and regions in Sinaloa and it was flooded with a bunch of armed cartel guys policy know I was wasn't a video of the government people in the cartel people talking yeah they don't it's on my feed you can see it if you want it so it's basically an army unit that was being sent to reinforce Security in in culiacan being surrounded by Cartel members and also there is that there's talk about there's a there's a specific immunity out there is he a law where all they fat Army families members live and they were apparently being held hostage by Cartel guys as a barn bargaining chips all dressed in civilian clothes with the vest those are all cartel guys are all cartel guys Jesus Christ and that zilong cartel was basically surrounding some of their communities and Helen holding their family members hostage so that went out over the radio so as an army member going into fight the cartels and do what I'm out of this light so they raise their hands and other than the release of hostages everybody backs out yeah I mean there's they've defeated the Mexican Government basically classica classical Mexican cartel activity they closed off the streets going into the City by burning semis and trailers and stuff like that so you would see all these burning semi trailers in the region so if you want to move in you can and if you want to use your helicopters the cartels have anti-aircraft capabilities so they broke out a bunch of people from the prison just taking advantage of the whole chaos Etsy there's a few on the videos with that there's a armored trucks with 50000mah Deuces on the back of them just moving around the city there's no way there's no way you can answer the breakout state prison took advantage of the whole chaos and just you know let's just let's let's break some of our friends out of chaos eventually they let that the government decided to let him go that's the official story but according to the people there government saying let him go there was like the guys holding him that you know what it's not worth it. That's one of the Leah technicals that's it, I'm up here at dump trucks they armor plate the sides and and put somebody on it's part of the culture and do some people and some of these communities think you know because the cartels are those are the guys in charge so is Sinaloa always been like that has traditionally been the cradle for like the origins of some of the hot love some of the more successful cartel heads lots of lots of lots of anybody that's anybody into a lot has some sort of relationship to the cartels because they're part of culture there there's no way getting around it had a surreal experience ones when I went there I did a class out there and the was running around this bumpy road and then all the sudden just flat beautiful Road the cartel part of the road that they built exactly exactly but it's now and there a more hardcore hardcore some of their gravy they have a highly visible Maya is called is the Narco Cemetery they have and it's basically luxury condos they look like by me I went there I thought it was a church didn't turn out to be a tool might solely the opulence in the money there is just over you know and then how they move around the roll around in vehicles with guns and nobody does anything because they owned what can be in what are they planning on doing it was anybody have any plans or is it just they just accepting this while you know you you get a lot of rhetoric about collaboration yeah that's that's how the invisible Maya all those are Graves some of them have CCTV video inside air conditioning unit alarms go there The Day of the Dead have music wife and shoot the Rockets into the air nobody does anything Jesus Christ it's crazy I mean the opulence is mate I mean seeing it and it's like having several Escobar's in one place and I was. It's like a lot of a lot of the cartels heads are from that region and allow their kids grow up in that and the opulent is amazing f*** like this going to grow I think it is I didn't I mean I don't think it is it is growing again. Going back to my friend John Norris and I like seeing his experiences up here finding all these illegal drug grows in in in in in public lands it's growing it's going over here to roots and they sent their wives up here in a lot of these kids that were born in the late eighties early nineties coming-of-age up here with that cartel pedigree so and they're US citizens US Passport so you're going to see some shift their coming-of-age experience you get you know I hand off of reigns with the older Generation Tiffany regeneration you're going to see the definitely it's definitely growing it seemed so crazy to watch because it seems it's not discussed nearly enough and it it seems like if it keeps getting stronger like what we saw was El Chapo son being released what's the stop it from taking over Mexico entirely different ways so another thing that people going to have to figure out and realizes that there's factions in Mexican the Mexican Government so you will see a federal government that apparently paid off by a very specific large cartels and then you'll see state governments that are of a different political party they influenced paying off by other cartels in groups so you'll see me know that military units moving on the town and the state police blocking their way to get in there because they play for different teams like whoa and there's a lot of talk right now about that Felipe Calderon 10-year and how his head of security ahead of public if he was on the payroll of the Sinaloa cartel which actually came out during El Chapo's trial so now you're talkin about basically federal police force that was on the opposite side so he had free reign to grow and do whatever we had to do in that region with the support of the federal government in a way so check technically and I know who's in control some reagent and realistically some regions of Mexico I need to grow and do whatever he had to do in that region with the support of the federal government in a way so check technically you know who's in control somebody didn't and realistically some regions of Mexico are completing cartel control</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what's going on with the Mormons now is are they moving out of there now are they going to go back to Utah just take one wife but then it was like a friendly hello from them from Passenger actions and then this happened and no a kind of advise a little bit but that's the only thing it's it's a mess a lot of a lot of more leaving communities down there is a lot of them down there in a lot of communities in Sonora kawila and leaving just leaving the area it's just too dangerous and only makes sense mean they just don't have the arms they don't have the Manpower and they're also in the middle of one of the most important regions in Mexico right now for a lot of reasons main thing there's two things that are really really kind of happening in that region one the traffic the trafficking of Fentanyl and heroin and all these drugs through one of the main drug routes up into the u.s. and there's a few factions fighting over that reads Los Salazar which are small cartel faction that has allegiances to Sinaloa cartel and the Linea cartel which has historically been in control of the Zealot Suarez so they're both kind of buying for control the area a few hours before the massacre actually took place there was a bunch of firefights between these two factions in the area so one of the main theories is that these this group of Mormons basically were case of mistaken identity going to driving into some of the areas with their being protected by some of these people that's one Theory the other thing that people kind of need to think about is that the largest and mineable minable deposits of lithium on the planet right now are a few hours away from where that Massacre took place and that is and there's a lot of interest in that space and control and they're not mining it currently there's there's a bunch of projects in play right now so they have identified the deposits yeah and I'll be able to look up the numbers but it's it's the largest mineable deposit of lithium on the planet and there was some sort of deal in the past where the Canadian mining agency was going to have rights to it than the mining agency was bought by the check by chinese company so again after that Massacre a lot of things happen a lot of things what happened that called that deal was one of the things that got killed after that situation know right so it's it's it's it's an interesting area there's a lot of things happening there that's going to put a tremendous amount of pressure on the cartels and somewhere right well I need some sort of mining operations usually has industry around it which is perfect for the cartels no extortion protection rackets feeding the drug use in the area from the workers and that's any way that you could see in the future the cartels being extracted from the positions of power of their endowment or is this something that people in Mexico going to have to live with forever and I guess people United States as well or is this something that can be fixed you've you've talked about before and some of your podcast and I want to listen to them a lot wait podcast and it is it is definitely part of the solution legalizing some drugs and I'm not all drugs are made the same maybe not fentanyl you know there's there's multiple things that could be done to guide us towards a place where they could stabilize down there and a lot of it is not going to be able to be done in Mexico it's going to have to be done up here when I basically don't want you have to take care of the u.s. has to take care of the drug market up here they lie market and certain things that have happened like legalization of marijuana marijuana some live some place up here have changed the Dynamics of what happens down there some for the better some bad some bad things have happened talking to my friend John Norris who was on here as well and is comparing notes seeing how a lot of drugs were crows are up here the pot is legal pot gross are up here exactly at the ones that I found in Baja 6 7 years ago and how some of that drug money made from those fields is staying in the u.s. is not being sent back so that means you have an active growing cartel presence in the US that it's US based so I think that's one of the problems that the people have is perception is that that's a Mexican problem it's a it's a u.s. Mexico problem you have border there was a problem has to root causes social economic inequality and 2 root causes social economic inequality and these civilization and corrupt government down there and a thriving illegal drug market up here and in all those two have to be solved in the combined way</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> coming to a point in our history where a lot of these people are dead a lot of these people are in jail a lot of these people got book deals and why does people are talking and I mean it's interesting seeing some of the stuff that is coming out now that in my time when I was active would have gotten you in a whole probably somewhere if you talked about it so there's definitely I mean like my mind was blown when I was seeing or Chapo on Netflix because of stuff that was going on in that show is fictionalized stuff that I went through myself so it's like this on Netflix now accurate was it pretty good actor parts so there's a there's a character in that show called so it does does the guy in the show conrado Sol is his name which it would nobody with people trying to figure out who that was is basically a government guy that had a deal with El Chapo and they both kind of escalating power it turns out it was Luna so this show was showing him the character Elsa which depicts Luna as a corrupt politician that was working security was working both sides and all the sudden you in it recently a few months a few weeks back they arrested the guy why all the shell was kind of protective do you think that the show had anything to do with him being arrested I mean it probably put a put the idea on the side guys two people to ask questions you know that's weird that shows actually do do that like saving surviving R.Kelly that's what got him arrested it is interesting you see a fictionalized forms of stuff that happened down there the narcos show as well as another thing and I will see you fictionalize things of how some of these powerful cartel groups kind of originated themselves infection and now that is in the public kind of domain as far as collective knowledge so people start asking questions and some of these things about all the people in power also ask questions as well it's so strange how popular become you know and it is such a popular focal point of fiction as well and it's fashion you know El Chapo's picture with a chump and yeah the shirt was on fire I really wanted that shirt you know that Conor McGregor or like War something to mimic it when on purpose when you guys in the press conference for Hatfield dos anjos did you know that he's doing it on purpose yeah that is settled nod to El Chapo I mean he's a legendary status for sure now his kid that was freed by there the the cartel down there he was wearing a skapulario which is like I don't know if you can see it in there that's an interesting get paid piece of a cultural thing from Mexico just got bodyguards head was not even these guys don't even care about him this the head head head head camera thing and there be a putting everybody out there and personally I would put everybody and zip ties and on-the-ground personally so these guys all have guns drawn and there's people inside with guns drawn at them and they realize they realize what they have now so they're like should we forcefully put them in, so how do you know that they're realizing this right is because the language through a lot of the same training that they went through and I did a lot of this type of stuff and all of them would have been in zip ties on the ground who this girl went reach out and grab their guns and put the guns down there so there's fear in these people they realize that they messed up Jesus right so that's what young people question these streaming this video live how to get sent back to the command post so when he was moving around he had one of these on this skapulario it's called like a religious Catholic iconography thing what is yours what is it from work that one like a holy death Effigy and he had that on he had his was a Santo Nino de Atocha which is like a Catholic Christ baby saying they have as soon as that picture of him when on online it was sold out all throughout Sinaloa everybody was wearing that they have to work you know they work those work think I'm free. I'm free areas areas that's the cultural thing called part of it where that's that's Anthony Shrine is right now it's probably most popular shrines in Mexico or that one because they work and then you go to the holy death runs down there and you see how how both sides both Mexican government forces and the cartel they they both been very kind of the same Saints so with that again that's a weird kind of thing they share that Faith was that picture of his truck down there Jamie you have some wacky truck now just a regular Truck Yeah 21 e bella townspeople where is how many cards do you give out I have no idea like a lot of them there's pictures of the El Chapo son gives out cars on Christmas and there's a bunch of cars there who are you like who who are you going to go towards Sam of course government patient cells there's a whole generation of lawyers a whole generation of doctors they pay for immigration procedures so hey you want to know yeah I'll pay for your immigration but okay wow so that that's that's that's how that's how you grow buy them that's kind of their cultural backing that have pop culture backing they kind of look to the Mulberry guys as influence or as inspiration you see you know insane paintings of The Godfather or Scarface and some of these safe houses with these people are right and you're like okay or do you see cartel influenced series for Netflix like there's one called Lorraine those who or which is about a with a female the cartel had the lady that that stars in that show was the one that took Sean Penn down there to mail Chapo because I know with a fan of that show well if they get to go to the terrorist designation he basically went down there to meet with a terrorist what happens in then is it retroactive I don't know I don't know he helped put eyes on on the movements of El Chapo by the Mexican Government why would El Chapo agree to do something like that so crazy though doesn't it seem crazy that he was willing to take that kind of a risk and take a photo with Sean Penn in that that actress what's her name again Bears rumors there's rumors of of a meeting that's about it I don't know anything else</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> or will there be a boat roll over there the bars on on on on one of the slabs how to Titanium again I have to research it basically it's a bit prior titanium. Right when you start it it's kind of hard to put it out so they made this whole on an endless wall with power Titan solar power titanium mix something like that s*** up with right now they sell these things they called bleach pens like and then there's busy than for tactical applications of these pens the sticks that you starting you can burn chains open so I got wasn't so basically I get over again of that is what they're using you know and some of these places and I mean wallets are making it and speaking to some of the border patrol agents that that I that I know it doesn't job at the start slowing people down split up till there's not an overflow people come it's not like 92 Mexico came to a deal and they said nothing that they were going to do there was a North American agreement there was like they were trying to do that with United States and set up a single currency that would be great if us industry moved in there with him will Columbia did a great job and eradicating all the the problems with narcotics I think it is it is not all of them because it still having a gorilla gorilla group down there that recently the farc that went and Dusty and then they got active again but they're still there still a lot of cocaine being produced are no well they were facing a few criminal groups large ones and Mexico is facing a lot of them that and they have the US right next door that is pumping money into the issue directly dinner after flying no and son a long plane flight to short Waterhouse on Mexico's a pretty big country I think people kind of miss that also it's a pretty big country big country do you remember when there was a CIA drug plane that had like several tons of cocaine and crashed because the Mexican Government wouldn't let them land and refuel yeah I mean all sorts of conspiracy theories around all that was a real CIA drug plane that had been to Guantanamo Bay at least twice like it was documented and they for whatever reason I mean I was flying back a lot of coke will do that play the CIA brings and Drug people who work for the CIA realized they can make a shitload of money if they bring in drugs and they they pass that money around and they work it out but the CIA itself does not bringing drugs custom Customs and Border Protection agent agency security is an agency has the most corruption charges as far as all law enforcement agencies is there really a federal federal charges border of course that's that's why I write it doesn't make sense and you know I need it maybe was a CIA guy that said how can make some money through your Tom Cruise movie that was about drugs with Cowboys that work for the CIA and different agencies like look over there or just a little more there like what what's going on and he would see like some sort of okay what's going on they can do anything yeah I mean they have their own cell phone that works in some places yeah we good if I knew but there's also like a whole cities with hidden cameras that are cartel control to see who kills in and out of the of the townspeople how like so late Mexican government is working with uniformed agents patrolling and pickup trucks in the back and these guys are living in 2025 and using drones to do to surveil the Patrols in the area and they're using their own cell phone network so they don't have to worry worry about government tapping into their Communications the utilizing encrypted phone technology that is available now commercially throughout the world to get around some of these things in there and they're working their probably involving and how they work you know I remember the first time I was working in in Baja and all the cartel guys would we move around and Suburbans dressed like federal agents and they would look exactly like the legit federal agents or they were federal agents with the cartel guys so you would and you guys immediately saying I was now we're using taxi cabs to move around and different types of cars and we're going to paint the other Vans like a taxi vans or we can move around in and ambulances so they change their tactics so we were always after these convoys of Suburbans and now they're doing something else so that's how they evolved you're trying to go after it with a hammer in mosquitoes furthest you can get away from all the way up for one of the articles I wrote and he asked him directly like what do you think about the border wall and in the immigration policies of this current Administration is a lot good for business you know it makes it seem like it's hot put people in in the United States so I mean that was pretty hard like how you do it I fly them to Canada they walk down what we talked about it before that the border the United States is a wall to Mexico the border from United States to Canada is it giant clearing that's a hundred yards wide it's real clear you can see it. It's almost like they make it easy hey just come right here I mean you hear you hear numbers from $8,000 to $15,000 depending on who you are and what you're trying to do how you're trying to get up here as far as being smuggled up and he's like past Mexican passport get a Mexican passport if you're Mexican get you a Mexican passport I will put $2,000 in an account somewhere so if they want to verify if you're financially solvent they will check that and just like I can just walk down and that's what we did pass Mexican passport get a Mexican passport if you're Mexican will get you a Mexican passport I will put $2,000 in an account somewhere so if they want to verify if you're financially solvent they will check that and just fly to Canada and just walk down and that's what we do</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Cecilia on this like if they can continue to grow I mean it's is really is it possible that we're looking at a country that might be completely run and overrun by criminal organizations and Drug seller some parts of it are already so you what I think is going to happen is you'll see escalations a clear sign or clear group that is like a like a sign of things to come is is a new general cartel the new generation cartel is a cartel that was used to be called Lowe's and Lapis Edna's it was basically an armed enforcing group that Tina Lockhart Old Maid to go after their main Rivals this at those which were originally members of special Mexican special forces that said you know what we're going to be cartel guys so they whole sordid history was formed formed cuz I'm right and their whole kind of play was that we're going to be against extortion against abducting people against affecting the community we can enforce the law in our communities but we're also going to drive through here right but that yeah that's kind of their thing so you see this group started kind of growing in the region and right now it's pretty big it's why I wasn't feeling well cocktails for his power and and and reach but the way they do their things as militarized is very militaristic and kind of paramilitary kind of reminds me a little bit about of the like the the farc groups in Colombia hearts and minds they go into the communities that community policing in the area that you originally said you know where where the government wants to find drugs here in the region we agree with their fight but we are also going to fight against these guys that are affecting Community as well and they have like groups of people they have they have training camps don't know if mail is heuristic training camps where they recruit people take him there and they're being trained and then guerrilla warfare when shooting and apparently there's some SF guys from the US that buys them so that's it that's the next India vs collation of simple ragtag group of cartel guys enforcing region to an actual cohesive paramilitary group now find it by 4 control not just the lip of the drug routes but also the populist and confidence about his ass in them so we could turn to let it go at some point it just seems like it's the Genie's out of the bottle is it I mean it is I mean it isn't a lot of ways and going after it just as a Drug Enforcement issue is not know it's so much bigger than that cultural economic some of these kids cartel Soldier kids are 12 years old polygons and now they don't have not they don't have option to know life isn't it sad or nothing bro it's either awesome life or short awesome life poverty short awesome life extreme poverty so that's one component to it another component is systemic corruption as a society from who knows when you know it's always been a thing in Mexico people that grew up down there to get stopped at a red light and you're like can I pay the fine here you know people that are be aware this show me a picture of the paperwork you fly that thing in there I know that's you that's part of the culture that's affecting a lot of things as well know people don't pay attention to the small rules so the big rules don't matter and just being next to the largest drug Market on the planet you know and having money Firearms rounds going down and Fentanyl that is it being fabricated Mexico now and some of the Chinese fentanyl making its way through US Cutter feeling the voids that some of the the drug Marquis has right now so they're making fentanyl laced fake fentanyl laced pills they're going to be there being towed into us and Fentanyl fentanyl laced heroin so that's why they're going towards now he's that's why you see this epidemic up here and a lot of things are additionally kind of focused on pot before it was legalized in a lot of reading is up here now is Parowan Federal so it's actually kind of accelerated the production of the harmful and dangerous drugs in some ways yes I mean they had to find another you know it was it went pot meth and Fentanyl laced heroin or fentanyl laced pills in the problem with the idea of legalization is that if you try to be the person who says Hey folks we need to legalize drugs here in America because we've got this problem with the cartel politically that suicide even though it's probably right it is I think it is I think it is very right it's one of those things that's so counter-intuitive that most people are going to go you're crazy going to make my kid hooked on drugs while say that site I was fighting the drug where I literally a drug war veteran and if I had a white flag I would hand it over to you you know it's like it's a useless fight I got to destroy pot feels realistically thinking about all the Akron OH the blood I'm like how to grow back when it is now it is it is a fruitless fight fentanyl heroin may be different drugs fentanyl particulars but a lot of that Fenton was coming from China or setting up Laboratories in Mexico so till it's the Chinese u.s. problem as well God damn what can be done other than the legalization what can be done mean how does unless the United States literally goes to war with the Mexican cartels and you made a face talk about that I mean I'd say designation is going to happen is going to happen I mean again we just saw the murderer the massacre of Mexican dual citizenship people kids women it's not uncommon for that to happen to Mexican Nationals it's pretty uncommon for that to happen to America Nationals down there and that woke up woke up a bunch of people you know and now he's another recent murder of another American National no kid with his parents down there help people will say don't go down in Mexico some of these people you know live down there have family down there have to be down there people have to wake up on this side to realize his problem is not going to get any better this problem is not just a Mexican problem with the u.s. Mexican problem and you know you'll get to a point where it's going to be I think in my life there's going to be some sort of aren't intimate intervention in Mexico at some point really so you anticipate almost like in a Civil War I think something's going to happen in Mexico is going to why's it so much that the US won't have another option but to put boots on the ground probably that's I think that's that's where we're headed the problem and again another problem is that the government is part of the problem so you can go down there and negotiate with this government but six years later going to be another government and you got to renegotiate with them and also use you Palm grease yeah and then you put all your faith in the military and the military gets compromised faith in you in the Mexican Marines and then they get compromised and I will be who you have so it's a stomach don't tell that to Trump excuse we can't count on that we're going in</div>

United States American companies in Mexico are pretty good companies and they're pretty good with their workers and their their Graphics are pretty good lot better than China lot better than China you know and it's a it's a different it's a different game and it's you see DVDs influences go into Mexico because they realize in Mexico is valuable place for them to have influence in front of American culture everybody wants all these manufacturers Ford Mercedes they're all coming out electric cars Porsches going to let your car now I mean that's a big deal and that's right next door all right so I think it again I think as a second largest consumer of American Products in the world is Mexico second largest so economies are intertwined they have a lot of America's living down there is a lot of Blood Ties to within the country of course Americans don't want America to be Mexico and of course a lot of Mexicans want Mexico to be more like America the opportunities and in making Mexico a better place yeah I need to make some make Mexico great again shirts and yeah I'm get to get in fights at the airport is Canada where you know like Canada is f****** wonderful you go over there this amazing cities it's it's great it's safe it's clean if we can make Mexico like that then we have you know it would be better for everybody including Mexico including United States everybody post 911 at the border you could see how businesses started failing in San Diego because it became harder to cross the border so interested there's their symbiotic relationship racism some of the dumbest racism in all of the United States but particularly for California and so stupid I got to see how I can place it like Fallbrook California where the capital of the world cutting down all the avocado trees because there's a drought and there's nobody to pick him no one to pick up people coming up and it's harder to maintain like don't keep they hired illegals and there's holyshit to organize start working on border control like I'm one of those people that believe in borders but I also believe if you are a hard-working person who wants to do better you should have an opportunity in that and I don't think a lot of people particularly poor people that aren't very well-educated there's not an opportunity there's no reason for them to be over the applied for United States citizenship well there's will why you want to come here why I want to come before opportunity what do you have to offer you know I'm a hard worker who has a lot of hard workers me that's really the attitude yeah you know I think we all just got me me I got lucky I got lucky my grandparents came here that got lucky that's all it is just luck and to deny that into deny these other people this opportunity this just got to be a way to filter out bad people media technology fat people better yeah I went through a bunch of questioning okay my background and got a lot of questions for what I usually do right I got to look and it's fine he didn't do anything wrong so like I'm here is fine but you know there's a lot of people like the Luna Luna was here on a green card and he got nabbed when he went to process his full citizenship so he was here for a long time you should just stuck with a green card I would have kept quiet for a later that's why he's in jail right he lied to him to an immigration agent and that's one of the charges he has on a wow so it's pretty interesting that people like him have been a long time of your things like open Secrets in and yeah I mean again not all not all Mexicans Good Guys in 09 people come up here I got some of the people that that I've met out here that are kind of on the same boat as I am at fresh in the country you know doing manual labor construction working Kentucky I met a bunch of guys that were working on the Kentucky Derby or the horse stalls around them all Mexicans get smell of me other party is the good food is usually he could smell you know where they are doing manual labor construction working at Kentucky I met a bunch of guys that were working on the Kentucky Derby or the horse stalls around them all Mexicans get smell of Mila tortillas the good food is usually he can smell you know where they are</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when you first started working on the Mexican Government with this they wasn't like it is now it was so I went to work for state government down in Mexico in Baja specifically and this was 2000 for like right before the start of the official start of the kickoff of the drug war as as as a coffee cake but there was that the official start was one Felipe Calderon came into office that you know what gloves off going to go after they organized crime right we going to send the military into into this onto the streets and they're going to head up spearhead operations against the cartels but before that things were happening still Sinaloa cartel the swelling and there was a rift between the Sinaloa cartel in Tijuana cartel and fragmentation cartel heads were being killed one Kartel tempted to three all this fragmentation and then they basically militarize the War on Drugs with Calderon came in mail try the War on Drugs immediately you start seeing that drug drug enforcement efforts were being put towards a single or a group of cartel groups but not the month but not the major one like Sinaloa cartel to start seeing how they were basically taking sides they're breaking up the competition that's what gather from the making it look like progress and also El Chapo has been built up until this mythical figure like he was the head of the Sinaloa cartel is a main guy that's not true at all he was an operator for the Sinaloa cartel but not the main operator you know there's different see reason and NN about who is actually who's actually in charge of the brain is behind the whole operation when you say Sinaloa cartel it's not one group it several the Federation of several criminal groups surprises uniting and working in conjunction to put drugs into the into the United States or one of the things I do is put a lot of things but that's one of the things they do so certain people there's a lot of people out there that which is El Chapo's Compadre who still out there is the actual head of the Sinaloa cartel has been since the start that you see how some of these people become celebrities and as soon as somebody becomes a celebrity like El Chapo Hulu few times in order you know pretty interesting situations that situation now the government has a celebrity that can go after they can point that gun so that you saw a lot of that around him as far as him being the head of whatever group or operation was but at the same time you start seeing you know the DEA and the US government can decorating and putting all these Awards on a guy like Luna who was the guy that got arrested recently it was head of security down to Mexico and all the sudden he's now he's not yelling he was recognized by the US government is being a player for the good guys and now he's arrested please start seeing all these different interests different political political kind of movement around the drug war and what that turn into and you know what you don't know what to think right each us Administration has changed the way they do things when it comes to the drug war and also benefits certain groups down there so you know who knows realistic Rock 2002-2003 somewhere around that time and there was no concern as a different time 17 years ago that's so recent in terms of like human history yeah that a region changes so radically so quickly while it's it's it's there's a lot of things happening you know there's a lot of interest in China has a lot of interest in Mexico and you go back and you see something like they cook the whole group do in the Michoacan are you fighting back against the cartels the the whole it was like series like a documentary on them the the out to the fence as they would they would call basically like Vigilantes ribs and then you later on you realize that they were all fighting for basically protecting or Kink or working around security for illegal Chinese or Meijer mining in the area yeah it was all about the Chinese or mining iron ore mining illegal Chinese or my children Chinese or minors they just made a deal and then we can get it on it so let's are all these guys and protecting our communities but they were not all of them but there was a lot of shady stuff going on the region and when it comes to that now you see things like that stuff is going on in Sonora and there's a lot of lithium there that's pretty valuable thing you know Nora is a place that a lot Hunter's go yeah Sonora has he's big hunting ranches and it's like it's famous for giant mule deer yeah yeah yeah I've been up out there hunting myself and it's a it's a beautiful but the beautiful are part of Mexico but that seems like a sketchy spot to venturing into it's perfect because it's because a rule so there's nobody around down there so little hunting I mean that my recommendation is sap out of don't don't take it down there to f****** you go and we do have the largest population of American citizens living outside of the country in Mexico for some reason freedom but but there's there's a I get the I get to draw you know what some of these communities down there pretty safe but some aren't you know if they're safe until they're not safe and safe until they until they all the sudden you're in the middle of a someplace I just going to be the speed at which I think is something along the lines of what happened to some of these Mormon communities down there you know you're on you're you're in the middle of your community and your movements are in the middle of our until they all the sudden you're in the middle of a someplace I was going to be the speed at which I think is something along the lines of what happened to some of these Mormon communities down there now you're on your you're in the middle of your community and your movements are in the middle of our route can you please get out of the way</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I started my immigration process when he got elected oh no it's it's it's been a trip how does that work like if you are Mexican born citizen and you want to become a United States citizen and obviously it's very difficult it so married to an American have an American kid that's how I went through the process myself and you know I got a green card the the thing is when he got elected everybody said you know what maybe our time to get a green card going to get be less and less so let's all try and get one so what would take normally six months to two years oh wow so those two year to can't leave the country so if you what happens to people that are illegal that's what's f***** up about it right so there's people that came over here illegally 20-30 years ago and they've done no crimes they've been an integral part of society they've had great live they can't pay taxes they can't vote they have to live under cover their stupid they're there and they do provide and they pay taxes to other but they're not paying taxes but if you made them citizens you would make money illegals and they will be here until they die it legally and we know they're here like how about work with what you've got lucky Verde do you do when your best to stop the Border traffic great fantastic but listen lose forget about the past these people are here they're here and they're part of our community like how you how you going to deny them citizenship to the day they die and they're still here legal immigration through is hard enough it's it was a hard process it's it's it's it's a difficult process and you speak fluent English yes that's another thing people in the line with me you know that did not speak a lick of English but they were from a country that had a quota I have friends from Canada that come over here and try to come sit as soon as I stop f****** grind don't get me wrong I love this country I bet I'm new here and I like what I see I don't like where it's going in some places what don't you like I don't like I mean I left my country because I couldn't defend myself from the bad people out there who the Second Amendment second and then it's a beautiful thing you have no idea how beautiful that Stella you don't have an option to have it that's one thing I like to eat opportunities this country provides I've had a lot of opportunity I would never get anywhere else I like to you got you work and work you the work input in matters here I like I like how was segmented indifferently to go to Tennessee and you meet people out there and they're great people you know there's some real people have preconceived notions of what some of the countries are but I've loved it and then you go to California and you meet people we're on the same boat as I was and their forgot completely when Mexico is and they're completely American eyes and they're completely against you as a new person here and 3rd Generation Mexicans the worst enemy of a Mexican is another Mexican That's a classic. can being on your show the first time was from Latinos is specifically Mexican Latino what was the negativity protested the Caravans going through Tijuana and wrecking their city that was beauty isn't that extreme to the right or conservative Viewpoint that apparently you have a fact yeah you got to talk about it when you're not set you did make a value judgment saying that those people coming through or protested by Mexicans need to go back to wherever f****** rice Patty they come from you didn't say any of that this is what I saw when I went and talked about it for a while when I was happening Byron Caravan goes through obviously a lot of those guys were gang members a lot of them or not all of them a lot of the more covering tattoos is pretty hot out wearing all the goodies cameras came by the females of the children won't be in putting front parade in front of medium to anybody was there you could see the circus is going on and then a lot of a lot of the camp and catmints they would they would be no later than comments with Needle on the outside one of them was next to a school that got to be closed down a niece of mine had a kid in there and the school had to be closed down because it was next one is in Captain it would protest and close down Lanes those people that live in TJ some of them are Americans and the commute so that's their livelihood people that work on terrorism and TJ white with hood went down so the fact that these people came and disrupted all that whole thing and then you would see these a Californian hippie American guys come down there and do puppet shows for these people and hand over a donation to the phone with canned food blankets and stuff like that and then you would see these guys go to the back door and saw that stuff in the back and just get money for whatever they were going to use the money for it we would like view online because I started posting some of the stuff online for people this is what's happening and that was like no no no you going against the narrative narrative the narrative in the people that are talking about you go and gets a narrative really no idea they don't care about the truth that's what's crazy the absolute that's it I'm like so simple I can't even vote up here yet you don't have to be a full citizen to go out so that it doesn't even factor in the goddamn it's so crazy what else about the youth in America like I have I have a weird mental comparison of seeing my nephew's down there playing soccer going out and getting the trouble going to the cockfights which is probably pretty dangerous but they go to Cock fights off of that and I'll see kids up here on their tablet you know playing games video games getting offended by something you know down there you can still punch somebody in the face if they get into your face in school I'll be allowed to do that dismiss you was probably going to get out of school or something and you see this weird specification of American children safe spaces say that that's Politically Incorrect I saw the California gun laws change like I got to see the weird California compliant rifles come to the range and you have to push a button to release the magazine and make it more difficult to reload yeah so strange if if if if yeah the idea that you just can't handicap law-abiding citizen citizens and that's going to somehow or another save lives in mass shootings and here's the other thing about you and I'm waiting for this to happen but it's just not happening there never addressing people using psychotropic drugs they're not if they don't address that although School shooters all those Mass Shooters are all on drugs they're on some kind of Psych drugs and there is no mention of it whatsoever like what what is I actually think it's all about the guns and the guns are a huge issue mean the fact that these people who are f***** up and yeah they that they have access and they can get access to these guns and they can wind up shooting people yes that is one issue Securities another issue there's another issue and that's mental health in this that. Tumi's the biggest one because without the mental health issue you don't get Mass shooters Mexico cartel guys going to a town shoot up a bunch of people and it's pretty horrible but on the Mexican side we only had one school shooting that like a notable one and it was mentally okay Google's being prescribed to children in Mexico is it similar not at all. I mean we were so behind and some and some incense as far as you know I don't know about PTSD so I came up here or TBI like I had like what you're describing that you're feeling sounds like TV I really yeah you should get yourself checked out and then you go down there like I think would happen and people look at you now and it's just a few days off take a few shots of tequila fine it back at it well that's the old school mentality World War New Mexico looks like snot snot at anywhere as far as medicating it kids being diagnosed with things like office with autism is a thing that I only recently kind of heard about 15 years ago in Mexico in Mexico and what about anti-psychotic drugs and always different drugs that you're seeing that these a lot of the School shooters were taking in Mexico is not a thing you know people think that it's pretty primitive in Mexico I can get any drug if you pay somebody off Eastside psychiatric level they're they're not they're not available down there were people that you can go to the new like what do you want this is not available so it's not a part of the culture now it's such a huge part of the culture that people want people are constantly wanted to take something to take the edge off or take something so they can feel better take something to you know to just to just to alter their state and the doctor prescribed to them constantly wanted to take something to take the edge off or take something so they can feel better take something to you know to just a disa alter their state and the doctor prescribed to them and then the pharmaceutical drug companies or just raking in the cash from it so it just becomes a part of reality</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> complaining about Will Smith Will Smith being the genie for some reason has complain about everything although I do have to tell you I want to see Frozen the musical cuz I have daughter first of all it was wonderful Productions excellents really good I mean I actually enjoyed the the music was very good however it's about people that live in the Arctic or they did live in Nordic country right right there all these blind people wipe well the dads black in the in the musical and the moms Chinese okay and then the dad black in the moms Chinese which is great they're great actor cigars why do they have kids for carrying the kid one of the kids is Chinese and one of the kids as white in the kids grow up and they're both White I am a girl I don't know if she was a young Asian girl that she may be became a white girl did she make pee pee in your Coke that's how you know she was great at her job I mean she had Perfect singing and everything was beautiful to predict that they were very talented but they're requiring you to make this leap like now you have to know that this is now a different ethnicity is a different person pretend does the same person like in most movies where you have someone plays a young version of the guy it looks like the guy it's not like you have a young Chinese guy who becomes Clint Eastwood you like hey what are you doing here like what are we making young Clint Eastwood he's supposed to look like he could be right young Clint Eastwood they were there was a video game that takes place in middle age is very possibly maybe you guys know the name of the blanking on it and they were they were black people there because everyone on Twitter and Facebook still thinks they're in the sixties and this is their personal march on Selma and they're fighting against segregation like this isn't segregation in history if you want to watch make a movie about Egypt right you should use people that look or through Egyptian yes if you decide you're going to just have only white people from Norway play Egyptian people going to want to kick your ass and that's kind of the same thing you're f****** with reality nothing with frozen but it was a movie for any historical depiction a thing where you like depicting an actual time and if you want to have like like the wild west when do movie about the wild west you have to have European settlers give do some African slaves there and you have to have a lot of lot of Native Americans you can't just decide we're going to do a film about the wild west but everyone's black all black crew all black writers black power going to make it happen if you can't if you did that movie people are there slaves yes black people have slaves yes my favorite comic book series of all time was Legion of super-heroes right and I just takes place in the 13th century and I was just 30 Century thousand years from now it's just they're just keep rebooting it number two just came out and I was looking at the cover you have chameleon boy who's orange with any Brainiac 5 was green and a living computer Shadow lass is blue but they had to make Lightning Lad black for some reason now it's just like these are 4T diapers some of them don't even have a body but they have to change the race just to it it's just really kind of a I guess the thing you do any stay woke but in retrospect it's going to be embarrassing cuz you not know about staying with my I'm very familiar you stay woke at all I never sleep do you ever think about like trying to be like a little more woke and people like it better everything pride of America this sounds like it's such a strange time man but it's always a strange time I didn't know it makes it good is that this can be called out and discussed and be like look this isn't about race or races and why is it important to you that this Chinese girl in Frozen grows up to become white look just like it was a very good music enjoy more because I saw the Brokenness upper Buckeye saw they did some work Shadows like I see what you're doing not to say that the Asian lady wasn't fantastic as a mom she was there the black guy's a dad he was amazing but you want me to believe that a block I made it with an Asian lady they made two blond kids one of them started out Asian and then became European later we don't know if that we don't know that he was their dad you know she's hauling around know she's not around because if she is she's holding her out with a goddamn chameleon to the child morphs as it gets older about A different race of the same person the same character that but the point is it's still not going to happen to a black guy in a Chinese person I can have a white kid so maybe the Chinese lady had sex with a white guy people think Corporate America is very conservative but they're the first ones to be pushing the stuff out of the Rosen Times Square New York pride month rainbow Flags everywhere and I said only Corporate America can make starting perversion look boring and I said only Corporate America can make sodomy in perversion look boring</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> remember when they had that 11 year old drag queen The Desmond is amazing and dancing around like it was some this what a what a great thing what a great thing was living his truth is so brave I imagine if there's a 12 year old that was just sworn to be a hoe like I am a hoe I'm just going to wear fishnets right and high heels and I'm going to stick my ass out of a dancer powder around a lot of money makeup on how different is that while he's also on the Spectrum I think I'm 99% sure so the Ennis photos him with naked drag queens by with chachki and it's just like look this is something for well here's the question to do you think guys hooked up with him know if not I'll let you want to talk about this because this is a rabbit hole that I've been on recently kids getting f***** because I had a friend in October who sat me down and he's like look I was raped as a kid for a long time and he only realized cuz of the show because he was watching when Jake The Snake was on the show my friend Matt and Jake was saying he's like all the s*** this is me and this really f***** him up for a while and if he's talking to me and he goes I can't even be mad because it was another older kid and I know he was getting it worse than me and the thing that's really f*****-up is he to know how is going to react right so used to be mommy's sleepy no mommy was a drunk right and until Betty Ford the first lady came out as an alcoholic now people like to view someone's doesn't my mom's an alcoholic you like all that sucks but the right if someone's if Daddy had a temper no Daddy was abusive but we know what to do with that information and when I started talking about us on Twitter and elsewhere that this is really common and because all of us do not think of kids in this way we want to think about it so sick they're the ones who have to deal with this nightmare and it's really really ever want to talk to know someone and I told another fun when he's like yeah my sister I just found out was being molested by her grandfather whole life and then it's like she's the one who's acting out and was yelling at her for acting out so Joe II name one of the things I want to talk about is this is something that has to change these people can't be the ones who have to worry that if they tell me your friend that we're going to look at them like all your free gotten what to do with this cuz they're the ones who are suffering for a very long time and I think that keeps people from speaking out cuz the fear of being I did it almost rather keep it to themselves and not other people know that they've been molested they don't want to for you to be uncomfortable around them and there was a girl in my high school she told another girl that her brother been raping her for years and she went to Mom and Mom says you know he's talking about that can't happen but this happens all the time and we don't have the space to discuss it so I've just been kind of talking about this a lot more encouraging people to talk about this a lot more because it's really really a lot of people are suffering because of this and what do you do here's the big question something like that what do you do to help the person who's been molested and what you do what you do to the person who molest someone while I the person who did it I have it I don't know but I think what happens is just like with gay rights right the more people who come out and talk about it the more easy it is for someone to call someone else if you like this happen to me you know what I'm going through let's have this conversation have you seen this very strange Trend that's rare but common enough and actually predicted where people are talking about people that are pedophiles that it's some sort of a sexual inclination that we should have sympathy for them because it's no. It's nothing to ask for it's no different than being born gay or being it is just a thing where you're born in a way that is there any science to back that up at all I would perfectly happy to believe that people can be born at this inclination I don't care if I'm bored I want to murder people will I better figure out how to deal with this and I think that's a complete in many ways red herring if it's something that they can't change that doesn't that makes it worse that means you have no reason to even there like any better you're going to be what were the resources are so they're going to be disproportionate in those fields where you are interacting with your targets so that's what makes it so sick it's not like you have these ideas okay fine you can have whatever it is you want you were laying those background work you know what to pray on these kids and you know what you're doing it's on again I don't know what to do with this information but I do know that this is really really bad and you know people talk about this is the truest form of being a v in the sickest part about it to me is how many of these kids go on to molest other kids yeah it's it's like a like a disease like they're caught a disease I told Matt that he there's two ways right they go on I told Matt you should consider reaching out to this guy and tell him you forgive him because he's like because it's possible that you're like 10 or 11 you're doing this you grow up and you realize what you've done and what this means and I don't know how you can live with yourself while we have to hope and assume that it ended with that but he didn't continue doing it as we get older and right with the same age child and then you think and what happened talk with divorce cuz it's shameful I didn't understand what they were saying but whatever and I was like oh that's just crazy uncle Nick keeping away from the kids is like that's not a thing Uncle Nick you were talking just a bunch of people that really cared about each other we're good friends I think we should kill pedophiles should be like f*** yeah but most people say yes but in public and public discourse I sang to kill pedophiles like okay because a problem sometimes people get accused of being pedophiles they're not like remember that that there was a daycare school and these kids are actually being coached into saying all because these kids have made stuff up another people would like coached him into making more stuff off and then everything got crazier and crazier what was the name of that it was it was a very famous case with them and they made a documentary about it because it shows almost like there's a mass hysteria that can go on especially talking about something that's a particularly heinous right like the abduction and or the rape of children rather because we're also scared of that being real that will pay attention as much as possible so they have these new stories they have all these different things that are attached to this and then probing to keep asking question and then it accelerating growth and cuz it's a focal point of attention but people start lying but we're also so scared so we don't want to think it could be true and we don't want to think either one tried true write someone would molest kids or the kids would be coached in the lion but I must have a more horrible I'm much more concerned with people who are dealing with this and how they can get that so I think that yes I just have a friend and Anakin everyone I've talked to know someone one degree of separation and I'm just saying for the people who had gone through this just like not listening to the show died this way I told him my experience with people come to univ on Broadway don't tell them what you think they want to hear beat as a vulnerable to return so I said to him I don't matter I don't care I don't think of you any differently I don't think you're damaged I don't think you're free I think it's awful I can't relate to this at all I know you're glad I can't relate to this at all return so I said to him I don't matter I don't care I don't think of you any differently I don't think you're damaged I don't think you're a freak I think it's awful I can't relate to this at all I know you're glad I can't relate to this at all and I think it's great that you want me to kind of talk about this that stop someone from blowing your brains out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so your podcast yeah was the big podcast that kind of sunk Milo kind of a combination it was me watching him on your show that let us to ask about that cuz I saw him on your show and he was like God at the time cuz I remember at the time he was on our show I told Paul one of my co-host like Paul this guy ain't no lightweight and he's got a huge Army A6 dance right now if you get the debate with him if you lose your total b**** if you tie you lose if you win by a little you lose the only way you can actually beat him with his army of sycophantic this time is if you just demolish him so don't even try you were concerned about this like this is like something you planned out in advance no I mean I wasn't really it wasn't a plan I just wanted to bring it up cuz I saw him on your show saying and I'm like that's very strange coming from sure cuz I knew that he had had experiences like sexual experiences when he was younger a 13 year old boy no matter how flamboyantly gay or sexually aggressive you know jumping the priest bones or something you know sort of gives you a better understanding of how this guy came to be who he is today and why he's so relishes his role of being the contrarian and being this this sort of very difficult to pigeonhole game and who's very conservative but yet believes in man Boy Love in the sub if you go back and you read old articles that he wrote for Publications that he worked for in the past there was a lot of stuff like we're going to take on bullying on Twitter and you know we need to make a safe space for people on online this is Milo and now he's like the biggest troll last time I was on your show when you told me you can't put the seed in my brain like it's kind of like fake and the more I looked into it the more I have to question whether or not that s*** with the priest even happens to begin with because I just don't I don't know I don't really trust this s*** that comes out of his mouth in terms of like face value lot of times when Milo tries to make a point he doesn't necessarily make it by directly saying it he tries to make it through like performance art on Bill Maher and and you know he's he's he's doing this whole flamboyant gay conservative thing because he wants the the liberal Bill Maher audience to be like boo boo look what Hypocrites they obviously I'm not gay people Milo Scandal broke would like I took him down it was me he was you saying yeah and it's a lot of very calculated stuff blob and get people active and get people to talk about him and that's the reason why he does this tour oncologist Amy Wilds why not do it in the Lion's Den if you want to get the Roars when he's doing it like where he feels like this problem is the greatest club downtown what's really insane is that was of the mayor of San Francisco there was a plotting the protoss like hey f******* there was $100,000 worth of property damage people throwing chairs or Starbucks windows and lighting cop cars on fire at least this ain't good there's been articles on like I almost made a video about this article on The Huffington Post actually it was basically like violence is as valid a reaction to Trump is anything that's like wow you're literally just advocating for violence and you think you're so enlightened yeah it's completely foolish it's like it goes and when things aren't going the way it goes against everything they've stood for before what about kindness what about compassion what about treating people with love what about facts that's okay with her and power and power but when someone else like it all kind of goes both ways. on your way it goes against everything they've stood for before what about kindness what about compassion what about treating people with love what about facts but that's okay with her and power and power but when someone else is in power that they don't like it all kind of goes both ways.</div>

I should be scared us come over to hear what you mean that kind of Technology can be used against Americans by another country well frankly if they're going to be terrorists I'd rather than taking it one person than 3,000 don't know for sure they have that kind of ability ability in general another like really sketchy in terms of like the legality of it like what it's not really a military story but it's definitely a military strike I mean I think we've been playing fast and loose with the rules of War for a long time and I think everyone knows this is nothing physically insightful that wore in the rules of War written by the powerful people I remember when people were talking about how much of a warmonger Obama was because drone strikes went up considerably from Obama from George Bush to you know what else went up drone technology yeah they're just getting better bombing people they know how to do it better and this is something I'd argue with people and wonder about when you become Fred like Obama was very anti-war through his campaign he was a big Lefty he went to call Ivy League schools bubble a culture that he came from he gets in the White House's drone bombing everybody do you think that they sit you down when you're president and alright here's what you can be in charge of but here is how it's going to be internationally and I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way it happens I think there's no way until you get into office you ever really understand what information what do you know what what what plans that they can reveal that terrorists have what you know what what kind of mean there's there's got to be some kind of intelligence they receive that probably scares the f*** out of them, yeah when you stop and think about how many nuclear bombs there are how many radical terrorist there are how many different Sexes how many people fight over each other the here are some photographs of a crime scene that we found that Isis behead all these holy act like this is all real stuff that you think could show you and then go look we have done our very best to keep everybody safe but there's only one way to keep doing this we got a drone bomb thrown away I know that many years ago that enough just know this but I'll be all there was a nail bomb in Grand Central that they caught in the no one talked about it and talked about it who found the nail bomb authorities the right people and they took care of it and nothing happened but think how many soft targets there are nail bomb down further information on my question you further you could question you want tell me the story again where the sky is left probably I don't know but if I since I've been through at grand central air quality Business Place Grand Central where the sky is the spot where the bomb was left probably how do you know where the bones I don't know but ever since I've been through at grand central air quality</div>

could lose brothers and sisters and friends and all of it that's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen there was this like the group of four pictures of this little kid I remember his name Timmy and it's like the first one he's like camouflage like holding up a photo of his dad then they made a stuffed animal with his dad's face on it and these like holding up a sign it's like I love you Dad can't wait to see you soon like the dad was dead like 20 and then let's show some support for little Timmy I'm like this just out of his one of him kissing the dad gravestone and I'm like this is not good like yeah we should support this kid but it would be a lot better if he wasn't in this position it's heartbreaking and just sitting and cuddling with his dad's doll or was it really messed with me something Sears Shuffle and we need less of that you would definitely not as as little as tall as mean as little of that as possible it's just heartbreaking to say and he's just so cute and proud isn't it crazy that you really only can say as little as of that as we can you can't really say we should have no war because no one thinks that cuz he wants a conflict each other but that's amazing

still we got more than someone wants to take your stuff and I don't you know someone else cuz I don't want you taking my stuff this is Vin you know it's but it's gotten a lot better definitely not a lot better no I mean it used to be it was considered appropriate that if you beat someone in a war you kill everyone yes and now it's like maybe you don't need to literally kill everyone or maybe you killed his General and then they kill some of your guys and then you kill a bunch of people they kill a bunch of your people and they say if you do that again what can you do have a happy ending son-of-a-b**** what you do you'll be out here with a f****** crazy suit on that would be no one here to listen to us the 45 it was 45 45 its and no one else has either that's what it except for Russia nuking themselves basically Chernobyl UPS yeah and then North Korea did they do that then they experiment in the mountains yes and then Mountain but I don't think anyone died so yeah how could they possibly say they were Ron Hey f***** up f***** up his back and explaining this I I think you he's not going to back that loan this is not a back down there anyway do you think it's possible that they could somehow another work this out yes really yeah because look even worth it innocence the sanctions and how we've kind of collapsed my reminder standing I'm not an expert arranz currency is also a huge deal and it's caused a lot of you know suffering there so they didn't do anything about that true could you know if your dick big enough and Demands a response and I don't think they're not going to respond they could respond Subway that's kind of like the safe face now how many write and write how many people do you think are in the Iranian regime that want change and that realizing that the Iranian regime and their support of certain aspects of terrorism and then the support of a lot of the stuff they're claiming this guy did including the the IDS and this is all problematic they brought this upon them by their acts and their deeds that we need to change the government like that really what a sophisticated intelligence society would want they want they would want to figure out how to infiltrate that thing that organization and sow seeds of doubt and like let everybody know how do you love your children cuz out I just made a giant f****** mistake I can look at it through the lens of stuff actually kind of worried about what you like North Korea and the Soviet Union and what happens if these regimes of people the top aren't they are cuz they're smarter charismatic they're there cuz they're loyal that's the first test word everyone's always looking after each other the kind of like look this guy's gun soft and they're getting rid of each other that way that's the power place going on over there so if you have someone being like oh maybe we shouldn't do terrorism all of a sudden everyone is Raising eyebrows and being like this cuz if you're going to advocate for that everyone's got to be on the same page cuz that's a big move to make right rights of 1 guys like because maybe this is evil it's like okay now you're making us look evil and I don't like having this voice in the meeting so it I think it's going to be very hard to have sex thing is about this strike because it was so precise I'm sure they're scared also that he would have no problem killing them individually that's the real fear so it's like oh if I ask like this he might be coming for me personally next or the people if there is a you know Revolt it could be like adopting your being raped to death by like a broomstick and they don't want that you stand there and shocking a stabbing on the a****** what's up with an item like yeah but you guys going to be the amount you would Jima Guy The Future you know about you but what I'm worried about is some sort of an attack on on some sort of a public place like a Disneyland it'll be a lot easier for them hitting his real hate them Love Like a Rock somewhere so who knows what would I need what they did with the Iraq war with it when it was Bush and Tony Blair they bombed the train station in Spain and Spain couldn't get out of there fast enough so it could be that they're going after one of her allies to separate us you know that might be a smart move to do you go from there so many spots I hit you know what I mean there's no way you can really it's like a shell game there's only so many shells what do you mean yes I'm very hopeful 40% of the world is on the table at all no cuz I think what happens is Russia and China and Britain sit down with us and Iraq and Iran and the like this is how it's going to be that's what I think happens everdream what is the cold medicine that he had Sudafed I wonder if he's being used in that regard I need a wrecking ball being used in that regard</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so it was one of the things we wanted to talk about when we first started one of them was a Jeffrey Epstein remember what the other one was you were going to show me The Jeffy Ooh Child I don't know if you got a betdsi you can stand if they only drop one nuke and it's on the White House small one little baby nuke levels the entire building and everything near it was Iran jumper dropped out of their the nuclear Accord so they're going to start enriching uranium again Iran nuclear weapons! check something right but they can get them this is so crazy this seems like for the first time in a long time I'm thinking we could go to war with a country but just seems crazy the internet jumped in the World War 3 I don't know I don't know what's happening right now I could be good stuff could be happening right now it's what did the guy do cuz Dan Crenshaw was saying that he organized the attack on the embassy and then he was organizing other attacks on us sites he was a bad guy supposed to be like there was there is some stuff saying like that he is a bad guy. It's just how Trump did it is how the problem he did help fight Isis a lot also so he wasn't you was a really guy but there was points like the biggest problem is that Trump has went out pretty much assassinated him instead of dealing with it like an adult imagine when they went through all those other like really finally detailed points this is a strategy we can employ or we just take them out and mess hall did he already was trolling Trump to like trolling on Twitter I don't know if that was true imagine imagine retarded orange get its fake ass f****** baby hands is like hell yeah fukin baby hands oh my God he got into a meme battle with Trump set aside to do things look real I don't want to come in today yet cuz I have a feeling I have a lot to say about this situation that might kill a million people our leaders I got to make this critical decisions for us and I got to be in charge of whether it what kind of diplomacy we employ on other nations to represent us in the most personal way possible like it the way he does it a joint Trump doesn't that's personal that's how he is so he's standing for us but he's standing up for himself as a person as part of that to write like he doesn't want to be f***** with you want you to know the United States not to be f***** with me and charge him he's the one out there and he's you can give you this new guys I hope I just Newcomb Commander the Islamic revolution guards corpse Force Major General soleimani with a Game of Thrones inspired meme of his own it says I will stand against you and it has the game with things like oh and you so he put that up and then Trump that is a couple months ago but I doubt he removed this is November 2018 so crazy it's so crazy that these world have collided what do you think Putin is probably laughing his ass off right now he's probably got his feet up on the chair smoking a cigar just laughing and laughing watching this chaos play out and then for sure he's going to help Iran for sure so dumb it's also scary but it's also one of those things where we don't know what the f*** is going on so it could have been the right move we don't know I mean it might it might have been the thing you have to do to avoid more more deaths China Russia and Iran hold joint Naval drills in the Gulf of Oman horrific China Russia and Iran together we're getting to some World War I hear that's World War 3 Italy join in Germany that's what that is away from the coast bro I'm bad imagine if this f****** guy gets us into World War 3 by deciding to do that and then have all these crazy threats to the rest of the world does not want to think just want to things like if you think you're the baddest mother f***** and you represent the baddest country you got to kind of almost be like a real badass motherfuker like a guy like eBay miocic like the UFC heavyweight champ don't go around saying they going to kick everybody's ass cuz everybody knows it and if you you start saying that you're going to be able to do whatever you want to maybe even doing it disproportionate Manor all the other countries like why do you have any power pack or Yuma and it's a really powerful we all get together that's a weird thing to do to take on a country that has allies that's where it gets f***** up it's not just Iran Iran it's all Iran's allies they all get together now you have a giant force of people and nuclear weapons congratulations did you guys play chess or did you put Checkers growing up and you didn't see this coming this is why it's really important to have you know people have to be able to talk of dialogue you see the sweet 3752 Iranian sites representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago bro that was during the Carter Administration I think we can let that go the same f****** people those people are all dead this that's crazy so this is Morty mentality this s*** to get hot get hot and they can get real and if he really has the ability to do that what are the causes he have the ability to do is there ever going to be another moment like that where I ran box is in a ship and then he sends in a fighter jet I mean is this going to really f****** happen because then none of us can go anywhere we have to hide and we got to get out of LA because it definitely knew that like this is because imagine the movie is it all played out like that in like a Stephen King movie made a thing about a game show host that eventually becomes the president knighted states and starts a war while he's on speed before this was enough to make me go holy s*** like is there a better way to handle that then blast knock out of the robot from the sky like start I don't know man I don't want to know right you don't want to know that all over the world these little pieces are in motion they're trying to protect us from terrorists trying to make sure that they stop Isis and this sect is growing here and these people getting shot there and what about the cartels not getting up as much if you would be paralyzed by fear if you took in all the information on all the f****** danger all over the world apparel I fear test I was when I was in Vegas while this was happening this weekend if you didn't look at your phone you wouldn't have known yeah this is going on though I didn't hear anybody talking about it yeah I didn't even all around it was a good thing about being off social media and this is was my point the first way is by the time things get to me it's it's already been sorted distributed better you know that you know I have to jump on right away and then it becomes the focus my day long with what we know anything and keep refreshing CNN every 5 minutes I'm scared like legitimately just looking for the first time in a long time since like 911 where I'm legitimately like oh oh this is this is some real s*** this could be really bad because if he says he's going to do something in a disproportionate matter he's threatening them he's calling their Bluff brothers so dangerous so dangerous because all they have to do is just Nuka why do something like that where the rest of the world hey hey hey what are you doing killing each other everywhere everyone cuz that's what could happen just like mutually assured destruction was always supposed to be the the big impediment that mutually assured destruction if we knew that if we shot them they shoot us we'd all be dead that that's what kept us from using bombs but who the f*** knows man what if Iran just says listen if we just sneak a bomb in by the time it's detonated they won't even have a chance to respond the whole system will be f***** the griddle be down all their entertainment will be down everything will be down and then the rest of the world can figure out a way to unite together and take over the power to the United States once enjoyed they were abusing that power they were the number one superpower in the world and they let their guy take diet pills and threatened everybody on Twitter I don't know if he takes pills abusing that power they were the number one superpower in the world and they let their guy take diet pills and threatened everybody on Twitter I don't know if he feels those are his</div>

that's one thing that you don't want to be misconstrued if you want to talk to make signs and yell like you don't like me like hey hey we're not talking deaf deaf guys right oh yeah definitely not that that scream death to America everyone's going to know the worst way to communicate something you don't really think that why would you say death to the American political system the American Military complex Captain America that's American everybody has messed up in some International conflict you actually have to think about might come knocking on your door mixed with scumbaggery let us to this position did Trump done anything weird timing though with this hole impeachment set why it's all weird it's all weird the fact that Trump can kill people who could just go send it in send the missile just shoot missiles he can just listen man don't give me that power either don't give anybody that power for sure but a guy like Trump guy was famous for being mean to people on a reality show being a baller I mean that Suites famous for you that's the crazy thing like he was in rap songs all the time in like a complimentary way has gone to an arch Home Alone 2 history you going to go into

decision to ban Trump calling for you just open up the windows and hear liberals cheering like King Kong just fell off the Empire State Building we have YouTube videos just screaming and popping their fists in the air and pointing to the screen Donald Trump and says owned it would be hilarious and all he would have to do is do that and and go over somewhere else and that new platform would be f****** gigantic cuz everybody would want to know what he says if he says it over there everybody else you just retweet on Twitter anyway it would probably be like killing coyotes you know how you kill coyotes and then they more coyotes like a female when they when they when they shout out that's like a roll call and if someone's missing the female make more babies that's one of the craziest things about coyotes that's why they're everywhere that's what happened with Trump they ban WAP Twitter his signal would be bigger than ever it would be f****** Bonkers like you're in a precarious situation now too because he's these social media companies they're they're being labeled as someone who would ban freedom of speech from certain people if they don't believe it there now this happens to be the president that they say you can't have freedom of speech on our platform anymore then everything is like out the window what is this what are we doing and then if it backfires and Twitter loses all of its power and some other f****** company comes along and takes the spot some company that promises to never do that to the president let people Express themselves but explain perhaps through f****** series of checks and balances why you can't somebody or be mean to somebody or just making sense Trump Towers everywhere I got him in Vegas and Chicago and all over the world like he's got to be a guy that's always thinking about doing the next thing and if you was like you would think he's like setting himself up as a business is like he's a business he's at he's now not just the president and he's always been a business he's always been a celebrity in and you know iconic Financial character but now his entertainment like what he says about life and everything f****** super valuable if Trump like Trump at that show if he decides out podcast no goddamn crazy would be if Donald Trump just pulls up has a YouTube channel talk show the camera says what he really thinks about everything they release it as a podcast as well and no one can stop them cuz that's freedom of speech is freedom of speech is let this guy talk if you start threatening people like threatening Iran from his YouTube channel imagine if World War 3 is caused by a tweet massive Trump threatens someone and they retaliate to show they're not scared we nuked them and then oh my God from a trump tweet with all this I ran things it might happen faster it it I didn't think was going to happen at all but now maybe this your man yeah maybe this is for a purpose it's not going to just go mess of thing and there's a lot of people don't want him to go the Republicans don't want to lose power and they're very smart in that even ones that are you know that we're never trumper's at one point in time they've accepted him eating like human character if you look at them in terms of like just his go back to that photo that we're just looking at let me see that big time he's a fascinating character man and he's also a very strong guy in a lot of ways like mentally strong in terms of what he's been able to accomplish all the business deals always believed himself there's something about that that gets other people innately sort of like to get a little ass kissing around them they just they want him to like them cuz if he doesn't like you it's devastating Trump goes after Young Twitter gets mad at you devastating so they all want them to like I'm so looking Amal reaching for him but that's like a that's a painting one day that they'll have on the caves the cave paint that after World War 3 after we get Newton to the f****** Stone Age cave paint how a guy figured out how to be just mean enough but just nice enough and have all these people Lycoming literally be able to kill someone with a press of a button and then everybody wants a touch unlikely that they're reaching for him they're reaching the back a robot that flies and just shoots missiles in the missiles are called Hellfire missiles did you hear that new I think Russia has it at Super sako's 20 smok 27 from space and it just like roller coasters but here's the other thing when you're 70 for whatever he is do you realize you're seventy-four or you just alive I think you're just alive especially if you're on diet pills then I think you're really just a lie you're out there you're just f****** grinding you just like for grinding because that's how you do it you just go out there and you kick out he's not thinking about riding off into the sunset he's not thinking about any of that s*** but we think that way when we see someone to 74 but by the time he's going to want out he's alive is he alive yeah he's going to just going to keep going especially if you're stimulated if you're artificially stimulated you know I mean I'm talking right now I'm drinking coffee yeah he's going to just going to keep going especially are stimulated if you're artificially stimulated you know I mean I'm talking right now I'm drinking coffee that's why I'm so excited talking yet I hope he does</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> last night during the Golden Gloves going on there is some jokes going on by Ricky Gervais so we probably talk while later but 60 Minutes was probably going on a different channel the same time and they had a report with some new evidence that nobody has seen yet they have some autopsy photos and photos from inside a cell so I watched the 15 minutes that they put together which is mostly just about like the incident in the in the salad and surrounding it I'm just going to say the pictures up because you can't watch their thing that's 100% the fact that they thought they can get away with that that's so crazy like that is such a crazy thing to try to get away with this gigantic International case he would have happened the cameras and broke man sucks shoelaces give me whatever the f*** that guy strangled me with these photos are all fake right I mean on the top of the great where the window is where you could see maybe there was something up there but the thing to remind remember here is that he was about six foot tall hundred 85 lb like on this ladder here there is also some other things I'll get into in just a second that would be easier to use then tying all the s*** together but they showed there's the other thing here was this this is about four feet off the ground and they do show up a new Switch they're saying was what he used but as the doctors would have said that the new said the show picture which is what you can see the top right corner here since play music from Michael bad and that's that guy from the HBO autopsy show for some reason I can't cuz I'll find a second but the picture that shows actual neck doesn't seem like this news cause that wound and it's a little bit lower than I probably should have been Jesus what is the fraction that they said was inconsistent with hanging it's more consistent with a murderer homicide and he said this is baden's words is that usually he's seen it and maybe like one bone break and sometimes too but there are three fractures he says like he's almost never seen that in any of those cases he's ever looked over and you would think it would be if you're going to hang yourself from such a short distance it would be even harder to get a fracture like that right cuz you not like jumping out like old western movie by Clint Eastwood movie when they would hang them Hang Em High so the one thing that they also had an ear as he left a note Jesus the note said like there's like four things it's at first that the sum of the name blurred out but it said this person left him in a shower locked for an hour but then said someone else gave him like burnt food and then bugs are crawling over his hands and his Road no fun but there's a ballpoint pen like the one I have in my hand sitting right next to him like if you knew he was on suicide watch you wouldn't give him a ballpoint pen that he could kill himself with you should be a God damn that he could have just used that to kill himself new witness somehow this is actually a different video showing a couple different things than what I saw I swear I didn't see this arm thing I didn't see the pictures someone I don't know the name sending burnt food giant bugs crawled on my hands and then no fun and then they're sending any end up with in this ballpoint pen is next to it that he could have stabbed himself the neck or whatever you know play if you don't know and I'm guilty of that hundred percent I might that guy didn't kill himself I am talking s*** though I'm not talking in terms of like people have to understand this is really important and hopefully and it's all these points are consistent strangulation that takes forever to get the pictures and then there's the video cameras didn't work and is the second time he tried to kill himself and he's a high-profile witness in a really really really important case involving pedophiles at the highest levels of government yeah I wouldn't I would think that that's the kind of guy you whack your also according to the procedure you're not support when there's a suicide there you're not supposed to remove the body and take it to the emergency room is supposed to treat it as though it was a murderer like a crime scene high-profile like even is this is most likely how they did it forever right like people that whack people that they were probably like you know I was doing, before the internet there probably before the internet right do you want to see I found the graphic images blood rushing to his head bro that guy got strangled that looks like a strangled guy that's what I thought they supposedly said it looks very kind of picture on used and it is orange maybe the red doesn't show up. Clean on orange can we look at it again cuz you're probably like I want to say for sure that killed him he's talking to his former soulmates lawyer f****** huge he's a gorilla a straight-up gorilla big Italian gorilla and they put him in jail with that guy, he probably has nothing on it and he's showing the actual lacerations the neck that show clear blood and sits too low in the NET10 what's better population right here if he was if you did what you thought life would have been like leaning forward on the ground at a private have been a little higher under the jaw not down at the base of the neck kind of it from behind oh, man look at his neck hold on though is any of that break actually breaking the skin the thing is it looks like a wire instead of wire me a wire that's why I looked Way Too Thin to be that but that looks like a man too looks like that's more like blood rising to the skin and then an actual cut what I'm thinking to it look before though like it was a cut so maybe there wasn't really that much blood that actually came through the skin and maybe are all that that cloth just maybe it's really thin and it gets down like a wire like if you choke somebody with like a bandana you know like if you had like one of bandanas at hippies put on their dogs and you choke someone to death one of those things I got to think it's going to make a very small Mark only going to make a thick Mark if you like get someone into liking Ezekiel choke has one of those things and f****** like where it was choking you like the actual would that make a mark like that what it looks like if you do do that test in like another piece of s*** make a mark like that I'm sure someone now is going to go to the myth busting like how do what it looks like if you do do that test in like to murder someone to find out the truth just get another piece of s*** but I will find out later today I'm sure the whole thing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Richard stuff from Archie or whatever it's called something that started all that propaganda against internet research agency 5G is bad for you so RT isn't she started all this s*** because I guess it's time to phone won't hurt you but Russia wants you to think otherwise okay a network known for salt sewing disinformation has a new alarm the coming 5G apocalypse who's this New York Times they're saying it's probably true then you see what they did to Jank Jank you girl from The Young Turks he was interviewing David Duke and you and they took it out of context in quotes and they wrote that he said to David Duke of course you're not a racist they try to pretend somebody just got to work for their own good cross the line they cross the line they want to stop him stop him until they got over woke they lied that's crazy that's a crazy lie though let's get into the New York Times I wonder what the fault Fallout from that was cuz that's for them that's got to be very embarrassing someone actually printed that they were forced to make retraction but the problem with that is when people hear about stuff like that it you know it's a lot of people obviously working to New York Times a lot of people so it doesn't represent everybody there but when someone gets away with something sneaky like that it really f**** overheard because in all the other people that are making stories people going to go yeah you're the f****** people to shut the drink yogurt said you know David Duke was in a racist when it's clearly always had your f****** magazine strike news it's all bulshit you had a shet newspaper congratulations in a fuel that and the New York Times just have none of that right least have none of that correction do they do is what I would like to know how many people read the correction vs. rather original story that's what gets real weird like if you make something up about someone then put it down or make something interpreted incorrectly on purpose intentionally and then you put it out there how much responsibility does the newspaper have and how much responsibilities that writer have for doing that they probably don't like them they don't want him to do it if you like this guy Matt you know what he meant f****** printed I don't know I don't know what the process was but yeah can't do that if you want us to take it seriously but there's still one of that number one I still do everybody saw it you know the Arrogant so you have to have to pretend that you saw something that wasn't there or either that or you're paying attention so loosely before you write the story that you don't even give a f*** out if I went and got a report in the fight you got a serious job okay sick of your cop you know you got a serious job you're a reporter reporting the actual news go to Serious job cuz you can you can change the way people look at things and it might be a lie and that's that's got into a lot of problems in the past people who think they know better though they know better than what everybody else wants that's it that's where it's real probably think you're doing good by withholding information I think you doing good by censoring people they get your news mostly from like Twitter or something I don't anymore I feel great I forget what it was about it was a story about something and I was like I didn't know that I read into a little bit was in the Wall Street Journal about nearest Bob's a way to look at things but I don't know if you can do that much I don't know what the responsibility is like ultimately to completely pay attention to everything all the time I don't know what responsibilities you have people get mad at you if you don't believe take pay attention to everything except importance all the time and they got a point they have a point but you also have a point for like self-management and for mental management to probably pay attention to less s*** I feel like I feel healthier and happier probably pay attention to that s*** I feel like I'm feel healthier and happier when I pay attention unless yet so when does Iran thinks that me f***** up cuz if something makes me think about it that means it's in the Forefront of the news now it's like big it's a big deal</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> hey what do we know about the Bounty as all that wood that were looking at before we were looking at something you were trying to figure out what we're trying to figure out was actually true $80 Bounty is that what it was an 80 million dollar bounty on Trump George Lopez jokes will do it for half so funny I guess you're not allowed to say that who brings us Trump said George Lopez says we'll do it for half that's silly Comics has folks that's funny any other time it's you know what man when anybody could be the President right in this is sort of manner is it really the same thing to threaten the president like is it is it the same thing as threatening Lincoln is it is it the same thing to threaten Trump in a joke to threaten a guy just think about it former game show host who's Notre Dame noted baller right character in many many rap songs cuz it was bawling and you like to talk s*** on Twitter you can't make a joke you can make that joke that will do it for half you can make that joke everybody definitely better than it but I can't pretend we're going to kill you even talking about I think you can get in trouble what happened to Kathy Griffin when she showed that rubber head show that Robert Trump had nothing right I did f*** her career up nobody talked to Kathy Griffin's really going to murder Trump right right that might have been important thing it's all so crazy let me ask you both are you guys worried about around. You worried about what was happening are you worried about these military people making joint exercise and that happened what was interesting was going to bring up is that police made some tweets that they're going to like we're watching La is worried there like what are you talking about going to try to kill Trump I don't think they're going to necessarily like broke they kill Trump it's going to be chaos yeah I don't think I don't think they're going to be able to do that I think if anything this is the worst part is already happened maybe I don't think so like you know because it seems like this is the first example of someone being impulsive so I'm making this kind of a decision that maybe strategy experts and real military experts would have had some real good man this is speculative but that they would have some real good reasons what is the terrible idea and there are other methods of working things out that doesn't have to go this way doesn't have to be and this is not a movie this is real life and if you think they're just going to force them out then seems like it's too good to be true for people that hate Trump sort of but then is something happens here's the thing if something happens special something horrible happened see the way America is like we are like we have the genes of this wild conqueror just lust for trap human that was willing to get on a f****** boat and make it over here from Europe and from work every other place and then the slaves that were Dragged In Here against their own will and then the other people that were imprisoned here and they were and then the Native Americans who got pushed out of the Mexicans against Jets this is all thousands of years of jeans right the moment something goes crazy that's what I want stuff comes out like how people were when 9/11 happened everybody had an American flag on there everywhere it became an intense place place where you like you you just that whole break glass in case of War like that's real if someone provokes someone does something where we feel like we're really at War we're going to you tonight we're going to United a crazy way in the thing is a lot of people going to love it and feel great that we're United against an evil cause I mean this is what this is why people have employed that strap convince their people to get in the war and Hitler did it right didn't Hitler he burn the reichstag right that was he did that in order to get people more enthusiastic about his plans I'm pretty sure he did that and I think Nero did that with Rome as well but but I'm an idiot in my memory is faulty Sonos way more than anybody arson attack was performed on the IRA Stock Building 4th Native American book is blood and thunder book is not just because of the news not just but also because of these goddamn books would have talks about the Navy interactions with the soldiers in the settlers and that is in our genes man it just happened people were horrible they did a horrible thing and it shatters this notion that's so many of us love to hold on to that without the Europeans or the Native Americans live peacefully they didn't live peacefully with each other no one ever has the Native Americans slaughtered each other they took each other slave they killed each other they tortured each other the Comanches were for it I mean it's terrific terrific with the soldiers did too horrific with the human beings of that error when forced into that conflict were willing to do and what they were willing to become that is not that long ago man that's why I'm scared I'm scared because I feel like we have come so far it's so safe it's so safe that people don't even like saying that it's safe we like we like to be in denial about it and focus on so much of the inequality and Equity an adequacy all the problems in the violence in the listen to that and they're right about all those things but goddamn is a soft time to live and it should hit the fan you're all going to know that when you're really worried about your life every day when your loved ones really could get shot and killed by someone who's a mile away with a scope because that's what's been going on if that's what it comes down to you're going to understand how soft we had it you going to really know how soft we had it and this is that cycle that everybody says right Hard Times make strong men strong men make easy times easy times make weak men mess is a common it's just how human beings are we needed motivation to kick ass we need we need some reason to rise to the top we need some reason to go out there and Conquer and that were the best reasons if we get attacked we get attack really go crazy going to be horrible I'm really scared like legitimately worried that people some people are losing their grip on what violence actually means and what war actually means cuz it's not happening over here because it doesn't happen over here the only ones I can tell us the one that went over there the ones went over there and come back they do not paint pretty stories they paint stories of ugly people and dangerous people and I like you got to be Village in cuz you got to be diligent and you got to be vigilant because this world is not what you think it is there's a lot of parts of this world that are f****** chaos written and fill with crime and fill with murder and fill with Dad and fill with Despair and there's money there terrorist and there's these religious fundamentalists who want to throw gay people off roofs and that s***'s real that's happening in 2020 right now somewhere in the world there probably planning on throwing a gay guy off a roof because some some person wrote that down two thousand years ago or whenever it was 20 right now somewhere in the world they're probably planning on throwing a gay guy off a roof because some some person wrote that down two thousand years ago or whenever it was</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> on the carnivore diet table that help your keto right or better way to do it I know it's just all meet just everything's meet I'm not eating and any any grains and I'm not eating any carbs nothing else let me know how I can all of the data Bloody Mary is so fucken up and I'll just not the most strict occasionally I'll deviate allow myself to glasses of wine and most of the rest of shittim just drink the water or skill close to see me kill Cliff carnivores like he died but you're allowed to have fruit or something eating meat like mostly meat and because I eat a lot of wild game after the substitute it have to supplement with fat I'm adding other fats to it while game it does not have much fat and you can when I read about the people that did this in there was a guy that was with the Inuit he was an Explorer in the Arctic and he was talk we live like that for 6 months and it was one of them saw the video somewhere online but is old black and white footage that the key was getting a lot of fat but they were just drinking water and eating meat and they were fine as long as they got a lot of fat they would do it beat like whale blubber and polar bear blubber and they would eat all this blubber to sort of supplement their there they're fat intake be seems very healthy eating like that I'm just doing his experiment they found a guy probably would imagine this is probably about the Inuit diet his thought process and I really respect his mind and when he start talking about all the different medical benefits to be had from trying that he had autoimmune diseases that went away and Mike and I know a bunch of people person to try to adjust a gentleman Exodia yep that's him to the dogs I thought that was really weird because that's definitely been proven to be the that's the guy right there give me some volume on this dude could you that I don't know if this is in The Domain Austin capsule e what he said he just basically said that as long as they had the ones they had plenty of fat I'm just seeing what it feels like it's weird I'll tell you one thing I do not trust my butthole at all my feel far coming on like others could be a disaster rocketing diarrhea from meat that's from all meat yeah this is what dr. Shawn Baker who's like one of the head carnivore proponents is like his whole life revolves around eating steak and deadlifting kind of hilarious and getting people to eat meat and try the carnivore diet and some of them that has a pretty radical health benefits and I'm so curious about that because I know that sometimes people convince themselves that something is better for them and it's something's working better than they feel better and then there's a sort of a placebo effect that can happen when you join a community of people that's also saying the same thing like we're all getting better all feeling better so I was real hesitant when I first went into it I was like okay I need to know if there's there's something to this or this is a nonsense way to eat cuz most of my thought process with this kind of nonsense we each need some Fiber is clearly benefits eating some vegetables it was interesting is the the level of energy your energy level it's like right here stays it doesn't go anywhere it doesn't go anywhere I mean it the other day I'm kind of tired and then I go to sleep that's weird man because how much of your energy levels during the day is based on your body regulating sugar and Insulin how much of it how much is your energy level is based on that it might be a lot this because this is unquestionable difference unquestionable difference is that my energy level basically has a flat line there's no roller coaster anymore and I had less of a roller coaster because I'm pretty healthy and I'm pretty strict with what I eat but not like this this is like this so for the last nine days or so it's been I've had like an olive I had does your body go into ketosis at all but must I mean I mean a lot of that I'm eating bacon with all these Wild game dishes everything I eat bacon with cuz I need fat and I'm cooking everything in beef Tallow and then I'm getting like fatty meat to butter and milk milk the fat everything look mad it's weird I see why people be opposed to it morally and ethically cuz you don't require people to consume a lot more animals cuz everybody's eating meat all the time that consumption the Needwood go up and it'll be even more Slaughter I got it seems like you're going to get really bored quick quick but and I don't necessarily think this I'm just saying if I think this is the best way for me to eat I'm not saying that I'm trying it and I'm basically trying it based on Mark Bell and Chris Bell and even more Jordan stuff talked in-depth with Jordan about it Jordan Peterson is a brilliant guy and when he was describing his experiences with his dinosaur super intelligent well-read art people are Jordan Peterson's done this. I bet it's all really really small amount because socially is unappealing to even say you're going to do it start about taboo you only me oh you can eat all the meat you not if you need any vessels what do you want baby that's what vegetables are good for you right that's what everybody immediately thinks but don't know if it's true though I don't know if that's true one of things is Shawn Baker said to said they were they're doing tests at Harvard with with people who are on this guy for 6 more I don't know I'm interested so did some blood work today and I'll make that blood work public school yeah mean especially if there's anything wacky with it but then imma do it again at the end of the month and I'll compare wow we'll work it out how many ounces of meat a day do you know what you're up to like thing is I have a lot of elk that's good but I'm running through it you know I'm eating some big ass chunks of meat is there something that you go to a lot like chicken wings or something like that just because it's easy no eggs you need eggs are eggs easy something that you go to a lot like chicken wings or something like that just because it's easy no eggs eggs are eggs easy things are great you know I wish that coyotes weren't real news Fox</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the really f*****-up part about it is it's almost like what we're talking about football that football be safer if there was no helmets it doesn't make sense to be safer if they were a state-issued if you apply for funding for support you're going to school like I'm alone or the state paying for you to go to school you go Fellowship you should be able to apply for a state-issued prostitute if you are a little socially awkward we haven't had sex because men get weird if they haven't been made privy to the way a woman is or they haven't had SEC and going to college let's get you a prostitute let's get you having sex twice a week so you're not afraid of women let's get you a little less weird let's find a prostitute well I think you could didn't have the social stigma behind it there's a lot of people that would choose it over working at Wendy's woman saying I want to do this with my body that's what's upsetting that is sort of that but it's also well in this country it's also connected to sex slavery we think of it as like if someone is doing that that maybe maybe they are a sex slave like maybe there's someone who's I think that's left on people's radar to do with the puritanical idea of New England Patriots massage parlor in the game of Happy Ending and then actually know that they arrested him and told him that there's a video of it and you know they're trying to get him to plead guilty and all these different should have gone on to a guy who's like insanely insanely wealthy who just going there to get your top one of them that they said was that it was that he was participating somehow and sex trafficking until they were accusing him of that they were that was a big part of what the police were saying what turned out that none of the girls that were there were sex traffickers there just prostitutes and the woman that did it to him she was like four years old using that term to the recusing him of this thing and using that term like to DeBrands yes consequences that you would want someone to face whether they just wanted to get your thoughts for they participate in sex slave with you so because there's a demand for it there is a supply so that is by a large part of the issue and I say this not knowing a ton about sex lately but I do know that if you take away the stigma and you can normalize things very quickly weed is a great example right you could do that and even we've done this with women and bodies in the way that we look at people who are overweight and we look at people with different things aguiar a place where it's less of a thing I think it was prostitution and it's fine and look at it as like this is her choice and if there if there wasn't an extension demand for it wouldn't be a thing at this point in time we have made tremendous progress by venting Technologies and also Eventing institutions and on the other hand are human ability to to collaborate effectively in large numbers which includes the corporation which is very effective way for people to work together now all that program has always has also had its negative side effects which are most bananas it'll be longer and we take too much out of its then nature can replenish with the fission on the other hand we have two plastic going into the environment Etc so many questions about how do we solve that and one hand is to say okay maybe we should consume less races are bad allergies bad we should all get rid of all those things and modern environmental movement which is very kind of this Romantic Movement has this image of back in the day everything was great to live in harmony with nature so let's get rid of all this modernity and try and return to that pure original fit what I however believe is that possible that I don't think it's realistic thing Thompson Cigars and people want to move forward and at the same time I don't think it's pretty the most effective way to to solve these problems because it would be like fighting a leopard tank with the bow and arrow truly believe that we should embrace those those forces that make us human them and has created an amazing wealth to also try and solve these these negative side effects as well and that's why I believe now the over cuz jumped over cuz I'm still station not going to end my people all becoming vegan but rather through fake Meats I think that the transport emissions are not going to be solved by people flying anymore or not going anywhere anymore realistically people are going to fly more so you better event technologies that allow people to do that without harming the environment and now the same thing I think it would be the Case 444 for plastic and really other energy uses as well Japanese face with me on the corner of outside my wrestling coach he helped me out a lot and I cannot go and I tell him all the time like this dude is 125 lb in 1915 tall guy what event was at but was doing Sunday is a big thing and it was at a party and then just one Asian dude it's just I getting all crazy in people's faces I can take crazy drunk in his face and I told my friend punches I tell him at some guy how to crack him but I'm scared I'm not going to put them to sleep I know if you punch him he's going to go knock out but you go ahead he's a smaller than a Google I even one time and we was at home like he walking and his drunk guy and there's like three of those four or five of us and he's the smallest guy in the back and we're all walking in like almost in line and it's big. He like he slips everybody little guy last key bump some hard and I looked at him like he goes to little guy I told him I was hanging with his new guy this guy just hanging out with us I told him that is the wrong guy to bump into cuz out of everyone here he probably one punch Knock You Out the Bronx Zoo I'm in like the 18 hundreds of the early 1900 a pygmy what year was it that long have not been civilized how we view the world today with inclusivity and objectivity and care and you know kindness towards others like his compassion and altruism on a global scale 45 years after slavery what the f*** guys so bronx.zoo yet speaking in are like weird Cryptid realm remind me of something so get this chupacabra has been attributed to the possibility that there are thylacine in North America and shears what supports that there is documented proof that however many years ago I don't remember the dates there were two breeding pair of thylacine Bound for the Bronx Zoo and the boat crashed into the shore and most of the animals Escape including the two breeding pair of thylacine fast forward 10 15 years you start having these Chupacabra sightings pop up in the Northeast and these animals were adapted to living in Tasmania which is a pretty similar climate to the North American Northeast and so there's people that have kind of drawn these parallels and said oh the chupacabra that we reported running around you know the United States is actually a tiny Remnant population of the thylacine that were brought here for the Bronx Zoo this what you buying this import export laws about Wildlife you know you could just bring in whatever you like if you had money you know what's to say that everybody was in a race to collect stuff for zoos and museums like what's to say somebody didn't bring some in a sort of new Nietzsche Marx who said God is dead but Mark's basic human beings are the masters of their own fate and all of these guys who basically took God out of the equation and all of them were basically saying that animals and God isn't it God is no longer here where animals and if you don't quit Society control our animalistic impulses we're going to f****** Slaughter and rape each other and World War 1 proved all the skies right physically but it was a time when they're worth that everything's up in the air and comes along and says time and space not so fast it's actually relative start a stopwatch and that's what noon said but actually a good luck trying to work your way through that the one where when you go if you go fast enough into space and then come back everybody here will be old and you'll be the same age what he was walking and where was he and he gets off the the train and he's walking away from the train station he turns and looks at the clock and the clock says let's say 6 internal wait hold on I was walking away from the clock so when I saw the clock it said 6 but that's how long it took for light to get to my eye by the time that I hit my I was actually later cuz the light has to hit my eye for me Jim sent back to fraction was he still but I wonder like when you say time stands still but it's got it list if you're alive it's God exists somehow biologically your body's not going to stop heart beating and breathing right so like how many heartbeats do you have in you and that's part of what life is life is like you get a limited number of heartbeats if you wanted to run break it down right how many of them are you going to use where you going through Lightspeed those don't count your going to beat your heart going to beat right so how long is it going to take in real-time down on Earth while you're up there cuz I think it's going to be like where you're moving so fast that it feels like 10 I'm going to beat your heart's going to beat right right so how long does it actually take in real-time down Earth while you're up there cuz I think it's going to be like will you moving so fast that it feels like 10 minutes cuz it is 10 minutes to you and then you come back you've only age 10 minutes but it might be 10 years down here</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the war in Europe all the countries involved what was the what was the size of the landscape were looking at in TuneIn like relationship the United States when you look at France Germany and England like what is that the European part of World War 1 &amp; 2 how much what I was thinking is like it's almost like having a war inside America right really close I think I think of you if you if you take France Spain Italy you know Germany Poland all those areas if it in Rhode Island hungry Austria all those Bulgaria Romania World War 1 map 40 maps that explain World War 1 that that whole area became a theater for dude, I'm on my third wild west book in the last couple weeks really yeah yeah about the history of the bar Westmont play this one of my tits up blood and thunder yeah blood and thunder an epic tale of the American West it's about Kit Carson and then the mountain man yeah tribes in the chaos and the way they would kill people oh my God it's so crazy I don't think it was a Kit Carson one it was the the one on General Custer General Custer was the last one which was Son Of The Morning Star that was the last one I was reading bro Native American guy f*** this other guy's wife so he he tries to get them to can't get them eventually find someone day kills him eat his heart Cooks is heart comes back and tells her better than marriage the lady what you got to eat a man's heart cuz you impose his will on imagine you're married married your woman you're married to a guy this other dude wants to f*** you he killed your husband and eat his heart and then you said getting his pee pee big boy that's that's pretty f****** gangster that's pretty funny because the guy loved you I'm going to eat his love for you because he cut two fingers off of his hand because he couldn't get to her and he loved her so much and was angry that he couldn't kill anyone win her over will he must have won her over cut two fingers off his hand before he got there and then found a guy Africa two fingers officer killed the guy everybody ate most of the heart that's a stalker I need to start a just remember like when we used to have those terrorism colors like today yellow no worries member of the flag yeah that's it from 1917 paper in London made this this is explaining the battle area only in Colorado was trench warfare 2 if you look at World War 1 it was a time when first bought the world hadn't been Europe end in the war for a hundred years so when people went into War and World War 1 they were I mean they went in every young man volunteered and even women volunteered to be nurses and songs never going to be gone for 2 weeks and it was going to be really excited and it was romantic and and no one including the soldiers really understood the technology like machine guns and and that kind of technology and mustard gas and they didn't know they were still fighting the way they had been fighting for Millennia which was on Horseback feathers in their helmets and charging with great bravery and so it would have they would charge and the other side would open up with machine guns and an artillery and then ultimately poison gas and so the numbers are too staggering to even imagine but like for 800 yards to try to capture that much land do whatever they would lose they lost something like three hundred thousand men in a day it was beyond like the number of men that were lost her foot I remember I had to ask three times cuz I couldn't believe it and because they were just so you're you're arrogant commanders would blow a whistle sometimes it would kick a soccer ball and you would follow the soccer ball over the ditch and run as they were shooting it and you'd and if you didn't you'd be tried for cowardice so not to be shot by your commanding officer in the back your head cuz remember conscripted they were brought in against their will from you know who this was the time of imperialism when the country that was bigger and stronger the austro-hungarian Empire Austria so would come in and say you belong to us now there was a secret alliances that would happen and so that battle was so insane and they it was just it was a true meat grinder it was a true meat grinder and then you have no man's land right so you have no man's land and that was the area where they would they would come in that you know they had to cross menu hear them dying and groaning but nobody can get to them it was the f****** it was the worst man it was a worst and in those trenches the body parts and everything and then in the people have to go to bathroom there and then the rain would come you were living in a gutter it would be on what people can imagine it would be on it was the most horrific thing in the only thing that was worse was something called World War II which is a continuation of that first European Civil War and and I don't know man it's it's beyond what we can wish sell for less than a hundred years time like that yes sir that's the one person's lifetime in a world where is where the idea of where ideas can be so dangerous this idea that human beings are blank slate and they'll that you can make them anything you want you can re-educate them in a camp and they'll be what you want this is the history of of your opinion and those ideas lost ground that's why the individual it's so f****** important for the individual take precedence over the state this is also why it's so important for people to be able to express themselves that's what I mean for people to but Fidelity to the state and a fascist

		<div class="paragraph"> wonder how long is going to take before the human race eradicates that cuz I think if you look at like pinker's work and some other people that studied violence and abuse and all of the various things that we love least about civilization those markers are going down sort of across the door with a violent crime or rape his markers are slowly going down like how long does it take for there's none of that anyway part of it can't just drop bodies all the time because it's you don't know it was going to f****** ring the cops just go can we take a look at your ring footage Ryan and you know you got to make a getaway somewhere you're always on camera and they can do this just posted something that I retweeted it and citizens are sort of revolting against this constant surveillance State that's over can China use sang over the next 10 years is what's going to be America absent sweeping reform this is the whole world in 10 years remember both parties in the US defend Mass surveillance programs China's Advantage here is not technological but that there is no strong civil opposition to slow The Descent into Nightmare so China is not I'm sorry I read it wrong is not able to slow it there just slowly descend against the surveillance tape liters is very important we were lied to enough kind of time for 18 years by senior us officially the authorities and scan your phone track your face and find when you find out when you leave your home on the world's biggest spine networks is aimed at regular people and no one can stop it and this is in China civil liberties because in the name of protecting the Fatherland from from essentially terrorism because of communist lit-lit the reichstag on fire interesting is how long is it going to take before some version of this makes it over here cuz it seems inevitable it's coming but you have to beat you have to fight it tooth and f****** nail Americans should always be distrustful of their authority figures I don't give a fuk how much Trump or anybody else you should hold you even accountable and you should not you should always have a healthy distrust will W2 for 18 years about how the war was going on Afghanistan we spent over a trillion dollars on that f****** War over the past how long has it been since 2003 good and and we were trying to turn into a Modern Nation you have senior us officials whether intelligence military everybody else they knew and somehow that just never made it on every General kept saying we're at a turning point in the war we're going to defeat the Taliban know you weren't and you know the difference and you knew that at the time and I understand that there's a lot of pressure and everything else but we spent all that money for f****** what and a lot of Americans got injured and f****** killed for it and we were lied to I know what this is but that's what that's how they would if they could get something that implemented in Afghanistan and put a giant kibosh sure on the amount of terrorist activities that right good luck I know I would say good luck honey I mean there's nothing in his they can really tell you where this goes politicians use the same exact language which is we have to protect the public from these insurgents this danger here is what this is doing it's making it almost impossible to be a traditional to have a traditional government right cuz if this stuff starts making it to there with then we can find out they're doing all the time so what if we would if it turns out well liberal let you masturbate on Sunday we want 24/7 access to anyone who is any sort of Representative anyone who's a congressman and it was a Senator and it was the president who want 24/7 access to everything you say and do we want to know want to know who you are no more backs my problem with the best people with that is a politician so I don't know if that's the answer might might I saying is the answer to just saying imagine if everyone has access to everyone's life and you need warrants and make it f****** difficult but the reason why a country like the United States goes to war with a country like Afghanistan or banister prices because you have leaders and groups once there's no leaders here and wants his no groups and everybody can see everything and everybody's doing then you have no no more need for governments or all the resources get distributed evenly all natural resources auction, natural resources on Earth are owned by the human beings that inhabit the Earth not human beings that live on that one particular spot and all those dudes are making fracking money that's our money b**** is our Earth healing the f****** essence of the earth and selling it back to the people how dare you Karl Marx right here man who sings you can sell you sell cars you can sell this you can tell that Mick building I'm not stopping capitalism but I'm saying is all natural resources all of them belong to the conquerors of the earth which is us the human beings out of it so no no no trillionaire Oil Barons no dependence on fossil fuels because you're great but if no one in particular is profiting entirely are fossil fuels because the money has to be distributed evenly to everyone the same with solder she wasn't eating anything that's a resource any natural resource but you need me I don't need the technology to to harness that stuff that you just said that what you can't sell is oil well anymore not when I'm president president you run you run okay and then what's our platform what's the tune in to see what's our slogan how do we grow more no more no more dinner theater everybody that works in Tennessee or now makes tuna you working a tune-up plant where you make tuna Swahili or so we have more more no great President we f***** up the oceans is always heavy metals and poison in there we need a filter for the ocean select a filter that you have at your house have two filters in tap water right yeah you really want us

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I've had my sunglasses on top of my hat and look for him for 10 minutes before stock quote was an eye on the planet well you try to keep him from violent games I do but they said it's like telling me not to blow in the wind it's interesting Dakota Meyer who's decorated veteran and you know how can you tell me story about a fist fight with a guy you know in war with with the Enemy and picked up a rock beat his brains in this guy is telling you that video games can desensitize you I'm going to listen yeah I am I'm going to listen to him I am too he's you know he healthy you're not going to make you more likely to go shoot people that's a fact yeah that's the thing it's like are you saying that you playing Red Dead Redemption is going to make you want to go out and f****** shoe people know it's not going to affect on minors I think they're couple things going on addicted one more game crazy they stomp the ground all day when you plan on that level do they retard your social skills and your you know I mean there's a lot of considerations I don't know I'm also in favor of you doing anything you want if there's some people that would make the same argument about someone is addicted to reading sure there's a lot of people that are in their heads reading novel human creation this design Captivate your attention whether it's a novel or film or anyting things are designed that's what are is and what awaits me an art gallery and you stare at someone's work it's like some human creation that captivates your attention and get you logged in and we see a really beautiful piece like we were in Italy and I we're in Florence we went to this Ancient Ancient church and had this is beautiful works of art on the wall painted this a thousand years ago and What would life was like and you looking to intricacies these dresses like that's an engaging human creation that captivates your attention we just we have Merit in that kind of engaging captivated piece of art we will put married in that we don't put Mara and video games for some reason it's too captivated someone who'll I got to trust fund you never have to work again you got a f****** 10 million dollars in the bank and you can just chill forever and you want to play video games all day my all right like if you want me and I don't know what to tell you you don't have to work something like that painting of when Spain was bombed by the luftwaffe before World War II does incredible imagery in what we can do with an iPad will it's all the same thing in some way it's a human creation but the thing about these digital human Creations as they have his alien-like coldfield them like there's something about digital things even if they're spectacular like there's no emotion in this thing this thing is a creation to one and a zero it sits in his computer I'm going to light a candle I'm going to sit there and I'm going to read novels all day I have $10 in the bank that I got for my trust phone I just like reading no one would say you're a loser who is Brian to he's amazing you know he got his trust fund and then said I want to educate myself I just want to read I just read all the great works and sit home all day and just reads it's amazing but that is somehow more intriguing because what you're doing is developing and expanding your understanding who is worth speaking to you might have some secrets and some understanding that I can use so we need to talk to somebody who's really gone down that rabbit-hole like Joseph Campbell piano who read all the phosphorus and everybody he's organized in a way that might shed some light on the things that are confusing to you that are you know that are depressing or that are scaring you or whatever you do need like that leaders of thought that can put things into perspective you know that come kind of tell you why there's a difference between say Picasso in this other people that know how to play the f*** out of a video game the thing as those people don't get any credit when you see the kids today that are winning these video game tournaments me while the dad works at f****** IHOP making real money on his stupid game you told him to never play that feeling like Arenas are we crazy this is where the world Goes the World goes to the most engaging creation and human beings have that locks in other people's attention and the most engaging Creations for young people are these goddamn video game they're just Group after it's their giant Group corporate efforts whether it's you know Grand Theft Auto or the new Doom when's the new Doom coming out I do think there's a difference I do think that when you're really good at a video game there's there is an addictive quality too and yes you're really good at doing something right but at the end of the day it's a game and that game is somewhat masturbatory that game I don't know that when you really could go to Fort not tonight or Doom I don't know if that game in any way expands your understanding your ability to contribute to the larger conversation okay but I'm just saying blue balls and pink balls and black balls and I don't know I don't understand the game I've watched a bunch but there's these people that play it and it's less popular now why the guys want a big-time guys got busted he got busted doing a fixed game like someone someone paid him off to lose and he agreed to do it for a certain amount of money but the thing is that a game like that as well respected because someone has to execute its not to me getting off the shot yes it's a skilled and also people love to watch it who play snooker yeah lean on me but you don't know where difference write a video game you have to execute as well but it doesn't seem like you're doing it because you're not physically do just moving your hands around and moving a keyboard and it doesn't seem like it's as skillful or but it is 4 people just like a great pool player right front so when you watch pool you're doing it for steaks doing it for money but you're also watching these people who have mastered this insane geometry what we respect some versions of that like elf respect that's why we don't respect bowling golf players of all time that golfer is going to make millions and millions of dollars a year but that guy is a baller he's a golfer and he's at the top of the food chain it comes to any of those skills require you to master yourself in the video games it seems like it's happening in a digital realm and because of that it's not taken too seriously either you found they made more money I can you find out someone's a successful video game player there's a certain party like why you waste your time with that even if you go huh good for him just seems weird yes right there's like a weird you don't it's still not good even though they were older it's subversive yes that for guys that are Arnie's it's subversive it's we don't trust it we don't like it we don't understand it and it scares us a little bit because it's also reminds us of our own mortality also brainwashed seen the video games till game player is all that stuff so so for older people I'm I'm feel I feel left out I don't understand it and I and I feel like they're being bad and they should listen to me where is chess is Noble does noble gases someone playing chess that's Noble you find out someone is really good at chess look impressive</div>

That's just one kind of abuse is also abused by your actual biological parents there's a very Spidey other biological relatives who have there's there's people that have abused by stepfather but it's the same thing it's like what happens when you were really young person to becoming an adult and once if someone is abusing you and f****** you over you over that just ruins the most people's lives most people don't bounce back from that you know and then you get caught up in this spiral of the cycle crime and violence in prison and abuse and you're done you're done</div>

worship God like they both believe in God like they are or like a the Sunni and ashea is that it was it was very human beings get in too much information and then we'll start parsing out stuff that's not that helpful to Otis Mendel long conversation the conversation very long and unfortunately when Chris was talking about the game changers he got several things wrong particularly the big ones were the amount of protein you can get in peanut butter amount of protein is in bread and whether or not that is equal to 3 oz of ground meat and what Wilkes are showing is that it is and he made his point very well and that made Chris his argument not look very good then there was the other problem where is Chris Kresser sort of personally defined he defined as low carb vs. medium carb vs. high carb and wasn't making a distinction that this is not the consensus amongst nutritionists what they consider low carb medium car-part James accused him of that Chris tonight it and then James pulled out all of these different articles that show that he has a different version of what he calls low carb meat a car or I got the problem with all this is he's just making Chris look bad and he's not necessarily proving that a veggie vegan diets better for you but he is rightly pointing out that he was wrongly criticized so I guess his chest is very impressive ability to come prepared here animal products is going to get is an easy way to get B12 and then the problem going to kill you that's the problem with doing a documentary and then that's a problem with someone criticizing the documentary you know it's like the documentary and he's got enough stuff that he can say you were inaccurate with with the criticism so that then we get lost in the argument is meat bad for you is it like that's the main thing it's not but the way they are conflating it with people who were advertising for cigarettes and doctors advertising for cigarettes back in the day and saying the cigarettes are these are the same people are doing this like know the problem is everyone was aware for a long time that cigarettes are not healthy this is not the case with me these studies that will you connect people with all these diseases with me they connect their diet as a whole they could be eating cheeseburgers and bread by soda and sound drinking and smoking but they also eat meat versus people who don't eat meat but what if someone is going to be conscientious and think about even if they're Incorrect and they just assume that the sign says the eating meat is bad for you if you start eating more fish or more chicken or more vegetables you clean up your diet I bet just statistically I'd already blessed drinking I honestly they have left it is cigarette smoking they're probably healthier on the whole because they're making choices that even if it's incorrect they think are good like not eating meat or as much meat nutrition is it when I watched game changers I have to say that it it did seem like the narrative the story of the movie was that being a vegan is better for you for all these reasons all the signs of the reasons than eating any meat that's that's what it was a vegan film screw that for me just as of you were the arguments being made that being a vegan that's what I like from just what I got right the Retros what was meant I got to being a vegan better for you it keeps your dick hard you won't die of cancer and still have less inflammation or Enduro sings claimed they made that was incorrect okay scientifically is a PhD what's really going on with nutritional science because of criticism of the film he was an all-in every right he had every right to defend get any closer at the end there was some confusion that was about whether or not it is healthy or not healthy to eat meat he was citing some studies and Kresser was saying those studies aren't valid because of this and that and that's where we would have been if we had a guy like Layne Norton in here would have helped a lot we can do that would have someone actually explain it I'd like to look at the blue zones who eat meat and they have stayed lot of times they eat some form of dairy and they drink their good communities they don't retire there's a lot more to longevity and Health and Living a good life than being a purist for sure whether or not it's because overpopulation is real do it there the conversation is really ultimately what is sustainable you know and it's not what is sustainable right now for your lifespan it's like what is sustainable for the future and should we engineer for a better tomorrow because we sort of are we're not that people are acting as individuals was not really a whole lot of Engineering in terms of slowing down the rate of childbirth or trying to prevent people from having too many kids trying to prevent overpopulation what up that's what the sink the thing is there's plenty of people that live below the poverty line in terms of like what our perception the poverty line is and what you're seeing in a lot of these more industrialized nations is as people start developing careers in men and women get careers you have less childbirth like you seen that in Japan Japan has apparently an issue with a lack of childbirth not as many as they said that's not sustainable more industrialized nations is that people start developing careers in men and women get careers you have less childbirth like you seen that in Japan Japan has apparently an issue with a lack of childbirth not as many as they should has not sustained of it at</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's why I think for a lot of guys you know walking into an MMA gym is terrifying but it's okay that everything that start with U no one tiny step and I like I like doing anything that makes me feel uncomfortable and and takes me off my pins and because I it opens up new Pathways of understanding somehow are certainly forces me to do what I do now with people who I disagree with philosophically it's okay but what I what I try to do is I just try to listen to them really I try to kind of 0 instead of like immediately throw my hands up did you see what Burton Cummings said the other day Britney Cummings Whitney Whitney Whitney coming now did I say Brittany what was I just saying she got reported to HR on a show she was on cuz as she was leaving some Merry Christmas some intern no yes in turn was offended called Human Resources because she said Merry Christmas and her aunt response something that's very f****** important for people to realize about the West Samantha really unique about the West in Western Civilization is that imperialism racism sexism Aldi's isms that we are guilty of the Westin invent these things but we did you know we were egregious violators in some cases of that you know slavery was a real fans country what's unique about the west and I'm getting this is that who were the first to label it and condemn it and the West has always been a country that seems always to be in the process of repenting for its past that is not, that is unique to an end self-criticism is part of it as a society we are so people like that silly girl who that's been going on actually in one way or another for a long time girl or boy I know it's a little bit more if it's way more but but that's actually to the character of this country we have always had people who kind of went you know that's wrong I don't want to do that this is this isn't fair all that kind of stuff and it was a f****** it would always cause all kinds of problems but that's extreme that's a silly goose whoever's doing a Hollywood thing where these people can't be liberal enough so hard to be Progressive that they're just becoming ridiculous it's so reactionary and everyone's scared that they're going to be out of the woke Loop like maybe they're behind the letting something slide they should have stepped up for cuz now you can get in trouble if you don't come out again someone saying Merry Christmas like hey man you know where were you when that sucking pig said merry Christmas you know What Christmas Means Supremacy and Quantum Supremacy which is quantum shooting its next level Next Step Computing and there was an article about Google achieving Quantum Supremacy and there were like we don't like the term Supremacy cuz reminds people of white supremacy and I think about those people those people they're ready they're they're not they're young experienced and wise they're very smart and they know they are which is one of the reasons why they want to make an argument to put something like that through and think that it makes sense it's because they're so smart but they're not is is you get seasoned by your interactions with human beings you're naive when you're younger and then as you get older you get season at my changes but you also get seasoning you experience so many different human beings that exhibit the sort of stereotypes and these like patterns of behavior and you got to know when people are being Knuckleheads and you got to know when people are being why is an objective and you got to know when people being kind and loving and you got to know when people being assholes so you can see all the different things as you get older you get more data you know in a lot of these kids are like 20 by 20 tuner yelling about the world like that Greta Thornburg check the heat she's 16 Healthcare I didn't you and I'm sitting here if we had to try right what would happen is we might come with more Republican or Democratic or a liberal or conservative sensibility initially I think once you get down the level of detail in your try to solve these problems policy for the most number of people wait gray or and way less if you are somebody that has to solve problems if you are somebody who has to turn a profit if you're somebody will have to figure out what your what Your clientele actually will by and I think sometimes that's why people who own businesses and people have to make the trains run on time have a different philosophical and political point of view then do people who essentially spend a lot of time thinking and writing in an academic institution run because you don't need to get down to level of detail you can stay in that wonderful world of theory and that's an important world it's not the say that you shouldn't have that but a lot of journalists come from that world they come straight from that world a theory that world of that intellectual Pursuit and and they come right into then they see the world and I think that might be why a lot of times people media tend to be a little bit more ideological maybe a little bit more liberal depending cuz you can say Fox News is just as f****** idiot Logic on the other side but I do think your your perspective changes when you have to get down to when you're out there in the real world that are just completely in whatever the subject and you know and they're just lifelong academics and that's what they're going to do both both but what would the real problem is when people come out of these universities and they have these sort of Hardline ideas of how the world needs to change the revolution Quantum Supremacy you know a lot of these people with these ideas are one day going to laugh at those ideas they won't give me to look at back I was so stupid just like you've done just like I have done just like basically everybody does as they get older you start saying oh my God ESR one day going to laugh at those ideas they won't give me to look at that go oh my god when I was 20 I was so stupid just like you've done just like I have done just like basically everybody does as they get older you start saying oh my God When I Was Eighteen with a f****** moron I was oh my god when I was 24 when he was stupid s*** I thought I should do memes that's part of life</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> but I think one of the reasons for that as we have a rate of something like 2,000 species of your being deemed extinct right so we have that many animals being extinct every year there's there's flags being put up is it really extinct have we looked everywhere and so this yeah I do want to say I was the first but I feel like I was in that way the first people to start looking into Extinction as far as an ongoing animals Bronx leading extinct and now it's like like mainstream in the biology world it's like there's a lot of people that are like romantic sort of thing is a lot of cash I'll give you can find and seem to be extinct Barbarossa harrowing journey to find this creature that the world is written off it's very romantic you have you ever heard of the all wrong pendek why does repetitive that's okay the Cryptids a locked in Vietnam in Vietnam and maybe some other parts of Southeast Asia and the most people thought it was nonsense until the homofloriensis until they found out about that Hobbit person that lives in the island of Flores been like okay hold on or lived right side 14000 years ago right so when they found out about that thing like will me and maybe these little suckers are still hanging around out there somewhere something that lives there here's you a mile away which is the world's largest cave that was only discovered in 1995 it's this massive opening 6 miles of underground cave daylight for 2 days you should look at the pictures of this place you'll love it I mean it's just this New York City skyscrapers inside of it it's so big it has its own weather system might mountain range between Vietnam and Laos and I we got to go into it this year because we were looking for this habitat fact this is my show that comes out tonight we were looking for the where's the people can hear it with Bob Weir fresh live tonight at 9 p.m. on Animal Planet we go into song Doon cave set your DVRs kids look at the wedding cake down right there that's called the wedding cake it's it's aspires I mean it's just it's the most fantastic looking thing does a person standing on top of that little tire right there that's so spectacular but what's amazing is about two-thirds of the way through the system you can see where what you're looking at is areas where the cave roof has collapsed and there's isolated pockets of ecosystem right so we were talking about the the pygmy people that could live in the forests of Vietnam this is the kind of my point is this giant six mile long cave with these huge openings wasn't even discovered until I think 95 so what's to say a tribe of small people hiding something like that and move in and out and never seen I mean it's it's fantastic there was a stupid movie about people that lived underground at 8 people member that is 6 did they do The Descent 2 and you like my video potential it's obvious probably not real of an alluring pendek I was totally real Jamie it's a 10 minute video I just died if you do not ever you have seen this before then there in Vietnam black how they used to always check the whatever it was called a check like the National Enquirer for like tips on Aliens what else it could be like yeah yeah could be bulshit but it could be a little monkey discovered they could stay hidden yeah and it was really small and you know it in and also some sort of a hominid that has Intelligence right it's probably got a pretty decent food source in the jungle yet but you would find a dead one with me that's always the argument right why isn't there a Roadkill screenshot. Who knows who's what's to say that isn't a short guy who's been poaching and he's like crap I'm getting busted right but doesn't mean it's not fascinating and this is the kind of stuff that we Wade through in droves to try and figure out you know are these animals are these creatures still out there yeah yeah I know it's running exactly like a person that's the thing about the little kid yeah but that's the thing about the Orion pendek is that they think it was like the homofloriensis I think they think it's really the same thing in the homofloriensis was really a three foot tall human or feet weird though that is a person with a stick and they're and there at that creature looks naked it doesn't look like they're shorts what's that 3ft grass or foot grass that's so weird looking somewhere between 30 and 60 in tall sets and it lives or someone kills it and you find out that it's real I'd rather not knowing and it lives meets for sure but I feel like a b**** I don't want to be right right you know what come on man just tell me and how blurry does the line get in that situation because it's it's humanoid right now it's like Ryan and put him in zoos you know what to breed them and keep the population up like like that gets really dicey</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> call your exploits on social media and the yellow Cayman yes that is a wild looking creature isn't it it's unbelievable was thought to be extinct it's a little confusing it's a species that was last seen in when the last one died in the zoo in the 80s and because of the region that it occupies in Columbia which is always been controlled by farc rebels nobody have been back down there to look for it and myself and there's actually amazing Colombian scientist named Sergio we're both kind of going and prodding and trying to see if we could get in and we both found it within a month of each other it was a beautiful yellow color so wildly diffuse super unique you're just holding that thing by the neck yeah we just had a little wrestling match him and ISO play tire out so they're not like mammals once they spend all their energy that's kind of it but yeah absolutely amazing are they similar to regular crocodiles or alligators in that they don't have to eat for like a year does so Cayman I mean came and don't have the at slowed metabolism as certain other species but they are at their remember the alligator family so to speak and they can go very long time so that food of crazy animal like looks like a monster the teeth on that thing swallows things basically hold yep spins to take chunks all the things swallow them whole that doesn't have to eat for a year and go underwater for how long without holding like 40 45 minutes some of them great photo Jamie from the nature is metal Instagram page from yesterday that those nuts I love that there's a great one of a Jaguar with a Cayman and its mouth that one look at the eyes of that f***** yeah go for Google that Jack is just locked in the eyes on that thing my God unbelievable is like Nature has created like in those kind of eyes that's the perfect that's the perfect vision of Terror like those eyes like locked into those eyes like there's no forgiveness there's no emotions there's just porosity and aggression and death it seems like nothing but testosterone is behind that the wrong wrong chemical seemed so focused and motivated and like you say it's just it looks like death yeah I'm sure there's some testosterone involved medication too but is a bunch of the cat s*** and there's any of the big cats and they regularly eat these ejaculate the one that we found it so great because I kind of hide-and-seek guy right like I look for them and now there's a scientist Sergio relleno down Columbia who's going to manage that species ongoing existence oh wow really cool so what is involved in that like managing their existence what is he I mean Sergio who's in the field lives in Columbia can work with the species really cool I remember there was a documentary about this guy who was the scientist who was obsessed it was a biologist news obsessed with the giant sloth and he was spending all this time down the Amazon he'd been down there for years and the documentary was following him at this stage where he was getting really frustrated and not sure if he's wasting his career right like there was this feeling like f*** this thing might not be real he's like huh you sure you saw it right to have this discussion of this thing that they saw two years ago yet big like a bear an expedition to try and find the megatherium so I have to look it up right 10 years ago now not that long ago but but you know if an academic institution is putting resources behind an expedition like that there's a lot of faith and maybe even in tell that they're not releasing publicly to say this animal still here wow that would be crazy from what I've been what I've heard what I've read your tongue about scientists and 14 foot tall walking around the Amazon site like that 14 foot tall Ugg winter here than a Kodiak grizzly that's what the reports say what is this website you pull up there article from June about the spots of information about the Mossad even saying like it exists just saying this is all the information we have about this this animal sightings people finding undiscovered or mythical creatures to turn out to be like the Tasmanian Tiger right that's a perfect example like people they love to try to fight with the thylacine try to find that thing like the idea that it's out there it's like what is it about people where it's so compelling to find a species that we were we thought didn't exist we thought was extinct like whether it's Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster or the thylacine which we know used to be real right right people out there that's so much more inviting to the general to the general populace to get an answer too then knowing oh you know there's seven hundred of them laughed and we're trying to get him up to 1,400 or whatever the species Dynamic is for some other animal as opposed to being like there could be one out there where is it and I personally I've been on two different Expeditions looking for thylacine Yeah Yeah Yeahs did one in Northern Australia up north of cans and then one I spent a couple weeks in Tasmania with a amazing biologist Nick Mooney who he's adamant that he seen thylacine and you the biologists this isn't you know someone who worked as a biologist that was out in the wilderness going yeah I seen thylacine and he was terrified to tell everybody and that's that tells me that it's more credible right if you're scared to tell people because of your reputation as opposed to like going out to going I saw it I saw it I saw it right that becomes more credible than the people who are just waving their arms and they are gonna told you it's here when did he come out of the thylacine closet scared to tell people I got to go public with this I'm not sure if he told us first or if it was probably right before then but not long ago I mean maybe 10 years ago stripes on the back cool animal yeah and the last one died in the zoo right the will the last one that we think in Hobart in Tasmania Expedition for that animals like all those other people that are kind of obsessed with it is to Papua New Guinea so this species yeah that's right all the way from Papua New Guinea down through Mainland Australia Tasmania when people came over and settled that area brought with them dogs dingoes and dingoes out-competed them in Mainland Australia and possibly in Papua New Guinea 4000 years ago but the thylacine remained in Tasmania were there no dingoes out-compete them but in Mainland Australia you got a diversity of habitats so there are places a thousand could still hide but in Papua New Guinea the terrain is so crazy that the idea is that in certain regions dingoes could have never made it there so perhaps their these isolated regions worth I look very small Austin population continued for the past 4000 years have there been sightings many but just the same kind of sidings is a giant sloth you know what I mean it's all hearsay maybe it shouldn't because they're embellishing or or you can be on the hook for someone store I totally believe this guy it's it's all real and it could be complete BS and it's just so hard to tell you just have to go with Instinct put it is incredibly compelling I mean if you really did get a nap absolute photograph of a thylacine and you you knew it was real or or caption one I think it would be the discovery of the century and I think it would kind of ship the scales for people that are on the fence about on the fence about why do I care about conservation what are care about Wildlife Management you know those kind of things to be like check this animal out something that you know last saw when we put a bounty on his head and now it's back like a tongue on by a thread like that such a message of Hope and let's save it let's bring it back</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the whole environment in Australia so strange and now because of the wildfires you know there's a lot of species like those we were just talking the other day about the koala bears yeah that the koala bears while their habitat got burnt in and allow these fires behavior is pretty aggressive in Turkish and I don't know enough about them to really comment on it but my understanding is it if you'd like sea otters right do you know about this thing with sea otters what about him to like everybody loves sea otters are so cute they're so cuddly sea otters are super destructive they rape each other like they're they're like gnarly animal they're like not that sweet at all my youngest daughter is really in the polar bears polar bears are adorable and she wanted to get like a stuffed polar bear and I find it so fascinating that that animal which is the most ruthless of all bears or sure we associate with Klondike Bars and Coca-Cola everybody's Bunny and sliding around the snow and I almost wanted like show her like this is what they do to seal right show her I know she's not looking at you like that picture is his image of this sealed in the they all have red faces from blood when did they ever figure out that one polar bear that was in Russia that had been sprayed it said like t-34 on it you see it in that image right there that one Jamie I don't know about that right there someone had spray-painted T and the number 34 on the side of a bear's body and they don't know what how and that's extremely Ball Z it was spray-painted polar bear how did they do it and then with the real concern is that this bear is going to have a real hard time hunting because they're going to be able to see it much better because of the fact that it has the spray paint on the side of it I've never I've never seen the story before it's really have no idea what happened cruel joke turn deadly for predator now to visible both pray and poachers right now they have a real issue with certain towns in Siberia today like in the outskirts were polar bears are invading their like dozens of polar bears entering their towns evacuated towns because of so many polar bears being there from what I've heard you got to get out either going to kill them going to shoot them with rifles are you going to get out probably because people love them because we grew up with Teddy Bear right and we see Yogi and there's like they're so lovable on television and in the movies yet and so people have this idea of them like they want to take beer selfies like that beer selfie people being like hey why don't you like not pose with Wildlife because it's influencing other people to do that I'm like I'm a biologist my job I don't have another option here I'm working with it another option here like I have to pose with Wildlife like I'm working with it like she posted that you are the God said don't do what I do</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the last time I saw you I think was right before we headed to the Galapagos I was telling you about that crazy Island we went on we found that tortoise to know that I love ya first only one specimen has ever been found before 114 years ago and we found the second one we saw that did the biggest Discovery in my entire career was the week after I saw you last Island tortoise Galapagos tortoise on his crazy active volcano on Far remote what goes with gnarly sunstroke heat stroke I mean everything and after a few days of hiking up and down this volcano we pounce cat and we founded big like a tourist have been digging and 15 minutes later we found the animals I mean how many of them are in the wild there's a return trip that just one more turn trip just went right now and then another one will go in January but what grade is on the first return trip they had to bail because of weather and the weather is very harsh there they found evidence of two more animals so things are low really good so there might be like for alive on the planet right now there's one the one we found she's literally the rarest animal in the world this it's on Instagram but it was on Forbes times New York piano everywhere it was like big big stuff so you can look up Fernandina Island and you find something like that what gets done to ensure the population remains animal on the island on the island so because you know tortoises swim at least not across the ocean so because of because of where they were if we had found it towards it was going to be the Fernandina towards not being said to Unique shell ridging the shape put her in a few super malnourished underweight dehydrated she was stuck in an isolated pocket of vegetation there's nothing but love around her is boring but there's there's a cool one where you actually see me like finder in the bushes and yeah it was has been a tortoise just chilling on this f****** Island hanging out some famous biologists flies from all the way around the world to find you terrible living conditions and she was stuck so we moved her to the fa sol Arena breeding facility which is where Lonesome George was kept that other famous tortoise she put on like seven pounds or 17 lb in like 3 weeks cuz she was so happy to eat she didn't leave her water dish for like 10 days cuz she was just so happy to see water like to find a male and do find a mail if you do find what if she's an old lady says want to f*** and you bring some mail and he's like a baby and he's like 15 and she's 80 dude water so what we had hoped when we found her was that you know maybe she'd copulated with a male 10 years prior and have been under such top environmental stress if she hadn't had the Dubai energy to lay eggs and we're thinking I'll let's get her some food get her some water who knows maybe she'll give some Offspring so she might already have fertilized eggs inside of her from 10 years ago sperm can live in them to like up to 20 years and have some serious burn him to all the food and water do they have success and taking these wild turtles tortoises and getting them to breed absolutely I think when you hear that it's bigger than your studio here I don't mean this room the whole studio you don't I mean it's all natural vegetation basically we just moved her from one Island to another where there's less stress and now if they going to mail they'll just have them together hopefully they'll be Offspring then they can release The Offspring back on the island the population can remain stable that's awesome wow so that was cool is so protected that don't they make you like put fresh shoes on like you can't bring shoes every war somewhere else that might carry seeds where to go to quarantine for 48 hours everything we brought with us had to go into a giant freezer yeah freezer there for two days and we kind of had to twiddle our thumbs just waiting and then we got all our stuff back on the boats and went out to that Island it was supposedly kills any sort of spores or get really cold if I remember correctly and they go through you know you go through everything they look they go through your booty look for NEC to go through your underwear like literally everything to see if you're bringing any contaminants in God that's so f****** cool it is so the Galapagos is really the place where Darwin started formulating a lot of his theories of evolution right with the finches in the tour crazy skeleton was that from some kind of Marine Mammal sea lion possibly way all it's hard to say they're going to beach their something and then that's in the background actually where we found the tortoise Island Man have a hard time with that laziness, Turtles</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know they were talking about Hawaii you know in all these different invasive species that live in Hawaii and there was this discussion about pigs and they were saying you know like we should really take the pigs off of Hawaii and a lot of the people in Hawaii like hang on we been here as long as the pigs right so like are we invasive-wryneck what's invasive now right when does it become because obviously like luaus they're synonymous with like eating pigs and wild pigs are a big part of you know the people that hunt and Hawaii lives of their food source so they will but then you have a situation like Lanai where I go every year steer terrible environmentally it's a disaster like it's it's all wrong on this one Island Tyrone the whole thing in an hour I mean maybe a little bit more than that but not much are so many deer plenty of food people who live there it's amazing you know it like if you don't have to have much money to eat really well right to get a rifle you go out there bang you got a deer and you can shoot as many as you want write the YouTube seven in a day and stockpile your freezer and have all your meat for the year and their dad abundant like if someone wanted to start. Yeah it's a tough argument that could because you're right like Hawaiian people pig is culturally significant to them you know just like pry access deers the people know Ian has been for however long the deer up in there but I guess it's like at what cost at what cost if and I don't think this is the case but if someone said look if I know these pigs are culturally significant to you but if we leave them here the whole island ecosystem collapse they'll be no birds no fish you know no lizards nothing is it worth it to have pigs like and it's delicate the pigs in particular records eat everything me ground-nesting birds will devastate everything everything Roots them f****** every tree everything is coming up all the sprouts and everything they're super distracted here in California Teddy buddy pegs there's so many of them right and they're all over Northern California has problem in San Jose there in people's yards they're destroying shouldn't cuz they're they if you don't kill them they just breed and breed and breed and breed and breed a breed and then they just expand right and they're dealing with him now even in the northern part of the United States are dealing with him in the Northeast was a New York Times article about it do you find that from two days ago about the expansion of wild pigs is that they're starting to make their way to the eastern states and they're just they can be stopped they can survive in any whether they breed three times a year they can they're viable I think from the time they're 5 to 6 month old have their first litter feral pigs roam the South not even northern states aren't safe to swine have established themselves in Canada are encroaching on border states like Montana and North Dakota black man if they get into Montana they'll do so much damage you know what's crazy about the feral pigs in the United States they were brought here by I believe Christopher Columbus starting with six animals so the entire 200 million or whatever it is across the u.s. I don't know the number it was like six or eight or ten original pigs that were brought in by Christopher Columbus and dropped in Florida I ended and they are terrible for the environment like they do so much damage to Native species to riparian Habitat I mean they're like said we were talking about it out there briefly and it's it's a good thing people should realize that invasive species like that should not be in an ecosystem will they certainly shouldn't be in an ecosystem when there's no balance right if there are warthogs there in Africa there's a system for that exactly like they're all they're supposed to be I grew up in Zimbabwe my uncle my mom's brother we were out on Safari one time and he was you was young younger than my mother so he's maybe a teenager or something and he grabbed this Plum and started going for a walk across camp and anyway this warthog decided it wanted this Plum and so it came trotting after my uncle and started chasing him in circles around this tree but my uncle was so panicked this thing chasing him around this big day of that treats that he wouldn't drop the plum so he's just in this Perpetual cycle of be being chased around the street until he eventually through the plum and a warthog just be ran off and went for the play lucky didn't want him running around this is why we should pull up you're going to love this animal yeah it's one of my top bucket list animals to see in the wild great name yeah garbage the middle of head yep that's crazy look at that one bro that does not look real right that's a real animal oh getting it all. FUNimation more Baton Rouge City Barber mommy and daddy do late at night why you evolve that maybe if maybe like a peacock's tail you know for Showmanship but what's really crazy about them involving those two two teeth are tossed out of there their Bridge their snout is they if they're not broken in fights and running around they can grow long enough that they will puncture the animal in the head and kill it I've heard of that an image of it on my my Instagram was one of those Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself meme Bruce's skull actually saying that it what can do that actually was driving into its own head growing into its own head yeah I like that I think it's the ground it's only going to get worse right it's already in your brain you have to get it you have to be smart enough to find a branch we could slip that over and work your head yeah I don't think I don't think that off I don't think that's happening if you're a pig is this awful I mean often that this happens when they kill themselves by growing their tusks into their brain that looks like two of them had a crazy animal what a beautiful animal Marissa which in the single Island near sulawesi used to be and then they think people have hunted him to Extinction localized Extinction within that Island in that subspecies but some people I know that worked over there 818 this wild pig with these crazy horns William Logan Barbarossa and what they said and what they ate and it's like that could be an extinct in extinct subspecies that you guys consume how many biologists are actually actively out there looking for these creatures with those I would say zero currently that species but with regards to this field of Presumed extinct animals it seems to be a movement that expanding that could be an extinct in extinct subspecies that you guys consume how many pounds are actually actively out there looking for these creatures with those I would say zero currently that species but with regards to this field of Presumed extinct animals it seems to be a movement that's expanding</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> are you at you're experiencing so many different facets of life on earth like you're going to all these different environments and ecosystems you're in the water and run the land and jungles are on Islands a UA Liv and Maddie Lovett living very cool I admire the jungle and I don't know enough about vehicle but it was like be season and I mean you you should see some of our videos on Instagram it's like I'm talking about covered head-to-toe and bees we were taking like 40 to 50 stings on average per day per person let you know and it has his so miserable d250 a day there's eight hours in a day all day long in the morning or evening right before waking up the rest I'm out in the field taking sting so you're taking like 25 when you wake up in like 25 before you go to bed oh my god when you doing this is there a way to prevent it is there at like can you use like a repellents or nothing work we and you know we like would like scarves over our heads and you know put my camera into anaphylactic shock they were so bad so we it comes with a switch I think my point was it makes you appreciate the comfort so much more when you get back see that tarantula hawk bird and they come out of holes in the ground hunt tarantulas like you know there's tell everybody it's the parasitic wasp right so it comes out at Hunts for tarantulas it lays its eggs I believe in the abdomen of the tarantula and then the eggs hatching explode out of the trantula and that's the life cycle beautiful fantastic complicated cruel b**** oh my God I'm sure you seen the video of those Hornets that visit this beehive they visit a honey bee hive and just start the Japanese hornets need to start chopping off the heads off the bees no way I'm telling you about off their heads off with their their mandibles write trop trop and if so much bigger so they fly in and there's a slow motion video of these enormous heart Hornets flying in and decapitating thousands and thousands of honeybees so what's interesting is the honey bees they're so outsized I mean that the Hornets are literally like 50 60 x large a much more powerful but the honeybees figured out a strategy to kill the Hornets and what they do is they surround them they get on top of them and then they beat their wings they all generate heat and then they kill thus the Hornets with the heat of their body that's unbelievable unbelievable so here's this thing that's decapitating every one of your little village right and so you have to jump on top of it and flex and heat it up but the fact that they were able to devise the strategy see look how they do it man they just grabbed a hold of these bees and just decapitate them it's unbelievable day of these horrific faces Riley's giant mandible and they're just warm in and they just honey bees apart you said it nature you cruel beautiful b**** larva larva or they want the honey they want something said look at all these dead f****** bees with no heads bizarre crazy it's not that mean it's it's just so weird right now that you know that nature devices these sort of strategies to prevent overpopulation and that there's this balance it takes place where you know the bees are threatened by something is very be like he's getting on top of them gg4 for dealing they all get on top of them CDC a bunch of them now and he's trying to get away but you can't fly away and so then they swarm and then they eventually kill him so you think that actually liked Cooks the WASP something it overheats their body and it for its how many of them are on their yeah there's something that it does wear it overheats their body how long giant insects would be the worst the worst I think would be praying mantises that we we've been on a praying mantis kick lately been watching kill rats and everything hummingbirds the hummingbird one is the wireless one they sit by a hummingbird feeder are not moving and a hummingbird comes to feed the spirit crazy Kansas Jackson's Mouse it's crazy this wild it is wild creature I see him all the time why I think we can't even imagine how strong they would be if they were our size I think they would run right through walls like 2 feet long and he's a little ass hot little ass of praying mantis and he's given up he's literally eating it yeah yeah animal that lives on another planet totally totally remember that movie Starship Troopers of course I love that movie I loved it and that was one of the things in the Starship Troopers like these big giant insect jumps out of the ground and shooting stuff out of their butts fun movie we're really fortunate those things are small that all all insects or small we would be on the menu otherwise no doubt about it like there to like indiscriminately perfect Hunters big big you know predatory insects is there a history on the fossil record of enormous bugs like isopods and things like that but I can't not that I know of like you know six-foot-long praying mantises like they're too like indiscriminately perfect Hunters big big Dino predatory insects is there a history on the fossil record of enormous bugs like isopods and things like that but I can't not that I know of is like you know six-foot-long praying mantises</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> interesting to me is how some animals their progress or the evolution remain stagnant like crocodiles are essentially the same way they were tens of millions of years ago where is human cissus Market changed over the last half a million years a spectacular change if you know or 2 million years ago the doubling of the human brain size really quickly special moments in evolution but then other things don't go at all but then you have these Lions they get trapped in his eye on the way bigger Buffalo something we can eat can't f****** a buffalo if you're little right and the bigger survive in those the ones that bread I mean it's so interesting to see how this stuff sort of plays out and that we're studying it and really over the last only few hundred years are really getting an understanding of it even less than that I mean we're really only starting to understand it on a big picture now yeah it is a maid and everything in between you go and ask constantly avoid just it's insane the world the living world is so fascinating if you ever seen the video of these people there in a crocodile Park and they're feeding his crocodiles in this lady's like chucking chickens like chickens out and I'll bite your leg off the light even moves rolled into legs pops right off and swallows his foot swells his buddies foot like f****** a it's it's not absolutely nuts that is a cleanup machine 65 million-year-old cleanup machine Mina's bit different size Hammer to go to Cayman you got a Nile crocodile exactly right that is a very good analogy I'm going to use that the next time that someone actually to explain that cuz that's genius this is a hammer another knife knife and knives right handle the bottom got it right it's exactly right now I think they're just so interesting. If I told you the story we when we were in my Anmar we're retracing the ram rematch are you familiar with the Remi Massacre know you'll love the soap during World War II when the Japanese were holding ramree Island in Burma Myanmar the Allied came in and started making Japanese retreat in the course of like 2 days a thousand Japanese soldiers eaten by crocodiles by saltwater crocodiles time and it was this kind of Perfect Storm of situations where because they're all these soldiers they were eating all the prey only crocodiles were particularly hungry because of that when the Allies pushed all the Japanese back into the swamps you know they started screaming and one screen would trigger all the others just like all the crocodiles to get into a frenzy and it just wiped out this entire populace of people that ran through the swamp steps to figure it out where like why did this happen to good to try and understand it better and while we were there this kid got attacked by a crocodile that was a hundred years old so probably the same animal that it eaten people during World War one or one of them right and we we save this kid's life like we got to the village and he had just been pulled out from the Croc attack his arm was broken in like 25 places he was torn up he had lacerations all over his legs ankle his arm and we should get him out of the crocodile's mouth so he fought off the crocodile basically and then the Buddy he was with fishing pulled him into the boat and got him back to the village and we had the only because we had to get to this island and this is very very remote so we got this kid on the speedboat and got him back to the hospital and he he lived I think he lost the arm but he was just going to bleed out and die right there in the village hundred-year-old crocodile there probably was one of the crocodiles that ate the Japanese people during the massacre goddamn my friend Jim Shockey was in Africa and they had hired him to hunt crocodiles that were terrorizing this one Village and people had fenced-off this area where they could get water and clean and do crocodiles figured out a way to get through that and tighten everyone in the village had like a bite mark hear a missing hand the bite on their head like these so many people had lost loved ones and friends and while he was there a woman who was washing clothes got killed by a crocodile attacks while he was in the village and these are Nile crocodile price and normous you having a 20 foot long plus huge killing machines and these are you know I try to spell anybody that says to me I owe these animals were hunting people and I'm like no not crocodiles are you know what I mean crocodiles will hunt human beings they will lock in outside of a small village or an area that someone's collecting water they'll spend weeks watching studying the pattern learning the behavior and just wait for the perfect time where they can sink under sit right there waiting for someone to gather water in my opinion they're not distinguishing. From another prey animal they just notice things coming to water here at this pattern and they will absolutely Target people 100% they don't care if your person the weird thing about people we feel like we have some sort of a deal right.

So in late last year I was tracking this giant lion that this friend of mine had told me that he'd seen in this in Limpopo Valley of Zimbabwe like just north of the South African border and we surmise that there was a potential that this animal because it was so big had such unique behavior in the factory was hunting Buffalo and even if Steven juvenile elephant have Remnant capeline DNA in it because the cape lion was is extinct subspecies of African lions bigger than your regular line and they would follow the elephant migrations North and then back south but generally they hung out in South Africa anyway long story short we wanted to test the DNA of this line to see if it had any capeline DNA in it and it was just one individual animal we tracked it for over a week hung bait every night you know did the college did everything that you do to get it aligned in and then finally this massive black Mane lion and I I darted it from about 30 feet away from a blind you already feed but wait it gets worse I was in a blind so I felt kind of safe right but when I hit it I dosed for and it wasn't even you had a bet with us he had dosed for a regular sized African life the animal takes off running as we hit in the head in the back recorders which unit right after it on foot looking for it and we get up to it we like always down okay time to do our work up and I start walking up to it to check it as you do when you tracked an animal I get joke meter that to that television the big one right there and it pops up is like hello it's not all the way asleep and I just dropped to the ground and just go digit go limp right cuz I'm like crap this he's going to come and kill me in fortnite he was drugged up enough even though it wasn't asleep to just kind of like not know where I was and like didn't really charged but growls and came forward to step or two and then kind of turn turned off and lay back down again though we got another track went to sleep but it was really scary how big was he I think there's a did you want to show him the picture on my on my page huge I mean I don't know line weights or points are you do you need a hunting stats but unusually large biggest one I've ever seen and I grew up there huge did you get the DNA and did they run the tests we did and there was a 14% discrepancy between it and regular South African lion DNA so we couldn't quite figure out what it was and latest as you know tonight I'm not a geneticist but the latest is that sample has been sent down to South Africa to run against capeline DNA to try and figure out what the discrepancy is but yeah there was a discrepancy so there is something unique and unusual but definitely something unique and unusual to see if I can find it quickly it's a big big animal and I've got on my phone otherwise I know this is boring for but it just as it was so you talking about something is twice the size of a normal line I would say like 1 and 1/2 25 to 50% larger while I mean the pause were just it's just y'all show you on my phone I can send it to you guys but it's just huge huge big black Mane unbelievable animal is back have him on the ground when we're doing the work upset him right there putting a collar on him massive massive animal do you guys know what was a size of a sack yeah he's hung know how old he is Diamond travels around but we've got the sample which was the main objective so these to be a North American lion that was even larger than the African Lion significantly significantly crazy in the last fifteen thousand years ago want significantly significantly crazy and that was not that long A Relic when the last fifteen thousand years ago or something like that I believe it was definitely coexisted with human beings we had lions and big planes game and everything</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you you like these kind of far out their ideas how do you like the side yet there's a cut there's a group of people that say the Dragons Were Real and I'll explain so it around the same time. So to speak and I'm not one of these people so I'm trying to get the details from Matt McConaughey movie but it was all a giant scaly animal that could fly so it when you take when you break that down you think about the fact that large birds had a hard time being fossilized because their bones are so porous right so because bones they have like Halo wishbones they break down very easily they don't fossilize so that the the group that says this basically they're at they're saying the evidence is the reason there's no fossils of dragons is because they had bird bones and they're actually very delicate animals but a handful of these small rats Mall a small population of these giant flying lizards existed and basically encompassed all these different countries where they all depicted fighting dragons in their own way and they were all killed off by you no nights or whatever it is and then didn't fossilize so it's like the science is saying that if there were lizard big enough to fly around and eat people they didn't have bones that could fossilized so it'd be like an eagle right and so and that's why that's why all these populations around the world have two pictures out them cuz they did actually exist now are there any stories of dragons like written like in the times of people that they have actually had the written word or is it just a Pictionary not my field is like ancient accounts told by generation after gen passed down I think whether their bones wouldn't a fossilized in these have been passed down stories have been exaggerated and passed down from generation to generation and some of them breathe fire but some of them don't depend upon which culture it was significant to wonder if what the fire with the fire supposed to represent or they just people are full of s*** right Allen I mean we know they were large flying lizards during the times of dinosaurs right the only way that I could possibly hold is that like a few of those somehow survived much later than we previously thought but I do I think that there are dragons attacking human beings and civilizations now I don't but it's still interesting it's so much cooler if there were people 2000 years ago why would people would dedicate giant chunks of their life trying to find out if pterodactyls did coexist with human beings when I Google that I remember I think the the large ones were like 40 lb or something like that I don't think they were that is really light right but their wings and fly right do anything that goes back to that hole Hollow bone type thing they're fat a lot like you pick up a chicken for what it is the to fall to kind of made them collapse yeah large gigantic ancient things 8 1/2 ft wingspan for females typically and a half feet possibly up to 10 and a few cases why female I'm trying that's still a big but a 10-foot wingspan is there a huge huge flying knives in the videos that the of the Mongols use where they they trained golden eagles to kill wolves just f*** him up and then I crazy and I believe maybe one of those cultures you have to like as a teenage boy or something like that you're right of passage is to go climb the cliff and take the check out of the nest it's like this crazy process where you know number kids died trying to get to the eagle chick and the ones that come back that's their bird for however long the bird lives or I don't really know the whole process that's right that's bananas steal the chick from the nest and raise it they figure these things out and someone was the first you know I mean someone would like to go get that baby birth I'm going to let you know we probably did because I got high off that honey get me a f****** bird have a bird do all the hunting</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you know about the sunderbans in India that's a crazy Place crazy I did a bit about that my act as well back in 2009 my Comedy Central special work over a. Of 200 years I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 300,000 people have been killed by tigers in the singer bands isn't that not I mean it's just like that. Number it's on it's unfathomable there's a store that I talked about in my in that set where there was a boat filled with five guys and one tiger swim about killed the guy drags by the shore jump back in the water swam out to the boat with 3 different guys until he got tired of killing people that's insane 252 guys lost this crazy little habitat and I know a couple photographers would have been in there no you don't see anything like huge tall Tufts of grass you know everything can hide perfectly and it's all there and you just don't see it coming a f*** and bunch of people living in these hot suggest Villages have no protection but you said something earlier today about how your friend projected the wolf howl into the young guy friend that guy turn the wolf expert but what I love Isis finds that those non-conflict mitigations are going to be the wave of the future by using technology to come up with bio-control like a wolf growl to other wolves or you know what an alarming sound or smell the animals don't want to interfere because of territories I think that stuff is fascinating it is yeah I agree it is interesting and I think one of the cool things about all this wild is that if we handle it correctly we can make sure these things are sustainable and they stay around we can we can still be just marvel at their presents Jeff and you know this is it is possible to keep wolves hear ya it's possible to keep grizzly bears here it's possible to keep all these things here and we really really really really should. Because of you go back in time and how amazing would it be if we could go back in time and see Sabertooth tires. Incredible to be able to see please animals you only see depictions of Reese's skulls of the you know they were caught in the La Brea Tar Pits or something like we have those things right now we are now a lot of them and save them and we have the the knowledge the power the technology the tools that Finance we have all the pieces of the puzzle to make it work I think that's one of the really cool things about what you do is you you broadcast all the stuff and then let people know and you have a big signal and you showed me of all this cool stuff like that toward us that you found like all these other different animals and you let people know if this is this is an interesting as exciting as is and it's something that it's like it's in our DNA to be fascinated by other life-forms right and it's worth saving no one left now they killed all those f****** yeah possibly I don't to get down a weird Rabbit Hole here possibly in Mexico the silver grizzly bear in the Hyatt High Mexican Ciara's ongoing reports of Grizzlies for the same species that would have been here right that hung out in the Sierras traveling all the way down into the Sierra Madres of Mexico and then and he's what they call Sky Islands if you're familiar with that term these islands of isolated habitat up in the sky where they get more rain everything else there's there's big tracks of private land down there in Mexico where a couple of these farmers are like something's killing my cattle and it's not a mountain lion and it could potentially be like half a dozen Mexican grizzly bears couldn't be get Jaguars though but they're saying it's not reported sightings of seeing Bears 20 years before another one was killed Google Mexican grizzly bear I need to see this so what's that I'm trying to find something like this is just pictures of grizzly bears years this I don't know but take a look at when the last one was killed and then if you if you can find it see where it says they were extinct and it's many many years later took the parade of some sort it's not long ago so you know there's reported on these giant tracks of private land up in these mountains there's potentially a very small population of Mexican grizzly bears wow which I think is fascinating and it's one of those things that I don't think it's like so crazy they don't think anybody's gonna looked you know what I mean like if some Rancher who owns half a million acres in Mexico's like you do right but maybe he does like who's gone to vestigate up in the high mountain peak areas of the million acre ranch well there's not supposed to be grizzly bears in Colorado but my friend Adam Greentree who is a very experienced Outdoorsman he was hunting in the San Juan mountains and he got a grizzly bear filmed no on camera he's he's looking at it through a scope and he be documented on his Instagram page and he's like that is a f****** Grizzly well there's a there's sightings of them from the path that was when he was getting chased by one but that was in I believe that was in either Idaho or Wyoming places were they known about grizzly bears his sighting of this is when he's like he's holding up a gun and if the female cat Bluff charge him see her standing there in the background oh yeah the wrong caliber bullet in his gun so it didn't really load all the way into the pistol and he didn't know that until after this altercation so even if he had like pull the trigger and nothing would have happened right no bueno but she Block charge them she got within like 30 feet a couple of times the wrong caliber bullet in his gun so it didn't really load all the way into the pistol and he didn't know that until after this altercation so even if he had like pull the trigger and nothing would have happened right no bueno but she Block charge them she got within like 30 feet a couple of times</div>

Ruins that whole ecosystem for that River in the Bears in the salmon this morning and yeah we can remedy it we put salmon ladders in and yada yada but it's it's interesting that everything seems so tough as you just said and at the same time it's so fragile because we know we do one thing I put in a hydroelectric Dam and it ruins the entire ecosystem yeah we were in Seattle and Seattle there's a place we can go and it's like underneath this bridge and there's these clear plexiglass walls and you can actually see the saint oh cool way through and up the river and they were explaining how they had put dams in and didn't really understand the consequences of putting these dams back when they did and then all these salmon would go to the mouth of the river where they thought their going to go upriver and it would be blocked right so the population drastically diminished and died in like in the harbor like really wild stuff is crazy not just like the Bears and the bird feel like the whole Rivers ecology right like the river the algae's that live in the river the little bugs that live in the algae depend on those salmon dying up that River and fertilizing the river so it's like the whole thing is so interconnected and then you know one little thing and did you really crazy do you write like the river the LG's that live in the river the little bugs that live in the algae depend on those salmon dying up that River and fertilizing the river so it's like the whole thing is so interconnected and then you know one little thing and did you guys really crazy</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you see that video of the octopus that in caption Eagle the captured in Eagle gas it was in Vancouver Island I didn't know the octopus at capturing eagle and was trying to eat the eagle in these fishermen saw the struggle and released the eagle from the grasp of the octopus to me is like holy crap to me it's weird like why you getting involved in this right it's not like right like people want to think that Eagles are an endangered species they are absolutely not endanger do you go to Alaska there like pigeons up there there are a lot of them there Pacific octopus they're amazing Eagle might not make it anyway look at them briody's f*** you don't want water in the monkey people I don't even know how but like what octopus can do is nothing short of spectacular you know we're talking about my friend Remi Warren earlier and he had a show on television before call apex predator and it was basically they would study apex predators and you know the different strategies they used to be successful as a hunter and when they did the one on the octopus he know he was in here and like he was like dude they're from another planet yeah he's like that is the way they change their texture friend their color and the way they do it instantaneously to adapt to their environment how well they blend in there so interesting I think they're the most alien creature that exist on Planet Earth there's a new documentary out on I think it's PBS cold making contact that's just about octopus intelligence is a guy is a Fisheries biologist and he gets an octopus and basically lives with it and it's living room like he figures out that this thing likes being petted like it knows how to the diverse array of things that this thing can process mentally it's like on par with like what chimpanzees do you know what I mean it's like it just like you can open jars that can close them could come out of the aquarium go back into it swim over if it knows you it knows if it doesn't like you like it's unbelievable yeah really weird right octopus dreaming I just looked it up and it starts with the living room in relation to whatever the f*** is going on in his head right right so Wildman it's just so weird how they can instantaneously change their coloration and their texture and then perfectly blend in with coral right like when you see them like stop on a coral reef and just become the refill like what are delayed Isaac like look I believe in life outside of Earth but I don't I don't necessarily think that octopus came from that I think they're you know they have other stuff like there are other cephalopods that they're related to genetically squid and cuttlefish and things like that I don't necessarily think they came from outer space but I can see why there's science to support that it's a possibility and then I can also see why people think that seeing them will their thoughts about that with a lot of different life-forms like spores thoughts about that when it comes to psilocybin yep there there's like we're the real freaky psychedelic heads think that psilocybin mushrooms came from asteroid right end and the the proof in the pudding in that one so to speak is the fact that you can take mushroom spores into the vacuum of space and bring them back to Earth in there they still they still fruit Austin Elon space weed SpaceX look at that little eyeballs how weird and look how many of them like I was getting Invasion imagine if your wife gave birth to that many people. Thanks you be like I have a school are we going time in human evolutionary time the more it seems like it's an accurate accurate like we're getting more and more plugged in everyday it's like a combination of the Matrix and The Terminator what was the one that did what they had them over a chessboard and was trying to make everything that we're trying to mimic a chessboard at school is really weird because it throws a system off because it's many right angles and it's this hard trans-fast A10 contrast so when you look at it like this octopus like trying to figure out what to do very strange pictures I mean that's pretty good like pretty f****** good yeah that's pretty impressive ability that these animals have unbelievable figured out how the f*** did that evolve right there devising strategies in order to be more effective Predators while they're in the ocean and hide from other Predators right and they figured out a way to change the color in the texture their skin like how long did that take exactly exactly Bob right there devising strategies in order to be more effective Predators while they're in the ocean and hide from other Predators right and they figured out a way to change the color and the texture their skin like how long did that take exactly exactly millions of years</div>

The whole thing is crazy I'm reading a Trina f****** Buck I mean he's lucky I give up I give it up to that guy for a lot of reasons first of all he was his back was against the wall that the UFC was telling them they're going to cut him out to this fight with Damien my they don't like his style they think he's boring they literally told that to him so he goes in the ring after the fight calls Brazilians a bunch of filthy animals does a bunch of crazy s*** and the next thing you know he's got this f****** character we're making fun of a suit and next thing you know he's one of the most popular guys in the f****** Sport and talkingshit and that was only three fights ago man has a massive adjustment why did you laugh when you found out that he didn't cuz it's a storyline Out of the Furnace we haven't had a guy that put on a character like that before he's the first a little bit you know he's doing it on purpose. He's wearing cheap suits play hilarious man is hilarious and three scorecards or on two judges scorecards they hadn't three-in-one so three rounds to Usman on one judges score three rounds to Colby on another judges scorecard yeah it was that goddamn clothes in 2 and 2 with the last judge this is another example of being crazy crazy but there's another example why we should have more judges more than three judges that makes sense 8 good number 9 would be a good number because nine to be like a tiebreaker 51 or 411 I feel like threes ridiculous like why do you only have three you know the judges suck already so why do you only have three people that's inactive</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how you doing man everything all right everything good walking good while walking great that's amazing them because your left leg it look like it was during the fight it was getting busted up taking it the wrong way I thought I was lying more damaging shots to the head and body you know I know Lake cakes Atlanta here and there but I didn't think it was too much until after I saw whatever happened you know but today you know it's like is what I said I just my lease take me to the face into the body does is 9mm that much to that to that extent and then again this is a street fight you know Scizor leg kicks like a you know it's it's hard like leg kicks a damaging they mean alot make fights of spin stopped on leg kick so now but Barboza think stop firefights ippc people who stick and move nice and this and that and just because the guys walking forward he's winning the fight and then like you see them getting to see people get into scuffles and then one guy bounce back it looks like he's retreating but he's actually not he born the scuffle and I think that guy that was staying there was actually winning the fight so what you said is this super like you know some guys like real problem with judges not even being martial artist that's why it's a giant that's my bird watching say Dallas behind the scenes just talking to daddy came from the DC was a DC fan in front of eyes on you and some of the commission there at the DC event was like I heard was was crazy hurt some people it is not like to know what is going on in like 3 in perspective surprising my time is it kind of hard and I'm not talking about my fight against talking about other people we need the fire and everyone spiders before he moved away and he was trying to become become a Referee and now he finally got the you ain't caught for a championship belt in the Heights organization what's cuz you don't even know how to f****** you don't know how much brake you should apply when you see some of these people that are judging you know they've never done anything they never done it if they don't they don't have any idea what's going on they just have a cursory understanding of fighting and it's not acceptable for the highest level of the game so many EX Fighters that would make amazing referees or judges and there's so many fans out there that have been training their whole life that just do the really really into the sport and these fantasies with these judges rather not even fans yeah they're just people that are doing it for a job but getting a paycheck and yeah after fight with walking around with me and my son the next day and the next day is next Sunday I walk into New York New York there's a Hawaiian I love once I love my wine greatest fans in the world she comes up to me and she rubs my back and she's like I'm so sorry boys I love them like what does IQ lawsuit we be back but yeah I love you with nothing to me like it's my funeral or something like guys I don't care I'll be back I didn't take no real damage I'm just happy that I'm not injured and out for a long time and I can get back to do a loving and it's punching people in the face what were you guys think it is let me know and I'll go knock on the front door right now and then I get here that says something up yeah well you you just need to make some adjustments for rematch I mean the whole thing was him attacking your legs that was he was getting close it was a smart strategy letting you switch stances you switch Orthodox but you were forced to certain times in a fight to fight Southpaw because of leg damage not really because it like that is because I just felt when I was going so far against him I just felt more like he was he was waiting a lot more regular it was like I was like I hear the word dragon dragon and dragon with leg kick it was like a latex so I could hear it in there and I was okay well it was what did you think he was going to fight like what would you think his strategy was going to be coming into the fight. So I thought I knew he's going to do that a lot of things for sure you know I don't even do like how we did although maybe living more get Megan's offense but I think she's kind of tripping out when he when he got me down I was able to get off and some some of them I think that you're tripping out that you could take it like he was I thought so what we did I think so we did good and then he just did better in one aspect with the lake cakes and it all added up yeah when I have to watch the fight again but I don't remember him Landing up a bug us real significant punch that had to hurt it was good punches but it was just his leg kick work was excellent though and he he he did a lot of great work some of the first ones in the first round sum of the first one was great it was good in the early rounds but some of the other ones psyqui super close and then he just do it like you know like I'll just end up getting into a tangle and he just end with a lake it just wouldn't even touch me you know so I guess I was the game plan but everybody was there and so in my eyes like a rematch makes sense and is very exciting fight with you he was the one that everybody wanted to see you Friday cuz he was undefeated and he would win in such spectacular ways but you you know you you deserve a rematch I really feel like I can't wait dad that is crazy you know you know from stylebender and Dan hang hangman hooker hookah I'd let you make the f*** yeah I was a big hooker fan for a while for a while I've been watching him since his foot when he was in 45 I was watching so but he just stood with Barbosa which is just a f****** terrible idea for most people by Bowser kick so goddamn good at he's a he's a fastest with kicker I've ever seen in my life oh God damn good he's a he's a fastest with kicker of ever seen in my life</div>

It was so ridiculous wow so then you realize do something different I need not be bringing the guy that work with no Ivan Flores by tracking coaches by striking coach in and he lives play hey man you remember yeah I always let you forget that it's kind of hilarious right you just watch you just wait how talk about like calling it but that's when those things like someone tells it to you like a champion he is here already and I was in idea I was in the UFC already and Chad was one of the top guys and older than ever my friend my friend told me doesn't tomorrow is like OS kitchen eat at work or right before you did and then and then he we will practice that he took me like a hundred times if I don't know wrestling too good and then I said told him and I said to him that I'm going to be like this is how life goes cellulite that has a different company he's got to put it on the world you know if you think you can do something we'll do it and go work hard I wasn't scared of hard work but you've always had this attitude.

		<div class="paragraph"> oppositions this is there anybody that thinks is a fruitless idea actually I was very shocked I read people that were actually happy that your project didn't work the first time like what the f****** is people that I think it's a young thing like cuz you're the really hopeful young intelligent guy comes up with the solution I think it probably does that hurt for me yes of course since the beginning delete what I used to do in the beginning now therefore she there aren't many new arguments anymore but I can write them out every single argument Russian the analyze them no emotions emotions only model your thinking where this person has a points if so great because rather have somebody else pointed out to me then I'll tell him to learn it in the field and having a headache and if the person doesn't have a point if it's just a sumption or unfounded or whatever it's very easy for me to just ignore it and so I'm done the question what motivates people to be negative for reasons first of all it's a genuine skepticism can be done and I think that's healthy and think we've proved most of those arguments wrong now but of course they're still at the Caleb's language stuff to do so so bit of that but it's kind of morphing now to few other things I think one thing is human perception which is sometimes for example say Okay nuclear power super risky we shouldn't do that but then if you compared to the baseline or other sources of energy is actually the least risky source of energy there is solar energy is causes more deaths per megawatt-hour than nuclear power because people fall off roofs so so it's it's really so if you ignore the Baseline and if you say doing this cleanup we shouldn't do it because there's all these potential risks rights of potentially potentially there are these moral hazard there's always risk not to it what people are ignoring is the certain hazards of this hundreds of millions of if you were to do the opposite question to say okay so if it were to go to the ocean right now and just dump the equivalent amount of plastic that we were to take out who dumped it into the ocean which you would you think that's a good plan and then the answer is it's no so I think there's there's a bit of this of course it's new so while we take things step-by-step I think they're manageable and they're definitely not risk a reasons to to not do it because Chris the Baseline is that there is already doing a lot of harm being done by the staves quote something that's one argument behind people's opposition I didn't know why you're a few weeks ago were people were saying well or just one person actually was was riding where person said you shouldn't worry about the plastic pollution issues you shouldn't do anything about it because climate change is the biggest issue and or attention should go there but if Lucius just a distraction and it's foolish should you not wash your dishes because your carpet is dirty mids doesn't make any sense both of them are Problem clean both of them this is idea that you should only think about climate change so I don't think about the giant Pacific Garbage Patch it twice as big as Texas are you f****** serious argument both of them are important to think about but a part of writing an article today is writing something that people will get upset about that's part of it is like generating our clickbait stop having controversial opinions all things are profitable today we are the giant part of why people write articles they don't write articles articles to State and objective well-thought-out perspective always sometimes people do but a lot of times people make some clickbaity b******* and they kind of twist story and quit twisting idea who you are twist it to sort of make their narrative make more compelling be more compelling and sell more for quick more and more add sales that's in part behind the growing tribalism in a relation which is everywhere social media I mean the fact that Facebook's algorithms in innocence support outrage right like these things are designed to support my friend Ari shaffir tested this it's really interesting because he tested to find out what it what is it actually support what you're interested in puppies puppies he's like no you assholes this is what you're into if you're into f****** getting bad about the border and getting mad about the climate and getting mad about abortion and getting mad about whatever the f*** it is that's what it'll show you because that's what you're interested in my YouTube feed is mostly muscle cars and fights I'll show you what you search for someone's happy that it shows you those things going on I don't think I don't think it's as Sinister as people want to say it is I think that the issue is human nature will we are compelled to get upset about things and I think a lot of it is people that feel disempowered in their own existence the people that you were talking about they're stuck in cubicles and they're staring at that clock waiting for the buzzer to rain so they can go home online they're tweeting they're taking a s*** and tuna guys with kid things going to fix this parking me infection s*** this a lot of what's going on there's a lot of people that are upset because it's there just it's fun to be upset when your life sucks it's fun to s*** on somebody it's fun to get mad about the Border when you nowhere near the border what are you worried about you what you worried about you're just angry angry these aren't logical discussions of people having their shout offseason and it's Richard get upset about stopping you know it even someone is doing something as beautiful as your perspective it's your your idea instead of just saying all of this guy is doing something amazing we need someone like this who's just as Innovative and just as inspired to try to tackle this climate issue and we need more people like him this is amazing stead of that like you spell incorrectly and yeah I suppose it's from the perspective of the person who writes and nobody would see her opinion is it supposed some from the perspective of the person who

trying to prove you don't have some sort of an idea of where this is all going no one really knows and changes happening at such a rapid Pace that it scares everybody so looking you to find things and they're looking for control and it looking to be the person who got it figured out because nobody melting official disappearing people are eating dolphins it's Madness it's madness out there the f****** Garbage Patch is growing and growing and growing if it wasn't for someone like you who's actually acting doing something about it will just get worse this is Spock that guy but but they're so they write about things and it might not necessarily be you know honest so how do you incentivize the truth again I think technology to make a lot of what we're concentrating on Obsolete I think we are really really close to some crazy breakthroughs in terms of distribution of information that's going to make it Obsolete and people aren't going to care as much about clickbaity things because you know you going to be able to feel things from digitally created media when they were very very close to augmented-reality becoming an essential part of people's lives same way your phone is becoming a central part of your life 20 years ago no one carrier phone around those are very rare and you know 1999 small percentage of people have phones on them now it's 100% right all this stuff is happening at this exponentially increasing rate when they Implement augmented reality who's telling us that Apple's like somewhere around 2021 and I've been looking that up in you but some other folks brought it up to that Apple's really close and they're they're in the process right now developing some sort of augmented reality goggles and they'll be like glasses like you know you put on just like this but you'll be seeing all these things in front of you you'll be able to move them around your able to see navigation you wouldn't be able to turn it on and off it'll probably work on Siri you'll be able to talk to it and you're going to be able to get video and information was podcast all these things music there is going to come through this and probably this is one step in his ever-increasing trend of us getting further and further immersed in technology and augmented reality will lead to some sort of impossible to determine virtual reality worth indistinguishable from regular reality I think it's under appreciated how much are behaviors also Guided by technology I mean of course we wear jeans or genotype which kind of lies at the most fundamental level of how our behaviors are formed that's why there is such a thing as human nature but then there is this whole cultural layer but that we Youmans created around us which sphere maybe other people have different names for it but it's indeed's everything Reds we we interact with some 30,000 inventions or 3,000 Technologies to our entire lives that's a huge amount and I think that's environment that shapes your behavior it decides what kind of genes are expressed and we create so so probably think about people being born thousands of years ago their genes were very very similar to the people today yet how they behave is completely different violets and why is that the case it's thanks to these inventions not just cultural inventions yo shapes our behavior and probably human nature is very hard to change unless it's actually benefits what we do look at how long it takes for smoking to to go away no one is one is incentivizing to continues use of it through addictive products with smartphones it's something that you want to use so I just wonder whether you know that interaction between humans and the technology that we create can invent incentivize inventors to become morally better and better because they aren't did she lose me or so the question is incentivize primarily by Prophet right but the behavior of people kind of shape by but maybe a person today is it's Morrison device to to do good things because of the environment that has been created rather than a thousand years ago I think that's absolutely and I hope that people's ability to express themselves through social media all those off and negative and Bitchie sometimes also can give you a sense of the moral landscape of the culture like not just the people on the far fringes that are the most angry and vehement about things but people that have objective real rational thoughts like the the fact that you were able to read that article and objectively assess whether or not someone has any good point if we could all do that about everything you know if people had that sort of perspective instead of being so reactionary instead of being so angry about things just look at criticisms look at possibilities look at all these different things and then shape technology to fit within our ethical and moral boundaries so there's others also there is very profitable right because of his things don't feel if you don't like a guilty feeling about buying something like an every time I get a 6 drawn-out feel guilty if there was something that you the people where they innovate to the point where you don't feel guilty supporting products and you probably cuz company has the same sort of ethics and ideas that you have that's all good and I think we're moving more towards that but again we're dealing with a very short window of time where we have had to adapt to the amount of change takes place during a small. Of time Chasm between human nature human behavior and how we want the world to be and indeed social medias if that's the case but same area for environmental problems are driven by and yet that's not creating the world's right now that we want to live in because the the technology that is it the interface between the worlds are so absurd nature and human nature that interface is not compatible with both so you either have something that's compatible with human nature so it's like a big car with a V8 engine but that's not compatible with with nature or something that's compatible with nature which is free walking but it's not really comfortable with you because we're play think that's cold outside and you got to get what we do is rather than trying to change humans which I don't think is very futile activity because there is such a thing as you and nature we have jeans have this Eeveelution are in history rather than trying to change that I think is much more effective to change the the technology around us that enables our our inner desires and behaviors to be positive rather than the negative I agree with you I think it's going to be difficult though to get that same sort of positive result when it comes to our addiction to technology addiction to smartphones a particular me for a long time it was like televisions right like people talked about how much kids watch TV kids watch TV 8 hours a day it's so much natto bad you don't really hear that anymore about phones and this is undiscussed rapid shift in what we waste our time doing and most of it is what you hear people talking about most of the use of these phones I would I'd be willing to bet a giant chunk of that social media yes right again so I think you're right yeah it's again probably we can engineer social media and our information technology to incentivize people to do good things but indeed now it's it's probably incentivizing the use of scrolling through timelines because I also I think it's our bodies and our minds and the way we view the world it's not designed to live in this digital realm sure this is a completely new thing for the species and I think we don't really know how to handle the dopamine Rush that we get from clicking on Instagram and scrolling through your feeds and checking your DM and reading your emails and constantly interacting with people checking did he text me back or what he said what about this and that very bright Engineers somewhere in a big shiny building a b testing all day to see weather NOAA red dots on certain icon in the social media app makes people click more or less and less</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> one more fascinating things about people that we have the ability to contemplate the possibilities that we have the ability to look at this and what are we doing here hold on technological or the rather societal sprawl and you see these urban sprawl is just slowly encroaching on new land and pushing out into areas where there's no houses before it's always weird for me when I drive by a place like Boulder Colorado does a really good job of limiting the amount of construction that gets done there they're pretty Fierce about it but even they have been sort of lightening up a little things have been getting built in every now and then I'll drive by like if I'm in college all that wasn't there before now it's there are no big deal just a new building used to be an open field who's that helping is not helping anyone and then other building outside of that none of you could you have the ability to look in time 50 years nice spread for this weird wart of humanity start moving across the globe disco featuring Google Maps where you can have Fowler Google Earth where you can have time lapses from satellite photos remember you looking to buy 30 years ago nothing and a crazy example that's a crazy example that place is so strange like Las Vegas and steroids Islands man-made Islands the shape of the world but all the different continents that world has seen that and it's not doing this the Google Maps thing called another one but there's another one in Dubai or how many years is spanning 24 and she helped build the the Palm Islands then the problem is that The Palms so it can I get stinky and Ono this Prime real estate that's just stinks oh no really all that makes sense but the water in between it would get stale of course that makes sense f*** this is Bonkers this video is Bonkers brakerite idepot the water from smashing into it like the outside Rim can just come everything so now what do they do with all the stinky watery just accept it could question that f****** world's tallest building is by Nana's right nothing watching pictures that people taken from the top floor it doesn't even look real I call you flat-earthers you need to go to Dubai you can literally see the Curve it looks they even taller can you see the curve from up there see you from go to airplane fly above the Earth yeah bring up the TV adapter either stays the area what kind of psychos want to be on that first flight well as Richards would have to go on one of the first ones himself if I was him I would clone myself and put a fake me on that see if that b**** blows up if I wouldn't trust them double yeah what is this Jamie is this GoPro this is what would flat-earthers you that show that the Earth is actually flat it's the perspective shift but just the height of that goddamn thing makes my Palms sweat I was there last year and it was somebody sticking her phone out of the 80s like literally like a missile from your head would just explode you guys getting hit in the head with a cell phone from a mile up motherfuker that's crazy they can all back away from the the building shut the f****** on James Kingman Kingman the guy who does those thing right he does these videos from nice walking places just watching those I can't imagine if I was actually doing that what a terrible f****** instinct or terrible thing that happened to me when you see people hang onto something your hands sweat so do your hands sweat when you're hanging on you.

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I've been reading that you are having some great success with your machine finally it's everything is up and running last time we talked you had yet to implement it actually out in the wild and now you explain to us what happened you had some bumps in the beginning right yes yeah so quite a few years finally something's happening so we we launched our first ocean systems from San Francisco in September of last year and we took it out and roughly two months later we fit we figured that's first of all it wasn't catching plastic so what we saw was with the system was moving at roughly the same speed as the Plastics of maybe just take one step back and how it works so Great Pacific Garbage Patch between here and Hawaii twice the size of Texas hundred million kilos of plastic and go away by itself and Daddy was stupid to have this artificial Coastline that is driven the forces of the ocean we we put it in there and the plastic naturally accumulates against it and kind of stays in there so we can dump really get it out because the big challenges that although there's a lot of plastic it's it's spread out over this is fast area so we first have to concentrated before we can take it out because if you were to Simply troll the ocean for plastic boats and that's it will just take forever really so so did it was 222 have those artificial coastlines play the first one and then what we saw was that somehow the system was moving at the same speed as the plastic so you can imagine if this is like a your Pac-Man and this is your your your catch and is moving at the same speed going in and sometimes it did go in but it went out again we got a video of it what it was that's the rights will learn from it will try and adjust assistant and then literally exactly a year ago the system broke into two and a structural failure forcing us to tell the whole thing back to land and go back to the drawing board so so we didn't have the best start of this year how much time has been lost or how much time has been spent I should say in the beginning phase the initial yeah version that you launched is where you're at now so we've been going on at this for the 2013 after 5 years launching it and seeing it break into two that was wasn't the best start of the Year could could have imagined but then went to the drawing board and you're the team really took a while but we'd into account adjusted the design and relaunch really just a few months later so June and this time we made the system is a bit more modular we could try different things to try and adjust the speed make you go faster make you go slower and then we figured was while the system isn't going fast enough what if we actually turn the problem into a solution what if we turn it around and actually slowed down so that it goes slower than the plastic and then we figured that that that actually works and in October we announce that where she catching plastic and ready just last week the first two shipping containers full of plasticware Orlando Airport what's really recently up and running expected how long does it take to accumulate two shipping containers full size of the net itself yes so that's the next steps and now that we have the basic principle of catching plastic confirmed I went out to make it bigger before weekend god build a whole Fleet of them because they believe we reckon we need maybe fifty or a hundred of them to really clean up pop this batch of five years that's the objective of the whole patch in five years that's the real objective that's possible have enough systems that's incredible now where are you at in terms of like trying to get these systems made and implemented so the so now we just finished this this first step with the system number one we call that then the next step is to develop a back-up system to which is deep going to be bigger version and ears to minimize the amount of Festival use that you need for it so that comes to because boats are really f****** expensive the Builder we have cost roughly $15,000 per day to keep running about boats to get to a point where the amount of money that you can straight from the actual resource of physical plastic can actually pay for the exit the whole experiment hope so that's what we want to travel next year with the by making products from the catch the way that we may can have the material itself hardly has any value it's it's pretty good the story to it and don't feel guilty terrible idea but what what is the what are the products that you're thinking about the first one but actually that will retain their value so last for very very long time and I text you once and I do Browns you can talk about it with other people and actually now so just last week we with the first plastic I'm sure we said okay now we welcome our supporters to actually make a reservation but can make a make a down payment so that you can be first in line so if people go to our website they can actually put in the 50 bucks and get the right for the first-ever products made from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch so you're just trying to figure out what Prada will have them all sustainability what wood products people keep for the longest yeah and think that people want try you don't want some kind of gimmick that's just going to be this paperweights flip-flop seemed like an easy one people loved by flip flops flip flops people that are like sort of like outdoorsy type folks appreciate the beach and maybe have to write these things down 1 belts people like belts and shoes like definitely some Yeezys and some dope recycle running shoes juice tub easy right people but you have to have a way to till I can send to buy field recycle the movies so ironic those f****** things want it back in the ocean you know just got to be a way to do that just tell you know I have like if you have your own company like drop off points in cities where when they're done with their stuff if it's broken down or withhold if you did leave throw it into this bin and you will ensure that it gets convert can raw materials and utilize again that be great move if you would do that if it if you made it easy for him you know tour Deluxe recycling bins they make it easy for them they'll throw their bottle in there are no so you have these two cargo ships or these two cargo containers filled with this plastic stuff what do you do with it now infrastructure in the US so so we set up this infrastructure in in in Europe to be able to force or tips and then shred it and then recycle it and then make those first products out of them so hopefully and hopefully with that then generate the the cash needed to to continue running the cleanup but of course now it's still small-scale eventually we should have those number shipping containers every and every day for a group of people come up with ideas what to make out of the plastic and they said that by September they should be ready to launch the first product that's great man that's the whole idea behind beautiful you have a river system to as well right yes so so that's the other thing right so and the only way to deal with that is to just go out there and then clean it up of course then there's the other side of the equation which is there still huge huge amounts of plastic flowing into the ocean every day mostly from countries in Central America where people are the stage of development June lot of things that are wrapped in plastic yet there isn't any waste infrastructure had to take care of it so you literally see people on scooters just drive to bridge to dump their municipal waste into the river because that's simply the easiest way to get rid of it to your point what's easiest and combination there's a lot of people and there is no infrastructure that that they can make you so so then back in 2015 we were like okay maybe it's some point in time this is ocean thing will work out who knows but then we're stuck with this problem that there's still so much plastic blowing in that we would just have to keep going forever and that would just be buses coming from and then we figured rivers rivers are like these these arteries that carry the trash from from land to Sea because it when it rains plastic washers from streets to Creek to River to Ocean and then we we find out that there is a hundred thousand rivers in the world so that's kind of a big amount if you want to do something about it so we started doing measurements in reverse and then we found was that just 1% of rivers are responsible 80% of the of the pollution so really just a very tiny amount of rivers if you were to to tackle those could really addressed the majority of the plastic going into the ocean and it's it's mostly like these relatively small River sin in capital cities like Manila Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur if very high density of people that's where most of the leakage so since 2015 we've been kind of a secret side project and working on seeing what can you develop something to to intercept the plastic in in those rivers and we just launched it months ago call it the Interceptor and it's this and Howard this is all real the real plastic is being pulled out of this River out of this River and it's also doing so in in their stacking into these bags it's a large physical quantity of stuff oh yeah and then maybe in in real life as we speak how does it avoid doing anything with fish how do you avoid captax accidentally oh my God Is that real yeah that this is the Klang River in Kuala Lumpur and it's 1% of all plastic going into the world's oceans is coming from that one River and the unbelievable how polluted this is his crazy 10 million kilos per year roughly so just looking at it looks like a wasteland that's so sad yeah so so then we have four interceptors to have been deployed so here's the one going to to the to the cycling River and kind of wanted to make it look like a like a spaceship some people would like it has barrier that that's concentrate the plastic to the mouth of the Interceptor where you have a conveyor belt against police alarm battery powered and then deposits on to this moving shuttle conveyor which then distributed across these big dumpsters can hold roughly fifty cubic meters of trash and it just works by itself Sceptre 002 cleaning in Malaysia is the title of the YouTube video it's crazy now you're not catching any fish in this it's so really it was what kind of lizard is that right so this isn't that one really almost all the plastic isn't that top layer so sure won't be 100% efficient but I think it's it's really bad having this pragmatic thing that catches most of it and most importantly leaves Wildlife alone cuz everything else can you swim underneath that exactly and so this plan that you had when you know it's been 6 years running how much of your daily time is devoted to this don't think there's much much free time at all its 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. looking where we were beginning of the year to Arena will now that you've actually pulled these cargo containers filled with plastic out of the ocean that must give you an extreme feeling of satisfaction right that you actually made it work like you it's moving now so I was kind of hoping for that feeling but then when you get to the point or not okay but they're still you can really only see the amount of work still ahead of you so that's actually really hard to enjoy success in a way that I should probably get better at that it's Hartwell particular what you're doing you have a Monumental task in front of you and what you're doing is rightly being applauded by so many people but I don't know how many people actually helping you you have a crazy thing that you're doing trying to pull the plastic out of the ocean when people find out about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch they been able to get panicky like what how long has this been going on how do I how do I not know about that because so few people I mean I would think like maybe 40 population understands there's a gigantic patch of garbage in the middle of the ocean is discovered 20 years ago exactly 20 years ago and still there just been growing out 1998 no one had a goddamn clue and then they went with what what's going on here and for the Northeast. Well let's try and cut off this this piece and then he was looking at the water and they just just saw that's all that trash and then he went back he was so shocked about it and then he decided to take some measurements Bobby's to results and that kind of popularize the whole concept of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and it's also it's it's a lot a lot of more than people think of it feel likes it's broken down by the ocean right yeah so that's that's what happens over time is that this these larger objects have interested the ocean due to working of the Waves what's the sun breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces actually not really a good thing because he's smaller pieces are easier to ingest for for fish and other Wildlife so so the smaller gets and the more harmful as well and Fortune movie season still in 92% of the plastic is still no microplastics own fixed up but of course if we don't clean it up over the next few decades all of that big stuff will also become microplastics and then when I much worse thing is the cleanup of micros those microplastic possible or is it just something that needs to be sort of rethought out so that was one of the positive surprises catching plastic not just the big stuff it was also catching most of the microplastics down to one on them clogged up with all the other stuff is that what it is we're not exactly sure how it was able to do that but we just saw a huge mounds of those this season in the system is probably has to do something with the radiation of the way so you have the pipe that keeps a system together and because ways are compression against it reflects this is well and almost like a lens it was concentrating those microplastics into one patch in the middle of the system which that's pretty cool so now where you at in terms of trying to expand it to a point where you could you don't really get this goal of the half of the plastic ocean in 5 years yeah so so it would probably be easier if we had one, but we know set two goals for a cell's one is the 50% of 5 year for the for the patch but the other one is that we want to have interceptors into the 1000 most polluting Rivers the ones that do the 80% in in the next five years so will be will be pretty busy and really really busy he has so if you're not busy enough yeah organization now about a hundred and I think my team is being now it's better than it's ever been so fortunately there's definitely love to help but we're still recruiting work to do and what is his ride been like for you from being fortunately there is Stephanie love help but we're still recruiting of work to do and what is his ride been like 4 for you from being</div>

over working at Wendy's lot of people that use it but we have an issue with my body that's what's upsetting but it's also if someone is doing maybe maybe they are a sex slave like maybe there's someone who's I think that's what to do with the puritanical idea of things that they were accusing Robert Kraft of remember Robert Kraft guy who owns the crofter craps crap on the New England Patriots what was that it was that he was participating somehow and sex trafficking and so they were accusing him of that they were that was a big part of what the police were saying what turned out that none of the girls that work there were sex traffickers there just prostitutes and the woman that did it to him she was like 40 years there was a new store where they used a buzzword yes it's very specific in terms of like the difference in the consequences that you would want someone to face whether they just went there to get your dog or they participate in sex slave so that is part of the issue but I do know that if you take away the stigma and you can normalize things very quickly weed is a great example right you could do that and even we've done this with women and bodies in the way that we look at people who are overweight and we look at people with different things like we are getting to a place where it's less of a thing I think it was prostitution look at it as like this is her choice and if there if there wasn't an exception for it any other way except when money is involved that's where I have a problem with it but it's it's it's not even that it's it's a it's a societal position because they don't want their daughter or sister or mother to be a prostitute that's it that's all or them didn't want to be a prostitute that's why they would vote on it but this the only thing that's completely legal to do like not only that but it's what cells are it is f****** selling cologne he sounded I'm a hot man if you if you get my clothes you might get some p**** and looking right at that mouth as many people as she wants for free charges then also like what the fuc when it comes to the idea of a woman taking control of her own body no taxes being paid and the idea of someone being a w**** because of our puritanical roots in this country all those things combined make it a volatile topic but at the end of the day if she's going to make money that's going to go back into your Society that's going to be put to good use of going to be tax is going to be in your community what do you care what she's doing behind closed doors that is safe and it's regulated just like we'd all of a sudden their standards now it was a way to sanitize this I think so and they didn't Australia they didn't Nevada minutes full on there you could do whatever you want they have they have brothels but I think it's also one of the things that we're conditioned to have a perspective on it's similar to the drug issue like I don't want my friends or my daughters are my mother or anyone I know to be a prostitute so we have this like this position on it I also don't want the do Coke but I don't think Coke should be illegal I don't I don't think anybody should do a lock you in a cage cuz you want to get coked up imagine if it were legal how many less people would be dying just in a drug trade yes and how many more people would be aware of how much you can do because you'd get actual Coke what would they aren't companies right if you're going to buy something from the bisco camp bisco sound Coke real coke disco flavored cocaine in Europe the way that they are with alcohol like Italy for example alcoholic freak out when you are able to do something they got to do whatever they want they can watch TV they could drink and smoke pot and f*** and they go crazy crazy for sure. Time and then at the end of that time they can either leave the church forever or come back and most of them come back right because it's all you know also you're probably so hungover will work out</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I haven't done it I haven't done it I haven't traveled to England since the whole brexit things been going on I went through touring and it should have just been like just hop on a plane to go to other countries and Customs hoping someone comes for you I don't know enough about the arguments pro and con to comment on it honestly doesn't matter cuz we don't have a boat I don't want to hear if it's possible Potter little bit cold world look at that guy come on like Harry from Dumb and Dumber when Trump was younger vote for Donald Trump and they wrote someone's like someone in your family voted for Donald Trump do you still speak to them and I would like to be with me this idea that you can't understand he represents all these horrible things but we have to be able to have conversations in this country and on both sides and other liberals at times and I say this as a person's fairly liberal it's terrifying just attacking your own allies and creating no space for a conversation when I was a kid and my parents are hippies and we live in San Francisco and also look at it and so I always thought of liberals as being the people that were like open-minded you know not wanting to silence people letting people speak their all about people just being whoever who they are and not not trying to enforce like rigid patterns of behavior and thought on people but that's not the case now because they think they're doing the right thing, I think they're combating something is awful in Agra 7 regressive you know the something that is that did feel like the country that they know and love is slipping away so they're not the right way to go about a response to this issue a great example of what your your ideology represents by being a good person but being open-minded by being kind instead people are being super super shity there's so many strange super shity people that think they're doing the right thing because aggressive in all do they want good thing they want gay rides and they want Racial equality and they want people to be able to make more money and then she wants to be happy and healthy attacking anyone who from the get-go doesn't agree with you because by the way if you if you and I disagree and you calmly want to have a conversation with me I am very open to having my mind change of course I want to be on the right side and I want to do the best thing if you yell at me and you call me stupid, and you're attacking me and you're on the defense from the gecko from the get-go as a person with pride you're going to want to be like you know what I don't want to hear and f*** you because you represent now all the good intentions like you're the representative of all that and I don't like you you are you're an ambassador for your cause when you speak I'm really into the environment and plastic and stuff like that and I am very specific about how and when I post about things because you don't want people to get activism fatigue and you don't want to be the person who post about every because if no one will listen to anything and you don't want to call people out specifically because just cuz somebody carried a plastic bottle that day doesn't mean they don't drive a hybrid you don't know what people are doing literally what I'm thinking of the pious good life that person is leading and you're judging them on a snapshot on which you don't want to be judged on well they want to judge people the thing is about it's a lot of what this is about people that are on the fringes it's the ideas are great right but the people that want attention for espousing these great ideas often times are The Fringe so the far-left and far-right a lot of it what it is it's just people that are ultra-aggressive about enforcing their ideology and then the Kitty and I want other people to comply until you get these people that represent the right in the disputed represent the left but they did a lot of the ideas of the right and left when something wrong being fiscally conservative there's nothing wrong with being socially liberal government in your money there's room in there for conversation but when you go far right and then you go far left then there's no room and when you start Owen Benjamin who is just basically like in a tinfoil hat somewhere and like living off the grid he offended a lot of people write you staring at me and I remember there was this girl that I was friends with on social media didn't know her but just followed her cuz I liked her writing that's it and she danced me one day and she's like maybe I don't know interact with him on Twitter I'm never on Twitter cuz I think it's a toxic black hole she's getting mad at me and I agree with what he said what he said was there was someone that he knew someone Works in Hollywood that had a three-year-old that they were turning trans right and he said is child abuse that was what led I don't disagree with that crazy situation spiral side which I didn't even participate in whatever Legos are your choice that's what you're saying I had known to none of this agency left him and then comedy clubs band him for that that was the beginning of it steered into that skid that's what that's what started the skid right would start the skin about like he called someone who and this person starts attacking me offline how can you be friends with him and I go all what are you talkin about she's like he's saying all these horrible things and I I said I've known most of my career let me go read what you're talkin about and she was angry at me for wanting to gather information this person is a trans writer who I literally until that moment didn't know was trans cuz I was just a fan based on Merit just like the writing and I said how dare you shame on you as a journalist you should applaud that I go and collect my fax they want compliance like immediate instantaneous complain I said I'm an ally and I am Pro trans and I'm pro-gay-rights but you do not get to bark at me on a Sunday morning when I've no idea what we're talking about and get mad at me I vote and I miss Doubtfire come over now, she is allies grossed when other people use it like he's an owl that's a good way to use it but when you say I'm an ally am I okay Subway bathroom wall like people just right up by the way anybody's ever said anything awful to me on Twitter who I've seen in person they say nothing and I'm talk the way anybody's ever said anything awful me on Twitter who I've seen in person they say nothing and I'm working with people should

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is it women when they go on a man's podcast lifetimes to get women or men rather hate on them women have like today women your body shaming or you're showing an unrealistic body type in your feeding into unrealistic body expectations I've seen that a lot saying that to another woman that was pulled in England in the UK because it was like a gym add this girls in a bikini shot hot body Jim something like that maybe sunscreen or some s*** but I was drawing a hot body and they made them pull the ad because it was promoting unrealistic body expectations but isn't do you think we have a problem in our society like my boobs are real and because they're big my whole life I mean my adult life people are like order to through and they can't believe that unlike someone's got to have real tits for you to ask if they're real and it's almost like was so fed all of this fake stuff that when someone actually hasn't been my eyelashes are real and they're long and people was like there's going to be fake other eyelashes against so when someone's big are strong we always assume that they're faking it cuz sometimes our noses are fake but some girls go crazy with your eyelashes over to get spiders out on their heads so I can judge that girl silently I don't have to say it to her face but you don't have to be a piece of s*** about it you might be again paranoid I think as a woman any time you open your mouth or leave the house is going to be like if people don't see just don't focus on the ones that don't because I have found when someone doesn't like me it typically has nothing to do with actually me well this is a thing that people do when someone's very opinionated where you wanted for some reason like combat their opinions I seen people do it even the things that they don't necessarily disagree with and being autodidactic and I'm being self-reflective when I don't like someone I really try to examine what it is and sometimes it comes out of my jealous I'm just jealous use autodidactic got it instead of getting like he's not being shity to me to you that upset people because deep down you're reminded that you're not that and those are all the things you want to be sure he's confident he's always good looking better now you know but it's not real when you s*** on someone wants to bring funny you're being funny I'm all for you but if when you're when you're just being mean about someone like some football player for the bowl one criticism of someone you're so rarely I talked about as my special but like you're so rarely allowed to voice because it's like well you're just jealous I'm like or I am in fact doing the correct feminist thing and judging her on Merritt of what she has done and I dislike it and it has nothing to do with her being beautiful obviously issues that women need more quality in this country I think the issue with the concept of being a masculinist or even the concept of being a feminist is that everyone automatically thinks you care about that more than you care about genuine General Humanity right because you're isolating gender you're saying I'm a feminist I'm a woman I support women I would support women's rights and women's values and exports feminism empowering women when people hear that they go okay you like women more than that Dell Comics I married a dude I have some hot dudes congratulations I am actually a gigantic frat boy trapped in a feminist body but that over vying for is just to be treated equally and not be made to feel horrific that's it I'm not asking for special treatment Wright's but I think that like when people hear it like they kind of have that feeling like she's one of those She's a Maneater it's almost like the word is so heavy now that it doesn't necessarily accurately portray the intent sort of applied I don't read feminist writing I don't the idea that other woman you're constantly being preached to by other women like freaking require what it is is I think on a granular level I enjoy having conversations and most men I know or like they're not these oppressive horrible people and we always look to the extreme left or right to prove our point when an extra wide is a whole population of people who think and feel just like you and that's the key is finding those people and communing with them will you you never a problem with man but you know you're also you're confident and ambitious and when you're both of those things and see if she'll hear the word feminist she's one of those but she's going to be annoying you're not but there's that thing and it goes back to what we were talking about earlier it's the fringes all men because they can't straight Pride Parade guys like the worst people that say all men like the kind of feminist that say all men I'm like you're part of the problem cuz that's just as bad as some guy saying all women are s**** you are just as bad for marginalizing anyone I was here in this woman talk about sex like women want this and women want Susana podcast women want this women want you to slow down women want you to be Jen Wagner no no women somewhere why do some women want to get rabbits look who talking to a girl who speaks in generalizations for a living like women do this but you proved it over years and years but I also like sex podcasts are like so not my thing was just so crazy to speak for all women try trying to speak for all minutes if I said men like to be ball-gag men like to be kicked in the balls smell like to be tied up and pissed on that line is JoJo their s*** shouldn't Tupperware and send it to them well that's true some men like that that's real question and you have to start saying some not all speaking for me if you personally I know for me while we have this thing where we are we don't look at things grangerland we like will they said also they must mean all and f*** them before me it's been do for me what we have this thing where we are we don't look at things grangerland we're like will they said also they must meet all and f*** them will for me it's been a little bit</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> start a tech company and like we are lot of Chinese people at work it was a computation of biochemistry research lab so of course we had a lot of Chinese people that works there cuz they were very smart well there's a lot of Chinese people when you say not all Chinese people are doing well this f****** a billion yeah I mean there's plenty that aren't doing well but the ones that are doing well or doing really well computer I had one guy who were working on a recruiting new people to work for me I don't understand what we're doing here but the one guy who work there he came over didn't know any English and he learned English by watching Seinfeld so I could you not hear those Seinfeld Cadence little bit like Kramer no not the full thing but every time you coming to the office TV like love no really weird what's your racial and racist I enjoy Chopsticks so great way to eat salad by the way I think people are often used to the Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee Narrative of Native Americans which is his victims and there's no question that they were victims of a Westward rolling Empire and 378 broken treaties and we can just go on we know what that narrative is like but the narrative that I told scenario of power dominance of Power with which came with brutality too and I think it's surprising it was a fact it was a fact that that if you go back in time these ended these Native American tribes that eventually got crushed as the Comanches did and put on a reservation somewhere and had their livelihood taken away from them but you know I really anyway it's a huge deal and and a narrative that I think to me that doesn't take into account the enormous power and dominance in Behavior of Comanches is just missing you know half of half an hour well it's so fascinating because it's essentially they were living like Stone Age people and they were doing it very recently there were there were doing it like in terms of the way Europe is you could go and see buildings and Italy that were built long before any of this stuff happened long before the settlers started encountering them and they were living like this and this sort of what makes very romantic play they live just chasing the Buffalo well in anyway and killing them in and eating only Buffalo meeting and doing very little farming picking some berries and nuts nuts about it maybe was just eating beet and raiding and killing It lyric they were hunter-gatherers nomadic hunter-gatherers which is what they work and and what the horse allowed them to do was to which is what they had been before divorce allowed them to do that only just really really really well otherwise they wouldn't they weren't in the position of becoming agricultural Indians The Horse Cave in this ability to and as you said that they got everything from the Buffalo clothing and and lodging and and tools and Saddles and bridles and food and everything came from the Buffalo so the horse just enabled them to do this an incredibly sophisticated level so don't eat McDonald's man like I don't trust me a matter fact DNR Andrew one time we went to we did the hip not the hip-hopper would s*** the MTV Awards over in Europe and while we was over there the crew and everything I travel the line I'm like there's like no we're going to go get something to eat and I'm like I ain't even that s*** up everybody the whole crew had to go to the hospital I don't know nothing for y'all got food poisoned trying to eat I'm not sure he said he didn't but I swear I told him to he said he didn't get it but he might have listened to me that time but but for the most part I just don't eat when I go out the country I eat s*** that I'm used to a fruit rice chicken and McDonald's McDonald's cheeseburger baby at my Facebook like that nobody really died on on paper I don't like diamonds birthday Jack in the Box all right they having e-coli outbreak any restaurant any place that that s*** that you would show it on there I'm pretty sure is ecoline that s*** they just by the immune to it if you look at it during such well I guess I'm a very short term faster 400 meter is 6 weeks yes you can do that but these are patients are transient so it takes time for things to really get get solidified and also if you're more patient with your progression as while you're going to find that your gains are much more stable if you take some time off which is important for anybody you travel you get sick some other thing happens so if you've been training in a matter where you're not forcing yourself in fact this is one of the very important points in that voice coaches would make that do not forced adaptation David rigert is probably the greatest weightlifter of all times so he is over 60 world records and several weight classes and just unbelievable athlete so he just made a point that do not force and strength development do not force massdevelopment that's another problem you start it's possible to build muscle fast but it's not given us earlier equality muscle so yes take your time and in this is interesting up Joe this is what Old-Timers understood I'm a fan of books by old-time strongman not all of them of course but some of them are just remarkable early Derman 1825 coldest Seekers of strength and it's an awesome book she read this book and if you follow the directions in this book from 1925 you will get parts of your results and foremost pop Fitness and strength programs because people who had some sense some common sense or able to observe what's going on they're not driven by some slogan until Alex Jones and John Watson was with him right yes I'm pretty sure about you know what that they couldn't believe what they found so this is Place Bohemian Grove and the idea was that they're all the elites would go and it would engage in these occult rituals is in America until you hear about this and you like what you heard about that I hate there's a place former presidents go top top ranking generals and heads of state and bankers famous artists that go to this place and they do a cult rituals they perform occult rituals episode 4 part 4 of The Secret rulers of the world directed by Jon renau send he travels with Alex Jones to go Netflix worshipping moloch the owl God and doing this calming them they have an effigy like a bunch of straw into the supposed to represent a person that you're sacrificing tumulak they all got their dressings crazy hoods they put the Effigy down they say they have the loudspeakers they have his crazy speech they give it's so weird but these are like legitimate wealthy famous people politicians these people are like heads of Banks and s*** and there's that's right that's nonsense that doesn't really happened is not a real-life Bilderberg meeting they don't really get together and f****** Pretender burning hookers they really like that and he's not always right and that's part of the problem when you're being lied to left and right by so many different things you can real off on stun things in and he did he's gotten you know it's been beaten into the ground but the the fact is that there are a certain amount of these things out there like that and if it wasn't for Alex releasing that video I think most people would think that's nonsense but then you see that video you have to go okay what is this what is going on and if it wasn't for Alex releasing that video I think most people would think that's nonsense but then you see that video you have to go okay what is this what is going on with the really dressing up

		<div class="paragraph"> is the place like I think if I had the choice if there was one place where I could go on a time machine just peek so I can hours look around then come back to present day. I think that would be the spot I'd want to see what Egypt was like when they were building the pyramids like in the middle of construction when they're at their Peak when they're building the Great Pyramid of Giza like what was Society like people like you just be a fly on the wall and no one knew you were there if they saw you who are you why your teeth look so good how come you don't look deformed I go back to the J I love you I'd be on the grassy knoll. Dave JFK I think he may have even been there I think he may have even been firing but I don't I don't believe that he was the only one I'm with you I think you could have been in on it and maybe he didn't even fire it right but when they said when he said that he was a patsy you know the way he said it when he got arrested he said I'm just a patsy that is that's like a guy who knew he was going to get in trouble for something that's not like a regular guy he was not a regular guy they easily could have talked him into doing something f***** up and then they did something as well and blames it on him and they had him set up for it yeah he seems like a wacky dude and it did that and made that shot and really wanted him dead with own it quite the opposite. Point you're not trying to not go to prison well maybe he is but it didn't seem like it he didn't seem like a guy who just shot someone he also didn't seem like a guy who was shocked that he was getting arrested for something but you can make someone a patsy back then that was real you can set someone up and then you hired Jack Ruby just run them dad Jack Ruby jobs a gun they put him in a nice jail cell like if is many people hate Trump right now if that's only like me I don't know how many people hated candidate but I know that the Bay of Pigs was a huge disaster lot of military people hated him for that the supposedly he wanted to get rid of the NSA supposedly he wanted to get rid of wanted to do something about the Federal Reserve there was a lot of things that he wanted to do apparently maybe as a CIA daddy was a CIA who's trying to disband one of those but he just he didn't had a disdain for secrecy and secret societies you know like that there was a lot of these like Skull and Bones type things that like George W Bush was in Terraria Herbert Walker Bush rather his dad was Georgie W and skull and bones 2 Alex Jones and Jon Ronson was with him right yes yes I'm pretty sure I'm right about that they couldn't believe what they found so this is Place Bohemian Grove and the idea was that they're all the elites would go there and it would engage music zoos in America California Northern California and so you hear about this and you like what I give you heard about that I hate there's a place former presidents go top top ranking generals and heads of state and bankers famous artists that go to this place and they they do a cult rituals they perform rituals episode 4 part 4 of The Secret rulers of the world directed by Jon Ronson he travels with Alex Jago Netflix on YouTube these people worshipping moloch the owl God and doing these things completely navigate like a bunch of straw into the supposed to represent a person that you're sacrificing tumulak they all got their dressing crazy hoods they put the Effigy down they say they have the loudspeakers they have his crazy speech they give it's so weird but these are like legitimate wealthy famous people politicians these people like has a bank some s*** and there's there's not a real-life Bilderberg meeting they don't really get together and f****** pretend they're burning hookers they really liked that they really do and he's not always right you know and that's part of the problem when you're being lied to left and right by so many different things you can get real off on and he did he's gotten you know it's been beaten into the ground but the the fact is that there are a certain amount of these things out there like that and if it wasn't for Alex releasing that video I think most people would think that's nonsense but then you see that video you have to go okay what is this what is going on with a really dressing up as a ritual this you're seeing it now show video Bohemian Grove just so we can watch the video and stuff porches dress up like Druids going over and they're tearing the Effigy and then they going to sacrifice it lied on fire do this is like really rich famous powerful people are all here watching this but you that the back that up so we can hear what it's we can read what it says back it up a little bit yeah but can't you know what I'm saying is make it so I can hear it and mass Ren's the stones of Babylon or so they why do they even say play it a little bit like look at this for beauty is eternal so they haven't sinned and we bow to Beauty Everlasting it's a very strong chat so they're yelling us out this guy's got this on the loudspeaker and they're they're engaging in this ritual and then they bring over this aphogee they Light It On Fire have a boat in the water like it's weird dude just imagine being a guy who's worth a billion dollars and this is what you do for fun you going to get together with Mike and Harry who runs Microsoft and you're all going to go and pretend you're burning something or who this what did they become billionaires and then do this or is it at chicken in the egg that's a question that's what people think about the elites it is true that these people are on meeting up once a year to burn a stack of hay shaped like a lady why wouldn't they invest in each other and you know of course that all bankers and successful will that was the thing about skull and bones is that they all had something on you everyone knew something cuz you all sucked everybody dick is right dress up like a munchkin that's what they all did I did some wacky s*** like like what you could have had on somebody before p*** search history probably all f***** each other there probably was one guy was like the tops dudes and you just convinced there but I will have a group and you can't tell anybody I really busy trying to f*** these guys in the ass that's his goal is just to f*** guys in the ass he's like man is getting harder and harder to Trixie's do I don't believe you I think you would tell tell me what do you mean I'm going to have to have you do something that you don't want to do that way we'll if you ever say anything about us to everybody about you mean I really do want to be in the club guarantee that's that's crazy dude just tripped a bunch of guys isn't that it was not so maybe they don't do that just run by dude you're Duncan dudes still in college and the bone house that our efforts are true I'm here to uphold the strictest interpretation of the Boneyard don't trust you and show your commitment yeah everybody bazan oil first like why we in oil what it's going on just weird fukin secret societies told me that they hated it that I was shocked when I watched it and it was good pull-up Kennedy speech about secret societies is Kennedy had this speech about secret societies that many people speculated had to do with the CIA or had to do with the movie brings up an angle I didn't know that he hired his brother to become the attorney general and he started going after yes open get into office about the Kennedys they were drug dealers hundred percent or tell us kids crack the whip but they couldn't get it to him cuz he was just staring out window alcohol salesman they made a bunch of money selling alcohol illegally just like a drug dealer does same thing the fact that those folks went on to become the incredibly powerful family and then two brothers get publicly assassinated f****** a man two of them the fact that you can keep guys around that you know will whack somebody for you like that though be a jack peora Sirhan Sirhan just trick a guy figure out what you going to say that I got to get that guy to run up on that dude and shoot him in the stomach and I mean if you put a gun to somebody's head and you tell them that if they don't do this we're going to kill you and your family that's it pretty much you got them especially sometimes you know like in the movies and they show someone a picture of their family and they showed my picture their house or whatever you know what I mean like I know where you live I know I think it's more than that I think it's guys that you can tell that they're going to do a good thing to go down in history and they going to live in infamy or for their own personal gain like you talking about people that you that are so dumb you're willing to lose the rest of your life cuz someone's telling you to go shoot Bobby Kennedy and going to do it in a restaurant from everybody was a hotel where he was shot because the hotel eventually shut down I don't know how long after the assassination but when we were there they would rent it out for television shows just like weird place man walk to the kitchen where where he got shot like yet. He's got shot in the kitchen and they bring them into the kitchen I brought him and I think it was an invention part of speech I think this is the main highlight or okay hopefully looking for very word secrecy society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret society to secretos and a secret proceeding we decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment and facts try to justify it even today there is little value in opposing the spread of a closed Society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions even today there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our Traditions do not survive with it and there is very grave danger that an announcement need for increased Security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment that I do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control and no official of my Administration where there is rank is high or low civilian or military should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news to stifle dissent to cover up our mistakes or withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserved for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of Elections on intimidation instead of free choice on gorillas by night instead of armies by day it is a system which has scripted human and material resources into the building of a tightly-knit highly efficient machine that combines military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operations it's preparations are concealed not published its mistakes are buried not headlined its descent is a silenced not praised no expenditure is question no room fretted no secret is revealed no President should Fear public scrutiny of his program for from that scrutiny comes understanding and from that understanding come support or opposition and both are necessary if someone else is saying those very things in front of you how they have an open budget there their findings are all concealed there a tightly Wood Group group that combines the military and Science and all you do like went about all the gears that are in play all the pieces that are implied that are making money and causing war and deciding what information people shouldn't shouldn't have and what overeats you know they're going to put into action before shadowing everything</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we were watching a weird course we are watching Home Alone 2 the other day the one where he's lost in New York and the scene where have you see that's where he's walking to the hotel he's you know he gets this fancy hotel he has his dad's credit card and he's like lost in the hotel for a second and it says Trump trump turns around really funny movie Home Alone 2 is like really well-written I was my mind is blown watching the whole thing such a great Christmas movie in there so many great actors it's an insane lineup Rob Schneider's actually hilarious in this one's are classic like I'm looking at it now a writer in me or the LA guy like I'm looking at Movies differently now and like this is so beautiful how they made this happens you do anything else they look like horrible parent right so they really had to make this one work out and they do such a great job with that he's a replacing batteries a guy there they're running of course still this late family that can never have their s*** together and he's chasing the guy and it makes sense cuz he runs into the lady taking tickets that's back when they took physical tickets and he runs into the ladies chasing the guy that looks like his dad in the tickets go everywhere so it makes sense that he does Casino makes sense it and they went he went to the wrong gate following the wrong guy like everything makes sense it's beautiful that they can make comedies but way back then like could rationalize a family being in a different place than their little choc story on new character should be its Macaulay Culkin as a 40 year old man trying to figure out what the f*** happened to him they put him on these movies when he was a little baby he's a cool guy. Very nice guy I had him in here in the podcast I really enjoyed talking very smart just a very interesting little fella but you know any good for anybody do that to the kids make your kid's dad f****** famous and when you're a little boy and you're growing up so I can't I like that and then I'll send your this forty-year-old man where he is now really nice guy really cool really fun to talk to recommended by Kevin Smith Kevin Smith told me I have to have modestly to got to talk to the guy he's great they really has is nothing like his character in the mail Malone. He's a grown-up he's a grown up man of leisure but I think at all the people that have ever met that are famous at a you know child age he might be the best at it cuz I think it's an impossible task I really do and I think it's the only way really works if you can handle Fame is if you have you you've developed character over your life I'm becoming adults and and we're nothing and understand hard work and understand the fortune that you have to do to be famous or to be successful in show business but if you grow up like that man all your signals are all crossed wrong all your wires are all f***** up you grow up thinking that you're super duper important for no reason with no work at all and that you can literally get whatever you want to have people get it for you all the time Justin Bieber how how how is he not going to be crazy house you're not going to be crazy tell me he I think he's handling it incredibly the ideal you going to hold him the same standards as this other kid who's also 24 whose dad is the football coach at the high school and his mom is a math teacher and they're really in tight with their community and he grew up going as the Scout camps in you know he plays football and he plays baseball he's got a bunch of friends he grew up and they're all normal is had a girlfriend for the past 2 years but just know if you should make it serious when you go to college and come on come on then yeah he's a whole different different kind of person then went to a normal high school and went to a normal college and then became 22 versus poor f****** him right pulled out of school so you don't have real like knowledge of History can probably barely read Justin Bieber's 123 hundreds of millions of dollars and probably had girls just launched themselves at him from the time he was a little boy in a way that no one who's not Justin Bieber's ever going to understand such a loser bro cuz I don't know if a therapist would work the thing about something like that is that's the kind of Developmental psychologists barely went to school but the kind of Dometic developmental damage that happens when you don't have to go through all the normal stuff that everyone else did like here's the thing about like one thing that UFC fighters and Comics a lot of us have in common is that we had s*** lives growing you were probably bully you fell into I got into martial arts 100% so scare people can beat me up. Wasn't a big kid and I didn't know a lot of people in the high school and went to adjust move their nose are f*** I'm so scared all the time I got to do something and I went to an easy High School Newton South is an easy High School don't they but these inner-city kids though that would f*** you up the point is that like if you don't have a motivation to work hard whether it's to become a stand-up with her is to become a martial artist or what anything that you like you like I got to get out of here I got to do something different I got to make something happen you got to go through s*** for that feeling to sort of emerge with enough horsepower to get you some momentum I can't imagine who I would be if I was famous 106 I'd be such a mess that same in the drug of the state of this day they just can't get they can't pump the serotonin out of their brain fast enough so they so many of these people chase these dragons will it also get really depressed when they don't have continual constant success like a lot of kids that experience Like An Early Peek and you know everybody loves them they're super used to it and everybody's kiss their ass and then it drops off and then like what what do you mean Trump's office like a lot of kids that experience Like An Early Peek and everybody loves them they're super used to it and everybody's kiss their ass and then it drops off and then like what what do you mean drops off and they get crazy cuz they want to get it back</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I thought it was hilarious to that they wanted him not have so many wives they didn't wanted to have the wise and they didn't want to have hit the end of the braids the long long braids and I didn't like that didn't like the wise wanted two things his own way he also played politics brilliantly he understood it from the early going that that quote the chief of the Comanches was going to be appointed by the commander at Fort Sill you know it wasn't just going to happen and there were all sorts of candidates jostling for this and he made that it was him that didn't make him any less the leader of his tribe it didn't make him any less of an independent person who the white men had to deal with but he made sure he had that one buttoned-up and it was challenged continuously I mean there wasn't there were continuous challenge to him it's interesting historical that you don't hear about him and the Comanches played such a significant part in taking over the west and settling the web you hear about Crazy Horse you hear about Sitting Bull you hear about the the Sioux and the Apaches you don't hear that much about the Comanches and you don't hear much about Quanah Parker know it was one of the great pleasures of writing this book is it through these were largely unknown things I mean if you corner with one of them there another another Discovery was you know every we all know about certain people running around San Antonio in the 1830s jave Davy Crockett we come to mind we don't know about Jack Hayes the world's greatest of the Ranger though the guy vented is anti Comanche Warfare invented the repeating you know he first he didn't invent but he first use the repeating 5 shot pistol in the course had a hand in the adventure of the six shooter but everybody should know who Jack cases everybody should know I mean Quanah was I mean Geronimo is Geronimo and he's famous largely for one particular particular break out in the late 19th century buddy nkwonta was arguably the greater man in in the reservation. And yeah I'm in Geronimo some ways was kind of a was kind of a curmudgeon to was Jack Hayes and the creation of the Texas Rangers who we think of the Texas Rangers today we think alike Chuck Norris do you really don't realize that they were essentially a group that was created to effectively combat the Comanche exactly that's where they took like some sort of several iterations of these guys with before they figured out how to do it right and then the guy that came out there this essentially a lot like like a lot of depictions of Navy SEALs like Renegade like wild rugged Rebels and they are those the original Texas Rangers is that Jack Hayes in there I don't know so hey so so the thing was a okay San Antonio in the 1830s late 1830s you have you have about two thousand residents it's a kind of the out the final outpost on the frontier and what was happening is Texas which now owns the Texas which now owns Texas having won its independence is giving out what they call headrights so if you want to get ahead right many free land to all you had to do to get your free land outside of San Antonio was go a survey the land so I had to do and so the surveyors would go out and Survey it and the Comanches would kill them and ever more imaginative ways because the Comanches understood exactly that the instruments did steal the win the instruments were the mechanism of the theft of the land from them and so part of the deal was to keep how can you keep your the surveyors alive and Hayes was originally a surveyor but he eventually just got good at keeping other surveyors alive and these guys who could do that eventually became known as Rangers and they involved as Comanche Fighters female fighting like Comanches did I mean they learned bird signs to track people they wouldn't make cold camps in the you never made a warm you never made a campfire if you were around Comanches I mean they would they would they learned these these techniques and techniques of warfare and they got really good at it they just had this one problem in the Robin was it they had three shots at Kentucky long rifle Bang into single-shot pistols and that's all they had against Comanches who I would encourage all of your listeners to go on and and look up this guy Lars Anderson on the internet I do believe about Comanches once I saw the Anderson videos you believe them yes Anderson can I think it's 10 hours and 5 Seconds there's no such thing as a quiver you're holding it as a bunch in your harm you want me to put all these things that we heard that the Comanches could do underneath the horse's neck and rapidity of fire and no one's ever Comanches never stood in one place and close when I shot the never once did that they were moving both eyes open anyway look at the Anderson video it's really cool but what that meant was that Jack Hazen the Rangers word an enormous disadvantage you know and then lo and behold he cut to the east coast this inventor named Samuel Cole to come up in the in the early 1830s with a prototype of a it was a it was a really ingenious little pistol it was a 5 shot pistol made in eventually made in Paterson New Jersey the Patterson called up with the same guy so and as great idea right absolutely nobody wanted it mean it was it was like a sidearm for Cavalry but the US didn't have a Cavalry so it didn't really work out for some reason Mirabeau Lamar the president of Texas ordered 180 of these things and they can they way to Texas the five shot Patterson Colts and somehow Jack Hayes in his guys found out about them and they got a hold of them they trained them in and they immediately understood what it meant to admit equalizing the Warfare against the Comanches it meant because now they've they had they had a five-shot 1 interchangeable cylinders now 10:10 shots and each pistol now so and close hand combat the world changed and and not only did that will change but eventually everybody was so stunned by what by this development that the u.s. government ordered a lot of what what ended up being Walker Colt six-shooters for the Mexican war cold becomes one of the richest men in America and basically Jack Hazen Rangers redefined Warfare witches witches and people said this about Jack Hayes and it is broadly speaking true before Jack Hayes you know people came into the West on foot carrying the Kentucky long rifle in after Jack case they came mounted in carrying a six-shooter was that the u.s. soldiers would try to get off their horse to to engage right right because they didn't think you found out that the only people who flat mounted where the Plains Indians I mean you don't nobody thought you if you if you use the horse you would ride to where where can I fight get off the horse and then fight the bite Comanches were fully magic and Rangers were fully mounted and what they what they use the Texas Rangers for in the Mexican War which is they were there was a terrible gorilla problems in these Rangers just went and cleared out these hilarious and nobody had seen this type of warfare before nobody seems kind of ability to fight and move and move mounted and move with these why nobody ever seen these Walker Kelsey's 5 lb hand Cannon six shooter Walker cozy 5 lb hand Cannon six shooters that they had nobody has seen those either and said he's crazy these these Rangers addressed anyway they wanted to you know sometimes with no shirts on Sarah pays and crazy hats and they were just the Rangers through everybody was scared to death in it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I mean who has the ultimate influence in whether or not there is military action and how long that military action goes on for right like is Bernie Sanders and why these people and Tulsi gabbard a lot of people that are running for president say that if they got one things you would do to stop these intervention interventionist Foreign Wars and the World Police Wars that we just go on in invading other people's lives that we would stop doing that I think that's great billy gets to say like who gets to say whether or not we like who talks to Trump and says let's just keep rolling into this place what's wrong isn't freaking problem over there Isis Isis building up with bumfuk eyes people who has a real ear I mean is it is it generals mean does is there any industry influence at all from weapons Industries or from people who have deals with them or if that's what Eisenhower warned about when he left office you heard that right yeah that is one of the craziest speeches a president has ever said Trump says you do have a military industrial complex they do like War don't kid yourself he says you do have a military industrial complex they do like War you know in Syria with the caliphate so I wipe out 100% of the caliphate that doesn't mean you're not going to have these crazy people going around blowing up stores and blowing up things these are seriously ill people but I wiped out 100% of the caliphate I said I want to bring our troops back home the place went crazy they want to keep you have a problem here in Washington they never want to leave I said you know what I'll do I'll leave a couple hundred soldiers behind but if it was up to them they bring thousands of soldiers in someday people explain it but you do have a group and they call it the military-industrial complex they never want to leave they always want to fight no I didn't want to fight but you do have situations like a Ron you can't let them have nuclear weapons you just can't let that happen that goes on bro like nobody ever talks about I feel like it's like we've been pretty much anti you know we haven't been swayed into his many wars is I feel like we would have been who know man who knows me maybe yes maybe no maybe we're closer to war because of him who the f*** knows Trump Administration considers fourteen thousand more troops for the Middle Eastern last week but he still I got some deployment you know who knows man maybe they know things to you know the thing about talking to people are Jocko willink and you know my friend Andy Stumpf and other other folks that have been over there like they'll they'll tell you there's there's sometimes where things build up and radicals can cities and things get really ugly and then they have to have some sort of military intervention or these people keep growing and they know they don't that's the other thing that people aren't talking about like in Afghanistan particular the Afghan he's are working with the soldiers against these terrorist organizations like there's ice candies that are helping us soldiers not like all of the u.s. against all of dentist and now it's that their combined against Isis the it's just the whole thing is so crazy that there's these groups these organizations that are like characters in a James Bond movie or in comic book right like thing about like Isis or something like Isis that's like it if you had a crazy movie about people that you know had a great leaders a spiritual guy lived in the mountains and you know what that's what I mean is like a character who used to work for the for the good guys names switched over to the bad guys suck someone in the Batman movie you know about extreme the religion is and how devoted people are and you can't question any of it most extreme in that regard where it doesn't doesn't allow any questioning of it and then you know people can't understand that some people practice it the same way some people practice Christianity or some people practice other things they only they only believe or take part in the positive good parts of the religion so there's a lot of people that are Muslims that are great people that really kind really well-educated wonderful thoughtful people that don't have nothing to do with terrorists and when is some sort of terrorist activity it makes them feel bad that they're getting lumped in with someone is doing horrific things these people that you know end up committing these extreme religions I feel like we should be dropping like soccer balls a Nintendo switches from airplanes to get them things to do so they're stuck even something if you're stuck in the place that's got a very rigid religious ideology and radical and women right places that are getting bombed by the US for f****** robots planes are flying overhead they're gonna down wedding parties accidentally killing people me that happens pretty comment right so you're making more radicals cuz I'm his people who lost her family members to some robot flying in the sky to some kid is acting you know he's got an Xbox controller his hand and shooting missiles you know they say those guys who are those Pilots they suffer PTSD as well those Pilots are weird that buy that s*** you know imagine being a drone pilot and you're watching something that you kind of know what's happening you definitely know what's happening right you were your controller that you see it but when you hit that button you watch those missiles to shoot down Hellfire missile to comb Hellfire 2 it's crazy shoot down into these camps shoot down and said he's motorcades but you know what you just did and most likely you're killing 8 out of 10 of those people are innocent I love the fact that a drone does it or like a soldier and Mike hate Tony you got to stop killing his and people say I'm a f****** kill up okay he sent me after those bad guys there's a lot of babies around I had a f****** let him know you ain't going to stop me from getting that bad guy there's no way we put you in jail yeah but if you have an Xbox controller and you shoot and hellfire missiles into a f****** school because you think that there's a terrorist in like what and you know they set him up sometimes too they give bad advice or bad Intel try to get someone to blow up a school or get someone to blow up wedding party like there's a lot of fuckry involved in anything you're doing like that with a know that if you do kill people it's actually bad press it's bad for you Public public perception goes the other way or bad Intel try to get someone to blow up a school or get someone to blow up wedding party like there's a lot of fuckary involved in anything you're doing like that with a know that if you do kill people it's actually bad press it's bad for you Public public perception goes the other way</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I just offering for the day it is named Sam Sam Quinn s see-gwun you wrote this book Empire of the summer Moon It's f****** amazing man it's about the Comanches and it's about the war they had with like through Texas and Oklahoma and went on forever like the last holdout against the American settlers in advance against the soldiers the Comanches were the last holdouts they were the last like truly wild tribe and they were running the planes for like hundreds and hundreds of years of horses and s*** but here's the thing man this move this book it's taken place in the mid 1800 to the late eighteen hundreds which is like that's so recently it's so recent the giant rock from Egypt came over in 1888 yes anomatic Stone Age life everything was leather and sinew and buffalo tendons that use to make their bows in their bowstrings they made their own bows and arrows at a wood and arrowheads are made out of Flint they would chipaway expertly and they would run around following Buffalo and just shooting with bows and arrows and spearmint run him off cliff they would run them off cliff stampedes there to get to the bottom and there was sometimes so many please down the bottom of these Buffalo jumps that the rotting would cause combustion and they would blow up they would explode and Catch Fire just because there's hundreds and hundreds of dead rotting buffalo on top of each other cuz they can't eat that many like stay if you have a tribunal 250 people and you kill a thousand Buffalo like how many of those are going to eat you can't really eat all of them so they would just let them sit there and they would literally start massive wildfires cuz it would burst into flames I saw bison when I was driving from Salt Lake City to some other gigs I should be clear I don't think they started Buffalo fire the fires of the dead bodies I don't know if it was like s*** to burn outside of their it must be that right but the they have these areas that we called buffalo jumps where they were just circle on this Pond Circle on the side and you realize our call my God this is a cliff you try to hit the brakes there's a thousand fat Fox behind you pushing you off the cliff imagine being the first Buffalo to get like really close to like run how to declare for the beast on Earth the dumbest elephants are smart right buffaloes are so dumb they're just run it by no disrespect but they talk in the book about how they would shoot Buffalo and that like everybody had the stain for a dumb the Buffalo work I think probably made it easy for them to almost wiped them out to the point of Extinction but if you shoot Buffalo one goes down and the other ones look and they go right back to eating and then another one goes down and then look and then go back to eating like you have to literally go out they were saying and yell at them to get them to move that's the only way you got him away from the ones you shot cuz you wanted to eat the ones you shot so when the ones went down to be like one of my friends died so do you know you were going to say that God had a plan to provide people with the perfect animal for hunting so they wouldn't want you to be eating healthy so I'm going to give you millions of this f****** enormous animal doesn't move when you shoot its friends literally feel the planes with these things because people were just such cuntz that they killed them all people are so gross cuz the Buffaloes are so easy to count that you just kill them all they killed able to have mountains of Bones man there's a buffalo job because he has a bone bonfire shelters was called because all that black and it apparently was fires from the Buffaloes hitting and burst into flames and some of those Buffalo Jump they say to this day you can find arrowheads if you go wandering around the area cuz he knows so populated by Native Americans at the time but the Comanches dude I can't this is Buffalo Jump in Montana but a lot of it was the Comanches which is in this book why does book takes place in Texas to f****** amazing dude and so scary this is Buffalo down in the Rock scene of a series of prehistoric Buffalo jumps Native American hunting Hunters ingeniously stampeded herds of Bison over the edge of a cliff overhanging the shelter in anaerobic candy that empties into the Rio Grande near Langtry Texas the Bisons plunge to their deaths on a rock pile at the opening of the shelter and there are starkly documented accounts of Northern Plains Indian groups using this effective if indiscriminate technique of killing bison we also have to remember back then there was so many bison that if they thought they killed a couple extra thousand didn't give a f*** they were everywhere there's so many of them and here's what happened because people got smallpox and it killed like 94 Native American population so when the Europeans came over in the 1500 and then whatever was when Cortez came over here where was I was at the 1500 anyway when those guys came over and brought smallpox it just wiped out like most of the population so the Buffalo who really their major Predator with people especially Native Americans especially once they figured out how to ride horses but now I was died until the Buffalo went ham bucked up a storm and then there was millions of them is the author Dan Flores Rosas whole paper that he wrote on it was it called Bison ecology bison diplomacy I think it's called something along those lines but it's crazy this if you hear about the fate of the Bison in the North American bass XD most iconic animal when you really think about the old west there was one animal you think about the old west maybe be horses the more likely be a bison hello Buffalo the City of Buffalo the question cuz a bison is not technically the same as a buffalo cuz those people don't move when they should too squirrel in literally every state pretty much people are gross then we kill everything yeah what's the difference is contrave the song Buffalo did not run in American West they are indigenous to South Asia and Africa Asian water buffalo those are the ones they get that are in Australia they brought those over to Australia and do they got a mess over there there's nothing that kills them so they're just all over the place and they destroy those they're so big there's so many of them and they're wild they even have wild domestic cows that grow out of control and the males become like super ferocious but you know I can bowl like Boulders want you riding them but they have a thing in Lost scrubbles and what it is is a domestic cattle like domestic cattle but that went wild like Generations ago many many generations ago so now they're just wild animals that happened have enormous f****** horns and weigh 2,000 pounds and freaked out of the sea people so they see people if your due to close they think your clothes didn't try to kill him they just f*** you up oh f*** that is this as above me is for my friend Adam Greentree he shot one of those but this is crazy he's going to walk up to think he knows Voodoo he put his hand on it and it just dropped yeah and when the real world he would be dead as f*** that thing we just smash him he's a head-high yeah so. Dude you know he wanted marrying the girl that girl that girl with camera now you wild domestic you know he wanted marrying the girl that girl that girl with camera now I feel like I could do have a bowl and then big ass scrub Bulls wild domestic cup</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> welcome to Yoshi again you want to go that one in April yeah come to Brooklyn absolutely so max Holloway bokanowski is very interesting very very very interesting cuz volkanovski is a tank of a man he hasn't phenomenal gas tank he puts people away he puts tremendous pressure on guys but Max always a goat and they have a common volkanovski he be tall do smothered them beaten by decision Max Holloway destroy them Max Max always destroyed although twice and I'll do is another goat mean all those one of the greatest featherweights of all time and and now all those fighting Marlin the Rises first fight at bantamweight people are very concerned that's up you know down one down yeah that's no bueno menu looks like Aldo looks gaunt preparing for 135 there's photos of him wandering around you know what Clues shirt off and stuff when you get a chance it's a wandering around saying you don't hang around and you see what he looks like yeah there is Instagram duty super super skinny so he lost the weight on purpose slowly over a long. Of time instead of just dehydrating the f*** out of himself and dropping down you know from 165 to 135 what he did was drop his body weight pretty significantly he looks quite a bit thinner than he was before so he prepared for it over the Long Haul and got accustomed to being a lighter person if you're going to do that that's the way to do that the difference between dehydrating the s*** out of yourself and just losing weight but even at 1:30 are there I mean a Wonder You Take A Hard Punch To The Head easier to go out maybe but maybe not because he's doing it correctly so he's not going to be dehydrated like TJ Dillashaw was the big sample of where someone goes too far you know when he went down 225 lb he looked like death he looked terrible and Brendan Schaub called saying I bet he took his TJ got busted for EPO I bet he took it cuz he couldn't train I bet he was too exhausted to train and that's pretty much what he said it didn't have any energy it was much harder than they thought physically on and you basically starving to death you're driving down TJ probably getting down to 45 that's rough 35 is rough paste to do it and high school wrestling the thing I remember the most is having trouble not swallowing the toothpaste and then water in my mouth while brushing my teeth I wear those things to you literally you when it hits your tongue in your body naturally wants to try a little dude wants anything it's starts the process itself to TJ's look sick like a Snickers there do you still see a six-pack stomach that's a ridiculous Rampage Raymond Daniels who's the world champion kickboxer Louie Anderson in the middle there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> people think of you better if all fights for 5 rounds like a like a world kickboxing fight guys are just also fight harder they would just go after each other for five rounds it would definitely be more entertaining I wonder man you know it's like you want to see a good fight but do you want to see guys sort of pace themselves to try to fight 12 rounds or do you want to see guys go ham for 6 rounds like what's better you know the best argument that I ever heard about about fights is the one where fraza hobby was talking about the other day and I agree with him 100% like why you have a time limit just like start the fight like we'll see what happens like let people figure out when the when did expand their energy like why is your brakes while your brakes you should I mean if if we had it like the early days the UFC then you would really understand all the nuances of, that you really can't Sprint cuz if you give you hurt someone you don't take them out you're going to get exhausted you blew all your energy out in the fight goes on forever it's it goes on until somebody wins that's when you really find out what fighting is but if you going to have boxing boxing those rounds like 3 minutes 3 minute rounds is with just your hands you can get a lot of action in there she made that up 256 rounds but I don't know it's nothing wrong is also great thing seeing someone slowly figure somebody out or five six rounds and then start working on the 7th 8th 9th and 10th and get a knockout in the 11th or something like that that's what it's always interesting to see someone break someone's style down figure them out impose their will and also see their conditioning as the fight goes on their Superior conditioning play out there's some guys just f****** don't get tired man those are the ones that I love especially in UFC Nate Colby ioana these people was a big one that's a big one that's a big one with two guys with enormous gas tanks what a fascinating fact that is to me because people wanted to attend Kobe can't fight everything in their reasonable rational mind is so crazy play about that it's ridiculous mean while still in denial than they would be there in less than out and they would be it's real problem he's a real problem because that's style of s*** talking is infuriating and you can't say I'll goddamn thing to him cuz he's in a character so if he pisses you off you say something back to him yeah I want you to suck Trump's dick you like I would say whatever you want Colby gets it man was he gets it he's full Rick old school Ric Flair with a new style twist and it's reason real Spider-Man real fighter is absolutely one of the best welterweights in the world and this is a very very close fight but tomorrow is mine is he's a tank of a man he's spectacular athlete he's got big Power I mean he only has I think a couple Knockouts in his career but it's because he's learned how to kickbox after he learned how to wrestling Zone Elite wrestler but he does put people wet and he hurt Tyron Woodley and he beat him standing and Tyron is a friend I don't think Tyron was at his best in that fine I think there was some issues the time and had but it doesn't take anything away from Usman it responds been running through competition me as one lost in his career 15 wins and then we talked about the loss of the podcast you just got caught a rear naked choke tapped and stake it happens didn't know Jujitsu that wall but as an elite wrestler whose transitioned to become a world-class mixed martial arts fighter you don't get much better he's he was scared he was scary rather everybody was scared of nobody wanted to fight him everybody was ducking him for the what you what you never heard anybody call alqamar was when we was running through competition everybody was like you know what now I think he's just he's just so you think you really get so many aspects of the basic part of this sport write endurance learn train and be entertaining no I love it it is God damn hilarious there's photos of him to the Press, orange suit brohi Isley that it looks like it cost less than the blue suit I didn't think that was possible was going to put this guy mark my words when this guy is done fighting he will be a huge pro wrestling star f****** huge and he might do it quick how about that if he wins if that guy wins and maybe he fights Mazda doll made fights one more time he goes right in the pro wrestling anymore and what's crazy is that I've been pitching we do a wrestling podcast The Comedy Store and I've been pitching for years now and I've been pitching for years that the WWE is missing out on having this pro-trump super bad guy character and then Kobe comes out of nowhere and does it in real life in the UFC record-setting performance against Robbie Lawler 500 some punches landed. He mostly beat him standing on it was mostly stand-up fight and he is the guy that you thought it was a wrestler and Robbie's the elite Strikers a former world champion and Kobe ran him over was even close fight and all this promo stuff that he does how good he is it that it's cuz it's he wants to be it's cuz he's a learner he came and saw me perform at the at the Improv in in floor West Palm Beach and afterwards we were in The Green Room he's like you know I learned a lot about timing and beats from watching you up there tonight and you know he has openly now said we talked about on the podcast be staying at now dude on the Candace Owens Show he's like they're going to cut him they're going to cut and they told him that his style wasn't fan-friendly and so he beats Damien my in Brazil and cause of a bunch of filthy animals everybody goes crazy and they're like oh hold on a second we might have something here so he talked about in jeopardy he was just a really tough guy had a great gas tank who I knew from my friend cam Hanes he trains with Cam hands right so just imagine the kind of gas tank this m*********** must have you do anything with campaigns you have to have a crazy gas tank well that's the scary thing about him right it's almost like again it's like a pro wrestling character already it's like oh you don't know but even if it if you don't if you don't somehow find a way to finish it your dog in rounds 4 and 5 now it's always going to be Championship rounds now with this guy damn you're going to be stuck in there with him if you can't take him out in one two or three and you can't maintain that pace if you try to take him out you emptied your gas tank he never emptied his gas tank and the thing is about his style this thing that he's doing. But his promotion Style with the cheap suits in the f****** book you think it's a joke yeah but then you watch his fights if you didn't have any information about him and his character and you just watch his fights but f*** man's Sky driven his guys f****** driven but then you adding to that this character and everybody's pretending you know that all that guy's a joke I joke. Joke he's running over everybody and everybody it's because you don't like Trump and this is like it's a genius thing to attach himself to Trump right and what's interesting is like even Fighters that maybe if paid more dues and her maybe your arm or respected like if you put them all at the table like when we were when you were backstage at MSG in the Rock there and Dana's got new BMF belt and all this stuff happening they were doing that press conference for this one Max Holloway's on one end and they have these guys on another and being backstage sometimes as a blessing cuz you can hear things that maybe you would notice if you're out front right and the wars and the cheers in the hoopla and everything was every time he talked to we had a good time to sit there watching from the sidelines he's Grace has a master class and promotion adaptation be adapted you created this character and this character is it's so obviously character but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter made so I'm he's not wearing that suit on purpose like I thinks it's good looking though he's trying to be a dork. He's trying to be a pro Trump dork like if I was Trump I'd be a little annoyed going Colby on Instagram right now the best videos with the girls or you just comes out of his hands on there but a loser high-level pro wrestling like like promos so you should look at this McGregor asked right I still don't think it works as well as a guy that has a never-ending gas tank never in the gas tank and and can take a tremendous shock to he's a nightmare for everybody in the division Colby Covington is a f****** nightmare because he seems like he's playing he's doing these promos with all these girls in bikinis so f****** Reid and Donald Trump Junior's book he's making it seem like he's a goof and don't notice along the way that this guy stomping world-class Fighters I mean stomping them he's f****** amazing when he's done is it's like a master class and promotion for all the young Fighters coming up I don't necessarily think everybody should do what he's doing and you know but if I was in if I was in his cap one of his friends I would for sure be cheering it on I think it's hilarious it's hilarious and what is madam everybody goes two ways right like even the people that are mad at him or still sort of laughing and you can usually catch them laughing while booing in-between booing orange suit is the one that likes right Jeff Daniels or Jim Carrey one of them had almost close enough but they're gross that's the point like he's doing it on purpose he's got money he's a f****** he's fighting for the title he's made money right just got that suit in the I was just the recent one the blue one weapon is only get the blue one here's the thing that the end of day is a nightmare for every f****** living human being is 170 lb a guy that I thought presented a bunch of unique challenges I would say Colby because Colby has a great wrestling pedigree fantastic takedown defense he can wrestle is a Sophos cardio's NeverEnding we saw the Robbie Lawler fight he put the pressure on you lands ridiculous trash can standing there against one of the elite Strikers ever in the welterweight Division and Robbie Lawler so like forget all the Trump b******* forget all the the character b******* and he almost did she have a name for that guy Joy Division Robbie Lawler so like forget all the Trump b******* forget all the the character bullshiting you almost did she have a name for that guy that but that's put that aside just stylistically stylistically it's one of the best matchups you're ever going to find for Eastmont</div>

One of those areas and you it's so weird that's the most reality reality TV because it's not planned like you know for sure they're not talking to the perps and saying beforehand okay this is what I want you to I want you to pretend that you're taking off and we follow you and then you hit the brakes just playing to say that you would never know you never get out cream to do that correctly wear wouldn't look you know I would look fake but these guys when you know they're getting arrested you see the glass you look in the Rye you seem confused and stupid you see him say crazyshit you see him get pushed against the car seemed scream at their old lady with their shirt off you see them these are real people that's reality TV and might be the only reality TV there really is because everything else everyone so painfully aware of the cameras are the only thing that sucks about the cops Bad actors feels like well you know we just doing our best here to keep the community safely relax bro stop it though some of those guys are already getting famous do what we talked about last round from Bigfoot he sent me an e-mail said he was working with the television channel to that not to be named and had a problem again with him trying to fix s*** and fake things lot of these shows that you're watching some producers faked stuff that happened with me and show that was on I had to get furious at this production date something was on I was so mad when I found out the cheaters wasn't real that they set up cheaters cheaters Joey Greco stabbed cuz he got stabbed that's what ended that show fake it says staged what does that mean would you let someone stab you on television like how much money would they have to that's dangerous you get stabbed man you could die I don't think they stabbed him I think they had red red anchor red paint or fake blood really just clench Up Inside Edition reported according to a paid actor that was a fake act he was paid $400 to act out on the show Exact Staffing I thought I had a friend of mine back in New York that used to do those shows that load like Jenny Jones and s*** like that or you know those shows with Phil Donahue like for a guy who's been secretly having an affair with his brother's wife for the last year you know anybody like what a coincidence I've been secretly having an affair with my brother's wife oh my God are you free on Tuesday at yep and then they bring them in and then we go do that no call back like we're looking for a guy who pretended to be a police officer and would arrest people do you know anybody like that I used to be a cop run a scenario by him and he would say that was in the everyone knew what was what was going on and so they were all covered right he lied to them they didn't know and so he would show up and do this goofy f****** show anyone axa.com a couple different ones yes Springer everyone thought you know Springer was real to until you it got just obnoxious they kept like running out of crazy things to do they they would have said that by the end they had such bad actors people are like laughing at themselves and stuff and some of those shows were great though some of those moments on those shows Billy watching the daytime Jim Jim of an episode one of those of Maury Povich's you are not the father and the guys dancing and all crazy the best one of my favorite ones I remember which it was but I was watching with Khandi Alexander we're in my dressing-room when we're doing Newsradio we just bored in between scenes we're watching TV remember to return the day for watching the show and this girl has a sec real s***** outfit on and she's got all his attitude and she's tell you no telling everybody she's a s*** and y'all just jealous you know when this one dude gets up and was like one of the most calm dismantling of a of a person I ever saw guy do the guy got up and again I don't think he's an actor I don't think he planned this he goes see you can pull that off but it's all about your attitude he goes if you had some Pizzazz you can pull that off but your attitude stank and that make you look nasty and look nasty it was one of those moments where oh she has a sucker face like she's got hit with a f****** Mike Tyson right hand like Deontay Wilder just bomb daughter like what those moments did you get those moments every now and then if you watch a religious show you'll get one of those moments sometimes every now and then. Just say something so ridiculous like what the f*** did you say everybody that would walk off with always walk off on Morita like that green room in the back right down the hallway tapping to rhythmic sometimes at the end like everybody that would walk off would always walk off on Maury to like that green room in the back right down the hallway there's clearly into the camera setup for Access for there and everything would have been more random if they stormed off in another Direction sometime so the more believable</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> 100% watched on the plane the other day the Dick Cheney movie with haven't heard great though you must watch with Christian Bale Real in this movie experience with you know politics but he's really just a business owner so working looks like he's real fat guy saw that move and go find I thought you got fat huh he went for it he really went for it man it's so good you really I mean it really exposes that part of things how close you can he's he wants you know he's running a massive business that makes military stuff so us having to do stuff benefits them tremendously it's one of the most transparent scams that's legal in the history of the world think about how crazy everybody's going on about this Trump call to the Ukraine and what whether or not there was enough to impeach him and all this madness people going crazy about this right this is like that this is the topic and I've heard many Democrats go see there's nothing here folks you got to back off this is not enough to take guy out of office the Republicans and everything about for this like you guys are you're making a big mistake here now think imagine a guy who's the vice president of the United States who is also a guy who used to be the CEO of Halliburton then this guy decides to go to war under false pretenses they make up some s*** about weapons of mass destruction they blow this f****** place to Smithereens and then Halliburton gets no-bid contract me this wasn't someone saying I can do it for 3 billion I can do it for 2.7 it wasn't any of that it was a no-bid contract for billions how to repair the places they blow up and he's making money off of it it's crazy I think for the first year or something like that I want to know when Dick Cheney was actually making money off of Halliburton I think he had abandoned his position or give up his stocks or something but it was awhile it was it was it was one of those things where you like you just left and then the company contracts in the billions am I stupid right now are you allowed to do this on television in front of everybody in the movie I'll and you know the movie also shows how much of the presidency year he really had President George W needed him to win it you needed him to run with him to get the you know the real like Republican votes at the time he for sure for sure no one else was you know could do what he could do he deleted them he was deeply deeply deeply connected but it was also Bushton why don't you go ahead and let's at least in the movie that's the deal that they made basically she's like please Bush someone unbelievable hits what's his name Sam Rockwell GMC the moon move movie Just Moon there it is you see the two Billboards. Well looks like Bush Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld of course he does. He's like the control Rumsfeld conspiracy theories that you probably don't know it's going to blow your mind to do it the day before 9/11 the day before the attacks Rumsfeld gave a press conference or talked about trillions of dollars missing the day then a plane slammed into the very part of the building where they were doing the accounting blows up building the Pentagon blows up a wall Rumsfeld was where was it the White House lawn listen to this where he says 3 trillion dollars and missing receipts talks about his adversary what are you looking at Google it I don't even do that just go through YouTube I know you have to see it cuz you hear of saying you like what the f*** did he just say point three trillion dollars in transactions somebody told you that literally like right before 9/11 happened they said they couldn't track 2.3 trillion dollars you know that didn't happen that did not happen but it did happen what the f*** yeah so think about what Kennedy said ya think about what you saw when you said that Vice movie where Dick Cheney who is the CEO of Halliburton becomes vice president and gets billions of dollars in no-bid contracts now think about we just saw with Donald Rumsfeld saying they couldn't find 2.3 trillion dollars oh my God what is true if the it was the accounting office cuz this is what I loved I love to say it cuz it sounds good let's make sure it's true that that part blew up but either way that he did say that and then they did get hit by a plane a couple of days later some believable what country is 2.3 million million is a billion thousand billion trillion and its 999 billion billion trillion 999 billion x 2 billion trillion a couple more billions know it's so stupid it's a hundred thousand and then a million and then 10 of those is a billion right yeah or a hundred of those a hundred millions of billions a hundred so it's a 100 trillion another three zeros another three zeros yeah how would you say that would you say that's like how big it looks right now so that's a billion that's a trillion or billion is referred to as a million million million million but how many is a trillion a billion Millions the billion thousand million a million Millions 2.3 million Millions on everybody's talking about it ever that didn't come up all the time people that it was going towards the White House or whatever and walk out of here in British terms British English which is not American English the word billion referred exclusively to a million Millions however it is no longer common and the word is now used to mean 1,000 million so if anybody is in another country that's why it seems like the whole country could have revolted like I mean that's what what did you do with our tax money that's our money right but that's a way to steal 2.3 trillion if you if you if you stole 2.3 trillion want to cover it up start a war I mean boom immediately everybody's freaking out they can't believe what's going on that's what the tinfoil-hat Brigade would say what is this a oh my God this is recent 21 trillion in unauthorised government spending defense department to conduct first-ever audit other never audited before why would they audit they just get free money then not like a regular company right to defense department all your company where I like all the Stockholm is going hey f******* what are you doing I got you know hundred thousand shares your stupid f****** companies CEOs running into the ground now they don't even have to audit you know I'm 21 trillion whenever whenever I don't even know if that is a thousand million billion or something 21 whatever come on I am saying that when things happen and disasters take place people capitalize on those disasters and if it's possible that someone was going to set something up some sort of an attack and they're going to do it because they were in the process of stealing something or was going to steal something you would have to be a lot Philly wait a minute where they going to do how much money would it be worth it to start a war 2.3 trillion MIP the number how much would it cost to start a war if you're evil anyway would you start a war for a hundred million man I can't spread that thin enough to know I got a lot of Palms start a war by we start no more what's going on I guess how much that number you got to do, guess ever published the thing I just found was just going off of congressional budget office reported report published in October 2007 Warwick stop at weigh more cheese this is a tough one trillion dollars wow that's a lot a lot I'm going to go with 100 billion conveniently planned on spending 2.4 trillion dollars how to say a very convenient number after we lost 2.3 but books and they just have stick figures with googly eyes it's not but it is right like if your if you are someone that makes weapons and you have a huge contract with defense department and you have the ear of the defense department and you know you guys play golf shirt and dress up like Druids and burning Effigy worship Molech towel God and start talking and you said hey man what we going to do worship moloch the owl God and start talking and you said hey man what we going to do to keep his f****** I got these tanks are American they are a mother f***** Want to Be Right Time Out you know I got a deal for you let me just walk around playing

		<div class="paragraph"> what is a mess and not in that sounds like Wildlife wise cuz it's so much so many things that are invasive in this last time we were there for the first time I actually went to a sanctuary one of those places and Jeremiah and Joel and we had a blast man there are some crazy animals down there we held a a koala bear took a picture with a koala let me tell you that they feel like the American version of that animal seems like so cute and like soft and Light Danimal what we think of koalas and we went we went to see if it was Tiny size that I thought it would be three bowling balls it's just so heavy and it's a real bear and are attached to it because this f****** thing they have to feed these things eucalyptus leaves the entire types all these well with Aiden with that what I didn't know is that that's all it needs and that's all it does like the second this thing is done with with one of the eucalyptus leaves they have two handed another one because you can feel its energy change turns its head and it gets like a f****** little bit of a look like they'd these things ready to f*** you up you have to just keep feeding us drug addicts on an IV drip that are starting to feel pain the second they don't have the drip of course like how much nutrition is a goddamn eucalyptus Leaf they probably have to eat them down to stuff themselves with it and are solid as a rock so think about all the things must you know oh my God I realized the true power of an what we consider an actual bear oh my God it's like that thing is this big right and it felt like that was that strong and sturdy in their hands and everything you feel everything and makes it to say it's a ball of muscle would be a tremendous understatement and honest to God man I thought we were going to go take pictures with these koalas cuz they have a little girl zookeepers and they seem super comfortable and they're giggling and happy and everything but it ended up being a serious situation I was scared I was Jeremiah cat making fun of me because of how scared I was when I got him good that she's like you want to take a group picture with all of you in the Babbling now that wasn't for you yeah yeah it's right now because of a gigantic wildfire in Australia they become functionally extinct which means that 80% of their range has been destroyed by wildfire that's good cuz it's taking my bike it is like f****** Tony f*** you Tony I ready to bite you bro look around each other a little weird can't tell there is this the final result Jeremiah not to break off because I think 80% of their range is bendy Droid and you know you're talking about the only places where they can live and breed and there's a giant population of them claws on front and they stink but they need our help but what it say this is one CNET Google koalas are functionally extinct extinct too by the way I was obsessed with the smell of eucalyptus I probably got caught up in some scientific clickertale illnesses they may be as of May so that people ever had it but it was really recent where are these ones coming from these are you looking at older ones from may see how everything's from urine * 4 turn the most most of her saying no koalas aren't functionally extinct I guess he has his after the bushfires in overstated claims okay yeah so that's what you got to wonder about today many time you read an art like I didn't even read it right I just read the that had two heading that's what they that's how they're getting you with everything that's clickbait and it seems like they have to do that but do you have a great article but it doesn't she had line how much you have to come up with something that's almost a lie you have to get their attention you have to at least give them the little bit that might they article might not even be about you just have to get them to click like a Salesman or a sales job or was losing weight is his wife got him to go on the show when he's losing all this waiting has to do all these exercising s*** and while they were there they were worried that they're going to have to evacuate cuz he's a giant fires are coming the way of Macau often is Australia on fire place is on fire that's a huge place would not that many people write that is dude that is insane that's the same we're looking at most of Manhattan and then a giant chunk of New York State a giant chunk of Pennsylvania it looks like New Jersey's completely engulfed that's nuts that's a huge patch and allowed into the ocean as well that's the thing like if you look at it that if you pulled way back at the entire continent and looked at that little square it wouldn't look as wow look at that again Pittsburgh to Cleveland in a go go way back go go no-go way small so you can see like the whole continent so that's how you got to think of Australia so that's Australia looks at it how many wondering if you died this way I can be the future vacations writerly Intolerable Act

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we just bought in the US some years back decades before there's some some kettlebells were used by some old-time strongman like Zeke line for example and there's a company named Milo no relations to the magazine the guy started carrying oil cap on his shoulders and he would carry the calf everyday so the cap would grow and eventually I became very strong so that's why that name is present in in the strength game start back then today it is it just wanted to find his Publications on strength training mostly Nish things again like gripping then you can keep lifting it absolutely typical training plan that people sound in S5 phones to my bench press today I'm going to do this every week and that by Christmas I'll be the world champion and I just doesn't work so the rate of adaptation is size does your body just cannot do that and it's cyclical nature we have to do put it in the terms you have to after you carry the cat for a while it grows you have backup to a wider calf and start start building up again why we do not know exactly so for some reason. Unidirectional adaptation just in one of them we're getting stronger at the bench press or what have you were carrying the calf he just cannot proceed indefinitely there's some 40 give some endocrine mechanisms some genetic mechanisms we do not know that but tactically would do have tricks trade to be that dork around that and there's a number of ways of doing that the oldest way of doing that and it's very smart still very smart for a lot of people they would call this I think possibly constant weight training or something like that has described it as step loading so let's look at your typical dinner somebody in the gym and for the person starts lifting whatever wait for whatever wraps and the next week let's say next week he has five pounds and he does it again he does it again while the Soviets figured out it is much better for him to stay at the same way for several weeks and then make it bigger jump so what you're doing pretty much as you are be making that a patient's more stable and it just happened in the shelter levels memories become stronger and so on but Old-Timers just they would say that you are silly Define the games so the way that many Old-Timers trained is there we just stay the same weight and the staying with the same weight for a long time in the beginning is challenging money becomes kind of comfortable that becomes homeless easy and never jump up so that just one way of doing it and today is not unprecedented either if you look at call Marie's gymnastics coach used that was gymnast very common I used that tactic with my the latest edition of my kettlebell simple and Sinister because it's much more reliable than just Progressive overload and also because psychologically first of all tweets out the impatient people so you were told to stay with the same load for a while some people out of money cuz I'll forget it I cannot do that well I do people for more stuff anyway and second so you're staying with this wait for these raps for sometime in the beginning they challenge you and then sometimes goes by and suddenly they don't anymore so we just a very much was a very clear clear sense of accomplishment so this is gold step loading or using the old timers Old Timers terminology the constant weight training if you look at the other ways of in progress so another approaches go to cycling and cycling so the one that I just described that would really be if we could artificially stop the growth of the calf like okay stop growing for a while which we can but this cycling this is where I mention earlier this is where you go back to a lighter cap so they classic American powerlifting training template this is cycling Solis history of cycling is very interesting what cycling is cycling is in the simplest possible terms you take 12 weeks you started light weights and that was the predominant strength training system in the 70s and the 80s and that was the strength system behind the dominant American powerlifting to soak lifters like Eddie cone for Kawaski lifters Donna Austin who is Lamar Gant whose deadlift records still stand decades after the use this classic cycling so they classic cycling you start with the moderate moderately challenging load then you keep proceeding go heavier and heavier and heavier than you can beat then you start over and to give you to give you a very simple tactic that's something that your listeners can use in their training whether they follow the cycling format where they do something else is that Russian scientist discovery that your endocrine system pretty much can take up to two weeks out of four of heavy loading that's just the way it is there are some exceptions if you but forget exceptions classic powerlifting Cycles by Gallagher so for 4 weeks you do sets of 8 4 weeks as a 5-4 weeks SO3 and in week one you start out with a Wade that's comfortable and weak to moderately challenging and week 3 you hit your repeat your previous PR for this wraps and a week for you such a new PR and then you jumped in neck strap down so you see in this particular template you have two weeks to hard reset training out of the month and that's just one of the many ways of doing that for me. I got distracted by what we want to do about the history of cycling so Bill star whose name in the game he was a former top weightlifter later on author the strongest shall survive he is book on strength training for football remains one of the best strength training books that American lifters started getting a whiff of some Russian Paradise programs it was. Ization fertilization the simplest terms is planning your training according to certain principles to ended beak perform that's just the really, 50,000 level 50000 foot definition and they did not have their full full information by was done so they just decided to do exactly that and that was very successful very successful purchase transferring he does not necessarily work for everybody there are some reasons for that this was shown on the platform and finally so first we discussed step cycling stopped loading which is concentrating second we discussed wave cycling which is just cycling right wave loading and third one would be the variable loading and variable loadings it is extremely unique it's on like something else so here is a variable loading Works in variable holding you have certain load parameters like for example you will know that your average training weights will be 75% of your maximum you will know that you will perform for example 300 squats per month or whatever so these numbers were arrived at experimentally over decades and what variable loading does as opposed to the tradition Memphis traditional Progressive overload is that the jump in volume for example from one training unit to another one day one week one month and so on it's at least 20% so the jumps really high really high the variable loading was developed by we argued that in nature most changes are discrete they're not gradual they're discreet so whatever it whatever adapt adaptation take place in your body the same thing whatever happens with many physical process chemical processes and so on so he concluded that training has to be either variable so you understand what I mean that it's a 20% minimal change week-old that DeltaPoint principal I mean it's constantly going up this is not a possible he goes up and down it just keeps flashing so if we use if we go back to the traditional cycling is an example the traditional cycling so it's a linear build up back up a little linear build up back up a little in contrast variable overload it's it's going crazy this is Al entertaining experience strength coaches and especially people with some sort of a bad ground in mathematics they're able to dissect and analyze training class from other coaches you can look it up line you can take an experienced powerlifting coach show him a program from another coach and she'll be able to tell work or not work for and so on and cannot figure out figure out what time to do dread there so there's a very clear pattern variable over looks like a photograph clear variable overload if you start analyzing the pattern look in the program so for example by Olympic weightlifting and directly applied it to so he's blind side made their way to the west and some letters using a very successfully but whenever you try to read this plan and try to make any sense with that he just drives you crazy because you see like okay he was a strain he was a pattern is going right here and he's gone so if traditional cycling's likely the variable overload makes me think of remember in Bueller's Day Off where the kid is looking at show house painting and you know want to use their oldest daughter there so when you step away you see something you start getting closer just a whole bunch of dots it just disappears so what's the story behind that so the stories this method Olympic weightlifting method was developed over several decades by number coaches bursitis is a very much, Maria Bamford so but I'll be off as one for sure did the bed you sound like a number of others and it was a very bitey before a limit on how how successful this method was you can look up the world that weightlifting records in Olympic weightlifting records if you do people realize that the international weightlifting Federation has changed weight classes at two or three times since the 80s and the reason they did that is to erase the drug the record set by the drug taking off please back then of course you are very happy that as soon as they changed the weight classes after stop taking drugs if you look at these records kilo per kilo pound for pound and if you charged them compare them to what they did then two other do today you will find it while they did catch up in a few weight classes in about half these classes the records from the 80s still stand so for example what unicorn opinion did in 1980 at 82 kilos he totaled Chronicles clean and jerk that's never been done before and you was a wiry guy who won't even take him for a lifter just amazing so Bristol the system Still Remains if we're just stick a very large big picture fifty thousand foot look at strength they're great many ways of getting strong some of them very good very bad but historically lifting Sports the two systems that have been are the Civic weight lifting system and the American classic powerlifting system from the 70s and 80s okay that was kind of a long detour to before tell you why the stuff that they figured out back in 1960s why it matters just to say it still is the best so what they did is empirical in endurance going into the cell starting to buy chemistry of the cell in the body taken apart figure out how this works is very helpful very on the other hand when you're dealing with strength that approaches being not really affected so if we talk about muscle muscle training for hypertrophy we still no idea what the hell's going on so we can we know which buttons to push but that just empirical knowledge that's not the understanding of the cell so we really don't first and hypertrophy really know we do not sow and let's I'll be happy to talk about this but if you don't mind let me down this variable overloading the system so what they did even though they also would happen and then they watched how the others performed and the white table top athletes perform and look for patterns and they were very open-minded so they're not thinking like well it's got to be just the heaviest weights will do that where it's got to be the training to failure is going to do that it's not the case so just to give you an example of how enormous that undertaking was so typical strength training studies one six weeks for some subjects you know she's studied the training Lowe's top weightlifters only when they were successful in competition for for Olympic cycles for 16 years and then somebody else due for another cycle and there just an amazing pattern just emerged so friends and I'm going to give you give you the rundown with the patterns are there a certain volumes there's certain optimal intensities so if you follow the variable overload method the optimal intensity so the average intensity would be about 75% of your max weight for most people be probably somewhere like a traps or something could do maybe 10 and you will see that about half of old the lips that you do or about seventy-five 80% now where do all the rest of the other lives come in so there's a normal distribution so you'll find that seventy-five 80% on the top 885 little bit lower you know so the light awaits like 60% on the bottom and they have your ways like 90% in and higher or in the bottle as well so they figured out you just have to do most of your work with these average weights they're not so light 2 respect them but they're not so happy that you have any question about performing lifting incorrectly so and then there's another aspect of intensity is just doing some have your lips very very carefully measured number heavy lifts in addition like 90% or whatever occasionally then they figured out the proper volumes just to give you an idea if you're looking at but saying you might be doing what happened while there's variability but then there's also something else is very interesting he's the optimal number of repetitions with the given weight and this is what hurt people hurt peoples had if you look at it the weights from 7 - 90% the optimal number of repetitions are one-third to two-thirds of your maximum so let me give an example to the reader about the listener let's say that you're lifting a 10 rep max weight so you go all out as hard as possible you can do 10 reps in training you should be doing you should be doing 326 wraps that's it that's that's the window and why is that we have no idea but they experimented with all sorts of rep ranges and they figured out that it directs are too low to give it a wait you don't get stronger the rabbits get to high either the Apple gets hurt or he's thick n***** compromised or he's just unable to perform the optimal volume so pretty much roughly you're looking at doing about half of the refs are capable of that's it and people can argue with her so they want what's the science behind this is no science we don't know the science is purely empirical this particular method is purely empirical it worked for decades is still does and that's one of the ways you can get strong showing summary we have we have three step loading which is Reese Davidson way for a while we're the same raps whatever let me get sudden jump that's the best way to train for beginners usually we have we loading or cycling which is we build up dumb back and build up again and we have variable loading which is almost almost kiotic we're just constantly surprised the body with with rolling at it but who do that within very narrow parameters so this method was purely developed by studying winners and winners is where they final Bible studies were done at every level example coaches in the field with conduct something called about the gagic experiments which is which is a study that's not quite as not quite as scientifically solid but it's still good enough to live Bristow testings out lower level athletes and they will finally take her to a high-level athletes so the things that I'm telling you about they have been universally effective for athlete's above the beginner level and of course there's some subtle changes as you progress there's some subtleties like for instance notice that I said that you have to use some heavy lifts like 90% 95% we have to be very surgical about how many so for instance beginners do none Advanced lifters need to just some but not many intermediate lifters going to the most or heavy weight lifters can do not as many lighter ones can do more so there is some differences at different levels but the principles fundamental shame and these principles apply where the people taking drugs or not they use the Soviet euphemism for that was restoratives and they said this is universal even with those are not the difference were there for the drugs would be he's just that the volume will be higher you'll be able to that's pretty much the difference but the body was to work the same way these principles have they caught on in the United States I mean they've caught on with strong first I know the Ute you implement these and people teach these but is this something that's universally sort of accepted or is it still something that people are cute load of cautiously curious about it's definitely not Universal in part because people don't know about it in part you out to in and this correctly so right now the several the several areas where you would see that is what one obviously buddy Che cose powerlifting programs that have been imported here by these by powerlifters the other is we have the program called plant-strong which is very faithful representation of the Soviet weight lifting system but apply to General strength exercises sing what Wheels to do and this is what we do with with with the military and so on and so forth we have some simple programs very simple programs that are designed using this Delta 20 principal and using this Optima loads that they could just go out and use the nice thing is I'm like Progressive overload cycling if something happens you got a problem here there's some variability so in summary to say no it's not widely known no it's yeah let's fix it and it did make sense and one of these are really like what you're saying about is completing the adaptation with your tendons in your ligaments and all these different things that often times are injured when you are ramping up your weight lifting and you're trying to increase the amount of weight carry so this this principle of maintaining at a similar weight for a long time allow your body to complete that application that makes a lot of sense out of patients need to be stable and it does it's not true just for strength training if you look at enduring such well the other patients in the mitochondria is weld the you can get some acute adaptacion so very short-term like I owe you a bigger whatever guns and six weeks or work faster 400 meter is 6 weeks yes you can do that but these adaptations are transient so it takes time for things to really get get solidified and also if you're more patient with your progression as well you're going to find that your gains are much more stable if you take some time off which is important for anybody you travel you get sick some other thing happens so if you've been training in a matter where you're not forcing yourself your progression as well you're going to find that your gains are much more stable if you take some time off which is important for anybody you travel you get sick some other thing happens so if you've been training in a matter where you're not forcing yourself</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> attack this is one of the very important points in that's so his coaches would make that do not forced adaptation David rigert riggers probably the greatest weightlifter of all times so he's over sixty world records and several weight classes and just unbelievable athlete so he just made a point that do not force and strength development do not force development that's another problem you start it's possible to build muscle fast but it's not given us earlier equality muscle so yes take your time and and this is interesting up Joe this is what Old-Timers understood I'm a fan of books by old-time strongman some of them are just remarkable 25 coldest degrees of strength and it's an awesome book she read this book and if you follow the directions in this book from 1925 you will get parts of your results and foremost pop Fitness and strength programs because people who had some sense some common sense or able to observe what's going on they're not driven by some slogan it's very embraced here in America yeah with the meat ads which are my people that the thing about it is that you think that mental toughness is going to push you past your limits or what your proceed limits are and that that's where the real strength happens that's where the real growth takes place doesn't buy it that's a very valid point for for you mentally not physically mentally but periodically is very important point you have to push the button push the body to the Limit weather in competition with some other manner but for short. Of time and not too often that's very important you know Ronnie Coleman is right yeah yeah Ronnie Coleman who was mr. Olympia just one point time one of the most impressive and spectacular physiques on Earth is now so injured from all of his incredible lips that he was known for lifting enormous enormous amount of weight and I mean I think when they asked him about if we do anything different I think he's had I hope I'm not wrong but I think more than 11 back surgeries over the last few years he's essentially herniated every single disc in his back and a series of back operations has left him walking with crutches and you know it's it's bad but this is the result of this sort of mindset of Champion to know that he was your Barbie I'm going to interrupt you for a second Champion has that mindset on the platform the champion whenever the champion is in the gym he or she is going to approach this as a as a working man pretty much this is the plan this is what I do so you will find that absolutely in in sports you have to be extremely tough and you have to model some of that in training as well but in a very very careful time matter for instance shoplifters stop powerlifters they Max twice a year had the Nationals and of the world's meanwhile they trained hard to push themselves to do everything right but they did not try to squeeze out one extra wrap you just simply will not work it does not work I remember having conversation with Andy Bolton Andy is the first man to dump the thousand pounds just spectacular athlete if you watch Andy pool and competition is just just unbelievable it's a thing of beauty and I just and he was telling me how how some lifters he have seen that we just simply try to hang with others better lifters in the gym and try to repeat exactly what they do and that's what happens after that nothing good happens from that you have to be tough when it's time in the gym you have to do the plan like for example about heavy lifting heavy singles let's same if I'm sure everybody who listens to your program has been at what point of their life decided to up their bench press by going to Max and once a week I'm sure everybody has I have you have everybody has how long do the last typically 6 weeks for beginner van sleep for my toddler eat or three weeks and that's about it so for whatever reasons after that you know you never system started venting out your endocrine system can keep pop and that's it so for that reason before the competition you might take like a 90% single double or something like that and if you look at the longevity of powerlifters and if you could lend you have any of the weightlifters of the Soviet school is very impressive ABY great example so David rigert himself who was the champion around you know the seventies so he is worried he's probably pushing 70 right now you know lives in a farm Works in a farm buddies code doing great very healthy and I'm trying hard so basically he is so I think he's German so if one of the dermis living in the Soviet Union and eventually when the Soviet Union fell apart cook for the immigrated to Germany and the so you're the guy who is almost 90 years old still looks about thirty years younger who still does jump squats with 90 kills four sets of 10 and this is an example so heavyweight don't have the same longevity but that's Passmore that does not have anything to do with the training system that has to do with the fact the strain you put in your system by eating so much just not so good but this guy's have longevity if you also look at the Power electric most successful powerlifters American powerlifters competed for if I'm not mistaken about 30 years at the highest level from a very light weight loss too much heavier one and he stayed super healthy throughout he maybe had one injury and Eddie right now yours have after retirement is very very healthy so you will find that the mentality of saving this eye of the tiger for 1 as opposed to treating every training days of competition that makes a big difference for performance and Longevity it's just battles the mindset of always do more always push harder always give your all leave everything in the gym that does this is the mindset that people have been tripping doctrinated into trip that they think that the hard work is what really matters but hard work doesn't matter but hard work and come in a lot of different it can manifest itself differently with that approach of work with a guy like Ronnie Coleman because he's a bodybuilder so bodybuilders obviously you're not talking about competition and sense of being able to lift a lot of weight and you're talking about just Mass acquiring Mass what y'all do bodybuilders from the older era like Franco Columbu very sad that doctor recently but she was an exceptionally strong man swimming llaveros is a heart issue that has nothing to do with lifting so he was very healthy and very strong till the end and if you look at the guys of that generation there you know they're doing great and if you look at other bodybuilders power powerlifter let's hear bodybuilders who have some kind of a power bodybuilding approach these guys have been around longer as well if you look at the Old Timers again Dave Draper Clarence is well let's put it this way he uses not a spring chicken but he's got an absolutely spectacular physic he's still staying very strong how old is he now and just super Jack body big as incredible to push himself when you need to bring self yeah but he's very very intelligent. Guy was built with a different strategy I can speculate I don't know but I can write back too late but if you look at the muscle mass that have been achieved by heavyweight powerlifters by Kirk karwoski look at that guy w o s k i so if you see that type of development achieved by heavyweight powerlifters then I don't see why not and bodybuilders have their own additional techniques they still have to do their stuff for the separation whatever it is that you do but I think there's a very good chance that you would have and if you look at the successful power like Mike O'Hearn for example that's a very strong guy he's a power bodybuilder they are Virgos karwoski right there yeah and Dad guy just would not fool around with a tech whatever deck and what-have-you pec deck painfully yeah and that guy just would not full around with deck whatever deck and what-have-you pec deck painfully</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know machines are this is an interesting point of you okay there is a belief that machines are great for beginners and because you don't have to control it it's a friend's isolated so on so forth really machines have limited use for advanced lifters when they're injured or whenever they have to just really focus on something so it's possible it's possible to use a machine if you really messed up you can find some angle a beginner starts doing leg presses scheduling mishap his coordination so I got out the back strength and ab strength sewing machines are not necessarily bad so the deck might be okay for bodybuilder looking for more cats or for somebody recovering from an injury knowing exactly the hangovers to push not your typical person going to gym has no business doing that I love about kettlebells is promotes functional strength it promotes the entire body moving as a unit that is used to apply very quickly to Athletics is one of the reasons why you get two people of adopted kettlebell training so almost Universal app so late I'd are many reasons why but that's one of them or and your ability to get out from under the bottom bottom positions is so just a phenomenal work turn on the workout but the these principles of using the entire body and with kettlebells using different parts of your body using your legs your call your app all-in-one one workout is also so it's so effective TimeWise cuz you can get a spectacular workout in a very short amount of time maybe this is a good time to discuss benefits of kettlebells vs. lightsaber bills or body that's very good conversation as a question ask people ask, so what are the respective benefits of these different modalities the body weight is obvious is accessible it's with you no matter where you go but innocently enough to body weight requires the most coaching I have tutor satellite for example if you look at developing something the gym is called the hollow position takes a lot of coaching to perform at correct even pull up or push up its is a lot of work one-legged squat so on and so forth so he's great intakes but it just takes more time or investment also the down side of the body weight would be you can't return the lower back and factually and you have to turn your lower back to see you you just have to and whatever you do back extensions other stuff neck Bridges is not going to do for your back so by the way gray modality but with its lease limitations the barbell if you just love heavy stuff it's awesome and it's just psychologically to extremely satisfying then if you're looking forward to my maximize your muscle mass nobody has come up with anything other than the barbell so you know you start doing you know some repetition Download Squad store so that's another but let's say you're playing football right the problem with the barbell first of all is the learning curve it take some time to learn it correctly it's not easy to master it and it takes a lot of instruction in addition the Broncos not forgiving so let's say that one of your shoulders are jacked it's just not very forgiving because you can how to adjust yourself to the bar is opposed to make the Implement adjust yourself so this is really credible comes in first of the Kettlebell because it moves freely it adjust your body to your physiology 2 Anatomy should say so it works quite well for example Mark Rifkin he was one of my instructors he was do bilateral exercises well because of the mileage you sustain you took a very bad landing as a gymnast ruin is Negan on from there other things when bad back whatever so that he can do whatever he cannot do to arm swings because it just messes him up but he can do whatever swing so the body compensates Hill differently than he can handle it so it's with the proper medical clearance it's much easier to work around problems then the offsets on a gravity-fed just tremendous thing for your back I'm sorry for your shoulder so what positions are put your shoulder and you cannot do with anything else but and you obviously you have to get up which is an amazing exercise did not do it as well with other implements but the ballistics that's another unique benefit of the kettlebell swings and snatches exercise the benefits of Bristol ballistic loading I was just part of sports and it's a part of life and often times it's hard to do safely go ahead start jumping it like before somebody starts jumping correctly jumping off boxes and so on and so forth to see when you don't hopping across the floor it requires some coaching it requires getting some strengths it requires addressing some dysfunction so on and so forth sample it's so many hard man with high mileage or really banged up in so many different ways the Baxter needs their hips they're able to do swing safely that's just remarkable and with a ballistic contractions very important so we have to run to have to jump you have to do things like that but it goes beyond that for your health for longevity so as we grow older there's a lot of type 2 muscle muscle fibers so the strongest the fast-twitch fibers and there are several problems with that first of all their metabolically needed for the body to be healthy to process sugar so on so on so forth second is to deal with real life situations you know I can spend fortunes so old person trips and breaks a hip terrible and sometimes the reason just weakness and we need this fast fibers because whenever your trip you have this reflexive contraction these fibers go online first so if you don't have them anymore you got that your problems right so and other reason is in type 2 fibers there is mitochondrial degeneration takes place is her older much faster than others and if you don't take care of that it's all so that's aging got it rain this type 2 fibers and only two ways to train type 2 fibers it's heavy or fast so there's no Third Way so whenever people try to do some sort of a super slow this or Pilates that whatever it's not going to do it so you have to train heavy we have to train fast if you want to stay young so are you completely against that kind of super slow training not at all but for totally different reasons obviously one reason it's possibly somebody is injured right and now the reason is to develop your type 1 endurance fibers hypertrophy for these fibers why would you want to do that or first of all type 1 fibers the downside of his fibers is they can track slower so obviously that's a downside for some sport for summer activities but there was no more efficient which means plus Brothers sports right so and other positive here they were to come pre creeper mitochondria so mitochondria that's why Rubik metabolism takes place and by building your type 1 fibers you automatically get more endurance in addition to muscle mass and strength to so super slow work is good for that but it has to be done correctly the proper methods were developed by Rihanna and so he developed this method I'm going to summarize a free right now for your free listeners that something you can easily do yourself easily know that word simply so did you rayshun of asset is 32/62 you have to select the range of motion where there's no there's no stacking there's no there's no support from your bones at all so for example of how to do a squat you go down below parallel but not to the point where you sitting on your couch and come up just a little about feral and Below again so just at the most unpleasant the most painful area if you're doing let's say push-ups for chest for example you would almost brush the deck with your chest come up about halfway and come back down and the speed very slow so there's no momentum at all now doesn't sound like anything new but here's what's new Juliana optimize your rest. And and that's a big Yankee game changer normally when people trained in this manner bodybuilders and others they just want to get more sunburned possible and by the way the burnt these awful and in this particular case you want to train close to failure and this particular case that's just a muster training that's not strength training per se so they try to run for 1 CET to the next so don't do this let's say the 32nd said than they will just need a rest for 30 seconds to do it again completely Hammer themselves the problem with that is even though we do not know the exact mechanisms of Boss what girls we do know that some lactic acid is needed but too much lactic acid is destructive so what's up did you see figure is after these going to set you have to rest for 5 to 10 minutes and it sounds for pupillary distance very hard mental thing to do so here I am going for this massive burn and I have to wait for 5 to 10 minutes but it's very simple you introduce another exercise in between so 5252 10 sets on the heavy day eventually presets in yd that's it now this is incorporating super slow techniques and who would this be good for wrestlers wrestlers is spectacular Rodger from the UK he had him follow this protocol before he and his crew rowed across the Atlantic did much better off than most people and was much happier if you can pay out their own across the Atlantic so for rowing for wrestling for bodybuilding for some people who cannot do anything else so that's a good protocol so this is essentially a muscular endurance protocol is both because because the muscles getting bigger and it will get stronger but it won't be faster if it's not with a boxer actually no no definitely not rest or yes MMA you just have to use your judgment there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> CrossFit Circle back around to that what do they do that you feel you said there's a lot of good things they do to get people moving they introduce people to all these different exercise routines what do you think they do wrong do I don't want to pick up CrossFit this so-called metabolic conditioning has been around since 1975 at least one Arthur Jones going that term you know the guy from Nautilus that's when he would people go through a circuit machines and I'm sure it's been around even before that I would just do things totally different so there's no point in there's no point in me trying to criticize criticize a different system I'm just telling you this is what the sign says experience has this how we should be doing it and I think that up there a lot of great people and Crossfit and I just wish you no power to them you would just do it like what you're talkin about with longer rest periods different sort of train approach and let's say that you're training for the CrossFit Games okay I say that you're going to write what you would do is name some CrossFit Darkside let's say okay in there wall ball you throw this a few times walk around you do a set of push-ups but say 5 to 10 reps and you do this for 40 minutes why 40 minutes it doesn't always have to be 40 minutes but pretty much we know if you can sustain it for 40 minutes not going to be over the glycolytic so we just kind of know that I'll give you another example you can do a burpee but time it in a way that you can keep doing burpees 4:40 so you do a rap walk around do a rap walk around or even breaking up so you do these different crossfit specific competition specific exercises in this particular matter where you able to just sustain it again for 40 minutes then you start doing what in track is called peeking so when you're running let's say 400 meters athletes when they train in the offseason the train largely aerobically even though their distances or shorted they're still not trying to trash themselves but we do know that even if you develop your mitochondria if you do correctly and suddenly you throw yourself in an acid bath your body is going to be unpleasantly surprised so what you need to do you need to model that it was going to happen is a couple weeks before competition once-a-week future much is like Eric something similar to the competition like a water whatever and this will accomplish several things one is it will operate you later Boppers so your body produces baking soda pretty much to cancel out the acid and it's a very rapid adaptation it's very easy to get just two weeks you got it and in a dish you also hop regulation that clinic enzymes we should also one for competition and again they're very quick to develop very quick to lose as well so finally there is such a thing as heart and respiration rate modeling so he's pretty much means that you can be so I can win and if you're not used to sucking wind tonight I feel good your diaphragm spasm and not-so-good so the purpose of peeking to get yourself in kind of a simulated competition situation where they acid is high enough to make your body adapt to it which end. Fast and to make yourself comfortable with hard high heart rates and breathing so that's that's a summer that's pretty much how track athletes train situation where they acid is high enough to make your body adapt to it which adults fast and do make yourself comfortable with heart I heart rates and breathing so that's that's a summary that's pretty much how track athletes train</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what do you do now account for so how old are you you look great thank you great haircut to thank you I'm working on being 20 jail I'm 52 are you older than me I'm working out we're both working how often do I train almost everyday just doing something differently yeah mostly kettlebells or mostly for the last several years would I suppose last several months work out of experimental doing something else but for the last several years pretty much has been nothing but swings and and dips just wanted my protocols it's a very particular anti glycolytic protocol anti glycolytic me and swall swings and dips why why that combination try to be minimalist pretty much and try to cover as much as possible also trying to do things that my body likes but the swings are I would argue that the swing is the most beneficial exercise anybody can do because you will again your drain power your drain your fast fibers you're developing mitochondria in the fast fibers you are treating your connective tissues and you know you're getting your cardio as well stopped you know it's not focus on that but you have that side effect the dip is you know what's been missing I like the idea of very minimalist General strength protocols that just have pretty much a hip hinge and an depress that's that's a preference why is it if you just wings powerfully and if you do dips or push ups powerfully chances are you and I going to lose your chops chances are for most people in mind what is general training versus specific training so in Russian Sports Science there was a concept of General training vs. special training special mean sport-specific pretty much so the general strength General training can be strengthened be something else gives you foundation for everything else and it's characterized by high degree of carryover so for example if you decide to do barbell squats you know for a fact that you're going to jump higher you going to run fast you're going to hit harder and so on and so forth if you decide to go leg extensions you can be sure that you're going to get better at leg extensions that's it so possible carry over so that's what you do and then after that you start having you more specific stuff so I'd say that you know you would increase the number of chin-ups you want to do what you got to do chips so that's a specific practice absolutely so for a long time and I was just doing kettlebells doing cleans presses snatches wings but bunch of different squat protocols overhead squats in my dip went through the roof so that type of carry over some of it we can understand that but yeah we've had the kettlebell swing for example increase the performance of world champion powerlifters and top marathon runners at the same time so very bizarre thing and I get a solid wood decipher some Woodside can but hey we'll take it right what do you think is going on there if you had a gas cuz it's okay so it's a number of different things one is the type of the type of breathing patterns that we use for example for endurance that for that helps strengthen doors so we'll use this pressurized breathing that increases your strength on exhalation so that pretty much do you strengthen any kind of exertion with his punching or lifting and at the same time we are also training our muscles that inspiration muscle inflammation muscles as well and so developing developing these muscles is really important for performance so. Just wanted to aspects and other aspects of the broke the 3,000 lb total record in the VIN for alerting some years back so I don't Donnie for sometimes with Donny kept hurting his back knees deadlift was stuck so we met I showed him some stuff he started doing that invented a couple of cool things of his own as well so nine months later he added about 70 lb bench press said the total record and what's what is coach setting kettlebells work the muscles without killing them just so it appears to be that the particular stimulus that you have its there's always a positive and there's always a negative when you're training right or something good that's happening so something that's holding back you have to recover so it seems to be that nature of things that happens within the muscle is positive or the negative and I think part of it is very well does ballistic loading the body adapts is extremely extremely well Board of it has to do the particular training protocols we have because we produce the right amount of acid but not too much acid a lot of trainees in the Fitness World their disenamored Woodburn thousand pounds in competition and he was just a brilliant Sports Ines brakebill and Coach he said you like burn light a match with a burn so again the bloating protocols we have these sites that you have the right amount of. Of that simulation not excessive because what happens if too much lactic acid is here's what happens positive motion rather negative but for sure they don't make them work it makes them worse or for sure people like to say well soreness is just caused by eccentric loading and that's it annual Sable Spiker free radicals and so that free radicals damage to a membrane as well so with what we do we tried and plus there's other stuff happens like body part starts producing ammonia which is toxic and deeply to ATP sold as things are going there's really sideways so I think the nature of what you do is you just optimize this metabolic environment to get exactly what you want by there are some other things to like in your case were pressing and four dips I challenge anybody to find a pressing exercise that's by mechanically more perfect for the shoulder than the caliber military press is perfect range of motion perfect grade stretch a contraction just absolutely perfect so we don't but hey what the hell effect exercise that's by mechanically more perfect for the shoulder than the caliber military press is perfect range of motion perfect grade stretch a contraction just absolutely perfect so someone could get some we don't but hey what the hell effect will take it right</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you see Jim's you know what we see Jim's like mine that have all this equipment all these different things do you look at that is like that's excessive or unnecessary that is just whatever you add for yourself and without knowing your training needs your background I don't truly I can't evaluate your gym but I can tell you that most people have too much stuff and it becomes our problems choices so you can mini of this and this and that so what are you going to do it called get injured from this kind of exercising in my life older contact injuries like you no fractures and things like that they're not from they're not from lifting from lifting things War World 2 weeks all of them were tweaks by the alternate ligaments by Falling in things like that you've never had issues with tendonitis or any of that combat. That's exactly what I got mine from sure yeah well first of all provided in the absence of medical restrictions you just work around 6 so you'll find things to do that Ward the area without aggravating it nuts does you know this kind of the age-old prescription for what you want to do and what I'm telling you that a lot of things we do are allowing a lot of people to get back in the game before it been really interview for and I can tell you that the techniques we use a strong first kettlebell techniques and some other techniques we have supporters amongst top Healthcare professionals people like Professor Stuart McGill who is top spine biomechanist in the world and who works with the elite of the elite of athletes and also the most broken down people Greg Cook was adopted psychotherapist people like that so we have a very good track record of keeping people healthy I like this old expression from George the Russian line hackenschmidt strength cannot be divorced from health I think that's a great line that's a great line that doesn't want something with my bicep tendon I think I got it from two things I got it from training doing a lot of chin-ups but also from archery cousin archery extending as your drawing back at the same time and this particular muscle gets over work cuz I have doctor marching I know what about your diet I'm an animal nutrition I didn't know anything about it I don't like it so I just feel sorry for people on that field I really do it's a constantly be reading papers you have to constantly be studying and it's still hopeless yet we should do is focus weatherton Dieter and training we should try to focus on things are more Universal so for example in terms of longevity dr. Nick Lane for the mitochondrial research or he made it very interesting point he said right now for lungevity so many efforts are directed at the genetic engineering manipulation whatever falling around trying to make this really really customized and he said you know what's really interesting why to try to focus on something that's been known to work not just for any individual bricks for racking my pretty much every species which is mitochondrial health and he says that if we find a way of extending life spent on his 30 years old he's pretty sure it's going to come from mitochondrial health and the stimuli for mitochondrial health sampling terms of nutrition that's that's fasting in terms of exercise it is both aerobic steady-state exercise and that type of work for fast fibers that I told you about anti glycolytic training and there's cold so those are the stimuli the primary stimuli for the mitochondria so probably for nutrition the same thing they should look for more things that work for everybody and then I'm kind of on the margins try to fool around with customization what about you personally what kind of diet to follow back some years ago and that's a very interesting gent Ori hofmekler and he introduced me to he's so cold Warrior died and I was not interested in any kind of a diet any kind of a body count changes I'm just not into that kind of thing but what attracted me is efficiency once a day and I thought sure I'll try and this was long before the current intermittent fasting craze has begun so I don't think or he's getting quite the credit he deserves so I pretty much as he's a large dinner and don't worry about it you snack at all during the day slam a lot of calories down in one meal do right what do you eat steak mostly brought my wife Meek Mill heated not not out of choice but mostly meat yeah but you understand what I'm telling you just personal choices did some research and summarize some other research like why are fruit and vegetables good for you and the party line is the antioxidants and they almost convincingly concluded that's not the case because if you just try to isolate antioxidants just give it to people they don't have the same effect so the current theory what you know is true the plant toxins pretty much promote for mises hormesis pretty much resistance against stuff so it's pretty much mild doses of poison that you take to make yourself stronger so that's most like the weirdest things are good for antioxidants Haitian might even cause cancer so that's just not something to shotgun or go to the pharmacy by all this stuff you should know exactly what you're taking them for and that should be a great benefit that some people have had is people thought of him issues like skin condition eczema things along those lines it seems to cure it up people with severe arthritis it's mean by cutting out all plant Foods completely some people with autoimmune issues have found great results some people found great results with depression but it's extremely controversial and you know it's all so ideologically troubling for some people some people I want you to eat meat at all so if you're eating only meat this is terribly sending about message necessary evil you understand certain things just like your foam roller Joe let me know you just do it if not you don't enjoy it that thing next to the Tim Tam that's what I use instead of a foam roller that Jackhammer right underneath the tripod and go that's that was invented by MMA coach Peraza Hobby talks about vegetables with such disdain I would think but I will tell you all this stuff about fiber and listen. That's supposedly good and again that's that's not my specialty but this other point about her Macy's which is again building up your resistance yes resilience to things so it's very possible vegetables are evil and the small doses of his evil make a stronger corner of your plate should be more probably probably I don't know it's just a funny subject with you you have an interesting relations you I'm an animal nutrition I hate it I just really hate it I have a sympathy deep sympathy for people who are in that line of work do you supplement with multivitamins or creatine or anything along those lines extensively and walnut for everybody it does work you don't have any I don't have any. So I'm not in that my things so what about vitamins you take any vitamins out there is there's no evidence and again if if you would get a prescription from your doctor that you shorten this then you should this is essentially not your wheelhouse</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> about endurance so they're different aspects to endurance and so there's cardio and there is the most of the peripheral endurance in the muscles muscular endurance so first to let discuss how do we develop cardio let's discuss how we develop endurance in the muscle the best the healthiest way to develop your cardio is just did exercise like running at a particular particular speed that's not too fast that's very simple that's the best way to develop cardio for most people it is for most people It Isn't So here's what's happening what's happening is the hardest stretching when you increase your heart rate up to a certain point the heart start stretching more and it stretches more and more volume not quite 90% of heart rate when you start redlining your heart rate when you start getting to 90% and higher the hard does not have time to relax foot so it really pretty much is twitching so you're no longer really stretching that hard so you want to be training at the metabolic intensity that's much lower something we can pretty much just any conversation so I'd say you're running and talking to you that's what you want to stay to develop endurance that want to develop to stretch your heart that's a basic method so that's one method so the second method is interval training so and the interval training for the heart was developed by Germans decades ago and these guidelines still stand so here's what they figured out they figured out that you're we know that this various systems anybody have a nurse do Francis noticed that when you're running hard and you stopped your heart still beating hard and then maybe 10 seconds after there's a sudden drop right there so is that a no-show so the Germans figured out if you get your heart rate up to about eighty-five 90% which is it's hard but it still not maximum and then you switch to walking or jogging so the heart is still beating and so is this extra volume of blood is moving instructions to hard so you can use the intro method as well but it's it was found its use best after after. Of steady-state training is very demanding on the body and it's not it's just it's too easy to have problems with a heart if you start using it prematurely then there's also such a thing as high straight under heavy loads exercises Dynamic exercise running bicycling skiing even life kettlebell swings that's been amick exercise when you start doing static exercises for you know that's not the best idea because that interferes with the blood flow that the something called Floyd vs. preload the heart gets thicker instead of the heart gets you know get stretch them bigger just not the optimal way to train the heart you can again this simple way you can use Dynamic exercise an interval type training or repeat training in this case to train your heart is to do an exercise that Dynamic nature to raise your heart rate to about 89% we should be 89% it'll be where you can see maybe a couple words you know you're not you're not dying yet you can still answer a question and then you just walk around and you'll do it again so that's a simple way of how much time walking around that depends. funny rage gay in this particular case you would do you would drop it down the regional guidelines were done for young people those hundred twenty hundred thirty beat so you're talkin about 6 to 65% and pretty much if you're just looking at being able to pass the talk test which means you can talk you know short sentences I can speak in short sounds like that right so for example you do a set of tennis Wings really powerful the Kettlebell walk around a little bit when you feel that you can speak again you do it again do it again so that's a simple way of doing that but the heart is only a very small part of endurance so we definitely need to do some cardio for health and athletes definitely need to do for their performance but what we really need to focus on his need mitochondria so mitochondria in the in the muscle cell so that's where energy is being converted aerobically which means efficiently so if you look at the way your muscle uses energy so you will get this energy with food converted and goes down eventually the final currency so to say ATP but it's only a few seconds so we have three main out of your system so have the powerful but it's only and it's clean-burning we have I Robux system that's not powerful at all but it's longer-lasting and we have the glycolytic system that's kind of in-between that dumps a lot of acid another 15 metabolites in there so what we want to do as we want to develop these mitochondria in our muscles it's easier to do a slow fibers and little more involved in Fast Five result we can do that but it can be done we're looking for instead of trying to trash the muscle with acid we are trying to train in a way that to produce less acid and then only before the competition right before the competition couple weeks out you do a couple of cannabis smokers like that to get yourself used to that that thing so the way we develop mitochondria which means major muscle oxidative make a muscle enduring and not polluting is low fiber is it simply moving right below anaerobic threshold so I never over threshold is that intensity at which you know acid is accumulating just up to a certain point it stays at steady-state and you can keep disposing of that for a while for quite a while as soon as you go a bobbit very rapidly you crash so running right below then I Robux threshold is the primary Training Method for endurance athletes and how do you know that you run the threshold when you feeling the talk test that's a simple way to do that and it's very interesting that endurance athletes even though if we're not necessarily will educated they can attend to grab it taste for that intensity and so what happens is we are producing a small amount of acid and the body finally able to be no produce less and less so that's how we train aerobic I'm sorry that's how we train mitochondria and slow fibers for a fast fibers it becomes something more interesting so the conditions the conditions for making the mitochondria be able to handle more traffic without producing as much acid is pushed them just to the edge of acidosis just just to the edge and do it over and over and over so and you're sprinting again and you're just walking but you're doing that to measuring of blood lactate and it still keeps below the threshold and you sustained us for the tape 40 minutes so think of this very second you sprinting very intensely but you stop before you start burning you get to the point of just light marker 14 and you dude over and over and over so if we talked about coaching terminology repeat training versus interval training so what is interval training garbage will have to take a step to the side so the three types of rest periods between your sets weather running lifting whatever so there's a stress. That means that you will have a harder time to do the same thing or you will not be able to repeat it right that's infiltrating there is the supercompensation. Which means if you wait extra long time you'll perform even better like for example if you do at setup Bluffs wait for 15 minutes you might be able to do more 15 minutes later and there is the ordinary. Which is that you'll be able to repeat it over and over so that's encouraging speakers go to repeat training repeat versus Andrew so we're trying to sustain that same level of performance for 40 minutes let's say so we're trying to sustain that same level of performance for 40 minutes let's say so that's an example of how we develop mitochondria fast-twitch fibers and the same thing we can do with kettlebell swings the same thing you can do working and have a bag and so on and so forth</div>

So I pay attention to them so I see what they going through right it's my turn I had John Witherspoon in earlier in the year with his side of the Lovelady I've known for a long time and I remember thinking like he was just here he was like happy he had all his energy he was hilarious and then a couple months later the lights shut off that's life that's life decal just like that was in the big scheme of things from thousands of years it's just like that but it got like that is just like I kind of figured hilarious comedian like he's is it's weird that he's gone you know why because it's weird when everybody leaves it's like they're just they just did not in the space anymore you know just gone I don't see it is weird though cuz I see death is just as much as life it's the same thing I do it is so I don't see you is weird I mean of course he emotionally with mostly a text with Bob is us you know but at the same time I get it yeah that's why I think it I think that's the key to all this s*** understanding once you understand you just pretty much got life for you that you think Steffi was just telling me stuff Brother 14 but the beginning and the end is pretty much life and death no difference so it's like we just spanking is because this s*** he'll make us arrogant that's true you look at it and it that's what you be saying understanding like it's just how you look at it and understanding There's No Good the Bad and it is what it is just got to be on the right side in the universe once we realized that will be ammo humble you said you saw cats hunt on a safari what was I like I got it on my phone</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know that horses originally evolved here in North America no and then they went and then they reintroduce them yeah there's a guy named Dan Flores he's got a bunch of great books and one of them is called coyote America he's got another one what is his other book about the various large land animals that went extinct here and North America but that the wolf and a lot of the other ones wasn't considering Eddie that's it yeah he's fantastic and essentially they all went extinct all the horses went extinct here and then they were reintroduced by Europeans but they had originally evolved and hear any of the native people here really use them until Europeans came whether it was Cortes or whoever you know what Cortez with the Aztecs or whoever else came across horses so much a part of the story The you know so they they come up with the Spanish the Spanish are acutely aware of what is going to happen if the horse technology gets out and they take great pains to not let it get out they don't want to teach the Indians in Mexico or the Indians in North America and how to use them but inevitably the technology does get out and then there's a few moments there's a great moment in time in 1680 in Santa Fe when there's a great Pueblo revolt and they kicked the Spanish out in like tens of thousands of horses get out it's the great horse dispersal and and and these are the horses that come into the hands of the police Plains tribes so in the 1600 that their power and their dominance started to sort itself begins to figure out how to have all these horses and how how valuable that was or some of the other tribes just hadn't kind of caught on no one knows and it's interesting no one knows that because it was on seen in flashes by the Spanish through their kind of Northern Outpost no one exactly knows what it was in the heart and soul of a Comanche that could do that better than anybody else but it got infected Comanches but by all descriptions of the time we're not a pretty horse anyway graceful people there were kind of short and kind of you-know-who of bowlegged in they they weren't especially graceful and and they didn't they didn't look like perhaps you were to think of the that the northern Sioux Indians of the Nic on the calling that kind of tall and you know with bone structure if that wasn't the Comanches and then they got on a horse and then everything changed and and and even though the Apaches were the first ones to actually get that technology from the Spanish and they crazy they raise Havoc with it but the tribe that got it the best in the most were the Comanches they were the tribe that actually ended up supplying horses to a lot of the Northern Plains tribes that we just talked about and what they once they had this incredible Mastery of the horse in this ability to hunt like they never had and fight like they never had they did what you would I guess expect the great new power on the plane to the planes are big place by the me the great new power the place is going to challenge for the greatest food source out in Mid America and that was the Buffalo herds and they were in the Southern Plains so the Comanches over. 150 years of sustained combat move South from the Wind River mountains of Wyoming essentially into this 250,000 square mile Empire think of kind of headquartered in Texas Panhandle which is where the Buffalo and this tribe they were known for being Buffalo hunters and they were also known as what they weren't really like making art work or doing a lot of the things that we sort of associate with other Native American tribes are mostly just hunting they when writing a 10 things that we all would associate with Native Americans you know this wonderful abilities and dance and music complex religion and complex religious social structures to go along with it and all these different things music and dance and all these things at the Comanches by the time that the kind of angle Europeans run into them they are a stripped-down culture that looks more like Sparta and one of the reasons they are asleep because they've been fighting this long warm primarily against the Apaches but against other tribes over decades and during that time as they became ascendant militarily they became less interested in those things they became interested in war conveyed status right War conveyed numbers of ponies and status in the thing and so yes they were they were stripped down War called should I guess to to whatever extent we we know or something about spartite would remind you of Sparta that's what's so interesting about this is such as unique tribe just a very unique branch of Native America that was specifically like this that they've been made war and they and they conquered and when you know when you think about what they got themselves finally it's about that's a 250000 square miles of probably doesn't mean anything but think of West Texas Western Oklahoma Western Kansas Eastern Colorado and eastern New Mexico gigantic chunks of that that was theirs and when you think of some of the numbers of them that were there when when say the angle Europeans in the Americans came through in the 1830s there was probably 25 or 30 thousand of them out there of which five or six thousand Warriors not know what five or six thousand suggest you but it suggests to me like the 3rd Base Line at Yankee Stadium or something it's not very many people you know occupying this gigantic area that that became as we were saying earlier determinant of everything that happened around it five or six thousand suggest human is it just to me like the 3rd Base Line at Yankee Stadium or something it's not very many people you know occupying this gigantic area that that became as we were saying earlier determinant of everything that happened around it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> also striking because you realize over the course of the book and I mean just any more books that I've gotten into subsequently that this was something that was going on before the white settlers even got there that this way of life and the rating and the The Killing and that's not what we associate Native Americans with we associate with taking the Native Americans land and then them fighting back and that's when things get ugly but it turns out this was is the wild way of life that they had had for who knows how many years what are the things that surprised people when I wrote this book at and I didn't know that I was going to be surprising people cuz I was just reporting what I found was was was that that very thing that that this was I think people are often used to the Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee Narrative of the of Native Americans which is his victims and there's no question that they were victims of a Westward rolling m are in 378 broken treaties and we can just go on we know what that narrative is like but the narrative that I told Center of power dominance power with which came with brutality too and I think it surprised if it was a fact it was a fact that that if you go back in time these ended these Native American tribes that eventually got crushed as the Comanches did and put on a reservation somewhere and had their livelihood taken away from them but you know anyway it's a it's a huge deal and and a narrative that I think to me that doesn't take into account the enormous power and dominance in behavior of of Comanches is just missing you know half the habanera will it's so fascinating because it's essentially they were living like Stone Age people and they were doing it very recently there were there were doing it like in terms of the way Europe is go and see buildings in Italy that were built long before any of this stuff happened long before the settlers started encountering them and they were living like this and this sort of what makes very romantic the way they live just chasing the Buffalo well and anyway and killing them and then eating only buffalo meat and then doing very little farming picking some berries and nuts and that's about it maybe was just eating beet and raiding and killing they weren't they were nomadic hunter-gatherers which is what they work and and what the horse allowed them to do was too which is what they had been before the horse allowed them to do that only just really really really well and otherwise they wouldn't they weren't in the position of becoming agricultural Indians The Horse Cave in this ability to and as you said that they got everything from the Buffalo clothing and and lodging and and tools and Saddles and bridles and food and everything came from the Buffalo so the horse Mableton to do this on an incredibly sophisticated level the most sad part of the story is the extra padding of the Buffalo I mean that's not the most sad but one of the that their way of life it's almost like you know what happened but I'm rooting for them in some weird way you know I mean I know that they're not going to win but there's something about the way they lived it seems so excited painting of the Buffalo I mean that's not the most sad but one of the that their way of life it's almost like you know what happened but I'm rooting for them and some weird way you know I mean I know that they're not going to win but there's something about the way they lived it seems so excited</div>

where everything's normal private property and then just giant ranches everywhere and this was all run by the Comanche 98% of Texas's if you go 112 state to the west and you let you read that you're in the big land of public land government land stays Texas is 98% private now that's a weird thing is it is how that happened it happened because that's the way it's settled in and the public land States just there was for one thing it was a lot more of apparently assertive useless land in in the in the western states but anyway he had it it happened in Texas you're lucky to get yourself a state park here and there when you were doing research for this did you meet with any current Comanches I met with some of them some of them some of them are on my on my website but as far as interviewing and four things that happened two or three hundred years ago that's not really a that's sort of a non-starter as a historian although although the book itself is based on lots and lots of interviews with Comanches but of the ear of people who this was this was a great there was some great projects done in the twenties and thirties with Comanches who talked about your hood memories of the 19th century and so a lot of what we know it with this in my book what we know about the Comanches and who they are come from all of these interviews and it's a lot in my book that comes from Comanches but again of the year so you know I just figured that interviewing people today about things that happened a long time ago was probably not that efficient efficient but still to me would be kind of fascinating to see where they are now in the Native American reservations this country traditionally been pretty horrific and it is very depressing and sad and it did for the people that live there just so little hope and so little opportunity and it's it's glad you were talking about before the broken treaties and just to see them having gone from being this incredible warlike tribe to being resigned is very small patches of the land that are usually not very fruitful not very resource field and it happened to a lot of tribes I mean if you look at the Comanches Comanches her a pretty small tribe they they they're located in their Center is No Reservations and there's no excuse me they don't have it in there but they there or something like that one of the big Ironically in some ways to determine factors and how wealthy a tribe is now its proximity to a major urban area for example Chickasaw and Choctaw oz are in DFW so there casinos there make a lot of money to Seminoles and Florida there's some tribes in California we're making a lot of money if you go up to say some of the Sioux reservations you know well up north in the planes they're not near they just stood there glands their traditional lands just don't happen to be close to Urban centers where where we the US government put the Indians and address of Plains Indians and Comanches and Arapahoe and Cheyenne and Sioux and everybody else they never wanted to be Farmers State farming was exactly what they never wanted to do and even with you gave him a hundred and sixty Acres they would they would sublet it they would rent it out to two mutually a white farmer who would farm and they would take a sharecropping percentage of something but yesterday they didn't want anything to do with it come in and above all they didn't want to be forced into a type of life that they that they had never done before in considered it just kind of unseemly do Comanches have a reservation today know the problem is the way in place of reservations they gave out individual portions of land for example on the East Coast there are reservations if you go to say Colorado fuel goes you see the Ute reservation with some of the Sioux reservations reservations all over the place not in Oklahoma so they're in danger of having their culture probably get erased so pretty I mean I think they would they would tell you I mean I will speak for Comanches or anybody else but that there that there you know they're pretty strongly organized where they are they have a nation they do have a nation is just a don't have a a body of a reservation but they do have a nation but if they have a nation they don't have the same sort of laws that one have a real Reno they actually do you go for a few years ago it's incredible now they don't have a reservation either but they have little pieces of land that is there but they also have been completely parallel police system completely parallel legislature they have parallel Healthcare systems open and you can drive through these parts of Oklahoma where I do say chalk toss or or or seven Cherokees or whoever Bay maybe are there these heaux parallel worlds their existing right in front of you and you don't see them there yes so so no actually I think they're in a lot of ways a lot of the tribes in Oklahoma are doing well but you in and literally can drive through it and you wouldn't be able to tell it's just such a stunning amount of change happened to this continent over short relatively short. Of time I mean really astounding and if you look at what from from the moment that the last Comanches to surrender with Cortland corner and the The Last of The Starving ever had all the Buffalo been killed now and so they're they're coming in and it's 1875 you know that very year there'll kind of Maine I guess camping ground would be Palo Duro Canyon one of the biggest AmericanWest up in the Texas Panhandle that's kind of where they're their Sanctuary was for one of their big sanctuaries were within that very year white been already owned Palo Duro Canyon there was already a ranch on it it was already private property within a few years there's barbed wire going all the way up I mean it this is happening I mean so now what you have you have the transfer of ownership suddenly white people own the land that the Indians used to but used to be theirs right II it happens now we have the cattle drive just before barbed wire and then it's only a few years of cattle drives and then the barbed wire goes up in this happens with just breathtaking speed at 3 for really the moment that they started killing the Buffalo off in the what 1870 or something 1871 to I mean full barbed wire it's just it's less than a couple decades it's only a few years of cattle drives and then the barbed wire goes up in this happens with just breathtaking speed at 3 for really the moment that they started killing the Buffalo off in the what 1870 or something 1871 to I mean full barbed wire it's just it's less than a couple decades</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it's kind of hilarious how this conversation came about you said you got a call from your publicist because your audiobooks spiked it's only crazy it was like what Cosmic dust in the outer bands of Jupiter just did that cuz we don't figure out what it was it just spiked like crazy went nuts I think it went to number one briefly Buffalo and I had put on Instagram how great the book was and he did the audio version of it and a friend of mine on Instagram he goes by the name of the Jackalope he's a fellow Hunter S Thompson enthusiasts he said you got to read this book and so he tells me to read your book and Empire of the summer Moon and it was amazing I mean he was absolutely right and it was so good tonight I made an Instagram post about that it's a fantastic book there's so much good stuff in there and I just it was it was so sad and so gripping and so riveting and we all know that a lot of horrific things happened in the time where the settlers started making their way across the Plains and right headed west but God you just did such a fantastic job sort of bring it to life it's all those things as brutal it's sad it's incredibly dramatic it's it's imagine think people forget about what the frontier was he's kind of a nice idea that you get on TV or something but it was it was a Savage place anyway that why should I was trying to convey it with this with the minimum possible of people being Stamped Out on ant hills with their eyelids cut off and things like that the horrors of it all aside. You know and I've never I knew that that kind of stuff had taken place but I really never read it so graphically depict it before before this book what motivated you to write about all this so what what this is a book about me I'm A Connecticut Yankee Massachusetts Connecticut guy I moved to Texas 25 years ago and I've been there ever since and I didn't know anything about Texas history nothing Beyond whatever you might know about the Alamo or something or Sam Houston or somebody like that and I got there and I just started to you know I started to hear about what one of the Great Plains and what they were which was an alien concept to me I wasn't sure what the planes were why they were different than some other part of the country the high plains and I came into this idea It Came Upon This idea that the Last Frontier was there that this is where it all went down we're like the end of freedom in Limitless is it was it didn't happen the frontier didn't push forward till it got to California then hit the ocean California settled the East settled and then it was just one last place that did not and it went on for any reasons for that one of which was the most hostile Indian tribes in the country and other was that it was there was no water would you know there was basically only land no water or Timber but so I got into this and then I find out cuz I live in Texas that there was this principle that lives on this that lived on this land the Comanches to determine everything that happened in the American West around them and that's not an exaggeration they would they were because until you're the West wasn't won until they lost it and that was for sure as they were two things one this Arc of the rise and fall of the most powerful tribe most influential tribe in American history the Comanches which was very cool from the Spanish in the horse and also it's a big step and then in the middle of that story a little story of this little nine-year-old girl with you know blonde hair and cornflower blue eyes who gets taken in a Comanche raid in 1836 who ends up becoming the in a mother at the last and greatest chief of the Comanches and in fact her kidnapping and his surrender at the very end of the Comanches Reno sort of book end of 40 Year War we never fought a 40-year gifts for anybody except them so I ran to the story and I'm just a kid from Connecticut and just seemed like the most obvious book in the world it was just the coolest history it's a crazy story that never heard of Cynthia Ann Parker before now she's we have on your way we have a giant and it'll picture of her on the wall is cuz it was so powerful your depiction of a to I wanted to I wanted to find out what she looks like and what it was his name again quando quando quando quando with his the names on the cover of the book right here because his mother was sent and Parker we should was not that didn't become that didn't come out and no one found out that until he was much older is he was born Quanah as a Comanche later in the reservation. When people found out who he was he identified as part of the Parker family also has a famous Comanche he was one of the most famous in and feared he was Quanah it's such a crazy story that they killed so many people but occasionally they would keep people and bring them into the tribe right so there were rules of the frontier at the time they were talking about how Savage it was in the rules of at least at the Plains Indians of which Comanches were one but if you were captured as an adult male you were killed tortured to death either quickly or slowly depending on how much time they had if you were a baby you were killed they couldn't deal with a baby baby was big they were Nomads and they were on their horse and they were probably escaping from whatever Ray they are just do they couldn't deal with baby a teenage girl or a young woman would possibly be killed but likely turned into a sort of as a slave the ones who had a chance of being adopted into the tribe or the Vino 8 9 10 11 12 year olds and so they instinctively they would take these captives and not just from a white people in from the Apaches in the Utes in the Cohoes and whoever they might take them front and so what was interesting about the frontier though is that those rules applied long but forget forget about white people arriving in the early 18th century for the moment those rules had applied to Indian tribe since forever you know that was the Assumption of a raid they all had that it was it was almost like the golden rule in Reverse or or the Golden Rule do unto others they all expected that kind of treatment none of them were shocked when a baby was for a pregnant woman was killed it took the kind of the Anglo European civilization of you know Newton and leibniz in the biblical tradition to arrive on the Texas Frontier in 1830 and be shocked at what they saw was a culture of rating essentially Indians in general and we know some Plains Indians we could kind of start you would know the names of the lot of a lot of Arapahoe and Cheyenne and Sioux and these were people who operated out in the Great Wide Open they were ballmastrz of the horse what made the Comanche special was that they they became the pre-eminent horse tribe people forget that there weren't any horses in this in the continent until the Spanish brought them in the 16th century so the the the tribes that got the horse in master the horse basically alter the entire balance of power on the plane and the try that got the horse better than anybody else in terms of breaking inbreeding and saddling and riding and stealing and hunting on the back of and fighting with were the Comanches and nobody was there. And so this was at this was not just a Plains tribe it was the preeminent power on the Southern Plains and the try that got the horse better than anybody else in terms of breaking in breeding and saddling and riding and stealing and hunting on the back up and fighting with with the Comanches and nobody was there. And so this was at this was not just a Plains tribe that was the preeminent power on the Southern Plains</div>

There's no denying that it's The Echoes of at least ancient races that needs to be somehow another addressed but I mean how do you address that like people some people want reparations and like the idea of it makes sense right clearly someone profited right there are two to this day their corporations you can trace their money back to slavery like if you look at a giant Plantation and they used to have slaves and they profited off of slave and a plantation and some other still in operation today I don't know if that's the case but if it was like if you give people money I don't think it fixes the problem I think it's fixed the problem there has to be some sort of beating this horse to death on the unfortunately I don't have any solutions know whenever he has one I don't know what it would be but I think there has to be some way to clean up communities and I don't know how you would do that how do you how do you go to a place like South Side Chicago has more murders than Afghanistan it's bad they're bad after on Twitter like the social justice stuff is so easy to do and it's like yeah of course that's what you're going to like you can have a hard day whatever shity job you have and then you come home you see someone got mad at something or did something wrong and you get to be like yeah this person you're cancelled and then you close your computer or whatever or you watch people retweet it and you're like you're like I did do something today when you see someone got mad at something or did something wrong and you get to be like yeah this person you're cancelled and then you close your computer or whatever or you watch people retweet it and you're like you're like I did do something today</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> who did it in terms of like if you're a young fighter and got aspirations what do you want to do you want to be an Olympic gold medalist you want to win multiple World titles to division world champion and you're retired undefeated you you're the one you're like a unicorn man you a rare dude because you were tired at 35 right 3333 that's crazy like you're in the peak of your athletic abilities and he do you know what did enough I mean it it sounds it sounds on meeting buttoned-up but it wasn't it wasn't that easy like I didn't know how things were going to go throughout the course of my career whatever reason like I always even as a young kid I'm talking to years old like I had this thought like you know I don't want to end up like a lot of Fighters end up like I seen the goal high really high and then all of a sudden they come crashing down like they start well but they don't end well country boy has swag and you always talk about himself in the third person to be like me and you know where Jones I don't you know I don't love the sport like that man imma get into get out I'm just special at it and imma be fishing on my phone won't you do Monday in Pensacola Florida Fighters don't talk like that he was the first one that gave me the thought of getting in and getting out and then again I just I just studied it throughout the course of my career even other athletes and entertainers that was always a goal just as much as I wanted to win the gold will Championship I wanted to leave on top of people were asking why are you leaving yeah well it's so difficult to make that decision though for something bro Jones jr. didn't even make that decision he said he was going to do it then I mean he had some rough Knockouts it was late and if you start to watch that some of them the people even didn't even see heartbreak a lot of it was good German quellin for people don't know was a murderer man he was a Savage light heavyweight but he caught he was cutting a lot of weight and you know he wound up having a serious brain injury and in in that epic fight with Nigel Benn Jordan animazing amazing fight with Ben. Off the deck looks like the fight was over people mad typical crunk Destroyer pause drawings f*** the super aggressive knockout Striker and for whatever reason Roy decided to know what was just keep doing it a lot of different reasons why people do that man I just didn't want to be one of them simply how simply put 2 years September 21st harder than I thought it was going to be one of the most hardest things I've ever had to do but one of the most rewarding in the way I reconcile it in my brain is that okay some point I might have to do this at some point I have to face the emotions in in the pool to come back and you know I'm trying to figure out if your body can still do it and just all the different things you go through whether I'm in my prime or rather I'm 40 45 years old so you can avoid it it's just when do you want to take take on that task you retire 2:30 to 3:35 now so God damn right they're like four more years to be unless you're Bernard Hopkins any of another decade but he started late when does all the different things you go through whether I'm in my prime or rather I'm 40 45 years old so you can avoid it it's just when do you want to take take on that task you retire 2:30 to 3:35 now so God damn man you're right there when you feel like four more years to be unless you're Bernard Hopkins and have another decade but they're Bernard credit he started late he didn't or started at 27 years old in Graterford State Prison</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the next 10 Rounds you started take over and you were solving the riddle the difference in power punchers like there's levels of power punch we always thought of him as this power puncher the crusher not a lot of people out but then it's like a Julian Jackson their level does us guys like that but that's that that different level of power punching The Earnie Shavers yes it would just put the lights out Kurt Cobain have never had that kind of power was like a snapping power I mean listen he did have power I don't want a lot of guys in their hometowns home countries like a reason why I like at a certain point in the fight you would see him hit a guy and then I will send their body language is different and I think one thing that was lost on my whole career that nobody ever talked about was I probably have one of the best teams in the sport of boxing over the last you know at that time to use my tide beating the best Dodgers in in the game and I'm awake last like if you look at coverley about of all the damage that he's done in a light heavyweight division he had 20 rounds here one moment he didn't have a wobble he didn't have a heated shake me up anywhere be one moment and it was a flash moment so just quantify that like a guy who is able to crush it like he is who he is he had one more minute 20 rounds so a lot of it had to do with my chin a lot of it had to do with my toughness which is also underrated and and I like I know this is going to sound dramatic I know it's going to sound dramatic but I didn't like to lose and for me it was kind of like either win or die like I said like that's how I felt like it wasn't that serious but that's how it felt like I always thought about Sunday Morning Blues on that plane family going to be looking crazy feeling bad everybody's going to be looking at you different like and you're going to feel crazy being curled up like in a ball on a Southwest flight coming back from Lenexa Kansas losing my the last fight ever lost against John revish a guy from Baton Rouge Louisiana 14 that is hilarious 14 14 years old retired never lost again and John was it was a 14-15 year-old bracket he was a little bit older and he was kind of a stocky kid again Country Strong and we are watching each other and separate back and so you know 5 day tournament 5:45 time to get to the finals and I'm looking at him and I was a little bit intimidated he didn't talk me like I'm scared to death but I got guys out and I was decision and guys along the way it could have went either way do you want a 3-2 decision three judges when is way to judge when my way but that whatever but if I was honest with myself like I got to be before the fight and at that moment like feeling the way I felt coming home I like dude if it is as much as that's up to me like that's never going to happen again I can't control every every aspect of the fight game stuff happen but it's not going to be because you beat me before the fact I can't live with this anymore cuz I was my motivation man that just to drive like it was like the wind or die and then and it has a thing about boxing MMA but the only sport that I know of but one loss changes your payscale like if you have a minimum you want to title your first offense is there a second offense is that these are good men amongst want to go she ate beyond that you know whatever whatever go ahead and lose one I can get cut in half so I lost literally takes food off my family table also knew that my critics and my supporters but namely my critics they had a front-row seat every fight and always see them looking is tonight going to be tonight so I had that weigh in on me I had to the supporters that believed in me was riding for me I look you know first couple rows my family right there my wife my kids always blow a kiss like all of this stuff was like tangible and real to me and I said stuff that would drive me and so I Get Knocked Down by Colbie Caillat like that's fighter flight time maybe like whatever is in you is going to come out if you got some turn in you that the time you going to turn preservation mode and you going to be so you can be more focused on Surviving then you are trying to win and I thank God man that that that he had his hand on me that night bro and that what was in me was real and it was enough to break him and the rest is history dresses entry it isn't it is amazing how much energy people get from haters I mean I don't I don't recommend reading negative comments or negative articles but it's a how people with a certain kind of resolve a championship resolved will take that hater s*** and you'll get up 15 minutes earlier than you supposed to and you'll have more intensity and your shadow box and you'll just push harder you feel it but I don't want to give the haters too much credit you know I got great mentors man my pastor Napoleon Kaufman former Raider the great man of God just a great great man he would always come with me and Pastor minute hating on me that element was always going to be there but I started letting that element work for me like I wouldn't like I wouldn't just you know just just be enamored with it and I wouldn't just sit there and read comments and stuff you know frankly the last three or four years of my career I didn't read a mention not one mention on Twitter I didn't look at comments on Instagram every now and again someone slipped through but I knew they were there and I knew generally what was being said I knew generally what the articles in the headline would read so it was there but will driving force with the people that were riding for me fighting for me supporting me believing in me that element was there and I was going to dress that element through my performance but they didn't I don't want to give them too much credit though they don't deserve that much very wise in the way you manage their influence by not reading those, not all the time but like frankly I didn't watch Boxing for the past three or four years of my career really and I'm a boxing but why didn't you watch the opinions the biased the double standards good stuff too and it was so weird for me because I'm the guy that would break his neck to go watch Tuesday night Gillette fights as a kid how many years I was over it going through what I went through with the lawsuit going through what I went through with the injuries the highs and lows and everything in between I was just burnt out what was can you refresh my memory the Lost was a promotion lawsuit yeah yeah it was it was you know I can't get too much into it for myself and you know but it was it was a long two year Journey on my best day I'm like doing the right thing soon stay stay stay in the race keep fighting not looking at may not be going your way now but just stay at like you're not fighting money's not coming in but just stay the course you're doing the right thing on my worst damage you get arrest on you you know people are writing our war would rather fight in the courtroom and fighting the ring on my two that's not hey I'm just trying to fight for what I believe is true. But coming out of that I'm done with all that stuff I'm not focused on your I got to focus on me it wasn't until I retired and got full-time in the broadcasting and commentating that I started to watch again I started to you don't understand who was out there on that you know in the landscape and researching it but I didn't watch it for many years that's crazy yeah I was doesn't make sense I mean you probably in your early days were so hungry for boxing cuz you had so much desire that you wanted to watch it all the time and effort required to become a champion RC the behind-the-scenes then you grow up and you see the business side can you see the dark side is like different the darkness dark side has a lot of that man in boxing mean it's historical the Don King Mike Tyson Stories the I mean there's so many stores are in the men Don King Muhammad Ali there's so many stories like that it's it's so sad it's it's an awful side of the business Darkseid yeah there's a lot of that man in boxing mean it's historical the Don King Mike Tyson Stories the I mean there's so many stores are in the men Don King Muhammad Ali there's so many stories like that it's it's so sad it's it's an awful side of the business</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> had an amazing career but one of the things that I think maybe people are as aware of is makes your career even more incredible as you fought for a long time with a bad shoulder like if you go back and watch to call frostbite I watch that get ready for this I watched it again U-Box the s*** out of him with mostly your left hand is crazy 12 years old for my subscapularis which is 50 is responsible for fifty percent strengthen the Rotator didn't really know it at the time we were told Hays to Young you know he shouldn't have surgery does rehab it wrong device found out you know 10 years later but we just rehabbed it within a band and strengthening exercises but we never had surgery so that was always kind of my Achilles heel man like I had just been plenty of fights by just fought one-handed because it didn't feel strong I didn't feel like safe I feel like anytime I throw it they can pop out of the socket like that's how I felt add popped out before and had not got it fixed right around 2013 in and it wasn't a hundred but it was better and I was able to finish out the rest of my career so we got to still not a hundred now it's not a hundred but I'll take it yeah I'll take your bro like I probably gained about thirty 40% with that surgery like they grabbed it because it wasn't attached but it wasn't driving dr. Michael Dillingham in in San Francisco like your shoulder capsules like shot subscap is hanging he said with the good news is it's still thriving muscle is get it attached attached it like a four-hour surgery some like that one of those surgeries that you're not guaranteed to come out of the same and you had to wait for a month or so to see if the surgery took like everything with men than kind of get you know kind of get stronger it took Manning and like I said I'll finish out the rest of my career strong wow so how long was it I buy a month so you went from it was about 2012 to 2015 where you didn't fight very often as it was a very infrequently was it because of the show nation of a lawsuit and the injury like back-to-back blows sew for 8 months you're rehabbing it and just still or when did you know that for sure you're going to be able to come back you got to turn the corner of rehab you know a three-month Mark being four-month Mark you kind of realized I'm good like I'm not where I need to be but like I'm headed there so wrong about that time about halfway through you realize that you're going to be okay it's going to take some time to fully get the string back leaving my next fight against Edwin Rodriguez like I still didn't throw it and I didn't realize I didn't know until I watch the tape I watched and you still think about injuries is weird like that 12-month period for me is always been like just like that sweet spot so I got to that 12-month. With the shoulder and I'm sitting over here right came to hand over hand writing 10 years the power in my right upper cut came back, I told this is getting better so after that then you started to see that thing flying started whistling and ironically enough my last fight that was the punch that started all the trouble for Sergey kovalev full attention because you were so successful with one hand you know it makes you wonder like what how God damn good with you have been if you have two hands or was it your left hand was so educated had to be you were so good at man was I have to tell you you noticed was using your job to shut down Southpaw Fighters shut down their job encounter you know when you just had that you had like extra juice with your left hand because you used it so bad to like when you have one hand or one arm that that functions really well-liked you learn to make that thing great like you know you overcompensate and that's what they left hand was over compensation because I didn't have the right hand to fall back on you know but the whole South part they shout out to my boy Nick and Nate Diaz liking all the work you've done and can't like thought those guys got me ready for a lot of my Southpark opponents like you know Midway through until the end of my career so a lot of work with those guys and specifically Nate at a certain point I stopped working with Nick cuz he was doing other things but Nate man and in the volume and have me like deal with the awkwardness and a height in the region like that got me ready for Chad Dawson opponents like you know Midway through until the end of my career so a lot of work with those guys and specifically Nate at a certain point I stopped working with Nick cuz he was doing other things but Nate man and in the volume and have not like deal with the awkwardness and a height in the region like that got me ready for Chad Dawson</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know one thing is always stood out to me about you was how composed you are and you rarely get emotional you know even like I remember when you fart Carl froch cough watch hit you clearly after the Bell clearly in a fight you were dominating you just don't like this you didn't get mad you didn't go f*** you you did nothing you took that punch this one turned it just went back to the corner like it never happened like you just just wiped it clean like that's not going to benefit me to get upset here how did you defeat that kind of composure I think one thing in my dad and Verge did really well for me and my brother Jonathan holbox from me for many years they gave us mental reps like like I be driving in the car or riding in the car with Virgin my dad and they be telling me listen man when you get in that ring when you spotted a million I do try to hit you while you make sure you get your respect you don't accept this in the rain like this is these are things I was taught I was like I was taught to be a warrior young age and oftentimes trainers with train the body but they don't train the mind so precious and also life experiences things that I've been through with my mom my dad and just just all that kind of stuff plus my internal makeup the way you know God made me all of that combined I never had to be the loudest talker in the room because I knew that all the all the stuff the real stuff is in me it's not on me so I'm the type that you hit me like that I'm going to smile at you we got another round of fights are so my my my anger might not get back imma get it within the confines of these rules but you going to feel me Colette knock me down all right but I got you everything and then I ate second that a couch again you feel all every emotion you can possibly feel but inside I knew like now you going to knock me out because I'm coming to get it so videmate some of it was taught and then throughout the course of my life and career I was I was given the mental red face and watch him right here watch how someone so pushed his hand down he got right back in his face. I don't remember in the teaching me and showing me and highlighting what a strong mind was and what a weak mind wasn't typically the week mine was the loudest talker don't get me wrong I love a guy that can talk to talk and back it up it's not a lot of those in the game now MMA or boxing so I'm afraid of the guy he's not saying very much the guy that's hard to read the guy we're trying to figure out manager what's up with him that's the god concerned about the loudest talker I used to get excited when guys used to just go over the top but from the time the first fight ended into the time the second second fight started I learn more about that guy in that. Of time and I did in any round that he said so much and I'm poking holes in them quiet I was just sitting back and everybody was misreading the silence car or scared he's not going to take the rematch I'm just thinking like you taking notes man just keep talking and he was just saying things like this is a weakness if you were still look like I won that fight I feel like they robbed me I'm coming back to get it and then went silent went dark now I'm like minutes the talkin to review a little bit too much about yourself what did you see from the time just excuse make it he didn't give me any credit he started I mean if it wasn't the written I'm exaggerating but just for the for the case of emphasis you know if the ring lights weren't too bright the referee was against them if it wasn't the referee it was a judge is that he never owned up to anything that he did wrong but if I go back to the research that we did about him before we even from the first time that line double what we heard the guy doesn't doesn't he doesn't take ownership of anything you blamed everybody anytime anything goes wrong he's a front-runner He's a Bully he says he's that that confirmed everything we had her so you're the crusher your Sergey kovalev you knock me down in the second round. XI the second round you were supposed to finish me sir the fact that we're even talking about a fight being closed the fact that I finished the fight that's bothering you that that that that's a chipping away at this whole Crusher thing that you've been that you've been living on and he couldn't handle it and instead of owning it he blame John David Jackson eBay mr. I blame that guy that's a sign of weakness man. Strength through the 8th round against yard and his last fight I wouldn't say impressed I mean listen he hasn't gotten what he's gotten by not being tough so generally speaking he's tough he's a tough individual to a point I wasn't surprised I was just I was like dude if you ever if a fighter is ever been Saved by the Bell you were just Saved by the Bell like you were a punch or a puncher to away from getting you know getting stopped in your home country and in your home your home City Hometown that was the only kind of like jarring part of it and then my next thought was can you recover is he going to be a physically recovered then psychologically come back and try to get back with you all took from him and around and you did that so he showed me that he still got something in there bees he was the right way to say it he's fading fast but he's fading right before I he doesn't have the reaction he doesn't have a still very good you still you still can be a lot of guys but he's fading fast if there's a Canelo fight on the table I think you should take it and ride off in the sunset man go enjoy your life well it was interesting how you expose them in a second fight because of the body shots the body shots have been a weakness like since then everybody kind of compromise his body they found what you found out is that something you knew going into second fight or did you know it in the first fight like when when do that in the first bite did you problem with me and they're in the first fight first couple rounds I was thinking too much and this dude came out fast I'm thinking I'm trying to get my range and he's a he's accurate I think in the right-hand I'm like I said bro said I was the best thing that could have happened to me like I said earlier and then you saw the body attack get Implement so that was always the game plan I won the second fight with everything that I did in the first fight like we unlocked the code in the first fight but people can get past a knockdown right a failed over to look at the you know the next 10 Rounds happened to me like I said earlier and then you saw the body attack get Implement so that was always the game plan I won the second fight with everything that I did in the first fight like we unlocked the code in the first fight but people can get past a knockdown right a failed over to look at the you know the next 10 Rounds</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> jet ski over the shark day of a show going off the rails the jokes are funny well its contextual but it's like I don't know I just have a hard time of this thing we do and you and I both know he's the guy that started he really is the guy who who started talking about s*** instead of just telling jokes started like talking about social problems and why is this and relationships and sadness and all kinds of weird stuff mean he developed a whole different kind of style of stand-up comedy but it's not funny because you are looking at something that happened in 1950 and 1960s just it's so hard for it to translate comedy unlike anything else loses its bow or its power over time because you and listen to like some even like red fox or something like really good great old stand-ups not that good even you know 50 years from now people will look back and be like that joke still funny accidentally told since then cuz I didn't know any better but it was about gay people that being gay is against a lot of key to cancel all dig so they put you in jail with a bunch of guys want to have sex with you is great yes, yeah I think it's things you you didn't like as soon as someone says that you're like I have always thought that you know they're just like vocalizing something you were never able to kind of put together and that had to be that in that audience and be like like you just kept doing it didn't give up didn't save 12v this is obviously not smart he kept doing it kept pushing the envelope George Carlin same thing you went to jail for it to crawling out of your skin is supposed to be the judge of whether or not something is good and if that's not the case then personal freedom we're not asking someone to like you know like someone's not going on stage and saying you know I'm going to Advocate you murder someone here is their address we're going to do it together let's meet up but we're not talking about that talk about someone cracking a joke and the audience laughs and they enjoy it and today even today when I get upset about someone something and listen to the audience laughing will they know it's a joke right there so they know it's a joke and they were laughing why do you have a problem with it you're not even there see if you just looking for problems and look at women in Saudi Arabia until you figure it out with that was my giant issue with Comics that we're going after Louis after that set was leaked only thing people should have been mad about that is that the set was leaked that should have been like you don't know where he's going to end up with that known for doing huge premises that you disagree with and then he convinces you why he's a right and a very funny way and tongue and cheek that's why they're talking in front of CNN he's he'll figure out a way to make that works is first I do is have been 10 months yeah let's see what you know that and I know that but there's a lot of people that don't even understand the mechanics of creating a joke that like a lot of times you'll go up and you'll have a promising that he might eat s*** without joke for a couple months before it really starts really starts catching years maybe even I've had that like now I'm coming back to cuz I was like I wasn't ready to tell it then and now I'm getting back to it I'm like okay maybe this direction 12 hours a day like he was doing the whole deal and his whole hour now is about this and we talked about him doing bits about that years and years ago he's like I wasn't ready cuz I might stand up wasn't good enough yet I didn't understand how to craft a joke yet yeah hopefully they were good enough cuz you really not going to and then once you do those jokes hopefully they were good enough cuz you really not going to get to revisit them for you to go back over your okay I put an album out 10 years ago and it kind of sucks I'm going to redo all those bits</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when do you have a life experiences the pool from people when they're like you know some people starting their teens and they turned out to be the best in the world Dave Chappelle but other people starting to teens and I'm like half some life first what are you telling jokes about I mean like I had like a whole career before I got into Stanford we were saying your career you were talking to me I used to work on Wall Street I got a job at Bear Stearns so trying to make it happen but 2007/2008 and JPMorgan for a couple mutual funds and separately managed accounts when do you think when did you when we're thinking about stand-up were you thinking about in the beginning before they're collapsed a bunch of friends of mine went to see a taping of SNL I have always been such a huge fan that afterwards are like how these people do this like how do you get here and I Google them and they all started in improv so I started doing improv I did that couple years and then any of my first improv class I was like whatever I just want more of this and then I eventually got into stand-up after that around 2011 but I was very much like you know like a very Taipei get good grades get try to do the best grade in the class type of person and I didn't really develop opinions or a point of view and so when I started doing improv I was like you know Morgan understand if I was like yeah how do I feel about these things like what do I think about them and like really just like I don't know it just that's how I was really when I feel like I started becoming a person personality before that I wonder if I would have been as curious if I wasn't staying up my curiosity is because I started getting curious about things because I wanted to be able to about different things like I am deathly much more observational in the world than I used to be but I'm also I might be a little like darker to like I remember things when I was a kid like I had I thought about what my wedding would look like as like a little girl and now the idea of having a wedding seems ridiculous like the idea of me and like a big dress walking down an aisle like there's none of that I could take seriously we're going to get married how would you do it I was just going to city hall and then maybe later I don't I don't know it seems weird to have a party right after cuz you're right let's see if this is going to stay some guy was kind of like gubsy on the road becomes your tour manager is a guy being really good at something so I yeah I think we'll that's the case with most women most women I think like guys are good stuff yeah yeah yeah and all those things are genetics normal women we like we're attracted to be exact same as the most dangerous to us like we like those men and so we make more dangerous men like we could decide to just only mate with like short soft boned men and make a whole generation of like killable syllables station that's against evolutionary biology it would have to be like women have to be like first we have to get women to agree on something which isn't but then also the law Heartlake height and weight is too high and they're like got to get rid of this one hold him in the tub that's not wise cuz time is not going to do that develop Hulk babies</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what is sober October group text done with Ari shaffir Bert Kreischer and Tom Segura is f****** ridiculous sometimes it's so it's sometimes it's so ruthless and so ridiculous just like what happened and there's three different conversations going on it's just really like being friends with women is a lot of work it's like you can talk to them about that just like either you can say to men but they're not going to have the end of discussion about it that you want it to happen you know like women what is ontology ontology child and be like but how did he say it like that. Like was there a. After the text is like the others are. Well then yeah I don't think that's good maybe sure I don't know they're sure she's mad yeah sure all right if you want to fight let's just do it now and not wait till we get to the restaurant when women have a lot of female friends because like out good for the other person you're dating or married to you should want your girlfriend to have a couple female friends so that she can have the conversation all of those discussions like he doesn't want to hear it he doesn't want to hear it have it with your girlfriends and then just talked to him about whatever else like or couldn't agree more with a husband and she's talking to her friend like oh my God so cute girl conversation hey let's have one conversation conversation thinks it's so nice to have like the girls just to be like the girl side of myself want to be why is that happen why is that even the standard like just let women be what we are and men can be what they are and then there's some people that do float in the middle but like why I think it all gets conflated with equal rights equality equal rights equal laws equal willingness to try different jobs those kind of things and then we decide that men and women are not any different and the disease are all cultural creations and these these are things that are concocted by Society bad for women when we say we're just the same as men because it's like you're saying with that sentence that men are correct and when you start finally start to think of us as men as the same as men now we're correct to yeah it's not an equality can you make all the people cuz it will never be equal to you you make every f****** human has ever made made in a woman's body this whole thing that was weird to me because it's some sort of a cultural creation that women are different than men that this is something that Society has sort of impose on women like not women different things like we just sometimes just like to be around each other would man I think sometimes just like I'm sure I can hang out with the boys no problem I grew up with older brothers you know like all I ever did was hang out with boys but now like I also see so much value and just getting to be with girls there's a lot of stuff that men like that women a lot of women don't have interest in this okay it's fine that's toxic toxic masculinity like all this nonsense we here today it's all exactly what we're talking about before with people trying to control people in to find people power I mean us being able to tell others what they can and cannot do or say is us just being like yep that's our power now we might never be better than white men you know but we can at least control what you get to say about us and I think as soon as white women are like yeah we do like to have control then we'll be like thank you let's dismantle all of this dare you tell black people how to feel about you know like what drugs we can and cannot say about black people did you ask any of them you know like I don't you see I'm sure you see where there's like white women with her arms crossed and then like when you start talking about race and then black people who are laughing and you're like they're like you should be able to tell jokes about black people like that it's like did you look indicated in office is so vastly different in the way of, communicates on stage in front of a nightclub it's so different that most people the vast majority of their day is under the spell of Human Resources standard of communication that's it's not how they want to talk they want to behave and think and also men and women working together is strange it's strange anybody says it's not strange never work with women and men together because people attracted to each other people get Petty people get jealous people get flirty people get mean people get controlling they Place social games with each other there's one night stand there's no like all of this is happening for a while and then they might hate each other but I still got to figure out how to work together I work in an office and my boss was really good looking and I was attracted to him and there was a chemistry and we started sleeping together like that's what I wanted and that it alright like yeah get married now the whole thing but take it seriously I'm kind of dating like jawless like kind of pushover guys and I'm like I'm like maybe they're the women I'm talking about they're like no I found these short so I found these soft books meant you no like jawless is one way to describe I know a lady who got a chinchilla up self to but it was one of those very unfortunate Chin's know and then she nor that well she told me she had chin implant was like what what is your what your jaw shape of her jaw should you go to ja reworked are you in order to get you to sleep with them it's not you you being some of the worst or someone is legitimately attracted to this guy and then you get together it still if I was running a company I'd say hey don't f*** each other you assholes I'm trying to make money have to say that it's in the rules and regulations would have to say but there's no way you can tell me that it's not possible for a man and a woman who work in the other in the guy's the boss and the woman Works under how many fall in love and they have an amazing relationship power over her basically prisoner give her half of that hundred billion dollars that he has and get her out of that Tower over you had saying that he wants you to sleep with him or making lewd, to make you feel disgusted what you show up to work and you're not interested in that person at all I want to do your job and they're making comments about your breasts are your legs your mouth or just like your mouth go to a man that makes him feel like a piece of meat like that like it like humiliated it's so hard to sexually harassment because they're in do so much of it would like it days do I get how many can I get does it depend on the performance depend on the performance I really know what I'm doing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> if you can get an inland sea salt it's better because it's not like it doesn't have potential as many potential toxins it's going to find like oceans how does that work was it an older C I wonder if what it is and it's it's just that these big salt so it is just like millions of years ago like they find seashells in Montana yeah yeah Utah earlier in the year where we were just all the Salt Lake and apparently that used to be on a underwater to and they'll find like shark teeth and stuff like that around there like an integer up on this light rail and then like there's no water inside think about that next time you see some assholes it's been 10 million dollars on a house on the beach it's where the water is in the water isn't yeah it is funny how we think of that though we're it's like me see the map now and we're like okay this is just how it is install actually refers to exclusively to Pakistani rock salt that used to be sea salt hundreds of millions of years ago so why don't we called Pakistan if I was Pakistani gummy outside in a little bit I was like wait know what's wrong with you but Merica what's wrong with you pretty clear that's what I forget you forget believing de Jesus you forget the USA you forget you forget the best in the world what happened to you what Jesus said what happened you not forget he's if it wasn't like there was some gay thing that was going on commenting on now I know it was a beautiful but he's he's so bad at English so bad easily could be don't forget Jesus Is It Go for Jesus don't forget Jesus only promise because what's wrong with you us say what's wrong with you you forget the number one Jesus what's wrong with you go back go back don't don't forget Jennifer Garrity is it don't forget Jesus says don't forget right closed caption first of all possible second you got to remember he's just got hit in the head. John 3:16 or 3:18 on a bandana around his head is Jesus not for gay Jesus people go for Jesus not forget Jesus you forget Jesus that increasing red meat consumption by replacing carbohydrates in the diet of individuals without anemia actually reduce markers of inflammation reducing replacing watch toy Elevate markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in humans need to study exist mean that doesn't fit either rcts random so they're actually controlling it instead of just looking at observational data which is subject to healthy user bias these are the study and then there's another one another RCT in women with anemia inflammation markers on a diet high in red meat or not significantly different from those on a diet high in oily fish and then there are also numerous please have paleo diets which contain meat and other types of animal protein and show that they decrease markers of inflammation including CRP randomized controlled trial showing reductions and interleukin-6 and also in tumor necrosis factor-alpha in his diet so all of this suggests is not the meat it's what you eat with the meat that makes the difference are we have studies of chlorophyll eating chlorophyll rich green vegetables Nationwide nitroso compounds with me you have lots of studies showing that when you eat plants along with the meat then you don't see the effects that you might see if you're just eating right standard American diet if an animal Foods are they said last time and is it as I've always argued I'm not a proponent of the carnivore diet I'm not a low-carb guy I'm not a keto guy might fundamental argument is just that the optimal human diet contains both plant and animal foods and this focus on individual food components or macronutrients like protein or fat or carbohydrate we've gotten too much it's called nutritionism it's just focusing on these individual elements and ignoring the overall pattern of diet quality which is the most important thing and that's what a lot of the more recent studies are showing when you look at the diet powder in the diet quality on its overall that's what actually makes a difference in terms of health and life span not how much of this fat how much of that fat whether there's no red meat or white meat or fish or whatever it's the pattern Washington kill himself maybe maybe this time he did if you had a house in Vegas I want to give you the odds he did come on 10% I would probably do you want more than 10 to 1 that he did kill him so I think there's only a 10% chance he killed for broken system well that's a defense defense is just we were incompetent not we killed him who knows that's what happened what's going on oops sorry yeah the cameras come on bro I have cameras at my house I'll never f****** off come on when the cameras rocks I've heard repeated a few times but not more recent at their there was screaming being heard from his self that someone heard screaming probably the biggest public conspiracy theory that most people believe in using most people believe it was a it was a hit I would say most people when you get there did you feel like everything's right like when you finally got to your place and you finally started when you walked 60 miles out there and started Living did you finally feel like I'm in my spot this is where I'm supposed to be oh yeah like you knew I had literally been planning to do exactly that in the Brooks range for 7 years like that's what I was doing everyday Was preparing to do that no it was it about it that was so compelling like why was that a thing that you were so drawn to because when I was living in the woods before that when I was in the teepee in Vermont every single day I wake up smile on my face I just be excited what was going on get up Lookout see the fog coming up off the water on the lake you know oh wow there's something over there is a loon whatever it is that I was just excited about what was going on out there and I just felt really connected to it and there are a lot of really positive aspects to being out in the woods I mean just the physical part like I like to stay in shape I like to be active and you can't have but be active out there you can't help but stay in shape I like the diet I mean once I started eating animals I kill myself and food that I collected myself in a plant food to it was that's the best food I ever ate my life when I ate that first motorcycle I mean I never had anything better it's a crazy way to live man it's interesting because most people tell you hey you got to get a job you got to be a normal person you can't just go out there and live yeah yeah well and that's what I told him I said I'm going to make a career as now I didn't know exactly how it was going to play out but I was always confident that it was a valuable thing to do and that it would not only benefit me but in the long run that I would be able to share this with people and that it would pay off and it did it just took time exactly how it was going to play out but I was always confident that it was a valuable thing to do and that it would not only benefit me but in the long run that I would be able to share this with people and that it would pay off and it did it just took time</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> family in this weasel to at the time by Sylvia at the time was out there with me yes she did a weasel weasel YY get that SeaWorld is telling me like you never going to find a woman to live like that out there but actually it's appealing to certain people I think a lot of people that's what people watch on TV people want to be free right now and people want to be alive and a lot of people don't feel it today it's true if you spend your whole life in an office or courtroom and before that you were in school you've never really damn in the grind the grind of just keeps showing up at the office every day and cases are piling up and next he knows you live with Glenn by side of a leg dodging wolves I enjoy talking to her like what a tough broad I'm not on the show anymore you know I know what happened with you and I showed you guys have a falling-out question about exactly a storyline that was for as I think I'm very popular with the fans every everybody that I talk to you I mean the viewers now you are my favorite guy I love it because people tell me that I really made a difference in their life like they learn something to get inspired they actually made changes in their life and I hear this all the time like yesterday traveling you know that's four different people come and talk to me about it and but I think I went about as far as I can go in the show cuz I was always pushing to tell stories or share things that didn't fit into the concept they had when you make a TV show you got a concept before you find a people put in it right and I mean Life Below Zero is a show about supposedly people live in a subsistence lifestyle in the bush and that's part of my life but there's a lot more to it and I'm always on a person who always trying to learn and grow and do new things and expand so when they met me I fit into their show like hand in a glove but I wanted to do more and I wanted to share more so I get bored you know I made I think I'm an 85 episodes of Life Below Zero I may Allah TV I wasn't satisfied just to show people what it's like to search for your food and chop down a tree in a free firewood to do more so I was always pushing to do stories that were a little bit out of the range for the scope of what they envisioned for me to do in the show I wanted to fly on a little 8-pound paraglider off the top of the mountain to get back to my Camp I've been dreaming about it for years and you know I said hey I'm going to do this I'm going to paraglide off this mountain I got a lot of resistance from The Producers about stories sound like that I did it and I was like I want to film this and that you know I hate if you guys don't want to sell that they didn't want to film that I'll get somebody else when I'm going to film this and I'm going to do this cuz I was excited about it they put in the Shell but I got a lot of you know resistance and I wanted to teach people all the time about things and that wasn't really maybe the best vehicle for I mean I had a blast doing the show I had an awesome time I learned a ton of stuff about making TV about all kinds of things and I made awesome friends Cameron some of the best people I've ever met in my life and overall had a great experience but I was always pushing the limits of what they really wanted to do I think because I want to make a story for example about finding a site where Stone Age people lived those very unpopular with the producers but we did it I mean I was just Adam I wouldn't that be unpopular that's so he said you look like you just walking around something to eat or chop something touched more trees first I was like no I've had enough trees on Kim I want to do something worthwhile I had to really twist people's arms to get on the show but the producer now this Stone Age site did you find it where was it not that we can get to right now it was like a doll story on TV about is amazing. I heard about it from somebody they've been in the 1970s he said there's a place where you can find stumps or Cobblestone acts like that's totally made long time you know these stumps were old like you could eat they were still standing you could touch him and you could knock him over there were like right on the edge like they might not be there in 10 years it was amazing but yeah this this this gentleman I know who grew up as a little kid out there with his dad his dad was a hunting guide they had been all over this area and he told me that there was a place where people had camped in their thumb rings of stones were they paid their skin Tans and they found the stumps that Cobblestone taxes and whatnot so we actually made it shows off my went with to Karen and we walk for a couple days just to get there from my Camp wow and then just go and buy this verbal description that he'd given me I was able to locate you told me about a game trail that and it was still there like that the animals are still following the same route you know and he said you get there you you turn this way you're going up in the mountains going to be there and off to the side you're going to see these stumps and sure enough I found the stumps on it was amazing how I got one of them Fairbanks I brought down with me that's so wild that it was just off of someone's description from the 1970s jackery coffee is an amazing man he he still lives in the Brooks range in a small village called wise man and he was somebody that I learned a lot from after I get to Alaska why is it was on the show as well wasn't it do didn't they film some stuff from that that part of the Erik salitan prior to the show Eric and I'd known each other for 10 years I met him not long after he came to Alaska is another really interesting guy he is yeah unfortunately Eric and I were friends and I kind of replaced him on the show that's what happened but you guys were together at the same time for a little while there was a little overlap before me then they found me then we overlap for a little while and then they get over there so they would just get rid of you if they decide they were they were born with your storyline there's other people living up there like that they just find them and office politics I think wasn't and also just differences and Creative Vision I mean I was not satisfied to just do the standard I'm starving I'm looking for firewood whatever stories over and over I was always trying to push it I was doing paragliding I was doing you know just exploring showing people are Stone Age people lived climbing mountains just for the joy climbing up and set up on top of philosophize about like those are I like to do and that really wasn't the vision they had I think that was a lot of it but honestly they never they didn't talk to me about it after they stopped working on that I still haven't talked to him about it so they just stopped yeah they didn't call you up and say they renewed my contract right they had an option to renew for one more year we shot one episode radio silence after 5 months I sent him an email and said hey what's up what's going on and I got about two lines back from a sad story the schedules off all we don't have any plans to film with you with the show producer tell me a couple years ago first of all I didn't work with producers in the field after the first year-and-a-half I said hey I can produce myself in the field I don't need to work with Bruce anymore and they went along with that so I'm responsible for my own stories as far as I'm concerned on the author Monster this mean a couple of cameraman and we're out there and I'm making what I consider real TV I'm sharing what I want to share nobody's feeding me lines nobody's tell me what I got to do I'm producing myself I'm working with awesome cameraman and we were due incredible things I'm a whole episodes of LBZ in the field just one cameraman and then we send all the footage back to LA and they work all their magic and edit it and everything and do what they want it but yeah I've made several episodes with just me and one care man out there but that's a lot of a freedom that's not normally given to people on reality TV from what I'm told and of course that costs intentions so they wanted to control you more oh yeah if you could guess you didn't like the kind of stories that I was going was really because I don't remember the details of that conversation but it was just a general tensional out I got a lot of negative feedback about what I was giving them and it was weird cuz people were loving it I mean people you contact with on social media let's get all modern last year's but yeah I got on Facebook and I got thousands of people you know giving me positive feedback when I travel anywhere we can go to Fairbanks again I was positive feedback to seem to me like the viewer is really like what I was doing but I did get a lot of negative feedback from certain particular people making the show that that wasn't what they really wanted they have a formula right in the formula survival really the formula subsistence survival finding enough chopping wood is really appealing it's one of the more interesting things about those kind of shows it's like what is it that's tapping in or what it was it tapping into what what what part of your ancient memory where this is like really exciting to people cuz I think there's a lot of folks out there like your lawyer friend or your opera friend that they just there's something about the idea of getting away from everything and just living away a more simple life it's it's it seems like the antidote for them so when you watch this on television and you see these people just chopping wood and living by the land and dealing with the dangers of living in the bush it's like there's something about it's like make it tuning every week yeah and I mean it is it's it's beautiful stuff to share I think it's it's awesome just for me I don't think it's the perfect vehicle exactly what I want to share because I want to go a little deeper I want more than you know like a 4-second soundbite and that's what I like about the Shoujo when I discovered your show is like wow there people that just sit down have a normal conversation rather than everything being chopped up an attitude new soundbites yeah you get a chance to really talk about stuff around just having a conversation time for 3 hours to get to really expand on your ideas and if you said something that you think maybe you didn't say it right you get to say it better or what I was saying was this and get to explain yourself expand and really get a thought across there's not a lot of places where you can do that in this world not know the reality TV shows your situation sounded like it was pretty much you producing it which would give you as much reality as you know they left in with but a lot of reality shows you know as well as I do they just set things up like a you're going to pretend like you lost your keys in that Lake you know my keys where's my teeth see bad acting like all my God and I know I know how it works I've done no shows before I know that there's someone who's always trying to set up these scenarios are scripted it's like sort of non-scripted scripted like they have a place to go to that haven't been used to see them on these shows you can tell when people are acting was like a weird feeling that you weird feeling that you got when you know this guy's opened up the storage shed before and he's opening up now wow when he got here like come on man you're a terrible actor this is awful but this something about these formulas of these people created reality television is a very strange animal</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> to me there's like cleaner meet and there's dirty or meet I don't really like to eat there a lot of people eat bears I've eaten the one grizzly bear that I ever shot I didn't shoot him cuz I wanted to eat in my Sean because I needed to shoot him but if I have caribou and moose I don't really want it and really ungulates is what I like to eat if you see the stuff that bears eat I don't know why people are so crazy about their me some people really like bear meat but I seen what bears eat and I don't really want to be embarrassed now rotten food while there's a couple things they can't have that can hurt you not too bad normally but a grizzly bear I mean you skin and I'm in the worms this long crawling out their ass and they got a lot in those worms can hurt you there you know Bronxville stay in urine test as I go into your brain in different weird places it's the eggs get into and they hatch cuz they're an unfamiliar hosted on the way to go into spinal cord to go all over the place where they do if that happens to a lot of kids like a roundworm normally it doesn't cause a bear too much probably just lose their intestines but if that larva if if you get an egg in you and that the larva doesn't know where to go he's an unfamiliar host in the act differently don't migrated weird places in your body like nervous tissue look in your eyes and stuff Jesus Christ yeah I'll look at that man in the eyeball and what do they do well I never got one in my eyesight is that look at that thing traveling around inside this person's eyeball that man's a lot of parasites you left your purse right there click on that fifteen worms and omigod their eyeballs overcome with f****** worms yeah I've had to deal with those words but not in me my God that's so insane I f***** parasites man so we're so many parasites creepy like I seen a lot of parasite but most of them won't hurt humans bridles are one that will in the one that's in the grizzly bear is just a slightly different variation from that one that's in raccoons is baylisascaris up there and kids up there and they were you know crowner that time playing and stuff and I just built this huge bonfire excited make sure no eggs the eggs are very resilient they can last for years and years in the environment they can survive being frozen all winter really oh yeah they're microscopic eggs that's what you got to worry about not the big warm you got to worry about the eggs I'll send you get those eggs in you scary s*** f*** that creepy crawly growing inside me then in my eyeballs into my brain tissue I have a buddy my my friend Justin Wren he doesn't charity called fight for the Forgotten and he builds Wells for the pygmies and we helped sponsor them and we do some things with them and he goes back and forth to the Congo like couple times a year and he went there recently and look 6 months ago and has caught a parasite that they can identify and they think it might be in his brain they don't know where it is but like your work out really hard and then you'll be shivering with like pale skin and you know the deed they're trying to do all these different things to him to try to eradicate the parasites and they don't even know exactly what he has because he's so deep into the jaw he's so deep in the Congo is going with a lot of Western people don't go so they're they're really baffled don't like we're not we don't know what the f*** you have he's had it for months and months and months and months of suffering and just it's taking a toll on him across the board every every aspect of his health is deteriorating because this is really creepy I've heard of people dying from parasites they picked up in the tropics you know so when you eat the wolf what when you eat the wolf what do you eat the back straps do you cook two hams like how do you how do you eat a wolf the only way that I like to eat a wolf as a boil it for a good long time cuz walls to we'll have parasites.

		<div class="paragraph"> been times when I ran out of food and I've literally tracked wolves and taking food away from them when they're killed Caribou yeah how many wolves were there one time there was a lone wolf that got a caribou just ahead of me he didn't have time to do anything except got it for me that's what they start eating its belly and pull the guts out in the whole caribous there why what happened that day I was really hungry we had run out of food I was out there with my ex-wife and we had your kids had one baby at the time so you are out there with a baby and you don't even have food the baby was fine she was nursing and your wife have any food yeah well we always had something to eat just not enough but I never ever have been out there when I didn't have something to eat every single day some days it was just one some days it was just one time again which is very little food but I've always been able to get something to eat but this particular it was kind of early on this was the winter 2006 2700 been out there that long made a miscalculation I was counting on Caribou shown up because so far I'd always seen a lot of care of in the winter that one of the income if I had known I could have prevented the situation but we're taking one moose in the fall I killed emotions Amber and I thought ma'am. 500 pounds of meat worse at the Caribou come later in the winter but it's amazing how much meat you can eat when you're not eating much of anything else and all that I was eating at that time really was Meet fat and maybe a cup of berries a day know that I've gathered in the fall and froze so the most we went through that pretty fast found out that two adults can eat a large bull moose in three months if that's all you got to eat ivy by myself of a large bull moose in 6 months for a large Bull Moose is about 2,000 lb you probably get 500 lb of Yukon moose is like two thousand pounds that one was actually 57 if I remember I don't pay too much attention to the exact measurements button somewhere in the range of 1500 lb which is like what how many pounds of meat you think that is I would guess that you probably again 5 600 pounds of meat out of there are you taking the the femurs and getting bone marrow out of them and doing all that child yeah oh yeah that's that's really important part of an animal is I like variety and they analyze a ton of writing one Caribou will give you so many different options in terms of food if you know how to utilize I didn't everything have a caribou except the poop literally you can eat part of the antlers when their own in the spring when they're growing their soft on the end it's like a pickle you skin them you take the Velvet off in the last intro to it's just that the consistency of a pickle look great raw animals ride a lot of parts of a caribou draw but anyway you get a lot of rides Utah the organs eat the eyes eat the brain you to the liver the brain spinal cord you can get all kinds of variety and it's nutritious is good for you I mean I learned about all this from the old people that used to eat this way I went to I would have been reluctant to eat certain things if I I hadn't been educated by other people that you can do is I'll talk to his nine-year-old woman in Fairbanks you know and I asked her so you eat the brains cuz I'm thinking you know mad cow disease prion disease there's Parts in Wisconsin where my friend Doug during those we're being a 50% of the deer they they test test positive for CWD real fatal disease and hasn't made the jump to humans yet but they're very concerned and you know this is coming from the deer like you said there's a lot of deer and where deer and moose live together the moose get we don't have any deer other than moose and Caribou that's why we don't have the preonic disease and just do deer up there at all unless it's too hard of a wow so you when you take this Caribou away from the wolf how does that go down what happened that day text remind me I forgot last talked about I had a trail up the mountain this lot of snow in the winter you know to three feet of snow you got to have pack trails to walk efficiently pack them down snowshoes and stuff in pretty much follow the same route I'm following my trail to go up the mountain looking for food that day and I came on there no care where I can find a caribou anywhere Inc Caribou track for like months their migratory and if they happen to migrate 10 the way I'm not going to see him I come on a track of one Caribou it's wounded is bleeding is being chased by one wolf and across my trail so I start Jason it was real fresh it was snowing out and I could tell this is just happened was injured Caribou this wolf is chasing it up this mountain the right ahead of me I got to follow this stuff you have a rifle my rifle my constant companion I mean rifle goes just about everywhere I go up there so I start jogging up the mountain as fast so I can go 5000 foot mountain and this this Caribou is wounded pretty badly bleeding almost continuously you know and it's clear to me that if he doesn't make it over the top of that mountain this was going to get him I mean going down the other side I don't know about this wolf has is Caribou this is usually the way that they in Jerome and it takes time is how it is run out to knock them down I see a lot of injured on the the big muscle on the back legs at what you mean hamstrung a real bad That Got Away they get away with Google likes it couldn't walk anymore but anyway I start chasing them up the hill to kind of zigzagging up the hill in this terrible obviously doesn't know this mountain it doesn't know where it's going it heads in a direction where there's some Cliffs on the other side of this Ridge and I'm getting real hopeful at this point and I still haven't seen him there ahead of me on the mountain and sure enough the tracks come right up to the edge Cliff both the caribou and the Wolf and go right over the top of the cliff and I'm like there's no way that Caribou survive getting. Cuz I know this mountain like the back of my hand and I just sat down there and I listened and I sat there at the top of the cliff and Sharon office real quiet out there in the winter the Arctic is just like dead silent and I start hearing the crunching in the snow this wolf you down in the Ravine and he knows I'm up there he can sense the the top of the cliff and he wants to to bug out of there at that point and he just walked up the other side of the Ravine I'm looking across the Ravine and I see the wolf going up and I know hey that Kara was down in that Ravine somewhere so he's just getting away from you by then because you you would shot quite a few wolves not times but we had a show at one time on the lake or it's frozen and German with me that was actually that story was told on the show and I documented a little bit as much as I could with my little camera at the time that day I shot through walls but that was a very unusual situation that was those walls were actually trying to get me which is almost unheard of but this was years before that this wall and like almost every other wolf encounter I've ever had every other wolf encounter I've ever had the wolf wants nothing to do with you and then world knows I'm dangerous will they know you're dangerous are they having any interactions with other humans walls notice all across North America I've only been able to find two documented Bonafide e cases werewolves have killed humans in North America in recent times it was this one guy young guy up in Saskatchewan several years ago there was one woman in Alaska apparently was killed by will say almost never happens they just know that people are dangerous they've been persecuted I mean they were bounties on Moses I think it's in their DNA now you know all wild animals grizzly bears didn't want to do it peacefully 99.9% of the time it's interesting you saying that grizzly bears are there haunted don't want anything to do with people they're having a real problem crazy bears in places like Montana where they don't hunt them right where they don't have any fear many many generations of no fear of human beings and you getting a lot of me thanks cuz that yeah I wouldn't be crazy about walking out the national park we're not allowed to bring a gun yeah well my Montana particular a lot but it was about three four hundred yards from me when he got up to the top of the ridge he's stop way way up high above I remember looking at him through binoculars or maybe it was a scope on my rifle I just remember giving a Yelp he laid down on the ground when he knew he was safe way up there and he just gave me yawn and I could see how long is just like a dog it seemed good this Ian like you just climbed up this big mountain in about 10 minutes you know so I just walked around the cliff went down in there.. Caribou I actually made a backpack out of rib cage carry home and it was like 25 below pretty brutal form up on the mountain then I'll have you was it I don't know a lot of things in a way but I'd say 50lb something like that you know obviously don't take all of that weight at one time with me I carry as much as I can't did you have backpack that like a pack frames I had a frame and I just stuffed everything in the remember it was so cold and I was so tired up there running up this mountain the when is dark it's dark up there there's no sun in the winter I just remember getting the head off that thing throw in the legs and stuff in the in the rib cage and throw it onto that frame I had it was all inside of the big rib cage still at the skin on it and everything was a wolf watching the whole time he was up on top of the mountain. I wasn't paying close attention to him after I don't know how long he hung out there I would think that you would want to keep an eye on that f***** going 8 or 10 miles when the snow is deep enough they start walking single-file in every wolf in the pack steps in exactly the same track and their stride when they slow down to a walk like that is just right for me I can step right in the truck don't you need snow shoes no you can't you can't keep up with their normal gait their trotting you can't even come close to that if you're in good shape you can jog behind wolves all day long I followed walls I thought a pack of 12 volt one time 8 or 10 miles there hunting Caribou right in front of me there's another time I remember taking Caribou me away from a pack of wolves which I didn't even see that killed the Caribou but you know there's a lot of brush and different stuff around I discovered it because Ravens flow up off that I went over there and judging by the tracks are half a dozen rolls around I took that Caribou got time brought it home and ate it but I had a lot of interactions over the years of the wolves and I never had wolves act aggressive to me I had my Curious I've had him act scared I've had him act indifferent I never had wolves act aggressive to me until that time January 2012 on a pack of 20 wolves literally took after me out on the lake and I did shoot three of those wolves and what was that about why do you think they were taken after you it was a very unusual situation first of all there were 20 walls in one place that's unheard-of up there that's totally unheard of the largest pack of wolves never heard account of that Far North with 17 wheels and I was back in the 1970s usually there's 5 6 Waltz in a pack up there it's real hungry country's hard for them to feed themselves at the packets bigger not that split up but I don't know what happened that you're out of two packs combined I don't know if the pact is brutal outside but it was on her up anyway I'm up on a mountain I look down at the lake since January it's just Twilight in the middle of day Isis big brown spot on eye how's that sound from my cabin about 500 yards big brown spot first I thought it was water overflow that comes up to the ice sometimes when you get a cracked I got the binoculars I'm looking in holy cow that's a giant pack of wolves that just took something down on the lake I can see like one of those breaking off ones breaking off and then coming back over and I I realize what's going on that there was very little snow that you're even though it's January I've been cold since September but very low precipitation is only about maybe four or five inches of snow so I could literally run down the mountain I was down at the lake within 20 minutes and I went right to my cabin I got my camera I got my tripod I'm like this is phenomenal I got to document this and I start walking across the lake out to where they aren't to get pictures of this so I get about 350 yards from these walls I still don't know what the animal is that they got there and you know I can hear you can hear bones break and stuff the wolves and I'll just amazing and I start taking pictures and I run out of batteries I'm like so I got to go back to the cabin that's like a hundred fifty yards behind me when I get about 30 yards or so from the cabin I look back over my shoulder and a whole goddamn pack of wolves it racing across the lake straight toward me nothing like it I sprinted Like Jesse Owens for the door that Kavanaugh is only 30 yards from it I turn I look back out the window and these walls came right up into my yard over 50 yards from the front door 20 wolves wolves are usually hightailing it out of there when they see people so I get my new batteries I get the camera set back up I go back out by the time I get back down the yard there by this thing of killed like 500 yards away and I want to get more pictures of this I got my rifle to a course so I start heading back over when I get about 350 yards and then I start taking more pictures I got a great picture you can pull it up baby I see that in the notes section on my Facebook page has a story and unusual occurrence with the walls anyway they're all eaten and I start taking pictures again and after I take some pictures first one and two to three the wall sister likes I can see they stop eating in there looking at me like 350 yards away by can you see that they notice them back out there on the lake and they're size me up kind of and I see someone we're just really slowly moving toward me like walking a few steps and stop and I'm thinking yeah I got my rifle and everything but there's a lot of wolves are how do I know they're going to stop when I start shooting you know so I decided maybe it's best just make a slow Retreat and I started and walking back toward the cabin in the walls it look like they were slowly walking towards me as I'm walking towards the cabin when I got about if I remember right it was a hundred yards from the cabin both walls started Galloping they just all 20 wool started Galloping towards me and I dropped that tripod right there where at where I was and I know I was a hundred yards from the cabin they were 400 yards for me and I ran as fast as I could for the cabin cuz I thought hey if I start shooting what if they don't stop the one it's 20 was there for five rounds of me that's why I had one in the chamber I had five rounds of ammunition just like the time before they're right there in my front yard and they're 50 yards away they're all Milling around Folsom Lake Jesus Christ this is amazing I've never seen anything like this so but I'm safe and sound in the cabin so I just collect my thoughts and like man it's time to teach these walls a lesson if I let those walls leave now they're going to think I'm just food I run away when they see me right now. I mean I could be out there in the night in the dark not even the walls around getting ambushed by so I had to shoot some of those walls hold up, make sure everything was perfectly right you know I put some extra ammunition in my pocket checked everything out okay I'm set to go out there with this gun and and talk to these walls about the situation and I go back out and they were back at the Moose but it turned out to be a moose they'd killed they were back over there at the kill so I thought would be a lot safer if I shot from close to the cabin you know rather than go out there on the open eyes so I'll just see if I come back over here and I started running back and forth right in front of my cabin on the on the ice just to get their attention and sure enough it worked that whole pack of 20 will started racing across that lake at full Gallop straight toward me I couldn't believe it was right in front of my cabin I just run back and forth like 50 yards out to my little water hole in the ice and back to the cabin a few times and they just started running right at me so I sat right down there on the bank on the shore right you know 15 ft in front of my porch and started shooting I think if I the first one I had was 264 yards and measured it all off the next day what kind of interesting just checking out the tracks and seeing what happened I hit three of them yeah what happened when one got hit they stopped at the closest Trax to me we're about 40 yards you know I remember reloading after I shot five times it all happened so fast but then the next day when I had time on out there looked all tracks and measured everything is size up situation figured out where I'd hit different walls and stuff and I wrote that all down that's what I was mentioned in the notes section are my Facebook page story because I wanted when it was fresh in my mind to really have the details cuz I knew right then that something happened to me that doesn't really happen to people I mean to get have a pack of wolves come after you is a very unusual occurrence read all over the place that wolves don't attack humans you know I've read that many times but they have they have at least take at least dorkly whole Little Red Riding Hood that's all because they were trying to warn children about wolves now when you found these wolves and you like when you start shooting and you hit one to the other ones freak out if they realize what's going on at the summit they started putting on the brakes but like I said the first wolf I hit was over 250 yards in the 264 yard something like that from me and some of the tracks came about 40 40 to 50 yards from me before they start their doing U-turn you could see if they're all just Milling around when I was reloading I just remember seeing all these walls Milling around in front of me like running around in circles and I was like holy cow I'm reloading and I remember shooting one more time as they were headed away but they all took off the into the woods and one of the wolves that I had hit was paralyzed paraplegic but he was still going on two legs so I ran into Adam yeah I ran into Katt the other the other two I just dropped immediately wanted was hit right ahead but I ran in the cabin, 22 so you want to put a big thirty-ought-six hole in this this world those paraplegic and I chased him down caught up with him and show him the 22 then I can hear all the other wolves howl and how you know probably almost in the woods on the other side of Lake and I just ran to her I ran over to that what they killed in this was the first time I saw it was a year-and-a-half-old bullmoose and it was still all their the legs were still on and I got pictures of it stuff they just started eating and how long before I started folder pictures on your Facebook not of that moose they put those on LBZ I think with LBZ Life Below Zero that's a different moves so so when you find the wolves that you did shoot and you know you've your shot until three of them yeah you eat them if I can help it one out there I want to do when you find the wolves that you did shoot and you know you've your shot and killed three of them yeah delete them if I can help it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> perfect people don't know what to Life Below Zero it's this crazy show where people live in this very rugged terrain and you you and you're the most interesting life cuz you when you would live up at the cabin you would live by yourself just you and a very small room just hunting all your food and then hiking around you didn't use any vehicles and you just kind of had a rifle enough frying pan or pot and a place to sleep and you seem really happy up there oh yeah I'm having a good time I just wanted to strip everything away that I could dispense with you know I got the idea I wanted to go back to living like a hunter gatherer back in 97 I just got this idea I was actually living in a tent in the woods down in Vermont having such a good time I thought where could I go with this what could I do with this kind of lifestyle and I decide to move to the Brooks range of Alaska live in a tent in the first place I just like the outdoors I just love nature and you know I was doing other things too but there was this one summer when I was in my twenties when I found this really cool spot in the woods and I thought he'll set up a teepee over there and I'll just hang out there this summer as much as I can and I just had a great time so I started thinking more about you know instead of just living in the woods kind of has a recreational thing I started thinking about how could you actually make a life living like this it'll get up every morning with the a.m. surround the sky the water I started thinking about it started reading anthropological stuff about hunter-gatherers that summer and I started getting ideas and it took me seven years to make it to the Brooks range in to get out to that Lake that you've seen on TV and actually start living that way it took me a few years just to organize my life enough to move up to Alaska and then once I got to Alaska I was kind of in Fairbanks for about four years before I could really spend long periods of time but once I got it all arranged I just drove up the Hall Road which is this Industrial Road that goes up to the North Slope oil fields is very very unimproved in Aries just Gravel Road for hundreds of miles I drove about three miles north of Fairbanks I park my van and I walked 60 miles off of that road by myself out into the Wilderness and started figuring out how to live off the land how did you know where to go before I had actually like flying around in a little Bush playing just part of my plan originally when I formulated this idea back in Vermont I thought I'll become a bush pilot that'll be a thing I can do in Alaska and so I was thinking about starting to hear taxi service I've been studying flying for Fears as soon as I got my private license I jumped in the planet Pluto Alaska but then when I got up there I was getting my commercial and all that and in the meantime as much as I could I'd go out and explore look around and I discovered this Lake one day when I was flying part of the Brooks range and I set up a little tent camp there that summer 2000 but it took me another four years before I could actually walk out there and start living 60 miles walking that's a long f****** way when I was 13 years old convince my mom to drive me back down and drop me off alone where we had given up the year before but just you by yourself yeah when I was thirteen but that's a trail that's called The Long Trail and it's Mark there's a little paint marking on the trees up ahead of you tell me where to go yeah Brooks reinell 13 yeah that's a little kid yeah go I went back a few times but yeah I mean I never I never finished the fourth grade tell you the truth but your high school did you ever get a GED I like to be learning all the time whatever I'm doing I like to learn but if I'm making a TV show I want to learn everything I can about it you know if I'm flying airplanes I want to learn a lot more than I need to know to do what I'm doing and it's the same thing with the going out there and living just learning as much as I could how much so much to learn out there. How long did it take you when you're thirteen oh well that was easy I mean I remember going once or twice with some uncles my we never got anything I never I didn't have any real honey experience until that summer I walked out to the lake really yeah so you really just had a rifle and I don't quite know what you were doing I've read a lot about what to do the biggest thing I got out there I had two months food I left two months worth of food at the lake okay to get me started and I walked out there in July 2 months food like what did you bring all I had left basic stuff grains legumes some beans some rice stuff that you need to survive a good oil you know basic sunflower was out there and I left that the year before when I had a plane my whole plan to become air taxi and and do the bush line at that time I realized this doesn't go together with living off the land and wellness so I actually sold that plane that summer and drove up the road and walked out to where I had left these supplies here before and decide that's what I really want to just go live off the land I don't I don't need an airplane anymore I don't need to fly so when I get out there was a 55 gallon barrel and had some food and it had a few supplies I had a tent you know it was insulated but if it hadn't really become a cabin yet it's the same place that you've seen but it was just a little little solid back then in the cabin as it stands you built yeah I flew in the plywood and stuff and then when I get out there I put I put I had to Walton originally I had a tent camp out there since 2000 I built plywood cabinet under the wall 10 basically what I did but when I get out there I had some food I have my rifle I have fishing equipment I started Liv and I started improving that little cabin you know and by September I ran out of food like complete I had one bag of flour to slow plastic bag of flour that was all I had left when it got cold enough so I figured I could start moose hunting so that was my plan I got to get it moves why just wait till it got cold this regulations bugs you got to preserve the me a freezer have to wait until like I still do when I hunt Moose my moose hunting season starts today I can leave a piece a scrap of meat out on the ground all afternoon and go look at it as no flags on it that makes sense wow that's crazy so you have to do other than the rifle aspect of it. Mean you're really Living Like A Primitive hunter-gatherer to use the bow and arrow if I thought I could have survived there's a spot right there it is everything I could I could do without but I never got to the point where I thought I could make it with just a bow and arrow myself you know people used to survive out there before they even had archery they survived out there was Spears but there were groups of people they would build a fence they would Corral animals then they would put nooses up between trees to get a move things like that is also probably a lot more animals I don't know that to be the case maybe not Alaska Alaska probably not too much different but throughout North America what can you listen to or you read rather the tales of Boone and Crockett Lewis and Clark when they made their way across the country like they found lot of game there was a lot of animals Muse just an abundance of animals and of course if they ran into Buffalo obviously there was millions and millions of Buffalo unbelievable that's the difference between debrecen over Alaska still wild northern Alaska is the most wild place left in this country that's why I went there is barely this country to give me sun even attached some people don't really think of Alaska's United States it's not but it's not it's a frozen Puerto Rico its way up there but it is actually the first time I ever saw the Brooks range was years before the last guy was on a flight I used to get jobs as a courier when I was in my twenties I was really interested in traveling and I found out this way I could travel all over the world as a courier so I would go to New York City I get these jobs as a freelance Korean take off to wherever they need me to go and one time I got this flight to Tokyo and I'm flying right across the whole length of Brooks right great circle route New York Tokyo takes you across it 600 miles of mountains from the Canadian border over to the she see across from Siberia and there's one road across it in 600 miles and I was just glue to the window the whole flight looking at that I thought someday I'm going to go check that place out on the ground you know I mean it's incredible when you see those mountains after 9,000 feet high and that one rose the hall Rhode Hall Road also known as The Dalton Highway that was built in 1974 just to construct the Alaska pipeline to get to the oil up at Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope Doyle stop there they built that road in one Summer's Amazing Story in itself wow yeah they started in April and they had the whole thing done once Summer from the Yukon river all the way up to the Arctic Ocean so when you got down to one bag of flour was there a part in your head we like what what am I doing here no I never wondered what I was doing oh no oh yeah had that whole shed built ever meet a shed for me will it what's that thing that you do will you have everything like Basalt without the sod house ya know that came that came like four years later and I built that with a piece of parachute cord and a a little block and tackle that you can fit in the palm of your hand they just had parachute Corunna and I had to get well that big it's actually talked about that platform that's right beside meat pole rent to meet pulls 25 to meet pole is so that they know just that's like my freezer I don't have a freezer out there so I just hang meet up and I live in the freezer the artist your freezer from September until usually sometime in May I can keep meet with about anything other than the open-air around it and it's a long time yeah it's most of the year yeah the Lakes only thought out from June until most years around the first of October freezes over so you about 4 months old water by 8 months of ice so you basically living off of fish for those months know there was one year when I caught a lot of fish there cuz I stayed there I Stay 1 * 15 months without going to town and buy yourself no I was only there for four months totally by myself but I'm not totally crazy I went back out and and I got my woman to come in there with me after she's totally crazy I went out there you know I actually was I got married before I went out there I went out there for four months I went back I guess Sylvia my ex-wife and we were out there for years you know we would go back and forth we would go to Fairbanks for 6 months or sometimes a year would go out there for a year you know we would done go back and forth and then what happened was after we split up I was out there one totally alone and that's when I get on the show right after that it all just timing was perfect but I'm up there by myself I'm living real close to the land I mean I'm sleeping under Caribou hides that winter and I'm eating just Caribou like I had a little tiny bit of store-bought food with me hardly anything and I haven't seen a human being at four and a half months executive producer of the show flights from LA all the way up there to meet me and Lance were there the summer before I was in Fairbanks and for a few years I was trying to figure out how can I share this stuff I'm experiencing cuz it's incredible I'm just I'm realizing that this is not ordinary life anymore and there a lot of people that don't even realize what's going on out here in the middle of the Wilderness so I'm talking to people I'm trying to find some kind of a filmmaker somebody and I don't know anything about it but I'm trying to find somebody to help me do something like a documentary or something like this so my friends know this somebody handed me a email address they said you should write to this person they're looking for people like you they told me it was a filmmaker I didn't know what it was I sent off an email I said hi you know I live in the wilderness I'd like to talk to you about if you're interested making a documentary and few days later I started walking from the road again to get back to my Camp so I left them a satellite phone number I said this is my only means of communication it's a satellite phone I don't keep it turned on because it runs on a battery you can send a message to it I check it once in awhile it's basically for emergencies only but you can communicate with me this way and I put that in the email how to do it well. I hadn't heard from people and then one day I turn on my phone the one talk to me so I called him up and we start talking and they tell me it's a reality TV show and I had literally never seen a reality TV show in my life I am watch TV for many many years and so you have no idea what that meant not really I talked to him about that but they mostly didn't they mostly want to talk about me not about them and I kept trying to get information what is this cuz I kept I remember I kept saying what I really want to do I want to talk about nature out here and they're like well we don't want to make a show about a show about you but in any case I learned what reality TV was over the next few months because after we talked for two weeks the executive producer flew all the way up from La he flew from Fairbanks on a little ski plane out there to meet me and he landed in that me to make sure that I wasn't just bullshitted ever talk to they had no idea I mean they're just talking about satellite phone and I was telling him okay you know right now I'm living off these two Caribou I killed last month in and it came out then they saw that it was real and they were like yeah we want you to show wow in a few weeks later we were making TV so they had to come out just to check to see if your story was legit yeah that must have been very surreal for you the guy lands out there some Hollywood jack off comes out to visit you when you're doing your Wilderness thing convergence of Worlds there's no world that's more removed from the world of living by yourself in the woods then Holly that's like the most opposite of it in some ways but we're all human yes we're all human and we had a great afternoon together we had an awesome afternoon together so she could take him and show him your routes and all the places where you go it was in April I had a pack Trail on the snow that's still winter where I am and I took him out for a walk up onto a mountain side so I can get a view of the whole country there and it just happened that the first Leslie track I seen that spring to come out of hibernation was right there in front of us that the bear had hit my trail and was walking down my pack Trail right in front of us it was that day totally fresh track so that was exciting and the bear no we didn't see the bear it headed up the mountain is walking lot faster than we were but we saw a lot of a beautiful things that day and you know I shot a Sizzle reel and he brought it back for the network to see you in everything wow anybody out there to wear all these by the time this happened I've been out there for nine years off and on you know I'd had my camp out there since 2000 actually and I've been kind of live in there at least half the time for 9 years again to know that country so well all the mountains are blocked some days 20 25 miles over 5000 foot mountains and everything hunting sheep hunting caribou and just looking around trapping sometimes but always alone why was this life so appealing to the young age like the fact that you're 13 years old and make that walk all the way across Vermont but I mean that's that's a long-ass walk you know I grew up in a small town right near the base of the highest mountain Vermont Mount Mansfield and some of my earliest memories are looking at that mountain wanted to go up there and I got to the Top Mountain by the time I was nine but it took me nine years has to get up there things take time Adam reason you're drawn to being in the wilderness I'm drunk a lot of things but the Wilderness definitely one of them when you get there did you feel like everything's right like when you finally got to your place and you finally started when you walked 60 miles out there and started Living did you finally feel like I'm in my spot this is where I'm supposed to be oh yeah but you knew I had literally been planning to do exactly that in the Brooks range for 7 years like what I was doing everyday Was preparing to do that it was it about it that was so compelling like why was that a thing that you were so drawn to because when I was living in the woods before that when I was in the teepee in Vermont every single day I wake up with a smile on my face adjust the excited what was going on get up Lookout see the fog top off the water on the lake you know there's something over there is a loon whatever it is theirs I was just excited by what was going on out there and I just felt really connected to it and there are a lot of really positive aspects to being out in the woods I mean just the physical part like I like to stay in shape I like to be active and you can't help but be active out there you can't help but stay in shape I like the diet I mean once I stop eating animals I kill myself and food that I collected myself in a plant food to it was the best food I ever ate my life when I ate that first motorcycle I mean I never had anything better it's a crazy way to live man it's interesting because most people tell you hey you got to get a job you got to you got to be a normal person you can't just go out there and live yeah yeah that's what I told him I said I'm going to make a career as now I didn't know exactly how it was going to play out but I was always confident that it was a valuable thing to do and that it would not only benefit me but in the long run that I would be able to share this with people and that it would pay off and it did it just took time exactly how it was going to play out but I was always confident that it was a valuable thing to do and that it would not only benefit me but in the long run that I would be able to share this with people and that it would pay off and it did it just took time</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now did you run into any issues where you really didn't have any vegetables other than the the bicycles in the stomachs of the animals gate you're just eating meat did you run any health issues just living off of meat I've eaten a very high-protein high-fat diet for long periods of time and I think that there's a lot more to food and nutrition the reason I was eating that way had nothing to do with me thinking that it was the best. the reason I was eating that way is because I just wanted to live as close to the environment as possible and that's what was available so I know some people is thinking well this is a really healthy diet maybe just maybe doesn't but that wasn't my motivation when you had a good amount of it what I felt was that if I eat too much meat that had bad effects what kind of Bible my body start to feel weird I believe that you can only handle so much protein but you can handle a lot of fat what I found is a head to eat most of my calories for fat I would eat a half a pound of solid purified a day when I was eating just meat and fat I might eat two or three or even four pounds of meat a day but but like a half a pound of it was pure fat but it was a form of it was a bear fat or where you getting fat from it would be moose fat it would be sheep fat something one year air fryer fat is weird right cuz it's a different Caribou chewy fat like a deer fat so it's not render down like a beef Atwood Musa what's different about it is that those game animals do not put fat within the muscle right it's separate if you get a fat Moose Hill have a big fat layer on his back until you would run to that fat or however that's how you doing me all you know when I'm butchering a moose in the field I start eating the fat right there really grabbed it off the kidneys and stuff and start eating it so that was a key for you was to get enough to eat a lot of fat and then I would feel better if if you're just eating protein for me it didn't work like what would how did make you feel so I can't drink enough water water whenever I look at how to drink enough water I drink a lot of water I feel kind of like just a weird feeling inside I mean it I also it was working really hard physically those times but I definitely drinking more than a gallon of water a day sometimes almost 2 gallons of water a day when I be liking real cold weather climbing mountains and everything eating meat fat all the time yeah I've been drinking a lot of water and the other thing is really poor like when I hear people talking about how they eat a high meat diet or ketogenic diet now and they're just eating beef I wonder you know what they're doing for variety because for me I was eating all different parts of the animal all the different organs and things and also a lot of that eat raw or half dried for example is one of my favorite ways to eat Caribou meat when I was eating you know this meat fat diet and now I eat more vegetables and fruits and I still like to eat a lot of meat but I do eat more vegetables and fruits you feel better that way personally yeah I like more I like variety I like a mixed I mean I felt good when I seen that stuff but like I say I would I would not feel good if I was just eating steaks everyday if I was just eating steaks everyday I would I would feel strange but if I took a crap and I just sliced up fan and hung it over the wood stove and left it there for half a day or something to give you no dry on the outside but it's still be raw inside that stuff was delicious I be like candy for me I just pig out I love that emoji with the crust eat it you mean in the crust on big pieces that have been hanging around all winter turn into Vegas fed the animals crust that cuz that's where the oxidized blood is dark for some reason like that around the shank on on a big animal like a moose when you're cutting it up into smaller pieces the crust looks so clean and everything down there you can eat it like dry meat but most of the crust on most of the big sections of me get black and they get I would not get to that food that gets like if it's not the same as dry meat that you take a fresh piece of meat and dry it for a few days this is coming from a guy the contents of animal stomachs so I trust you when it's not food don't eat it not that not that black crust that it's just it's oxidized blood yeah yeah I haven't even been able to eat the blood from too busy but that's the thing is that you can eat the stomach you can eat the intestine you can eat to call and I'll be in the: you can eat the lungs even you can eat spleen I've eaten all the stuff but the truth is if you're one guy working on butchering a moose you have a hard time getting all that stuff preserved and prepared you know cuz it's like if you want me to call and you want to get the s*** out of it fast before it gets hard like what is the colon of a moose taste like what you do if you want me to call them mooses old guy who's married to ask mom told me this and it works you are you got to work fast when you when you take the colon out of your next dog try to stop chill turn it inside out the poop on a tall stalk turning inside out like a sock okay you got the outside you got the inside out with all smooth you know how the outside of the colon and large intestine is full of fat like on any animal you lose all his Fat Albert that's going to be on the inside now wash that you don't take it home and wash it good to get the lining all nice and clean and you slice it like donuts fried up what it taste like delicious does anything that resembles that would resonate with people it's like to Adonis fat yeah I'm saying there might be for other people that know what that tastes like some Village in northern Alaska and cut off people old people find old people eat stuff like the grown-up 78 year old native people</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> brother animals are you we were you hunting when you're up there anything unusual for big animals the only the only thing around is Moose you terribly. 11 Grizzly I shot one Grizzly that was becoming a problem that night I had a moose in the camp my wife and little baby were there it's time to my and my daughter was only 3 years old and my son was just months old in this most was there I just killed it a week or so before and a Grizzly was coming around at night trying to get that moose meat and I chase it away a few times and it kept coming back and eventually I shot right over the bear trying to scare it off to sometimes out of work if just chase him off doesn't work and but it still it was walking toward me to 16 yards when I shot it got it wasn't run it wasn't trying to get me but he was I just couldn't have that bear hanging out there trying to get that moose that I had there in the camp so you shot him and ate him yeah what was that like all the fat was unbelievably good man the meat for me bear meat like it says not my first choice I liked it but I'd only have a desire to eat it once every four or five days you know it's not like some I want to eat pounds of everyday the way I can just different the fat was unbelievable it stunk terrible like I took all the the fat out of the internal abdominal fat and all that stuff too and Boyd it is smell bad just like beer guts you know it just stung and I remember Sylvia saying you going to eat that stuff like that I don't know try it so I rendered it and you know just heated it up until it liquify Antoinette back down no bad flavor at all it was like almost tasteless has the mildest fat you've ever had really yeah that cured the bad bad smell and it's not like it's hard but it's still hard fat soft and creamy in so it's nice variety that winter to have all that verify it was really nice variety but I learned something from that just a practical thing that for some reason I don't understand the chemistry behind it if you got some fat it tasted funny if you heat it up really hot and cool it back down it'll take that away how to have them lose fat once it was getting old so we can a little rancid and I tried it a heated up until just about to the smoking point cool it back down to taste it way better who sings doing that I don't know I never looked into it think that would be something you want to look into not really just a little practical Boy Scout trick wants to know you know that you don't need another magic behind it so so you take what to do with the bear hide turn it into a blanket still still have that hide it's beautiful because the Bears up there don't get his big have salmon mountains but it was a real light color bear there's a picture that when you might pull up yeah that's it there's another picture with right after I shot it on the beach there but in the in the photos are on the first page there whatever they're called the ones that you can keep this Facebook you're just a Facebook page white, I don't like yeah says beautiful hide really can you keep the claws on the hide when you make the blanket yeah I just I ever dealt with I skinned it all out like Taxidermy and I left all the claws in the lips and the the eyelids and everything and take a long time and I can't get myself that it was a big project that built a big stretcher had it all know what do you use to tan it I use the same thing I use on walls for Wolverine which is like a diluted battery acid basically really yeah what's the old Willy's do these brains right with brains out here but I never got into that somebody showed me this battery acid tanning system way back when I when I first went up there and started trapping and it worked really well for me so I stuck to that house that work it's been a long time since I did it but you just dilute the battery acid very diluted and I forgot the exact proportions cuz it's been awhile but very very diluted and then you had a lot of salt so you want to get the proportions right you want to look into pre try but that's all the tenant the solution is just battery acid water and salt and see you in the right battery acid up there just it's so concentrated it's like a little little package of fluid out there like One X enough for 5 years or something fluid out there just for tanning and system pH back to neutral after you're done tanning it here it is 7 gallons of water to 2 cups to pounds of brand or pickling salt is neat's-foot oil where the people's feet leather you put on your baseball glove neat's-foot is supposed to be one word at least one I just Googled it and feet of cattle I don't know it's something to call it needs foot oil but it's just a oil that you used to preserve leather you put on your baseball glove neat's-foot is supposed to be one word at least one I just Googled it and yellow oil rented from Perfection bones and feet of cattle</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but how many bullets do I care so Trisha comes up for 4-day date afterward Communicator for 3 months and she had and I decided that I want to take her out to the camp can I plant for tomorrow when I go to Brooks range so I want to fly up there so she could see the place to know what she was getting into right and we're packing and I like I think I threw in like 10 rounds and we're just going to go for the day she had to be back at work and she just came for a long weekend and she's like what that's all you're taking 10 Rounds we're not even going hunting this is just in case in case a bear happens Packers 10-round that's Alot Like I go months without shooting 10 rounds of ammunition so I she convinced me to take a full box of thing but that you would need to decide in the rifle play something goes wrong with the site talking about a Target yeah I got a Target okay you have a Target but there's tools you know where you don't have to fire up around yeah this or sighting yeah it's like a bore sighting it's like a laser and it has it set up like literally you can have your rifle zeroed in at a hundred in like two shots are usually get easier than you know three of six or something but never goes out I have my target 200 yards I'm right in front of my campus shoot across the lake there when it's dead, and I hardly ever have to adjust a scope and I'm so happy that I got that's the only rifle I have ever killed a large animal within my life was the caliber 30 ought 6 for $550 in 2003 and I never needed another Centerfire rifle it's a classic Ruger M77 is it called M77 Mark II any to what kind of side of using on that it's going to 227 Power Scope that the difference is that's an older picture there's nobody up there with me I actually took that picture myself but that was before I get my suppressor that's what kind of stupid it's Ritz Bits ignorant because for hunting purposes like one of the biggest biggest problems like I have a friend of mine my friend Cody's is ears blown out cuz he was working as a guide and someone fired off a shot right there as here now has to wear hearing aids sautes one shot at close to the muzzle that's why I got a suppressor I really think this is a very important thing so many people damage in their hearing without even realizing it up 100%. 2% it's it's all God did it when they're young a lot of my friends they go with a suppressor that's actually a different gun but that one I never killed anyone else but that is a suppressor that's the problem is when you're hunting it's not practical to use your protection and if you hunt regularly that adds up over time you shoot a rifle that's 160 decibels why are they making a law that you have to damage your hearing to go hunting why they make a law where you have to cover your ears with something the reason being is because they're worried about Urban situation so worried about people shooting at people and you know you not hearing anything but you do hear something a lot more than that have you ever depends on what you're assuming it's Hyper Sonic supersonic it's still loud like a 30 ought 6 without a suppressor is about a hundred 60 decibels that's definite you put a suppressor on it it's like a hundred thirty and knocks it down about 30 decibels more or less it's still very loud are there different levels of suppressor that I bought the best suppressor I can get if you want to make a gun shoot like in the movies just silent like a little pop you have to shoot subsonic that's not practical for hunting you have to you have to be questioning whether or not I've actually use a suppressor why I feel like I did at one point in time someone somewhere let me shoot the rifle that has a suppressor on but it might might be a false memory now subsonic ammo in there you can buy shot subsonic 22LR subsonic you can buy 3:08 ammunition subsonic and it's very quiet but it's going so slow that it's not effective to hunt Moose or Caribou with Ryan I mean pretty loud and compare I have a muzzle brake on my 7 mm really loud once who is just about death he was like Stone death from one shotgun blast use in a canoe and somebody shot kind of in a position where the muzzle is right next to his ear and it's always someone shooting near you just blows your eardrums out it's terrible yeah but so in California you cannot have suppressors but yeah I think that's what they're worried about don't know enough about about firearms that are making the regulations but I think that would be the worried it would people be shooting you wouldn't be able to hear it while I think that there might be other ways to deal with that because all time and you can it make it less disturbing for all the people also that are in the mountains if you're on public land in your hunting deer and you hear a boom like over the side of the countries that have more regulations on Firearms there places where you can use suppressors from what I've heard I mean I haven't researched extensively but I think in Britain even people have suppressors in the New Zealand Australia different places yeah yeah I do 99.9% of my hunting with a bow and arrow that's awesome but it's not up I'm not doing it because I need you know it's not like a subsistence thing I don't need it absolutely just I love our tree I love hunting archery too because you have to get close yeah that's where it's at that's what I love doing is getting close like some guys will brag about animal dance to it's it's all so it requires more skill I feel like Ms sounds f***** up but I feel like Dan wise more of a chance like if if I'm inside you know 60 yards shooting in an animal that animal has way more chance to get the f*** away from me way more chance for me to the blow it to step on a toy or if you catch my wind or it makes it more difficult Dan was more of a chance like if if I'm inside you know 60 yards shooting in an animal that animal has way more chance to get the f*** away from me way more chance for me to the blow it to step on a twig or if you catch my wind or it makes it more difficult</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you like a lot of aspects of living up there and put what's like is there one thing that really stands out one thing would definitely be the autonomy the independence I think it's just a natural need that humans have you watch a little baby when they learn to crawl they start separating from their mother a little bit and they start to learn to stand up but they're still holding onto the wall then they start taking their first step and it's like wow I can stand on my own feet and they get all excited and start running along before very long and I think we just need that feeling of Independence some people more than others but it's the same basic thing for me it's just like to be out there totally independent on my own nobody else is going to help me if I have a problem you know if I'm up on a mountain and I don't have a satellite phone with me I got to be a back to my cam I have to be able to there's literally no choice right and just to have that degree of responsibility that in modern society you don't have you can't have that degree responsibilities modern society for yourself you can't have that level of Independence painting on your own is it hard for you to like come to a place is it weird driving on the 405 from the airport headed over to the studio you have to be like why the f*** would anybody live here I find it fascinating it's interesting cuz it's a different environment I'm in a very curious about the way people live everywhere but I do find myself realizing why I don't live in a big city you know I find it really nice interesting me sleeping well this is Coldwater toilet toilet did you use one yet but they build them too high squatty potty in the toilet you put your feet on oh yeah sort of put your butt in the right position at the front desk natural position for humans to s*** it works for me that's another thing I like about it out there okay there's the autonomy the independence is very important and I think a lot of people are missing that and that's why they're attracted to learn something about that life but also just like I said when you do these basic things to be taking a crap it could be taking a shower whatever in a different way out in nature mean you can't a lot of people bait outside they wanted to they don't have the privacy but when that's your normal thing I mean it becomes a totally natural thing in it it's like very healthy and it's beautiful I could eat you out there looking at mountains all around in nature Little Tweety birds flying by while you're bathing and you're not sealed off and some little fiberglass cubicle yeah it's it's 100% different way of living life and your perceptions change your senses change in the modern world there's a lot of extraneous noise and imagery that we're filtering out all the time you can't pay attention to everything did you ever get injured while you're up there yeah yeah but you can't pay attention to everything I'll get to it you can't pay attention to everything so your filter stuff out all the time right when you're out in that environment it's very quiet you're not getting inundated with all of this extraneous noise and your instead of filtering your tuning in your really tuning in like one little bird that hasn't been around the valley flies through I'll know it I'll hear it wow different it changes it changes the way you think is a feeling that you get when you're in the real Wilderness like particularly we did some hunting on Prince of Wales and you know when you're out there it's raining rains everyday and there's this feeling of beautiful isolation you like you're really isolated I mean you're really alone there's no you don't see anything you don't hear that and there's this indifference that nature has told you that's really humbling it so I can put you in your place yeah I think the reason being is the ocean just lets you know a b**** like that you ain't shitt that water you can survive there knowing that there's something right there that you can survive fountains check you the dates of the sheer Beauty and the vastness like if you know you're looking out at the Continental Divide and you see the the the Rocky Mountains just like the tumbling tumbling on the one hand you feel really strong being able to do what you're doing there but on the other hand you feel really small really vulnerable really insignificant like if you know what you're looking out at the Continental Divide and you see the the the Rocky Mountains just like the tumbling they humbly on the one hand you feel really strong being able to do what you're doing there but on the other hand you feel really small really vulnerable really insignificant</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> long after that in February in the middle of February the Caribou showed up that year and I Got 5 Caribou at one time. On the island on the lake and then you know we were all set again released a famine yeah it is so hungry country but there are a lot of animals but they just there different places you can fly over the Arctic all day long enough to see hardly anything it's like the Sahara Desert up there A lot of times but there are a lot of animals concentrate the caragor country this herds of 100000 Caribou but 200,000 in one place at one time but there they are recognized as a heard they get into the hundreds of thousands reverse cyclic the population goes up and down but you know they're in there in certain places and if they're not where you are you're in the Sahara Desert then when they show up it's like the Serengeti plain I mean all the sudden there's Caribou everywhere you step outside you hear the antlers all over the the valley if it's like in October when they're running hear the wolves howl and Ravens croak and I hadn't heard anything for the last 2 months and all the sudden look at that oh my God we're looking at an enormous pack of caribou but they called him the compacts hurt heard enormous herd of caribou look at all those in the summer on the North side so big still at the cabin looking out at the lake and Caribou walking across the lake moving all the time and I estimated that one moment I could see a hundred on the lake wow yeah lot of caribou like the way I hunt them sometimes is running around out there on the lake with really yeah like ran with them and that's how you were hunting them Echo Chase in the car I told you how I used to study a lot Anthropologie I used to listen to anything that I could hear about how people used to live in the old days especially the Inuit and people living up north there was this awesome Biloxi he made some Doan's back in 1960s of the netsilik people in that sell castlemont series is called it's fascinating Castle in Northern Canada and some people that still knew how to do things in very primitive ways and one thing I learned from those films was how they would hunt Caribou in the way these people to hunt Caribou is there only be you know a few Hunters there build a little Stone and hook sucks that comes like a scarecrow make a line going down toward the lake so looks like people than the few Hunters would move around and they would use their voice gel in the Echo their voice run it confused the Caribbean chase him into a lake that way they could use their voice again down and then one guy in a kayak could overtake Caribou Inspira it's amazing but you were by yourself yeah but this is something you can use by yourself you can use this technique of using your voice to confuse Caribou herd them where you wanted to go you Echo out on the lake if they're Caribou is wide-open they can see me I have while away and don't go out in the middle of lake in the Dane stand around out there if I try walking up to him a few hundred yards away they might just take off yell as loud as I can yell and project my voice over to an island or or Shoreline depending on where I am and it'll bounce back in stock and they'll run straight back at me while she was like oh my God she thought I was going to get run over she was filming once and I could hear when I watch the video to like but really work you see that picture there Jana find it it's it's rape on the leftmost picture yeah Tricia took that picture wow they were running away from me before this picture was taken and ice cream and hollering echoing my voice off the shoreline they turn around and run back and I do many times I had these Caribou run back and forth like five six times I could stay within 50 yards in a lot of times just by yelling as loud as I could you look really close right there yeah well Tricia thought I was going to get trampled and so this is how you hunted them find I could stay within 50 yards in a lot of times just by yelling as loud as I could you look really close right there yeah well Tricia thought I was going to get trampled and so this is how you hunted them</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you eat the wolf what do you eat the back straps do you cook two hams like how do you how do you eat a wolf the only way that I like to eat a wolf as a boil it for a good long time cuz walls to will have parasite Philip trichinosis and I like to boil it if it's your family have probably eaten wolf like my kids when they're little maybe once or something like that is irestore how many people could you ask that too and I began my kids probably and wolf really yeah there was something from the lewis-clark exhibition Expedition something from Brunello tell me about some guys actually preferred wolf meat they could have eaten but they meet Jesus wow so did you eat these walls they shot a little bit of it cuz I was short on food that at that time that winter you do not like the whole thing but a few meals of it so you boil it and how do you do it like onions potatoes make a soup and have him like that no I mean no I'm not there all winter long that does 2012/2013 there was any vegetables plant food that's what I get food in the winter that's the only so you'll actually eat their stomach contents yeah thousand years I believe you I believe they have a great pickled in their stomach contents pickled brownish when they eat these lichens in the winter that's what they're feeding you can eat those lichens off the ground harsh but when is partially digested in a caribou stomach it actually isn't edible food in the old people used to eat these while I read about it and I even talked to some people who done it you know when they were kids and stuff and sure enough it's not bad stuff I got hooked on it they were like looking at me like the stuff good as primitive as I could go and I satisfied my curiosity about living that extreme of a subsistence lifestyle so now I eat much more store-bought vegetables I eat normal foods but for time there for a few years I got down to where I was in Caribou stomach I was doing anything I just wanted to just immerse myself in that whole environment out there I want to get my food right there what I could see what I can get myself just get right into anal 15 months without even going out to town not talking to other people that time I had my wife there but just to really get into a different state of consciousness they put you in a different state it says it is a beautiful thing you said pickled stomach contents how do you how do you pickling a tenderloin in the stomach contents you just take the Caribou you get to the right chamber of the stomach that got four chambers on their stomach and you just cut a little slit in it just after you've pulled this the guts out and you just slip the meat in there they slip it right into the room and in the contents there and what happens is the temperature is about right in it it will retain a lot of heat that creates he I think the the the micro organisms in their create because if you just bury that in snow and snow course insulates it'll stay warm for quite a while and if it was really cold it might not work out in my free solid before pickle but if it's the right temperature the middle turn brownish color over time and it'll be pickled it old people used to do this all time I read about Casino 20 years ago and then I talk to people and I said yeah this is safe to do so I tried it and and there was a winner there where that's where I got a lot of my vegetables was out of caribou stomach and the meat will just it'll it'll turn brownish first on the outer part of the meat and then it all the way through it and it gets pickled you got me carefully going wash everything be careful Ashley what I found is that it just all depends on the conditions once you learn how to handle me probably can do a lot of things with me that most people be scared to death of and is completely safe as far as I'm concerned I never had any problems with it but like moisture is very important if you buy me in the storage wrapped in plastic that keeps it moist you let it sit around for a while is spoiled and it doesn't take long leave meat out of your refrigerator be spoiled in a day right but if you take I'm also out of an animal and you butchered properly you separate the muscle is one piece you don't make a bunch of cuts in the faccia you can take a muscle that's 2 or 3 in thick don't put it in plastic don't wrap it up that'll cause it to spoil you leave it right out in the Air 2 or 3 inch thick muscle like a hundred degrees up there sometimes other times it's cold up there just berries during the day depending on how the fire stoked right I'll let it sit there for a week 10 days and then I'll eat it never cook it just let it sit there really never cook it now just let it sit there so you got a crust on the outside it gets across on the outside but it's too thick of a piece to dry like you would dry jerky or so it stays moist inside and cheese omelette turns into something like cheese to get their flavors arranging it yeah it's actually fermentation that's taken place I believe it's actually a fermentation process but it takes on different flavors I really like I called gummy makes us my kids used to call it and gummy me looking for something about the Caribou stomach and there's this thing called The Polar manual made by the government do you think the Navy back fat is better than chewing gum and Lives May 1961 also it may be older Indiana Siberian foods pemmican of her that it's the meat of bear seal caribou and walrus mixed together with fish eggs and dried do a hard Frozen block Trapper's peaches and cream is chewing dried beavertail Caribou back fat is better than chewing gum don't overlook the contents of a seal stomach for a fresh fried fish dinner nor the contents of a caribou stomach mixed with the trip lining as a tasty in quotes salad of reindeer moss and lichens properly hasn't word acidulated situated are walrus melted death give 16 quarts of know I love dairy products I was thinking about milking a caribou after I killed it but I I didn't just because she was in bad shape she been attacked by the walls and she had an infection in her leg and I was afraid that somehow I might get sick but I just remember this lactating Caribou that I'd killed and I never heard of people doing that until you just read that but water so you were worried you would have taken the milk but except for the fact that she had been infected she was the one that only had two good legs and her back leg going right up there towards your other oh it was in terrible shape it was all is full of pus and damn shot once he'd been stabbed by another elk like in his in his one of his back legs and it it's all filled with pus like when we were courting them and taking it apart it was as one section that was just all possible f****** nasty but soon the same thing in the most stabbed in the back like in the honc there so when you boil the the wolf how you eating that just playing just fine just chopping up right after you boil it get a little extra flavor will just eating a boiled it like is there something you can fix little Wolfie Wolfie do you know if if you want to live that primitively off the land that's all you do it takes all your time if you want to share that life with other people like what I've been trying to do the last six years you can't just do that yeah because like you would even have the ability to communicate do that yeah because not that I don't really have the amount of time to hunt and gather like you would and I don't even have the ability to communicate Ryan I want to be able to arrange to be on your show if I was out there living the way I was living in 0678 years ago</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Hardee's 100% douchebag they take themselves very seriously really hard to not be a douchebag in a Ferrari for a really interesting guy built in England where he took a dino oh yeah and he put a 400 plus horsepower modern Ferrari glasses off and bring the car back to stock it was Dino was one of the prettiest Ferraris ever right if you ever driven one they sound great but I just love his dog she has the smallest engine Ferrari ever made when did you know the the website for the guy that did it or the YouTube channel I think the guy I think his name was David Lee and he built it and if he claimed it was an F40 engine which I don't think was entirely accurate I think I exaggerate a little bit it has been modified in certain ways cuz now he has more than 400 horsepower it would be like using something is very valuable and not really replaceable for for purposes of modification doesn't make much sense what other options are available that could deliver you the same result Gabby like was over and I was like pounds am a bit maybe there any Heine they're tiny and they're made of nothing I mean the 2500 maybe a good number of heard that car that lives here would be a very low estimate maybe a really good original Dino is out there it is so it's actually done something car cuz the car is a hardtop or is it at Target Target's look how pretty it is hard to tell it apart from a regular do you know if you don't know what you're looking more the things to look for obviously that badge on the left that says like Evo something and then the clear engine cover with the big bubble in the middle of the of the Bonham Exchange yeah by the way that bad can go f*** yourself the badge doesn't need to be there the exhaust is a little bigger Wheels with you're probably like 15 and I think there are 17 cheers I'll pretty that you want to talk expensive David Lee the Monza 3.6 Evo dinosaur 3.6 that's what tells me it's a mod 360 engine 2.8 yeah right without the turbo spool do you have that natural build power and you really kind of can just use less throttle it won't jump out at you but I mean you are a man of taste Joe that's awesome to beautiful ride look at that telling them of them even if you did something to level of singer Ferrari people aren't really like that Ferrari people are originality over everything that's so weird yeah they don't like modifying the cars they don't like previously been modified all about them numbers matching s*** like you so much Moodle silly Testarossa have timing belts belts are something that Italians were doing for a long time and they should never be done again downstairs to be changed and in the case of the Testarossa you're talkin about giant Flat 12 engine they're in the front so they're up against the firewall behind the seats so you have to take off the whole back of the modern stuff they use chains you don't have to do that b******* cuz you would Lamborghini use chains so you don't need to do the engine out. It was smoother for Enzo Ferrari also had a daughter contempt for the people who bought history cars and I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't just so the dealers would make more money on the services even if he knew it was worse couldn't make money doing that and he had to sell streetcars to customers but throughout his entire life openly treated those people with disdain that's how you end the story of Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini had a Ferrari it was not working for one reason other he went to Freud complain about it and so basically told me to f*** himself and so he said I'll do the better car and that's the story of Lamborghini he's almost like an Audi group b a v i v a g so they're more reliable now yes but so are Ferraris but around 2010 when the 458 came out Ferraris took a massive jump in reliability first off the big one is a dual-clutch gearbox which you know stick shift or one thing right and then these early single-clutch paddle shift gearbox and Fry it's like crazy people the naughty use them ride and they ride the clutch is out and they would just go through clutches like crazy the dual-clutch cars have much more like failsafe type stuff built into them and they actually work properly used to have the Gated shifter stops the problem with Ferraris that their new with problems all new exotic the first owners of exotic cars is they want that that new technology that's that's from racing and also it's like it's improved the drivability you know if you want to buy a Ferrari or Lamborghini and driving around in the city and use it as a car by Ferrari right now and it could just be your car like that was there that wasn't a thing you could do really in the seventies or eighties or even 90s like you could really use a modern exotic car be at Ferrari Lamborghini McLaren Audi R8 whatever back to be your only car now and that the gearbox technology is a lot of with me that bought one computer-controlled like engine management systems call the IRS though the RS is in in Porsche speak is the fastest version of what they can build the other GT3 touring with a stick that's the one you want you want the touring because it's Talking Stick because the 4 liter engine with a stat 6-speed gearbox is the best engine transmission combination available in cars today. Chesapeake is the fastest version of what they can build and the GT3 touring with a stick that's the one you want you want this morning because it's f****** stick because the 4 liter engine with a six-speed gearbox is the best engine transmission combination available in cars today.</div>

Maybe I should I use about 20 minutes and it scared the piss out of me twice makes a Model S and they put a carbon body wide body kit on to hot sounds like fun though the axis model sp100d is they replace the entire body with carbon they take the hood that they take the fenders off and put wide-body fenders on they they do a bunch of different s*** to it you know I wouldn't I wouldn't fuk with that they they do a bunch of different s*** to it you know I wouldn't I wouldn't f*** with that yeah they f*** with the suspension they tighten up the suspension they change the wheels and they completely redo the interior they stripped interior that's where I would start putting whatever you want and need</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Tabitha widebody gt3rs with a vented fenders and you can modify you can modify later you just complain about people who don't want to modify night shift not the turbo but seems like it's all going we even Corvette the new Corral they said the new GT500 they haven't ruled out the possibility of having a stick shift but you also look with a GT500 they just announced this thing it's it's like 750 horsepower I've driven a lot of really powerful anymore I don't when I'm driving it on racetrack as fast as it will go like when I went to test the Corvette ZR1 the last run engine one when it went just completely f****** bananas right 750 horsepower I went to Atlanta to drive in and they had a manual and automatic me to drive and I drove the manual and it was so f****** fast that I did not feel comfortable taking my hands off the wheel to do the ships and and I was like at this level performance I really need to have both my hands on the wheel and I'm pretty decent like s*** but I'm not s*** and then when I drove the automatic car I went okay I feel way more comfortable at this pace with my hands on the wheel right this 8-speed automatic they have is the biggest hunk of flaming shitt ever put into a sports car and so with the C8 with the new one they got rid of the manual and decided to substantially improve the auto with a new dual-clutch 8-speed which you do for you and for me is sad that it's what I kinda get it because it's just sort of what progress looks I get it if you're going to take it to a RaceTrac yeah I do get it but how many people are taking their goddamn Corvette original it's not even about that it's Saturday it's Saturday of that in really about how do we get the 0 to 60 time under 3 seconds because when they had the ZO6 which was 650 horsepower and Amanda ZR1 with a 750 horsepower they couldn't get it to 60 any faster sucking f****** 0 to 60 that that that is important for some reason and adding a hundred horsepower didn't change the 0 to 60 because the front-engine rear-drive your distraction limited that pointed burnouts so by putting the engine in the back you change the weight distribution now you got to dual-clutch 8-speed instead of a manual 7-speed now you can get in that 2-second range 260 which doesn't improve the experience but it doesn't prove the number on that magazine cover but everybody know I mean how do you not know it's it's it's a f****** fast car yeah I know it's that the GT500 a real bummer though cuz that's how it's such a muscle costume same version of the Tremec dual-clutch from the Corvette is a Nails in the Mustang don't know what the Mustangs got if I had to guess an hour if I had to guess the Mustang had water C8 Corvette on 305 rear. I bet if you went out and looked at a Ferrari like a 458 or something you'd be shocked at how narrow the tires are the weight distribution doesn't necessitated weight attire sizes are typically chosen by the weight distribution of the car so like your 911 air-cooled call your old one right and you got big fat and you got relatively skinny front that's because that engine is over the rears so in a mid-engined like I just look this up for an unrelated thing in the 458 the front tires are only two forty-fives on that and the rear tires are 305 so where is the Corvette your front tires are like 275 the old Corvette 5 that that difference in weight distribution is how big of a difference you need in tires. That's you driven the GT500 I got to say it right Thai Kanpai con</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the Tesla's are such cool cars and they're such you know they're such like you said the Serene you know what I mean at all. I don't want to give that credit exclusively to Tesla because other V's provide a similar experience to the one place they are lacking for the amount of money they charge their Interiors are a little Baskin trucks look at that thing you do know I don't I don't like it and I how dare you I'm not entirely sure it's it's real I mean I think I think I just don't think that will pass the test that it needs to pass and I and furthermore, I crash test pedestrian safety stuff like that furthermore it's it's it's because how do I say it's really hard to talk about Tesla because their fans are f****** crazy that they get really mad and they don't leave me alone about your crazy few people since in the design space who design cars professional for living and I have been convinced that it could be possible to build and sell a shape of vehicle shaped sort of like that although not exactly like that okay having said that I think that the way that it has been marketed is not entirely on people company show concept cars all the time wrong with showing a concept car there's nothing wrong with going here's a here's a prototype we built and this is going to show the direction of our industry and if you build electric cars as your business it's pretty easy to build a concept car that runs and drives cuz you got your skateboard and you can just get a put anybody on right so odds are there's like a model X chassis underneath that prototype truck right but there's one I don't think that accepting reservations is an honest thing to do when you don't know how you're going to build the truck don't know there's no way that trucks on the road next year no way warranty selling them is like a logistics business their operating this company like a tech company where it runs on hype like where's the Roadster that's supposed to come out this year and you're actually a car company or not exclusively driven on hype but they have made some cars they build and sell cars but what I am saying is their business model is not like the regular car companies in that is so dependent on this height machine bringing in new investors bring a new reservation cash when they go here's this crazy total recalled space truck and all it's going to cost you people to buy into my space truck vision is $100 worth fundable and you're not going to find out that her dollars get you a truck for like two and a half years are you going to go after your hundred dollars if he's late or if it's your I'm not saying you shouldn't buy whatever he sells is in The Roaster thing a different deal don't you have to pay all the money or something there is a reservation process is all I'm saying substantial sum of money we don't have the Prototype yeah but it's easy to build a prototype Tesla anybody on it it'll look and feel like I mostly wanted driving car with 45000 $5,000 credit card in 10 days gas no interest loan of $50,000 until he delivers this product which is like a good income for a lot of people for a year and then leave it up correct and so I'm not saying that they don't build and sell real cars I'm not saying you shouldn't buy one or at least one ham saying and then handed to you as a billionaire need to give him a zero-interest loan of $50,000 for a roadster why do you need to give him a $0 loan of $100 for a truck that he hasn't demonstrated he could build yet why do you think they made the roast of fifty Grand and the down payment for the truck only a hundred bucks because I will tell you why because why I believe I believe I believe I'm going to I'm going to put this and I believe okay okay I believe it's so they could go to a bank or a VC because there's only $100 you get so many Rockrose 500,000 orders 250,000 orders I need a billion dollars that's why you would do that there's a lot of individual pieces that really add up and on a house that's not made of you know it's like imagined of the the mortgage crisis in a way you took all these Bad Mortgages and you put them together and all the sudden she smashed the f****** window on stage he quoted a bunch of power and torque figures that are basically made up you did that dumb video with tug-of-war the F-150 that was completely fake as a fake the F-150 was in two-wheel drive and he was telling it uphill that's not like if you going to make it easier for the car to drive downhill and Uphill no Towing uphill what it would beat the weight transfer is is if you have a two-wheel drive pickup truck going downhill with my friend Jason fenske &amp; Engineering explained did a whole video explaining debunking this but if you have an all-wheel-drive extremely heavy vehicle vehicle stereo and batteries all-wheel drive versus a pickup truck that's putting the two wheel drive with no wait in the bed that's just so it's all automakers make up silly games to show up their product right go to space shuttle or whatever bulshit they do right but they make up a game they know they can win they don't make up a game and then she died like why you going to do a tug-of-war video if you didn't have to cheat at the video on video to do it like pick a different game you know you can win Bob said don't engage that idiot what are you doing I'm not doing this yeah they probably can't realistically it can't really compete with it either but I think I'm going to go and warn the last do you see any like other renderings of people like camping in the Cyber truck in what's absurd well yeah dude like you want to f****** you know you want to buy one wait till he says this is the one you can buy to put an order and I just I don't think it would honey bucks congratulations you just bought him a Tascam that's that's that's what I mean figured out creative ways to to get the public to bankroll s*** that he already said was done bro a million Robo taxis by 2020 where's the robo taxis bro but at the same time that they figured out that full self-driving is not right around the corner as they said it was going on in the full self-driving you're not going to be able to send your Tesla out to do errands for you without a driver in it anytime soon it was the parking with Tessa promises 1 million Robo taxis and sometimes doesn't work do you know who Kyle Dunnigan is guys alive he's got the best Instagram on the planet and he does face swaps a husband you now that you know you didn't know the Deep value know he does a lot will doctor Frankenstein come out or what yeah yeah yeah yeah f****** s*** do it again Windows same ball you should go differently editing to Infinity listen Misty's class not hahaha I was laying in bed and my wife is next to me asleep and I've nowhere I know the deal was that when they hit the wall or hit the door with the hammer that it broke the glass or know that first lady was going to hit the door with a sledgehammer but except he was using an orange Hammer which is a dead blow hammer not a sledgehammer so that's a little disingenuous dead blow and then he goes to the windows are cleaned up a bunch of broken glass like right underneath the door yeah that's true that owls over a door kind of maybe if you would just smashed a bunch of glass out of it that's true Kumail likes cyber was exclusively on Google for like the last 15 years</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> we took a left but I can I can it it's it's like 700 horsepower 610 horsepower and 750 torque but just like the Tesla the torque is incident 00 Porsche has this really interesting thermal management system so Tesla although they do a beautiful Road car for the city you know they've never gone racing they don't they don't know about endurance racing or real real high performance driving and you've seen them kind of struggle with the Nurburgring a little bit harder than it looks over there they wouldn't they weren't talking about what it was but I figured the three motor car with a widened body and a different Aero package in different size there were some of the giant like GT3 wing on it to it seemed like they the number they originally put out and you guys talked about on the show Jamie looked it up was a compilation of best sector time so they released a sort of theoretical best time we're actually ran that complete lap the big difference between Tesla and the Porsche right now is thermal management managing heat and cool so where it needs to go yeah there's a prototype build a one-off prototype so the Titan has this really interesting thermal management system that integrates the brakes the battery the motors and the cabin heat and he had a climate control all-in-one system and so it's very common that one system will need heat while the other needs to be cooled and one will need so they if the brakes are hot but then they need to be cooled but the cabin is called and needs to be hot that use the brake heat to thicken send heat or cold anywhere in the car and stay up there go back to wash okay it's not that bad though it doesn't let you change it to doing body kits on Evie's button lyrics what is that sounded unplugged brakes unplugged so your Tesla for instance if you want Max performance at the hardest launch you can do you got to have like 80% battery or more and it only let you do a couple of them in a row before it starts to get noticeably slower learning to let you launch but you want that to 5 or whatever it is it's only going to be your first couple launches where you get it will give you full performance until the battery is dead so I get a full bore launch control start with like 40 miles range call SCANA get from fully charged in fiery 300 in so I was able to drive around normally and I found that the range estimate was pretty accurate only had the car for one day so it's pretty accurate and then I was to the canyons and in that video I burned off 40% of the battery just making that video you're just smoking through battery and then you're still with Adam and Technology will improve to the point where they can get like rearrange out of these things like the theoretical range of the Tesla Roadster was like 600 miles behind that's never been done I think so I'm not an expert on TVs and there's like electrical engineers they will be screaming that arranged the key that we will see that will really be a game-changer is battery charge X Out and Keep Your can we get a charge in 5 minutes or 10 minutes and not 30 minutes or an hour and the number of stations the opportunity to charge but they don't have as many super high speed charger so Tesla and all Eevee's on the market right now except the Titan all the rest are 400 volt systems okay and the test was probably the best most efficient use of 400 volt architecture 800 volt architecture if Portia is to be believed is more efficient the it's a lighter setup of it flows in and out faster than the 400 volt system a couple other advantages to it but it can charge really really fast through the correct Chargers there just aren't that many of the super fast ones around is like 3 in LA right now one is in Burbank at the Best Buy in Burbank is it safe to hear from almost dead to almost full in about 18 minutes I got 80% e juice fast enough that I could watch it go 6-7 really it was pretty good. I think the real problem with EV adoption special play sigelei is the infrastructure man I don't think this city generate enough electricity through its grid for all of us to be charging cars at home charging it would radically change everything unless everybody switch towards or even think is efficient enough right now it's a homeowner like if you like how and Evie drives and you like the experience of owning one and it works for your life like a thousand percent get an Eevee but is is a 90% Eevee adoption rate in La something that's really realistic like not anytime soon talk about with cars and everything else happening in the industry if you want to know about well I mean the Titanic don't think we've looked completely covered it with my question was all these cars is what is next right it's like we're seeing these incredible 0 to 60 under 3 seconds times we're going to eventually see the range increase but if you would ask me 10 years ago are we going to see a 2.40 to Ice-T sedan that feel like it's violating physics when you step on the gas mean that's why I drive and yeah laptop for a screen yeah we've got about I don't know right right years ago or so the the trajectory of increased performance. Very steep where you know the new version of every car has a hundred more horsepower and now he's got these high-performance v's and with a high performance TV that's a f****** dragster I mean the the tycon does your does 1/4 modulo 10 I mean so you can you know I don't want to be flippant and say all it takes is money but all it takes is money you want to know a dealer and you buying a dragster that you know you you say that Arch NHRA license to run that fast the real difference Tesla's have very video gaming steering know this the Tycoon has the steering system from the Porsche 992 and so it feels like a Porsche go faster video that had us in and put it on speaker one of the things that makes Porsche hicken different is that have a 2 speed transmission your Tesla is one gear so your Tesla from 0 to 120 is bananas but it pretty much dies off because it runs out of gear people don't really need to go with their Autobahn stuff they need more at the top end so that I can actually switches into 2nd gear and keeps pulling like crazy you know above 81 and the biggest difference. Dynamically is like you know how when you're Tesla you can drive with one foot on pedal when you lift off the pedal guitar and so you can pretty much drive around once but Tycoon doesn't do that so Porsche believes that the kinetic energy built up by motion is better used by allowing the car to just Coast as far as possible then by hitting the region and capturing it in the form of breaking the weight of Tesla does Tesla have an impact on but if it's still doing that does it does it have an impact on the way it feels well it feels I mean yes because you have to use the brakes more in everyday so you can have a car quicker to use the brakes more to didn't mean to delete have regenerative we know it doesn't necessarily I believe the Porsche is ultimately better at that it's the only real difference is that when you lift off the gas in a Tesla it slows down as if someone is applying the brakes in the Porsche you just pure Coast it's a pure coast and it's and it's a really it's it's an even more of a coach that feeling then a gasoline car it's like you're freed of all restraint a video that I sent you and so I just posted and I was like let's see how far I can go without touching the brakes and I got this m*********** posting up to like a hundred miles an hour taking corners and not using the brakes to the handling the gripper so good I posted like 12 miles down not that alertness bladder it while I'm filming and I've never been able to not stop the car. I believe me I know you can drive down the road just on freon sometimes I do that video on the garbage to it's amazing how little of that there really has made on the road it's it made like like a line of kind of dirt on the road and it goes back and forth across the road and you go with what the hell was that dude dancing to Crazy you what's really crazy about that that could start a fire omigod probably but it could also swing into an oncoming car vlog that's not my YouTube video someone has stolen my YouTube video motherfukers yeah motherfuker</div>

Movie so this is like 1960s and early 1960s cars the way they talk and the way they drink and it's about this guy's a professional pool Hustler who's been traveling from California to New York City to meet this guy then Minnesota Fats and playing cuz this guy is the best pool player in the world until they play all through the night Robert Rosen badass motherfuker in pool wants to come and play Minnesota Fats and Minnesota Fats is jacking this guy and he's amazing flowers who was again Paul Newman getting back into the world of pool the endless movie spoiler alerts in the 1960's retires because of this movie this movie in particular that it didn't mention the first movie but was pretty clear they're playing with a Balabushka this movie that that f****** chew is worth a shitload of money like there's a lot of like great pool to manufacturers from that era like I know you would like like crafts I do she like totally in the world of pool it's all about Q's about like the type of hit you want type of wood weigh digging in the yeah and Bell bushes have a very specific kind of hits of her it's like there's an old school feel to it that a lot of the players that went playing like most her life love company still around give me art pieces in the Vintage.

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what's up you didn't tell me this was taken in Northridge a week ago emanations they took half dogs and cats will the cat that I said that could open doors and said he wanted nothing more to than to kill none of my other cat's he was a Russian blue had three legs and he was really really smart we adopted him and we tried for like 6 months to make it work we try everything everything you could think of to make I thought he owned the neighborhood and he ended up getting eaten by a mountain lion yeah yeah Three Legs vs a mountain lion in Morgan smartest fastest three legged animal you've ever seen but f****** mountain lion one may be a little cocky for his own good thousand percent that was never seen again but we're so weird that we let those things as Wonder around us we're so weirdly don't think it's really strange that I live with another species in my house I think about that very often I mean mountain lion oh yeah rarely kills people but it does sometimes and we want to keep it around sounds an awful lot like the Sharks bro and we also have a lot like they're running out of s*** to eat you know do you think's going I've lived in a city and I have attention to the deer in the summer but I'll tell you what's what's happened man cats oh they've moved in and start jacking deer and coyotes We Didn't Start jacking big cats these big f****** big wild dogs play mostly around. So if you go to like Iowa they they have too many deer like you'll be driving wiring diagram hunting deer not mountain lion well you can't hunt mountain lion California they don't have is there a predator predatory cat that you forgot that you should hunt and I don't know because between people that are very much Animal Advocates animal rights first they want animals to rule and to be able to have their own freedom on their land whatever happens happens like mountain lions killing deer and all that kind of stuff and let it all take place and we shouldn't interfere with that we shouldn't hunt these people that really think like that and you know they have their arguments they have their the reasons but the reality of animals is if you have the large predators in the large Predators runs out of things to eat it's either going to go further and entering to new areas looking for food and it might get hit by cars or it's going to Branch out and expand expand its range and expanding its range is going to find a farm or it's going to find a dog in the backyard is going to find something because it's just trying to get food in like how many of those week willing to have around us California doesn't when they get what's called depredation order like if someone has something happened like if you run a farm and a mountain lion starts killing your livestock which does happen to lady in Malibu a few years back had I think it was an alpaca Farm in this f****** mountain lion killed like a ton of them it was just killing them just fun and what they said was in an idiom which is really nuts that's strange I think he couldn't get it out you know if y'all are really big animal they couldn't get it out of her didn't feel comfortable enough to eat it while he's in there so he's probably really good at all at once I think it was over a couple of days but it was kind of a killing spree height of a killing spree</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> say that you liked your Porsche to go to The Comedy Store did you like Juiced you up yet feel like that I like I like something loud something that just stupid yeah yeah but it's actually got the the elements of like a Baja truck also so you can just f****** smash speed bumps and like you know those weird transitions into driveways hear that everybody hates and sports cars get taken an angle and all that yeah boom straight in on the power bouncing a little bit you can drive off a carbs and s*** it is so fun it's all those things you love about your car but also the things you want in like a trophy truck cheese and Horizon pools you should be a Salesman I am so I don't get Kickbacks but but you should everybody should buy an off-road Porsche its plant right larious you have all the recommendations lot of people out there that's okay it's true what I feel is the second ugliest version It's it was kind of unique at the time in the UN Rutledge that mad time talking s*** about my choice cuz you you're kind of sewer about automobiles right in my mind like why wouldn't he get like a 68 Mustang I don't have a connection to those cars you know were those my car Larry Chen shot that photo all the car was beautiful man that that was a beautiful car and I did dump a lot of money into it but I turned I got out of the cover Car Craft magazine out of speech at featuring speedhunters and I and I got all my money back out of it even after I gave half the money to charity so I got out of it pretty good wide tires held the right stance those are awesome meals to those Wheels the wheels are hre rs105 switch is a really popular wheel for the Ford GT so use the so that's why the cheapest car they've ever like that picture you just saw is it done basically and once it was done I was like oh f*** man you know this thing handles so good and it looks so cool I could really use like 300 more horsepower like it was like it was like 300 horsepower 350 horsepower and it really need to be like six hundred and so I was at the point where I either was going to get spent two more years and twenty more thousand dollars and maybe I'd be happy with what I got at the end or it was on the move on and about the same time I drove leaking is the name of the dude who built my Porsche and he builds and sells those buying his number 14 of the cars he builds I drove his for a video and I just was so in love with it and I just said oh this is exactly the thing that I need in my life right now and so when I sold the Mustang I gave the money to my lifted 911 with the scooter and and the test cars I have the number one squeezed Safari 911 from 1987 I didn't spend all that money to look at it you know if you spent all that money collector value is what I get out of driving isn't it shocking when you open one of those old Porsches of the to it yeah yes from the sixties to the mid-90s are some of the finest built vehicles in terms of quality and Engineering there another expensive to maintain they can be annoying but as far as pure quality of engineering there's there's nothing better by the finest car in the world with a quality perspective through most of its life as a really unusual one for me because that year was like they still kept the Frog eyes yeah but the suspension became more more lively it would have been more controllable but yet it's still maintained a lot of old field at the time those cars if you go back to 92 when those cars came out in 91 and you read sort of the Contemporary reviews of the car they were calling it old slow and heavy know they said it was a solid feeling car but the Corvette ZR1 was faster in wider you know what I mean in the Ferrari 348 was a piece of s*** but to some of the Japanese stuff the Supra the 300ZX Twin Turbo the fact that they were unchanged from the 60s to the mid-90s isn't it is a positive with an endearing quality it's it's it's such a they developed that body and Chassis so Surly over those 30 years that it's such a finely engineered thing that you can take it and build something like a singer out of it a singer 911 it is as like I remember of their regular car right is as fast around Laguna Seca 458 with no traction control and manually shifting yeah yeah I mean they've done wonders with those chassis and they really lighten them with carbon bodies and and so it is possible to take that chassis further it just would have cost Porsche Porsche lost so much money in the 90s dude Porsche was really Hanging On by a thread and they were losing money like crazy until Volkswagen to have a group came in and that's where you ended up with the water cooled cars the boxer and then the Cayenne but in Wendy's when they were doing the 993s from ignite they were losing crazy amount of money on those cars years older than it really is and he is so finally made ya so interesting Carrera RS if you look at the passenger compartment the roofline the windshield beside one of those car you know it's basically unchanged from the 70s to the too late 90s such a pretty shape it's just like some shape that people just gravitate towards and it's a really old ones do they they have the kind of Airy about them I think you know of all the classic cars they are the most usable you noted to just run around the city and drive you can drive a car from the 70s know Magnus f****** drives a car you know remember that, oh my god that car was a magic thing he's got a video of him like driving it going around this corner you know they have that video that they made about him yeah little short. Carbon Outlaw. Document any of and he comes around in this old school silver Porsche and you look at me like that's a whole different thing he's doing it everybody else well one of the things I love about my car is with the lift on it and the tires you got like less grip than normal at 11 so if Nobody's around like I can slide entrance ramps like I can be a silly bastard in in in that car and it's it's just extra fun because there's a silver car with the blue small displacement that's probably at 2 or 2 hour or two to you know not like this big boars running mate like you've got or you know I've got a 3-2 which is a bit more of a basic on Teutonia the older ended up like those are actually kind of like engine in the back at your feet can go forward young Germans are pretty big people too yeah one of the things with Portia specifically is is about tall people fit at me. Barbarian DNA with 6-4 and so that he demanded that's why Panamera looks like it does so that have six word for person can fit in the back exactly that reason I think that's an insurance thing I think my being a 4-seater might be able to have a friend getting the back of your 911 for a couple of blocks yeah yeah 64 Huffine I'd like the most strip downtown's that's what I like make sense the mall like that I don't want it radio on when I like a radio air conditioning nothing so I have a radio and air conditioning but yeah I know you mean go out and drive that car like that is my activity like Magnus he's experiencing you know what a normal person experiences when they're enjoying the pleasure of driving but he's getting way more analog way more Super like car if it's all ancient f****** techno slide cars are really easy to do when you've got a little engine light clutch and shifter you don't need more power you've got your duty everything needs to be I do that stuff back in the cars 2000 pounds in the engine weigh 200 horsepower you can just fingertip the whole thing's crazy yeah my friend Todd just said this to me is a very wise thing so it doesn't matter how fast you're going just matter how fast it feel totally cold 9000% a thousand percent perspective like you're supposed to get if you didn't know how fast you're going you weren't looking your car other than for the purposes of safety you weren't like it wasn't a dick contest would be a certain level you wouldn't want to drive at I agree even knowing the speeds like near me personally like my cars have fairly low low power like they're not crazy huge power cars like and I think Beyond a certain point I just can't use it anymore and so I think there's an argument for having something low-power like they're not crazy huge power cars like and I think Beyond a certain point I just can't use it anymore and so I think there's an argument for having something like a Tesla for everyday and then having a an engaging machine for the weekend</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the main question here in my mind is whether there is evidence that supports being on a 100% plant based diet with no animal products versus a diet that includes a lot of plant foods and some animal Foods I thought you were in the film which was talking about plant-based diet only eating plan okay so whenever wherever about an animal have animal products will kill you dairy products will kill you all kinds of different animals food is being used by the sea that people play nothing could be clearer The Playbook that was used by the smoking industry so they paid for studies and we know even with food place has been gone for cigarettes is being done with drugs research shows that industry-funded studies 1/4 times 48 times more likely to have a conclusion in that favor for that product that was the truth we never do the the pallet was joining what the hell so I want to make that really clear there was In Articles they connected we didn't do that if you watch the film we never said I did you why did you have that in there though if you're not saying because I'm using the same Playbook you're not saying that meat causes cancer you're saying there's anything to say Sears vegan doctors have enough so basically the consensus and just hang the changing every time they are changing because straw man argument was you were making some sort of a correlation between cigarettes and white of maca put away their mark on the Ravens and the way meat is marketed correct Solutions Family Healthcare president saying that you're connecting the two things you're connecting something that clearly causes cancer cigarettes and these studies that were made to show people that it didn't they're paid off. Studies are fake they were they were essentially cherry-pick fake studies that were financed by the tobacco industry locked in order to get people to buy more cigarettes you're making the same sort of crying about me correct which means you think that meat is okay but that's where where that's where I went where is leading expressing that individual feels weak like a thousands of articles in the peer-reviewed literature right so unless you want about me making a documentary Association of anthropology offered the director of energy and environment resources at my house really respected in animal testing so one of them being a chicken sandwich at lunch if this was a vegan bias coming into it will you connecting cigarettes so you're saying that the same sort of the same Playbook but there's no evidence the meat is bad for you know exactly recently been established by mainstream medicine you understand that right. They release new studies releasing these new studies saying that there's no longer this concern that red meat causes cancer or the 30 minutes is also an appeal to Authority because I find many illustrious doctors and experts were highly qualified that will disagree with number it fit a diet must be 100% plant based in order people watching and listening but he knows more about the consensus me experts in a field that I would understand what I'm looking at that research that is published the peer-reviewed research this published and even reviews of a perfect example as the whole Dairy and cancer section that we talked about cancer and I pointed to a meta-analyses it looked it over a hundred and fifty different reviews and 84% of those found no association so how is that not part of this discussion we're talking about hundreds of scientists across different continents different countries they're using pure viewed in the movie Just One expert is pointing to you know one group of studies without me that sounds just right to the 2018 merchandise as you go to sleep now if not like what your flight 807 is 507 Peterbilt 579 when you put some in quote what does that mean to you means that's what he said. Quotation is coaching the study right front of study can you anything you do in literature when you put some quotation marks recording mr. Douglas 970 1% should no evidence of it this week secretary consumption and 24 increased risk of cancer with Donna Summer I realized what he was doing okay if you want to go to a few guys like 110 you're going to really realize yet what Chris is doing okay this is really I'm glad that you brought it up please answer when can I just take the reason you didn't forgot you got a queen slip basically but he added 71 and 1384 right this is how you got it right is 71% plus 16 to 87% he could have said 87% show no evidence or an increase risk 84 + 16 Haitian or inverse Association shows decrease risk so basically doesn't inverse correlation but he did not show he could have said 87% sure no risk or increase risk and instead he chose to summarize its a 84% increase risk industry-funded research researches into swipe my research shows that are you are you proposing that we throw out every study because one of the main studies in your film was sponsored by the Hass avocado board the one with it claims that animal products contribute to inflammation yeah I'm finally getting a lot about that much do you think that the industry in the meeting has more money than the plant-based industry right agree with that actually we can look at some statistics on that I don't know anymore definitely a problem but I see it as a problem across the board and I think I have some statistics admit that you hear the audience to believe that there was a potentially decrease risk overall you made it sound very high because you didn't split between no difference. no evidence or showed an increased risk 84%. 87% that seems like it's got it doesn't hold you honestly don't think that that statement instead of just putting the 71% sure no evidence 13% sure that would be in the fairest and most honest summary of that statement I would say that if you wanted to say at the most accurately yes that's the best way to say up 21% showed no evidence 13% show decrease risk but I don't have a problem saying 84% showed no evidence or decrease risk true about something causing cancer that's the relevant point the relevant point is does the study show that Dairy causes cancer the primary under the most of the oven says it shows no evidence or shows a decrease risk that's the ultimate County 4% is to show evidence that indicates the dairy causes cancer if you do is study and it shows that it doesn't then that's not in support of the claim huge review of 153 meta-analyses because of Industry funding what is the basis for that claim I'm saying but it's ways the results can you then I don't I don't I don't accept it I've 153 studies that they were in this metal now sees that they're going to sway the results to the point where these findings aren't valid and we could do the same thing with this all the studies that link to in the film or we can we can also look at other studies on Dairy and cardio metabolic outcomes that we have lots of large reviews that we can look at this discussion to have if you're just going to sit there and say industry funding analyses which each also had individual studies in them are so bias by industry funding that we can't count on the phone I would hope that you would know more than I can't get very far in this discussion if you're going to claim that we can't even talk about studies in the peer-reviewed literature because industry funding completely biases the funny because I'm saying even though they were more cheering increases then try to decrease risk right I am saying that it's possible that that the industry funding to misleading statement more showed increase then decrease of crown but there's 71% showed know that all hypothesis is no longer correct it's not a while I thought that I was actually not true based on epidemiology if you have 10 studies that show no association and turn that show an association 16% showed an increase risk factors and they drink whether they smoked expect the results to be 16% showed no so it showed no evidence 71% or 84% showed an increase that would be something you say hey this is causing cancer this is more likely. That's not how I pretty much work started if you had epidemiology is slippery even if studies and 70% now show no evidence when you say it's most likely that there's no evidence that's not how it works I'm still in favor of showing the relation a person the people in all these studies are showing an increase risk of cancer we would we would agree with this is why or 84% they were talking about something that doesn't give you cancer well. I agree that this study found that what they couldn't prove causation right I couldn't prove a link between Cancer and are proving or at least making this correlation between consumption of dairy products and cancer but the evidence doesn't show that if you want to look at it in its entirety the Evan shows that most of the 71% showed no evidence of the causing cancer 13% showed us actually better for you you have less risk of cancer then not eating deer 13% I'm sorry if you look at slide 113 prostate cancer was a disturbing so it's 50/50 with beer consumption prostate cancer find between Dairy and any type of cancer at what f****** answer said you look at the black line that shows no association if you look at the green line that's increased Association and the red line was increase Association that was the mechanized that you provided causal and this very spot lol backup half-and-half that's not gonna know how evidence of a causal relationship games there's no evidence no causal relationship which martial arts and crisco martial arts but I think I know more about anthropology nutrition that I know more about boxing kickboxing Jiu-Jitsu and wrestling so we believe about the consensus which one you about leading experts nephew of a thousand times are viewed and would look at this study and reach the same exact conclusion that I did Bible proven connection between Dairy and prostate you have half study showing an association half studies showing no association not to mention the fact that that's as you just said that even if there was a strong correlation that doesn't prove causation what this is Broadway off here comes the question was still there a lot of inferences made in the film whether they were intentional or not on your part that you know Dairy people are hearing Odair he's going to cause prostate cancer they're going to extend that to cancer their other claims in the film made about Dairy and metabolic issues and saturated fat metabolic issues so the operative question that I'm trying to answer it data supported not just Walter Willett think that or any other expert in the film do the data support that conclusion right and I didn't even in that study the data don't strongly support that if you have half study saying yes half study saying no that's not a clear signal and it's definitely not evidence of the causal relationship so so having Walter Willett or anyone say there's a strong relationship and we know the mechanism and there's no it's causal that pilot study didn't you tell me that two-thirds of people have an intolerance towards towards milk and dairy and I have a study here is that what the numbers it's one two out of three people in the world have in the world and if you're talking about a study that shows 50% of the people in these studies that are consuming Dairy that there's a correlation between prostate cancer and in Derek wouldn't you assume that maybe the same thing that were talking about with two-thirds of people are in intolerant to something they consume this thing this entire causes inflammation in the body and that inflammation the body could possibly be leading to cancer correct no. Correct very very is inversely associated with information so we can pull up irritated by Dara if they have an intolerance to Dairy and you said two strands of people here's here's what I would suspect there that if you would be segmented those people out and said let's do a study find out who's intolerant of dairy and find out who isn't you would see even better results for dairy because despite the fact that some people are lactose intolerant we're still seeing in that meta-analyses that you know most people there's no association in most cases and inverse Association in other case Vista West wouldn't if someone's intolerant of something that means your body is irritated by means it causes some sort of disturbance right whether it's inflammation or gastrointestinal disorder you start farting and that's what happens when people are lactose intolerant right that irritates the body wouldn't there be when you assume that something your body is intolerant to would possibly be the cause of disruption or disease so right so if you're looking at 2 Prince of the population are intolerant but why would that cause prostate cancer and no other cancers I don't. Doesn't make sense that's why it's a red flag because there's no logical explanation for why it would cause prostate cancer but no other cancer Providence this is a review systematic review of 52 clinical trials and they found that dairy products were inversely associated with inflammatory markers which means the people who consume Dairy actually had lower levels of inflammatory markers so the hypothesis that Dairy is inflammatory and that's why it's causing cancer doesn't seem to hold up in a literature you also said that you know an expert nutrition into what we have to believe today is Chris really is it is about Manhattan houses but it's about nationalities is for the totality of opinions Can Only Imagine song just one meta-analysis and systematic analysis with all the data until what year is that you are better at interpreting the data than people that are experts in the field are many experts who would agree with me I can tell you about the second on the other side not to be wiping include them but you are asking people I would understand that if somebody Chris is figured out this neutral or diet that you figured out something about nutrition these better than the consent he knows more about consensus more about the majority of leading expert but to believe the Chris knows more about anthropology Urology heart disease Paul just agree with what I said you chose the probably one of the few that would agree with the idea that humans primarily ate a plant you exclusively plant-based diet for for most of human evolution we can go into that again I'm actually representing the consensus view point in anthropology James and you'll be hard-pressed to find a consensus group of experts that agree with that idea plant based diet for for most of human evolution we can go into that again I'm actually representing the consensus Viewpoint in anthropology James and you'll be hard-pressed to find a consensus group of experts that agree with that idea</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> pattern let me talk to you because this is one of the primary misconception that people have about consuming meat when they hear studies that say that meat is associated with mortality or high cholesterol or heart disease are all these different factors we are talking about these kind of studies were people fill out a form tell us what you eat how many days did we do you eat meat how many days a week do you eat this what they don't take into account is whether or not these people are going to Wendy's whether or not they're eating mistaken and you know and broccoli something healthy there's a giant difference between those two things but they're lumped in together because this is meat consumption out their studies on perfect for sure but you were saying that basically saying we should look at outcomes and not just look at individual Marquez write that basically diet quality the overall diet pattern so if I Grandpa Christopher Gardner did the study at Stanford a couple years ago and he took two instead of saying low-fat low-carb he took two groups and he advised them all that basically eat a healthy diet and then one group ate a low-fat healthy diet in the other group ate a low carb healthy diet they all lost weight but he wasn't that big of a difference between the two for athletes that need a lot more call Jen Foster knows from Plants I think the sun athletes that can slow and steady state where are you getting more file today Sheehan I think the state athletes can do but like an MMA fighter a soccer player not low-cal low-carb Advocate. I don't believe everyone should be on a low-carb diet but I never ever believe that some people Chris has his own he doesn't have a consensus definitions of carbohydrate levels you've made up your own definitions right when did I make up my own in 11 hours and he's on a low carbohydrate diet definition of 15% that you want so if you look at the pair of you let you try the less than 30% or the next by Jamie less than 40% by Jamie would be 15. peer-reviewed literature next call next slide 4265 and then High Cobb Chris Cole's mold and 30% pure view literature high-top morning 65 on the next slide more than 70 depending on the pair of you looking so you come up with your own definitions of what is low moderate nicop low carb moderate carb and high carb in my work with patients who wrote this out you did have a different definition than the pyramids when is the fortnite starter said that everyone should be on a low-carb diet and always argued that it depends on everything from your jeans to your exercise power and activity are you getting your numbers from like when you write low carb moderate carb and high carb this is just a wreck this is a clinical recommendation for my experience working with patients I'm not representing the scientific literature here I'm not trying to make arguments about Magnus backpack absolute Madness come out during. This isn't this is why I feel that Chris does that mean when you have people at Christian in multiple times it throws people's perception off as what is a healthy diet because Chris misrepresent the data he comes up his own definitions of things he misrepresents things that we said in the film K represent in the football do your patients low carb moderate carb or high carb these definitions how are you coming to these conclusions so there a lot of people James bit disagree with the the cart the ranges how many different studies were shown is this something that you just found that disputes his position or is this like a large group of mental health who uses you know of the folks at Verda who are all scientists and these they use a ketogenic very low carb diet 2% or even 15 40 to 65% you're not you're not you're not even in the ballpark you know so if we're thinking about using low-carbohydrate diets for example for weight loss or for diabetes or you know metabolic issues like virta health is doing then low carb is not going to be sore 40% not going to work so that's where my recommendations on how many based based on the optimal range if you have if you look at the rest of the Articles going to be like if you've got diabetes you've got your overweight or obese you're trying to lose weight this is the range that I've found and other experts like the people at virtahealth have found will be most effective and these are the rhonj is not there's no representation that this is the range that is defy is low carb in the scientific literature so you aren't you calling it low carb because if someone's on a ketogenic low-carb diet in order to get into ketosis you have to have a low number of carbohydrates taxi probably even below tenant not even not even just to be in ketosis like just to get the the maximum weight loss you know someone could be at 15% and still get quite weight loss without being in ketosis lost 5 minutes you showed a study from trying to prove your own point carbon low fat people how to quit equivalent Outlaws and just said that so why am I eating out all the sudden advocating only low-carb diets for losing body hitting only low carb diet so that they can both work at 4 different people and then low carb vs. high carb what he's talking about b******* like processed foods and sugar and eating tell her a rude and when you do that people no matter what low carb or high carb lose weight but I think you will agree as well as almost anybody would that getting on a low carbohydrate diet and forcing your body into ketosis makes your body burn fat does one wet. Strunk but it's it's proven Triton aren't comparing healthy omnivorous diet with apne on plant-based vegan diet they're comparing a vegan diet with a standard American diet that contains animal products yes I know and expect either so what what's the point why are you here and why am I here actually I did a double master's degree in exercise physiology and nutrition he's a registered dietitian you don't want to and we can talk about him</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I really appreciate Chris and as long as much as we disagree I really appreciate you coming on in and giving me the opportunity so everything going with protein animation about a positive reaction cardiovascular risk is found in meat eating plants in a healthy diet pattern fit all absolute eating meat by itself is associated with cardiovascular disease nobody ever has eaten meat by itself false dichotomy if you like old animal park by eggs and all this stuff and then there was a fully plant-based diet supplement with B12 which one would you have a false dichotomy show that says something about plants right plants are awesome totally agree on that was that eliminating all animal products from your diet is probably not healthy unless you follow a very strict routine will you make sure that you have all your bases covered nutritionally that's what Chris has said from the jump extend that and just say I don't think there's strong evidence thing that including some animal products in your Whole Foods plant-based diet is harmful eating and organ Meats for the nutrient density or you could have someone who eats more animal products in depends on the person and their needs are 562 but we didn't put a slide on but I think the granitic again I know that's really listening so I can maybe do you describe it to people differences in postprandial inflammatory responses to a modern vs. traditional meat meal yeah but I just want to point out that like yeah she going to eat 90% plans and you going to eat the rest of it from animal products I think it wild Court Elk and kind of roommate stuff like that would be the way to go by Fall coming from dealing with this grain-fed unhealthy animal when you talk about wagyu beef that is that's a dying animal I mean if you were a person whose muscle tissue look like a Wagyu steak by bro you got to get on a f****** diet you know I mean really but if you saw it like you know an athlete if you looked at an athlete's muscle tissue would look like a piece of elk most likely look very lean and healthy by dance so Android 10.1 but shows that me does create information would like to see the sun grass-fed meat has no nose to the feedlot fiber in terms of the Irmo the bio microbiota yeah there's a lot of benefits to having these fermented vegetables as well you know things like kimchi and and having things that provide you with good a probiotics he's a great benefit to a lot of plant Foods looking at like maybe a hundred grams of fiber and really high fiber intake as long as you're eating healthy as we we both agree forwarding the recommended BMI range body mass index so we talked about healthy plates of a broccoli and kale and also has a a piece of grass-fed meat that's what I want to talk over there on your conscious diet know I totally agree on a Paleo Diet Rite they had a two-year follow-up and they had improved loss body fat and improved blood markers what was really interesting is they were told to eliminate Dairy right so you cut out Dairy reduce the amount of closest concerts like white flour and sugar in a list of stuff they were told to increase their fruits and vegetables and they were told to increase their meat consumption and they don't improve health markets or across the board now was interesting is at the end of the year but they found was the people had not stuck with the meat recommendations to be kept them recommendations the same they got out of processed junk food right transpasses stuff that you don't agree we should get out of my Diet Rite they took out out that diet and increase the amount of time food so it's very clear that the benefit did not come from increasing meat consumption it came from increase Prime food consumption or going who sang it is from increase meat consumption and I mean that was the benefit is going in the mall Whole Food plant-based processed foods eliminate sugar eliminate these things that are just fiddled what we know that it's not just that it's a truthful different than incorporate whole time so you replace your you're getting rid of cramping in my personal opinion price on the consensus you're replacing both highly processed foods and animal foods are incorporating more whole plant food and I could say the same thing about the benefits you see with vegetarian and vegan studies comparing with standard experts experts in the field right turn to to Chris and go okay can you tell us more about nutrition anthropology and Urology than all of these experts I think that I agree you shouldn't just listen to me but I don't think it's genuine to suggest that there's a consensus that a whole food plant-based diet is a better choice than a plant-based diet that also contain some animal products we have no studies on that and we probably won't unfortunately for in the near future because before then I said before nutrition and dietetics recognizes that completed anybody to help her old life stages including for athletes I think that there's sufficient evidence to 100% but I'm not telling people that they should be doing now I'm saying you can eat whatever they want. I think we both agree that people should be getting out junk food right and so does transversal</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think we can get inside of demonology and look at that but I think we should definitely hit protein because I think if everyone watching right that's the biggest meth in the stupidest would have dry fan. It was a definite B12 so I make sure we would be 12 because one of the things that you said that he disputed was bring up that B12 quote that you said was complete horseshit I can read it out if you want. I'm pleased if you disagree with what you were just like with protein animals are only the middleman before industrial Farming Farming farm animals and humans could get B12 by eating traces of dirt in planters or by drinking water from rivers or streams but now because pesticides antibiotics and chlorine kill the bacteria that produces vitamin animals have to be given B12 supplements and you said that's just all false that oldest factually wrong so first of all B12 is made by bacteria stop. From SummerSlam Water Festival you misrepresented why I said so I said it's made by bacteria that these animals consume you went on to say that animals didn't get bacteria from the soil that's not what I said I said to get it from the bacteria in the soil so you misrepresented what I said drinking water from rivers or streams I've still have not seen convincing evidence that is true of I-49 Jack Norris a vegan dietitian has admitted as much in his article and then even more relevant than all of that is looking at B12 deficiency rates between vegans vegetarians and omnivores in the clinical literature like the other stuff is not really relevant until you get her into the clinical trivial critiques then is that okay so first of all you said is zero evidence that B12 is fed to cattle right you said that even fun animals have to be giving B12 supplements there that's what I said I'm down to Boston does the quote for the poultry right so would you have to disagree that pigs and chickens and I don't disagree that they sometimes get B12 but do what about shellfish shellfish are extremely high in B12 12 supplements you really suggesting that too like the population gets most B12 from shellfish know the claim that animals need to take B12 supplements in order to have B-12 in their flash so you not a writer and chickens got it from James even farm animals have to be king because you said that is absolutely false everything that I said about me tell you something absolutely false to do list also you talking about the people used to be able to get it from consuming vegetables right on it and that the water is now because of pesticides and chlorine in the water no longer have in your claim that the same percentage of you pick one study that showed equal to rates of deficiency in an hour at the huge literature that shows big differences between vegans vegetarians and omnivores can credit be 12 in their gut bacteria so what you bought Untitled by valves and other vitamin B12 Youfit is no evidence just because you're mine I got to read the small print to listen to his people just listening as well for sheep and cattle to three different products that a 200 sided two feet on the left liquid complimentary complementary feeding stuff continue essential Trace elements Cobalt selenium for 12 of B12 deficiency 547 okay this is the largest supplier of animal feed supplement in the world on their website young ruminants require supplemental vitamin B12 Pride development they also say find me cheapest sometimes administered parenterally to incoming feedlot cattle and also B12 to increase milk production there was no evidence but Catholic given B12 and you said that all my statements were absolutely Falls you at least admit that you were wrong there if I said that vodka that specifically that one portion of the statements that are still evidence and then later on you said there is also zero evidence that B12 is fed to cattle that is flat-out wrong and I have just shown that is that fact I was wrong about that so many other things as well so so you want to look at humans what is the point of the point with cattle or deficient because they're in a feedlot where they're not eating grass and that is the primary reason it is no more because B12 from animals do you just do you dispute that the primary source of B12 for human beings has been eating animals and also fish and shellfish in history so can we just go to slide 48 the vegetables and by the way be retained vitamin B12 store with adequate to prevent B12 and b12 that was in soil and water and that by the coronation and filtration systems that we use today that's what's ruining the water in the water does not have at least 12 in the morning the consensus view that you can get enough B12 from eating unwashed but that was the consensus view what he said in the statement was that the reason why we no longer have B-12 in the water in the soil is because the fact that they had Koreans and pesticides and that seems like there's evidence to back that up again now I'm giving you the facts do you question that I spend $1,000 on since then if you say you have no reason to disbelieve it's a lot of time it's a lot of 10,000 hours is a lot of times like what was it lean Layne Norton said that you should probably have gotten a PhD I don't think that's because those people a lot smarter than me but I'm making me sign. soil that aren't absorb and utilize like true B12 do receive B12 under whatever circumstances I don't know whether it's because they're grass-fed or grain-fed I'm assuming their feedlot animals that don't get proper nutrients from soil for I don't get property I mean if your getting these greenfeld bed soybean fed cattle and they're just pouring this dried out s*** into a bucket these animals are not grazing in there. But likely deficient a lot of different things is also they've always been supplementing their die with mineral supplement with vitamin 97 and getting it and you're not just having anybody B12 about 12 in capital and Avenue a 4.3 have to be calling Capital you have to be you there's no haven't you said it was Zero evidence about that you said there was no evidence about being able to get it from watering and again I proved to be wrong. There B12 from eating from Soil and Water with no you're misrepresenting is misrepresenting is wrong. You got to admit that in this case but clearly wrong about B12 being given to cattle when we showed before industrial farming farm animals and humans could get B12 by eating Freddy Carter dirt on plant Foods or drinking water from rivers or streams that people will get the idea from hearing not that we never needed to consume animal products to get B12 and we can only occur we can get plenty from eating around so where is the evidence for that other than the one study that you showed their that that's because most evidence of vegans even vegan tell your friend your I said this you took issue with my plan and up to 39% of people tested including me if he does all low in B12 as a result the best way for humans to get enough b12 with animal food is simply take a supplement then you said he didn't provide a reference for that so it's hard to check but again a contradiction amount of evidence on B12 deficiency so can you bring up slide 50 please Jamie you said that I didn't provide a reference OK button the bottom all of the references whenever I made a claim about the signs of the research Outlets covered by the can you put slide 51 please show me that is not your e-book on the left yes okay you rounded up to 40 but I kept it 39 s Pacific Coast Healthcare practitioners in the general public realized data from the Tufts University framing have plasma B12 levels normal range range at which many experience neurological symptoms that was the opening statement of your B12 ebook and you claimed that you couldn't find the evidence of that study no disagreement that B12 deficiency is an issue I've talked about that on my website you said I don't know why did you open your ebook with it it's not okay so there's two different issues here one is do omnivores get B12 deficiency do you have any idea how many articles I've written over the years remember every study from every article I don't know how to write so Level Training and nutrition in California acupuncturist have for your master's program which includes a lot of medical sciences and nutrition research methodology etcetera because we're considered primary care providers in the state of California so the training is a lot different than it is in other places so there's the question of can omnivores develop B12 deficiency yes they can if you go in the rest of the e-book is because of things like sibo by individual what would be considered right be more is more common ingredients that is what clinically makes a difference if someone is B12 deficient our guts then then they develop prepared to go to that I will get to that you said before 5 claims that I made about B12 Waupaca be false I've already pointed out three of the things that you got wrong out of the five and you were the one that like is recommending and telling people what to eat Trina and my facts in this case doesn't change anything about the I'm recommending that on a vegetarian and vegan diet and there's lots of studies showing that can develop B12 deficiency absolutely I see it in my at 40% or meat eaters you reference you didn't respond right away because there more meat eaters in the general population has nothing to do with the fact that beat that meat eaters are getting levels and vegans and vegetarians study and that study said only the researchers found no isn't an opening statement of your ID book references the study but you said you didn't mention this part only the research has found no association between plasma B12 levels and meat poultry and fish intake even though those boots by the bulk of B12 in the diet it's not because people aren't eating enough me to get the B12 is that so distant Banks up my train the safest way to get B12 is to take a supplement now Crystal just say you'll claim was right I didn't say I didn't accept that I did not buy doesn't matter whether you accept you don't know if you even said that like we should consider high levels B12 deficiency remake even more but doesn't that doesn't really matter the point is that you are saying that Rosa county is the best recommendation stop doing that are $60 blood test and test for B12 then you can decide whether you need to supplement on the level of vitamin B12 in fish and is all the factors that inhibit the absorption you say where you can just spend $60 and get a blood test if you're going to recognize in the world not everybody can afford having stability to the safest way to get B12 if you eat me or not is to get take a B12 supplement to 92% of vegans that's with using holotranscobalamin which is much more sensitive marker B12 deficiency than serum B12 which is really problematic and then you have nine out of ten comparisons of homocysteine it found higher levels of homocysteine and vegetarians and omnivores and higher levels and vegan compared to vegetarians and homocysteine is also more sensitive marker than serum B12 four stages of B12 deficiency and serum B12 will only go down change in the fourth and final stage of B12 deficiency so these other studies that I shared on the last show we are looking at holotranscobalamin which is the most sensitive marker B12 depletion not technically the deficiency at that point and then you have homocysteine and methylmalonic acid that are more sense less sensitive than holotranscobalamin but more sensitive than serum B12 and I need to show you some money if you got all the facts wrong so far about B12 of my plants you said that they were old false and they weren't false by every time that I made so far was backed up by science and you have admitted that you made mistakes are vegans not you can we got to remember that most people probably listening vs100 vegans 92% it says 77 vegetarians 77% and omnivores 11% B12 depletion but that study showed it was more like 40% of depletion emails whatever whatever the numbers I agree with this. Can you just go to the next slide please Chris I think slide 55 this is from the study this is from 16 years ago by the way I'm picking studies to suit the bias so this is what he said in subject food is not consumed vitamins the levels were Walker said right lavender scent an omnivore science degree like if you couldn't get B-12 anyway you should incorporate some animal food into diet fat 556 I'm showing you handpicked study from 16 years ago by 56 from 2018 with twice the sample size of 100 people now know he's dead B12 supplement the studied markers indicate that is independently of the 57 now this is a study that looked at runners in May of 2019 really current and it feels like you might not have the most current they said because you said to me in your email that you sent only one part of what you do and you have lots of other things that you're doing right so 557 this is comparing vegan vegetarians and on the ghost runners plant-based eating but also the supper music better to the vitamin B12 status of supplement uses of omnivores was high I can patch it in known supplement uses and a high proportion of known something uses have B-12 from just outside the reference range so again that more evidence that people it's a good idea to supplement in general cuz you just have higher levels is a water-soluble vitamin anyway 50 you losing from the tractor so you can absorb as much I'm not playing those who studies outside with no moral I'm saying that you handpicked to study reading study James as many studies here so we agree people on plant-based diets people if you want to eat 95% plants and you don't know how common it is for them to supplement animal diet with B12 is it a rare thing when is metabolic consult with keloids turn off the pigs and chickens and vegans have higher homocysteine levels than omnivores not attend comparisons found higher homocysteine levels in vegetarians and omnivores and higher levels and vegans and vegetarians so that's 9 of 10 comparisons that's not hand-picking one study that's nine out of ten comparisons that have been done on this topic right I'm out like you said before we shouldn't just look at the mall cuz you should have been out comes right showing that you pick the study from 2016 your Tablet S very small sample size that is 9 out of 10 comparisons right there that was not the only study that I do not know anybody that I showed that when you came to be 12 or the statement true and you said that they were completely false and you were wrong I didn't jump debunk Chris did not debunk the film he made misrepresentations back claims and he got things franktuary wrong but he certainly seems to have gotten it factually wrong that animals particularly cows or not giving B12 supplements he certainly seems to have gotten it factually wrong that at least some of the B12 the people would be able to get in the past that I got from water and soil and the percent of people are the best way to get B12 is the supplement so so the thing is I have proven that he got three or four things factually wrong educated and not educated is not whether or not they go to specific plot tartlets whether or not they absorbed the information and when they study and you know that you're you're obviously agitated about your assertions about Elaine's still stand that vegetarians and vegans have much higher rates of B12 depletion or deficiencies and omnivores the books of the sudden necessary for many people buy for people that can afford America in a nice like air conditioned room and we drove him we can afford to go to the doctor like the best way to get B12 to take a supplement. And you're wrong if you think otherwise if you can afford it short if you have a diet that gives you the amplim out of B12 you don't need to stop if you're saying is that blood tests are expensive so you should take an expensive supplement now they're not expensive V12 he is whether the argument is that you presented in your ebook play snot in grass-fed not a Michelle not as much as permanents in the boss majority of animal products that people are using B12 supplement Christian chicken f****** a mouse it's pretty stunning the other carnivorous little monsters then chickens in when you get them and you get those eggs and eggs look like a really dull yellow those are animals breeding grain only those are vegetarian chickens that's not what they want to eat what they want to eat is worms I don't need to have supplementation this is sort of an argument against vegetarian diets for chickens really really eat that way. For beef what was what was misrepresented by I really appreciate you having me debunk right and there was just a lot of things were financially wrong and it's more that I can point out okay</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and I've seen you say this phone interviews we have 22 years of research showing a single high fat meal in Paris endothelial function that study was call it was from 1997 snow eating 50 grams of fat in one group was 0 grams of fat then the high-fat meal was an Egg McMuffin a sausage McMuffin from October about the Browns and non caffeinated drink off from McDonald's the effect it had on endothelial function which suggested a healthy omnivorous diet with plants wouldn't have the same impact there was a 2019 review and this is will be at Kresser. Co / game-changers adding nuts avocados olives very spice Blends orange juice red wine and protein including milk protein to a high-fat meal prevent endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress we've got studies that suggest a dairy and egg proteins and prove endothelial function 2015 controlled trial with 52 subjects dietary proteins including milk and egg improved endothelial function 3006 study adding dietary protein to a high-fat meal prevented postprandial endothelial dysfunction we have 2009 study followed subjects for 12 weeks a low-carb diet improve endothelial function where is a low-fat diet decreased it 2007 study I followed on and on and on animal products in it milk and egg protein Adventures of endothelial function not worse than it has animal protein worsens endothelial is the scientific consensus we keep going back to literature what's wrong with healthy compared to what healthy or unhealthy compared to what do if you have a low-carb diet and you replaced bunch of white sugar and flour you might not see your internet the outcome is going to be a dwc claim that was made in the film is it animal product animal proteins worsen endothelial just listed a whole bunch of studies especially those suggesting here's one that says influence of food patterns on endothelial biomarkers is systemic systematic review the conclusion was that healthy food patterns abundant in fruits and vegetables had a beneficial impact on endothelial function westernize patterns higher intakes of processed Meats Suites fried foods refined grains were positively Associated inflammation McMuffin and Egg McMuffins and in the end you show they're not showing that my studies. how does it mean is optimal when you see the fight and everything in it so when you see follicle postprandial lipemia that mean offering me a fat in the blood that's associated up to a 50% decrease in the female function which means Nest nitric oxide is produced which means that the office don't open up as much less auction unless it's okay so how much are trees at dieting flow-mediated vasodilation right so as the triglycerides this is after the meal which was by the way a shake of whipping cream and liquid chocolate and nonfat dry milk as you can see that the two hours again how to find Osaka parents are more fat in the blood by YouTube that liked Essence the Milky mist of the blood you can see that very clearly but the flow meter dilation drops are drunk by 11% okay if you look for example that make sense of it when you have those fat in the blood your ability to your office to expand goes down with no whipping cream and that's it now I just had some so they can put another here that we can skip the next one at 11%. The only thing that changed I put the belts for the plant-based meal and the Redbox in Korean BBQ add milk oil mayonnaise rice and vegetables calories is in red and the plants and animals I don't know if you want to go into eventually buy something for which changes of fmd for mediated dilation postprandially not alter the meal that which is important task is at law for 6 3 hours and what do you do again to be another animal voicemail for the overtime and then and this may pave the way for the development of our arthro sclerosis BMO base meal 2.7% increase in fmd 2 hours following the plant-based meal dilation this is what you've been talking about mediated dilation at 3 hours increased from 5.1% to 6.5% in the carbohydrate restricted group and decrease from 7.9% to 5.2% in the low fat Diet Rite 12-week low-carbohydrate diet improve postprandial vascular function more than a low-fat diet white flour and stuff in it that's the thing that's where that's often the low-carb diets due to their being paranoid to add the diets with animal if we're talking about protein to claim the film was it animal protein causes endothelial dysfunction somehow I've gotten off talking about fat and I've just mentioned many studies that show that that dietary proteins including milk and egg improve endothelial function a study Bible dietary proteins improve endothelial function on your fasting conditions but not in the postprandial state with no effects on markers of low-grade inflammation 2015 study compared to do you can show a huge benefits of eggs if you compared to laud right you can just sort of proteins that included soy soy milk and egg and they all improved endothelial function prevented postprandial endothelial dysfunction and then there's the two low-carb studies that I mentioned there's Gold trial that found a low-carb high-fat diet improve pulse wave velocity which is another marker of endothelial function their studies of the Mediterranean diet which is a healthy diet pattern that includes some animal products include improve pulse wave velocity Seafood consumption protects against endothelial damage yes, compared to beef at the does review mean between a vegetarian and non-vegetarian Sprite the three times increase risk for those white meat I took a chicken once or twice a week and then you go to a mint analysis which is not comparing you're comparing fish to bacon or beat of course but he's in control trials that look at dietary protein milk even know how to read do you want to feel qualified to read even a single Paper yes but you don't know how to read a photo taken research took a master's-level research methodology class so I'm referring to study literature if protein milk and egg don't do that logic class I'm referring to studies that are in the literature and you haven't answered the question like if if if protein comparison Ophelia function why or studies showing that milk and egg don't do that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so you said what's a little disingenuous about the film they said every plant has every amino acid will yeah nobody disagrees with that but it does have a 11 of an inch of them the first of all people to disagree that if you want to search just you know plants of missing amino acids people think that it's missing some of the nines every plan has everything I said in varying proportions that is what I said and you left out the enduring proportions which again I think is disingenuous he did not complete my quote you can pick part of my quote to represent your view so people remember one do you think the plants are completely so a lot of people think just like you know that people that dissolve cool thing when no one thinks that protein gives them energy I don't fight studies here the only place I could find on the knowledge of Collegiate athlete and around 50% in each of the studies think the protein is what gives you energy for people with things like why did you put that in the film at the strawman people don't think the protein give you energy about 50 Cent. A fleet think that protein gives you energy back to you like the DIA how is it determined so the benefit dies takes into consideration amino acid profile and bioavailability how is it determined press know how it's becoming the DS I don't know the details that's right. Took the whole digestive tract so what came out in the end we looking at about so basically pause the ileum Yukon a digestive loyden absorb the protein released by the bacteria right right because port in the pig now ptcas with mercy and rats and this is done in the rocks in the stomach humans but it's mostly done in pigs but it is a most similar digestibility to humans and they basically assessing how much about protein is absorbed right and how much the amino acids absorbed the floor some people make the argument well amino acid profile requirement different bunch of crap but I'm not going to make the argument a quote from last night when you were trying to bash the film it's all about protein quality and this as you said is an established science a firmly establish science prevent nutrient deficiency developing England but like the nation in like a hundred 3130 countries of that so it's like 29 malnutrition was largely conducted after the identification of Selena and the realization that many children globally are suffering from subclinical protein malnutrition to a address protein malnutrition the composition and digestibility of proteins must be determined the next slide and this is what I was looking at the store and I can see the top candidate the icicle bendy going to say cultural organization of the United Nations has developed methods to evaluate the protein quality of food items and in 2011 the digestible indispensable amino acids Gordie iaas was recommended as a successor to the previous their previous method why are you assessing anyway so I'm not going to have the argument that what I'm going to have his I'm going to go with everything so far far during divorcing your other PS lower back to us endorsing of the dixk Ocala FL points out because that's what it was designed for as you can see and looking at post-exercise skeletal muscle the DIA does not attempt to delete so it wasn't designed for that system it was designed to starving people in countries why do we not getting enough protein and you weren't getting enough protein as you would call high-quality okay so would you recognize that it wasn't developed for that system is based on the scientific literature now for the amount that I still think it's irrelevant measure of protein quality because it will go get it and they do acid profile and digestibility I agree but as you can see it's still looking at amino acid profile right you can see that it's looking at the at the relative content of amino acids in a particular food yes and it's looking at the LDL digestibility which I think is an improvement but again it looks at and it's not just my opinion that is not used for that this is like in sports medicine 2019 and I drink you're busy with other stuff you probably haven't seen this article that came out in February but have you seen this Parkinson's that's right that's an important factor okay it has been proposed that mop out muscle protein synthesis is maximized and young adults with an intake of 20 or 25 G of high-quality protein about 20-25 grams of a high-quality for high-quality protein do disagree that like eating four or five times a day at 20 25 grams of high-quality Beaver whatever you want to touch High School whatever and then you'll see you know the screen just don't you agree with do you agree that that is the amount maximum I suppose it when it shows it that does to a 4-Hour window acute muscle parties is most of the Sports organization suggest that for acute protein 120 grams of protein a day is that enough for a gas leak proteins in 250 lb athlete how to say no so I'm not staying there any more protein than that right to repair recovery 4-Hour window vertical acute short-term Batman trying to maximize muscle and that is because anything less would like like 17 grams or something into things you're loosing you're getting 1.2.1 which is like a foreman right it's like telling the others how you should build so you're getting enough leucine and you're getting 810 grams of essential amino acids that is why is important in the acute stage of muscle protein synthesis of I'm sorry this is like a long but it's only like them down so for like ibjjf that doesn't mean that that's the best scoring system for MMA right that you can get points for like yeah so this isn't just my opinion scientific literature you shouldn't be heading to 1.6 to 2.2 this states that shoot anabolic responses are not associated with long-term muscle against probably can only be answered by assessing the results of longitudinal studies that directly measure changes in lean last with the provision of very important messages so you agree that it's not just about a certain point it doesn't matter because yeah if that's how you don't have four times a day unless we can have a hundred fifty grams of protein and have 40 grams right so if you're going to optimize muscle mass and by the way how much how much must have you put on the last 15 years I'm like 190-193 maybe it's nice like if I go over 200 I feel slow I feel so the handgun I feel like I just feel so punching like whatever and then you have to hit a video so what you have to do two things you have to maximize the muscle presences in the short-term and you have to get enough protein during the day right 1.62 2.2.2 it doesn't matter essential amino acid amount and the leasing amount in the for you can hit the loosing amount and the amino acid amount in virtually all of these vegan forms of protein is that what you're saying not to do it with like you do beans rice and vegetables Ascent protein powder anyway broadcast if you want cuz there's a lot of planes ever made with completely false again so if you get enough protein if you hit one of the windows if you hit the 1.6.2 urging you can hit an animal protein amino acid profile vs. plant protein so you're saying if you're getting enough protein in show of as you have acknowledged of the right ratio of plant proteins difficult toll if you like if you were really messing up and eating like a healthy juicing depending on where you live you might want some vitamin D was this is what it was with his assertion was that the amino acid profile of meat is superior the amino acid profile number one athlete and hitting the ground so we'll you're saying is that as long as you getting this 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram protein desserts lentils are peanut butter or so that you have enough amino acids to achieve the desired results and it's essentially the exact same as if you're hitting that 2.2 grams if you're getting 2.2 grams of protein and you're doing it and you're not doing it in the way that you said where you're not planning it in and not getting making sure you're getting enough Lucy which is longer but there's a certain quantity that you will achieve am I doing good so slide 34 because you basic digested as well more precise data collected the more precise data collected so far in humans assessing real specific orally nitrogen digestibility has shown that the differences in in the digestibility between plant and animal protein sources are only a few percent contrary to historical findings in rats or determinations using less precise method in humans probably just came out last month published I'll take this one step further there's only at most like two or three percent difference in digestive time protein and you know how it goes fast in the pigs they give them raw food so they give roll beans Walgreens and you've said one of the reasons that is classified digestible is inhibited the Lights Casino hasn't been tested we know that I just about the stress in Plants by a few percent only if you decide not to 40% vs 100% but he was claiming lost time that's all science science and different imagine that not only if you hated it but you would get equivalent you might even get more because you're killing the trypsin Inhibitors by heating it so that whole mountains about quantity you were wrong the quality the GI scope was not designed for that it doesn't matter when you get enough protein as long as you get enough protein using measures for a organization that is looking at Hunger I am withholding about if people have got enough I agree if you're in a developing country and you have very little diversity of Pampers and maybe not enough in this manner what you should be eating animals I agree that that is not what it's designed for and it doesn't matter not enough I agree if you're in that like a developing country and you have very little diversity of campers and maybe not enough in this mineral you should be eating animals I agree but that is not what it is designed for and it doesn't matter when you get enough protein</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> American attorney try and tell her that you but I feel like I spent a lot of time digging into research I had to the research checked and checked and checked again I had to reset check to make sure it was not cherry-picking that it was reflected upon her into evidence but who is checking it where they people who were not Advocates of a whole food plant-based diet exclusively or were they know people like cuz all of the experts in the film are people who are clearly aligned with this that protect airline with the consensus and no over half of them I thought you just agreed that there is not a consensus that 100% plant based diet is better than a diet that includes a lot of plan correct amount would represent that point of you that it doesn't have to be on a plant-based diet Netflix bright the ones that actually spoke on on speeding in Arnold is not leaking he doesn't think they're eating soup for babies and it cut down on me by 80% to all the people I mean is not he's on a plant-based diet eat seafood you know I'm talking about scientist who published that needs you know who are on the team that the paper is that I've shared to go with that to me it feels like you don't have your finger on the pulse honestly I'm not trying to be rude I think you probably know a little about you feel about that study study the study that said that studies exonerate all from the same company but apparently giving recommendations will guess what and companies like that not the ones that give public recommendations on what people should be a number one with exponent need directions like another exponent so if you look at their recommendation Festival Frank Frank who is now the chair and Hoppity took place set the panels manga recommendations for adults that red meat consumption habits is highly irresponsible he's ever seen and if you want to follow the recommendations slide 90 2017 for the sugar industry so there was a meta-analysis in the annals of meter today you mean the thing about the red meat okay the recommended daily caloric thresholds for sugar intake are strongly associated with negative health effects analysis so don't worry about your intake of sugar a****** that was what I meant because you came to and then two years later do you really think the email address of the person that open I emailed the most from the beef checkoff program they've been doing that since we started to sign up for meeting list they look at when the film is coming out and you don't you think it's a coincidence that the day before I started film comes out they released a paper exonerating read me in and cancer and the same place so if you'll be to buy a study about sugar financial support for that paper was funded by the technical carbohydrates of ilsi North America and as far as the international Life Sciences Institute sounds pretty legit right so its members include Coca-Cola company Pepsi company and Red Bull and a bunch of other folks looking out for your best interest all this recent study no disrespect your busy with lots of other things you run a successful business Consulting people selling stop I get you don't have the time you were unable to read a basic Forest plot look at it as you will soon. I just don't think that you're the one that's really respected scientist accepting the stuff from you except the method analysis on red meat and on processed meat for cancer can you also go to accept the 2017 study meta-analysis you accept the store if you accept a saurus second goal and pointed out industry-funded research is 48 times more likely right do you know that when they did the math analysis they they doubled and tripled and quadrupled up because when he looked when the dimensional analysis the analyses included studies multiple times scientific research with that funded studies again if they finally starting to understand other studies and those the same conclusion adding those on as if it's an additional studies and research studies Tortas you can switch things around and make it look good if you want it like look at Alexander and I don't want to get like on Saturday but if you if you give it to get from tenants a week to call Victor week it doesn't raise your cholesterol so that's how it is MC what are you doing I was just making a point the industry-funded studies the results of the mega house right proving your point that the same company that tried to exonerate the sugar industry is also Thanksgiving studies funded by industry in seven less you can pass those out and see is that really busy and we can't rely on any study not to have them that you would really need to look at the way in which a study is designed to see if it was viable and you also have to replicate the studies Mainstays you want you Cam proof and picking them to just eat your bias you are the one that quoted this study that it showed your fingers on the pulse because hundreds of like top scientists have written letters joined in the same letter to the house Internal Medicine asking for those things to be retracted investigation into the annals of internal medicine that doesn't prove nothing has been done and controversy is not surprising as red meat has been demonized for as long as it has been and then a study comes out which exonerates it that it would be entirely expected that there would be controversy. Sutton of scientist who described meet guidelines didn't Report top students who died so that because remember most people listening scientist who discredited meet guidelines didn't report past food industry ties the lead researcher Bradley C Johnson said he was not required to report his past relationship with a powerful industry trade group on know what that tree group is but if you scroll down by controversy did the baby make a nonprofit with a fancy sounding name and then they back it with industry-funded same with the meat study being objective resent that study is evident when the consensus of the scientific researches is a GameStop study Bitcoin current investigation is ostrich being retracted the co-author of the paper and probably ship to mod correct season of Dean and Agriculture and Life Sciences at Texas A&amp;M right with the program and there's actually a lot deeper than that actually goes back to the Brazilian government but letting slide 94-94 was just posting about me to program partly back by beef industry because if they found things that happen to be correct and they release it but they release it from a shity company that has which studies included in the analysis explain this to get to your point Chris you agree with the founding with with the the conclusion of that study and you think that the evidence pointed there's many studies that point to the idea that red meat is not in fact the culprit in the culprit is when you're looking at these epidemiology studies that you're looking at the overall diet of these people and ass do they eat me you're not asking what is the quality of the food they eat so I agreed that conflicts of interest her problem and I you know that the editorial that was published in animals alongside of the study said this is sure to be controversial but it's based on the most comprehensive review of The Evidence to date because that reviews inclusive those who seek to dispute it will be hard-pressed to find appropriate evidence so who wrote that studies covering millions of participants over 34 years there are several other men analyses that have been done over the past few years so I don't know the best way to show these cuz I've got him in a Google doc so 2017 let's see if I can give you the title to a Me Maybe you can Google it or something contempt play review of the relationship between red meat consumption and cardiovascular risk quote from that study the review concluded quote recent findings demonstrated that despite the presence of heme iron and carnitine red meat does not significantly increase cardiovascular risk when it is assumed in recommended doses you have 2014 meta-analysis of 13 studies this one Jamie is called association between total processed red and white meat consumption all cause cardiovascular disease heart disease mortality and this is a good example of what you were just saying Joe there was a slight increases station between red meat consumption and cardiovascular mortality and then at the end no significant associations observed between any type of meat and heart disease mortality results of the present meta-analysis indicate that process meat consumption could increase mortality these results should be interpreted with caution to the high heterogeneity observed and most of the analyses as well as the possibility of residual pounding meaning helping user bias Lippy in a meta-analysis of 11 studies of red meat consumption and heart disease concluded the quote the current literature data does not support the existence of a clear relationship between a large intake of red meat and increase risk of myocardial ischemia and then this is one of the largest it was done let me give you the title of this Jamie red and processed meat consumption and risk of incident coronary heart disease that should bring it up that's by Misha at all conclusion consumption of processed meat but not red meat is associated with higher incidence of heart disease and diabetes so there's a bunch of meta-analyses that have been done over the years that reached the same conclusion and we could you know look at the same saying this is for heart disease but also some for cancer so it's not just that study there are many others as well then I am in line with the consensus for, I have to leave head a range of carbohydrates could be a pretty you are not in alignment with the scientific consensus and you claim that we try to fit in the film right that you handpick studies to backup your biased not to mention that we've pointed out that the studies in those mandazis something to have refunded by industry control those out but you don't have the wherewithal to assess the studies in the Metro analysis could you point out yourself give me the post plot conclusion right conclusions and writing but has not looked at the actual data so you haven't been able to establish when I was like spend the first thousand hours I would look at the whole paper and then I would look at each otha and I was big into each offer to see where that that funny was wrong and I'm telling you that the industry is finding studies to explain things in their favor and you plead the Fifth there's no doubt about that why do you think those lost time then why did you point to an industry-funded study for the scientist wait wait wait not clearly invalid it wasn't representative assessing food Robin nutrition organizations like National Academy of use the methodology that wasn't appropriate for looking at what we were looking at to Reno in the child have been found the association between saturated fat</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Titus your concerns with the protein and just make sure I'm understanding your argument protein quantity and protein quality and within protein quality it would be the ability is that fair issues with little consideration for me to get quantity and quality of a mix of amino acids in if you're really on it but it is well planned and it's likely that you'll get protein 4:30 is muesli taking me off the plate and you only eat what was left on the plate you're going to have a problem is pretty low in my experience put me through a lot of hours of extra work 3000 about 3100 you know anyway so there's just so much fun with it with what you said that you're going to eat every single topic 3 oz of 90% lean ground beef ground beef for protein content from grass-fed beef which is what I advocate okay cuz I've recorded a number of times so 1 cup of cooked lentils or peanut butter sandwich has about as much protein as three ounces of two or three large eggs that was what I said okay so you know are you safe has 24 grams of protein I'm not sure what your sources of grass-fed beef is leaner but he's talking about what he does advocate for the ground lean meat protein is Whole30 Brad Pitt someone said you need 5 tablespoons of peanut butter to get the same amount of protein in what world does someone and that you changed your tune a little bit when you came in the park. I use bread two pieces of bread what is 4 * 521 piece of whole wheat bread 34 even on the leanest beef you chose it was 24 grams why did you say you needed 5 tablespoons of peanut but I know how it came about because I think what you do is you take other people's work like the nice man and all these other people you read their articles and you take their arguments because some of the stuff it down your site is very reflective of people's other arguments on other sites so there was something that started when people started saying in 5 tablespoons of peanut butter you don't include bread and we make a sandwich cuz it rain the most people do it's not just peanut butter I almost bought peanut butter sandwich in here today to show you what two tablespoons of peanut butter looks like a two and a half cuz when I had I looked and it was just surprised me like a real tablespoon we showed a piece of whole wheat bread on that we're advocating eating mostly whole food at the whole grain no one is saying we decide in the film if you want to try it was just try to push plants we said white sugar in flat white flour bad for you associated with weight gain 5 tablespoons of peanut butter at 4 grams a piece that's 20 grams right around the bread crumbs so why do 24 grams of your handpicked lean beef which you don't even mess with you there's no reason that you should be picking that one will be shown in the film why you can think 24 tablespoons 55 minutes I'm hearing something to just factually incorrect so that's why I hear that's why I'm here again pressure to both of you so give me just look at actual the breakdown of all these different things agreed on is two tablespoons of peanut butter and two piece of bread go to the flights quickly as you don't get to see it on my slides tell him to go to YouTube yeah we go of bread 5 grams of protein are accepted that right tablespoons of peanut butter has a gram for the slide what is on the left side when I arrive at the theater this is absolutely. We're talking about we're talking about quantity of 18 grams of protein about as much protein in the peanut butter sandwich with two tables that you couldn't last I mean 18 is not 24 tablespoons of peanut butter and I was really conservative I'm in the brand of protein ground beef organic ground beef in the neighborhood of the lowest and the highest okay so go to grass-fed beef slide 11:3 18 grams okay so much is 17.9 round it up yet three eggs a engrams at best I said about I was trying to show that dispel the myth that you you know times have no protein and animal foods have all this protein so I've just showing you that now your second point was that the problem with his second point was appointment peanut butter sandwich to get 18 grams of protein 410 calories you know that may not be a problem for somebody who's training 31 calories I love the people like to point out the beef and peanut butter sandwich when compared those even though we were right on the protein now you're trying to pick on the calories so you didn't pick the length / 231 calories the next 1 5/16 has which is about the same for be this route 210 calories grass-fed beef in the first instance 17 turn on 75 calories and that was on the right none of the last one that we could have picked something was left out a survey Pick 10 paper example slide 1970 calories so again would you say but I think his argument was the argument was the quality of the provider and then there was like always based on the calories total percentage of protein isn't that more calories to get the same amount of protein stop so many calories you couldn't get it and you were wrong again agree for the peanut butter sandwich or just in general I ordered pizza for us to high protein recipes from your site because I didn't pick the simplest Alex about being fat I think the first couple sweet potato and leek omelette next 18 grams of protein do you have an issue with your own meal so do you have quality score and I will show that you were wrong again so tell him bacon hash slide 2118 grams of protein 570 calories if you want to go to your breakfast of champions which I thought it's like 22 and by the way I took your date writing to you at the I assume that you would not lying 600 calories do you think that people should not eat that meal depends on who you're talking about but no how much does protein do maybe I'd have to buy the protein powder from your website in order to make that up anyway so let's move on to now the by the way it's like 23 largest buddy Abaddon comparing completely plant-based with okay. So this is how much they're actually getting the largest of the Avedon comparing theaters actually per pound of lean body mass Point Break about the amount that we're actually requiring we're going into the amount now we're still a fleet's guess cuz this point is like managing got enough to survive but I don't think that was I think his point was that a different required for athletes you can get enough protein for athletes more calories after they get more protein as a percentage or two positions on medicine the dietary protein intake necessary to support metabolic adaptation repair Remodeling and for protein turnover generally ranges from 1.2 to 2.04 kg per day in the next slide Jamie if you could bring up slide I have I agree with that and have it in my where are you eating at from the big Square of 1.6 ft squiggle means about a about 1.6 grams kilograms a day during ret resistance exercise training provided no further benefit on gains in muscle mass or strength and he's like really highly if you look at the two so we're 1.6 G so it's less looking at about three-quarters of a gram per pound recommended anyting over that provided no gain yes directions to get it was 6 grams you decide so it's actually out to 2.2 and down as low as one but 12.2 the other one the Academy of nutrition and dietetics and the Forfeit of 1.22 to the widest range is 12.2 compound of. Probably just 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day is one gram per pound of butter so no doubt party Builders and athletes testing at higher amounts may be beneficial so if you go to Jamie if you search for examine.com how much protein do you need there's an article there and examine.com is a do you know about about them that I know of scientist or group of scientist if you scroll down Jamie to the optimal daily protein intake for athletes and similarly active adults or if you just click on that you see in that paragraph different numbers because 4 of the 49 studies in the meta-analysis lower-range were conducted in people with resistance experience the other 45 were newbies studies found different numbers female athletes required 1.4 to 1.7 male endurance 2.12 2.7 amateur male bodybuilders words of 2.2 grams per kilogram for those interested in comprehensive breakdown and provides another link Rainbow 1 to 2.7 gram or kilogram so that's a high range and also I think some of the studies that you've looked at that look at I just want to point three if I should go down my computer to having my slide but they wanted to point 12.3 you go to this two things about that one it's winter in a caloric deficit has a gluconeogenesis you told some of the protein and you tricked you know you use with a vengeance is less protein left the building so if your bodybuilder cutting for competition turn it down to like 45% and your protein requirements go off about that no more rain because also the case with those carnivore people in a lot of Keto people as well right during exercise you can only get 10% of your energy from the oxidation of protein into glucose. So the opposite and it's too big it wouldn't be 2.22.18 on based on the junkrat how much protein can the body use in a single meal for muscle building applications for daily protein distribution shut off C1 of 2.2 Grand a day and cohort of young male bodybuilders all of the method of assessment indicator amino acid oxidation technique used in the study has not received Universal acceptor determining optimal protein requirements trying to point out that you was off on Sunday if you want to take your eye the indicated amino acid oxidation index is that the company store still 2.24 the scientific consensus that you threw out a bunch of high protein vegan protein turn the levels that I can just find a consensus on the poaching Rangers draft least annoying find a consensus would be 3.3 but even if they were there's no reason you couldn't get it got it on a plant-based body argued that everyone should be eating 3.3</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the thing is about striking to is like striking when you mix in with wrestling you can kind of get away with a lot more lot more crazy s*** happens people knock people out that maybe would not people out normally Kevin Randleman was an amazing example that he knocked out Mirko Cro Cop a left hook striking to MMA and you know there's like this so much craziness going on that sometimes it's hard for people to clearly establish the Cuckoo's actually better on their feet until someone can stop the craziness colored lines that maybe other people don't see or maybe they can't get to where they open a jar and he finds a few things you're doing good you think you're doing good but he's waiting he's waiting for the moment where he sees the spot and he's been looking at and he cracks Darren till dubstep in left hook and put some out walking animal like Darren till and cold come on guys to like we kind of because of his last few opponents it was like Donna Graves who is going to fight before Johnny look at his legacy in the Legends at a spot it's tough for me to get up for the challenge so he's playing with his food right now wait wait till he fights I'm telling you wait till he goes to heavyweight you going to see the old John 20:21 there's actual where he thinks it's a challenge wait till you see in fight a steep are Francis you're going to see the the monster come out all right let's do it I think I think using cruise control I think you are entirely correct you are at that Elita level when you've never been defeated if one lost the b******* lost everybody knows the b******* lost he's you really should get his record clean let's read something to you want me to clear them with this whole pictogram s*** the found out that this is what we just have this new ability to measure substances in the most minuscule amounts that it's so ridiculous that just some random sort of vitamin that has some contaminant when one millionth of a gram or whatever positive that's not a drug it's not like someone's cheating so they cleared them on that right you saw that makes this whole statement about the the new way they're viewing this stuff because the factor equipment just amazing you can't hide from the Sun sleep and relax not hurt it's not helping anybody in terms of them stronger faster and it might help them with anxiety a lot of other things so they release that right there doing good things but with John it's cleared that he doesn't take anything that's just some some s*** that's a residual residue that's on something else I'm contaminated supplement same thing would happen with Tim Means to means got busted same way they ate mini drag it out with him for months so I guess UFC news suspension from painted something Chopra net there's a window will Josh has had an extremely long window obviously youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion so long just come to a close and they took away a large chunk of it but they're going to last a long time with these guys like they say that like at their Peak the best fighters have nine years at their Peak it's like a few like real Legends GSP obviously GSP Jon Jon obviously right John is undefeated right now I mean they took his title away when's it back right never never lost title fight and you're dealing with the guy wins the title youngest ever in the sport flying knee opener on Shogun head up just nothing but success since then people that liked inspecting him with a microphone expecting him to fall off like you're dealing with a goat used to go and eat it after the Santos finally content with one leg so I went back and watch Jon Jones fighting you watch you like oh he's and kicking and give two fux about being in the right now but he was smart to Granderson or Anthony Smith Smith and Johns Lake all right let's do it man so if you know that he's f****** with his food right now while he's so good but he still able to fight out like the Gustafson fight the early one the first one was a perfect example of him falling into a trap right partying too hard didn't rank in the stretch with some stretch like he had to be pushed War for that fight I'm talking the best I've ever seen in the training room I was like magic 5555 what the distance and 1. Match Justin's the best light heavyweight of all time if he was in a different era and there's no DC or John Jones he's how about the DC fight alright featuring decision that's cool running back boom KO DC said you're not going to trick me into leaning towards my right where you can hit me with that left kick like I said a conversation about it how about the DC fight alright featuring decision that's cool running back boom KO DC said you're not going to trick me into leaning towards my right where you can hit me with that left kick like I said a conversation about it</div>

Can go away you see it right yeah thank thank God or whoever's up there man for you and Bryan Callen thank f****** kid station the world that's a that's a identity thing two men that like do you people get strapped into that identity it's one of the hardest things about Fighters is when you quit you you have to find meaning in your life like what it what are you good at now dude for me I know I never did anything professionally but it was the formative stages of my life where the only thing that gave me any feelings of good was martial arts good at drawing but even then I was like my drawing teacher didn't like me I had friends that I was close within the class we all Drew we liked our stuff but man I feel like a f****** loser except for martial arts so when I quit and then I'm just doing, and I suck at comedy of eating s*** and I was like what am I quitting for like I'm quitting something that I was good at to be something that I suck at that maybe think I have his pipe dream that I can eventually make a living out of I remember that feeling of not when an identity and obviously when you're 21 known as an identity anyway you're always so how to win a f****** confusion your head and try to figure it out I was super fortunate where I was surrounded by guys like you kallenberg Tom and it's just like where I want to be in that party I was I was so fortunate get the Stars aligned for me where I was at this party over here and guys are getting CT and you know you're fighting and it says f****** grind and then you guys were over here I'm like why I want to be one of them I'm good man I'm good I won't do that you and I think it took that bridge in that Gap you and to be honest I think I would that's the only way that you could have done it because at the the ego that I had at the time especially fighting men begin to that level it was like that Eagles insane The Narcissist in the the dream of I can beat Cain or Steve pay these guys and I think the only way that I could a bridge that Gap is by you going so hard in the paint was so scared about in Ghana also see where they're going to fight you with in Ghana or someone like that you don't mean I was so scared you were going to get marked by some some when you weren't all in any more those big f****** when you watch like when when Francis murked ovary with that left uppercut Jesus Christ yeah I might my feeling was when he came over as K1 Grand Prix champion because the most celebrated Striker was ever had in a man you saw it in his fight with Brock Lesnar phenomenal people f****** crazy insane in this he did the same thing to Junior dos Santos remember all super worried about that like this quick Ascension into into this UFC and I'm and I'm fighting top 10 top 15 guys I'm in the I'm in this world but it's like I was almost like a cheat code because I was really athletic is really really athletic with my background so I got a pass a lot of guys fast math lettuce ISM but then you get to a certain point we fight these vets were they they fought big powerful athletic guys before but it comes down to experience background site I got a bath a lot of guys fast math lettuce ISM but then you get to a certain point where fighting these vets were they they fought big powerful athletic guys before but then it comes out of experience and technique and that's always always going to win nine times at 10 that's always going to win</div>

Hi correct that I can have to go back and watch as more competitive smart he sees things and he can act on things that other guy's just they just either don't have the ability to that or they don't throw themselves in the fire correctly like he does and then he gets out good his defense is on skin with everything put it all together he's able to fight with his best stand-up stance you know he's fighting like and he makes you aware very clear very quickly that you're in danger with his hands he's throwing bombs at your f****** think about his experience Nick Diaz I'm looking at Connor you know they're just you think I don't care about the development I see why he would say that but I think it would be a real shame if right now in his prime of primes he didn't fight for the title I just feel like he's so close and that will do beat he's huge right now once that's done I want Mazda doll to fight for the title whoever's got the belt I think if Mazda doll and Nate Diaz or Nick Diaz don't fight on the undercard of delfield I don't know if it's going to fight but my thoughts are that right now we're experiencing Zone where are you see Fighters enter into it whether it's through this rededication or refocusing of his intent and his discipline and came back like and then came back do it man than just he became the Superstar night I just you know when it when when I meet those guys and you lost another store and you get around them that you just I have to sense of just like I'm so happy for them in they got that's why I talked about a Nick Diaz fight for Jorge night I talked about Conor McGregor fight because you're not the titled like tomorrow and Colby they're not making real money man you don't think that the Colby going to bring a lot of people record would say does it and I love Kobe spent at 5 ticket sales in pay-per-view snow let me text from Colby with one big win right now I can see he hasn't fought in a while right fights Robbie Lawler before that was a whole year with his $3 suit and it's f****** Maga hat and his bone the strippers if he gets through it right he gets through and he beats come on and get on the internet and it becomes like a thing he could be but he's crazy s*** talking with his $3 suit and his f****** Maga hat is bone the strippers if he gets through it right he gets through and he beats come on and any Bandits get on the internet and it becomes like a thing he could be the next huge Superstar</div>

He's like if you feel that way Brahma support you call my manager the next morning and it took us so I went I went I went that weekend call the fight we held off on the announcement allergist how they feel like look he's going through some things were good give us a couple days so I got you that weekend and he said you still feel like that, they want it but I think I'm done long story short we ended up announcing it September 21st was like a two-week. We're trying to keep it under wraps and doing all the stuff I was letting the necessary people know Roc Nation HBO everybody know and the night before I announced him and me and my good friend who's the director he's also directed mydoc Deonte Thompson he we put together as video cuz like a legacy video where I had my young son my middle son and my oldest son and those are like those are like you know that was me at that point time in my career and we did this whole video that I was going to announce my retirement with and and actually have the dock that I'm working on right now is about this like why did the best Fighters tour of the world at that time walk away from this point on Top Shot the video I'm in the damn I retirement bro and the response was just overwhelming you know it was like I just couldn't believe the amount of people that were reaching out and it was like it was good that I was getting support but it felt like somebody died like I felt like I died and it was overwhelming that follow like I said it at the beginning of this podcast harder than I thought it was going to be one of the hardest if not the hardest thing I've ever tried it had to do and still like I still have to do like it's a daily decision if you're not doing it no more than one of the most rewarding man and it was a necessary evil and I hope that one day man the young guys can look up one dancing and imma do the laundry Wars I'm done I'm out like how long do we have to do it before we feel satisfied look gross money if you don't if you're not financially literate go get some help ask questions and as soon as you feel like you're not really there you won't do it no more Sunset bro you can do hope to be an example in that area what's so important I think for there to be a god like you because people always have this narrative Fighters always come back they always fight like Sugar Ray Leonard did when he fought you know later in his career it when he thought he was Danny went and fought yeah the Terry Norris fight was hard to wash man and then you know it Hector Camacho stop before you that's true that is a handful handful was a brilliant guy to articulate it's like he's an interesting intelligent guy that just said we could get everything we need to do by the by the assholes you know it hey you know all fighters going to wind up with brain damage all fighters going to wind up going out on their back there all end up coming back after their Prime it's so important for guys like you to say you do know that you can manage it correctly use a shark infested waters but you stay on the rocks and you do your due diligence and you put in the work and your discipline and you fight correctly I agree with you so wholeheartedly about appreciation of the Masters of a real masterful boxer like when I always talk to people about Floyd Mayweather to talk all this s*** he does this all that forget talking watch how that guy fights he f****** barely gets hit he's been rocked maybe twice in his whole career Maidana and and Sugar Shane Mosley those the only two and it's masterful boxer and that's what everybody should emulate this as much as anybody but if that was my son I'd be freaking the f*** out don't fight like that it's not worth how give a fuk how many drunken assholes turn you want they not going to be with you when you wake up in the morning your head is pounding in your head when you have a hard time looking at light when you you have to have all the shades closed when they're just a little crack of light coming into the shade is hurting you is give you a headache and they're not going to be taking the reporter in there that was etan and you know talkin down against you know guys who bought you a question and it was two guys at the gym and one coach said amen my teacher sent out of hitting I get here.

I pulled like eight people out of a man and I was alone and they were all armed and it was one of my heaviest most intense cases and I've been on one year like say if you were if you're preparing for a fight how many days a week do you do strength and conditioning everyday everyday everyday is not of course it's not the same training but everyday I see Valentino and we train together yet everyday I train more conditioning is trench more than kickboxing infant hold Miss for me for should I can high can hold me for my myself you and me for me and we just talked together we just playing a game plan together for fight we just to I'm My Own coach know that is crazy at your level and then I just move from Pantry in countries and countries to run to run to run and then came back in France Paris and it just turned myself that isn't saying how many World Championships themselves I think nobody but it didn't founded a new coach I don't know about making any trips to Holland or the tile and you know in French yeah yeah yeah, he might have heard on our our show he just sent me a paper it was about kids attitudes to Wildlife and it was comparing rural people's attitude and knowledge of wildlife the kids with Urban and Suburban attitudes about wildlife and you can see the input of media when you look at this thing because people who live in urban or Suburban environment when they tell you the top-of-mind wildlife they know about this non-native stuff like lions the other likely to know like what's what's an animal right in the MLB draft right and people who have a more remote Viewpoint what are much more likely to look when they think of Wilder to think of things that they interact with you know and not like the things that are on your mobile above your crib when you're a little baby and it sort of points and also there's a slight tendency I got to look at this more carefully but has a slight tendency to have negative feelings or think things are dangerous or bad the more urban you are in terms of native Wildlife the more recognized it as like a negative or bad thing and what they're pointing to his being part of me to the office of authors if I'm messing this up by just looking at this morning hope you're pointing to is the the the stirrings of there being a greater acceptance of decreased biodiversity meaning that you're kind of like okay with the bad things haven't gone and we're focused on like water animals animals will be like a drafting hippopotamus in the things that the Disney tells me about a not like possums and raccoons with your kind of girls you know we're like okay I've got a Ferrari 328 I want to make it a little faster and I've done all this stuff on my MGB back in the day so I know that you wind up doing with the intake and exhaust are the options there but they were all basically horrified like you just don't do this to a Ferrari in like the only suggestion that came out with how we can put in Italian to the exhaust on it and now you know I'll make it sound better and maybe it's good for a couple horsepower or something at those are things that people largely due for the Aesthetics is oral or visual with it and that's not a big move and write it out that time John Romero at the office had I picked up there's a copy of Turbo magazine back in the day and there was an article about an old replica I'm I'm kind of race car done by a local company in Dallas called on Norwood Auto Sport or Norwood Auto Craft and what do you think we could what is the 328 have standard horsepower the best probably the European trim it was probably around 300 horsepower and number of steps of this and this is all I swapping out all the computer electronics on different turbos and eventually I melted the engine in it when it was at like five hundred or so and I went through a long history of melting many pistons in the different devices different I cars but that nothing this decade-long set of interesting experiments there that was my gateway drug into working on this or like okay we made all this power in this system we know it's kind of at the limits of a lot of things in the chassis after we melted the engine there we tuned it back down a little bit that's the way so many engineering things wind up going to do it until it breaks when you dial it back a little bit and you stay there must have been 3200 lb eye but yeah you could really feel it rear back when you went into it and if I speed is a little bit dirty if you start getting up in 1:54 tomorrow so we thought well what's the next level where do we go from here so I'm he had done a twin-turbo job on a Testarossa before which is a much wider car and flat so there's a lot more possibility for doing things there so I got I got a Testarossa and we said all right we're going to do the twin turbo job with intercoolers with the new engine management systems and we went through this long string of upgrades through this which generally was like okay we melted the Pistons we broke the input shaft all these times but at is top-form in Peak still have the dyno sheet for is like a thousand a 9 horsepower at the rear wheels horsepower to this was over a thousand horsepower at the real wheels and it was amazing I thought and I want to say this very clearly I thought he was wonderful this job you know if you had someone was actually a business person on that show would be the worst show in the world because Bill Gates would make proper decisions and crazy but no filter that's what you want. So we got to his makes arbitrary decisions that you try another human brain tries desperately to make those makes sense and that ends up being some kind of entertainment and so I actually actually a Donald Trump junior said to me and of all the people we've had them and show you seem like the only person who's ever like my father did you actually seem to like that I have a Fascination and to respond and a affection for people who are able to get out of their filters and I said some people do that with pure genius by Bob Dylan some people do with bravery like Lenny Bruce some people do it with drugs you know Neil Young perhaps Jimi Hendrix perhaps and most people do with a mixture of stuff but I said Thelonious Monk said the genius is the one who is most like himself and I said with some sort of mental problems coupled with greed and a lack of compassion your father has somehow found a way to throw off the filters and I will listen to Tiny Tim talk on tape for hours because I like that little bit of Asperger's and all that other stuff I'm not assuming I'm not qualified I can hear him talk forever I can listen to Lenny Bruce you know the hell will there has those hundreds hours of him just ranting on his tape I think I don't like people on drugs that much but the way I do and I listen to Lenny Bruce talk forever and Donald Trump had the dark side of that it was almost like when I was hitchhiking around the country and it'll almost enchanting you'd end up in a biker place and you know some Clubhouse and some guys just hold important I've always been interested in the people who are out on the margins you know and what what Donald jr. took as affection like I guess was a bit of affection but it's also that if you have thrown off some filters I'll listen to your talk and so that was that was very very strange and then I really did spend a lot of time kind of sticking up for Donald saying that is interesting stuff there and yeah he's he's crazy and he's Beetle and he's empty really weird stuff that you've never seen before you have never seen someone who has never laughed sincerely and never made a joke never laugh sincerely the joke you but it says remember things on Twitter did you see the thing you did on Twitter the other day we put a picture of Trump Tower in Greenland they said I promise not to do this I mean I laughed that was funny Trump Tower in the middle of Greenland I never shot Tower in Greenland they said I promise not to do this I mean I left that was funny Trump Tower in the middle of Greenland I never shot</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> f****** Trump just passed something to do and no one wants to give him credit for any stuff wasn't going to start wonderful stuff for kidney transplant stuff I'm sure all the student loans for disabled veterans student loans for f****** everyone we're crippling kids or crippling 17 18 year old kids with sign up for these f****** loans and they could compromise the point where we have people to this day right now under Social Security money their Social Security money is getting docked because they owe student loans there at the end of the f****** road and what are you do what do you do and this is a real question this is not rhetorical what do you do about the feeling of fairness the people that work their way through college waiting tables that's a good point working really hard and then they just say their feelings of which I think is valid is yeah yeah you got f***** on this but let's help someone else out what Amaya compassion as you know there are people that work really hard to not have student loans yes and there are people that took them to have to be somebody who took them frivolously 100% And I think quite a few and I think it's also we also should pay attention to the human mind and the development of human mind the frontal cortex and then frontal lobe does not develop properly until you're 25 years old right so somewhere somewhere in that you can't be trusted with money or your future or thinking about what the f*** you're doing in terms of like taking on a debt of bond is $1,000 I have stuff is well don't we have to decide when someone's adult and then give them that respect yes I have I say you're 18 years old can't control what decisions you make yes what is that you're going to because I think 25 is too old I think 25 to others well yeah but I think what we're saying is we look is a lot of 18 year old people that make very good moral decisions and we should we should praise that he was a problem with the student loan thing in terms of the it's the only loans that you never get exonerated from you can get bankruptcy right and you can get exonerated you can you could escape the phones of credit cards the debt of mortgages you can escape a bad business collapsing and owing millions and whatever you get you to escape that through bankruptcy you cannot do that with student loans it's a corrupt system you take a child was trying to learn a trade or trying to learn a profession and you acquire insane debt is going to track you and crippled you for the rest of your life and no matter what happens to you you owe that money making your colleges out of the free market to buy giving those by giving those loans easily yes and by having government help yes are also are also taking away the free market because you know we found out that when you put the free market in like LASIK surgery when insurance doesn't cover it it gets Wicked cheap you know and if colleges had to be paid as people went without Easy Loans to get and if call did not get government money they might be Wicked cheaper I think they went in there were really really expensive gas crazy expensive solution is in treating education like a thing that's going to make our society better and and think of it as the same way we think about the fire department same way you think about police department mean when you read the paper there's always one whole thing about college is getting too expensive and people can't go yeah and then you turn 20 Pages later in the paper and there's an article about how online learning is going to happen is happening at all this stuff is going to happen do you think that that idea of college is going to hold up for another 10 years I think there's an experience that people have what they call away I did but I went to college in my town and went to UMass Boston and I really only went because I didn't want to be a loser I was really all it was I was doing martial arts and fighting and traveling all over the world all the country rather and and thinking about doing stand-up at the time as well and then transitioning to do in stand-up why was also still taking classes I was wearing nothing was a complete waste of time I was only doing it so I could say yeah taking classes at UMass Boston us barely paying attention barely showing up and it was just a thing that I didn't want to tell people there wasn't going to college like that was the number one reason why I did it but I but that was kind of unique life from the time I was you know graduating from high school to the time I start doing stand-up I was obsessed with martial arts in competing and that's all I want to do is make the Olympic team for Taekwondo that's what I was my goal and that's what I was trying to do so I wasn't a normal person I wasn't like I was going to go to Ohio and f****** and travel over there and take a full course load and not be able to pursue what I wanted what I wanted to do was going to window doesn't didn't exist and the only other option was the Army there was a dude who sings clay bar vs. really talented I was a fighter who was on the US team at one point in time I think and he was competing through the Army like they they had to subsidize his training somehow or another and I was thinking maybe I should join the Army like those the other the only other thing that I was thinking about doing but for people I think there's a thing about getting away from your parents getting away from them getting away from their influence being wild and crazy and be with are the kids trying to find yourself I think that comes from traveling to a place and going to college and I think there's there's some benefit in that I have friends that have had great benefit in that the sort of transformative experience of being on a campus of physical campus in a place that's outside of their Hometown where it gives him this new experience where they get to trying to reinvent the Pluto God about that appear to be someone else I wonder why we getting that a four-year. Why isn't whole life you cannot be could be instead being a snapper weed that's going to change because people aren't having job for the whole life Anyway by the way the liberal arts education was never supposed to teach people to trade for I was always supposed to make it so that young man could talk in parties to give people jobs what's so rigid right you get out of school high schools is torturous affair with you being a square peg trying to shove into a round hole than you get out and they fly off to wherever the f*** you're going to go to school and you go there and your forth with this overbearing workload of school and and then social things you're trying to figure out what's okay and what's not okay now where's the safe space and what am I what am I allowed to say this and what am I allowed to say that and what are the new rules now for this new generation or are we really going to change the world world you realize that f****** money that you spent more that loan you got is not getting you a job and you're f***** and you can't get a job and you're also massively in debt and severely depressed and trying to figure out your future I mean bendy going out or all people up for a horrible failure I am with Bernie Sanders in that I think education should be free and I don't think that's a bad thing I think y Burnet Burnet How about if education is cheap like everything else is getting cheaper if you want to learn anything now you can get it for free on the web you definitely can't do anything other than physical things things you can learn online in the physical things you can get a big chunk of it from online tutorial I mean what's let's talk about all the matters okay let's talk about juggling all the time and that was my whole life was juggling and what happened was with the internet juggling got tremendously better because people could watch videos of things they knew were possible and get better at juggling get better physics early can teams like you can take a course at any college online and if you sincerely want to learn you know I don't know if we need to have this what is it what is the term called when the when the Amish take their one-year of Rumpelstiltskin attack attack subsidized Rumspringa every person to cook describe yeah it seems like live your f****** life there isn't this four-year magic. Or the two-year imagine. And go out and learn the stuff you want to learn I mean you know we both have children and they'll be talking about going to college and of course. Of course but my wife will push very hard for college and my thinking is anything they want to learn so true which is the libraries in local towns more true now it's even easier now I can't imagine growing up where my my son can type in Lenny Bruce and it all just pops up Ryan I mean that was an amazing store is Wreckers Mitch's Lenny Bruce and he's on Sergeant Pepper I guess I should learn about him let me break that down until I learned about Terence McKenna I learned about Terence McKenna from listening to a Bill Hicks record was like who's this McKenna and what the heroic dose until you've read Franz Kafka in the penal colony I got the record hoping it up it said that I listen to one side got to that song got on my bike road down to the Greenfield Public Library Kafka I got this written down Kafka in the penal colony sat there Reddit went back list of the record my entire education starts with Mike Nesmith of the Monkees who said listen to Zappa listen to Hendrix from Zappa to Lenny Bruce from Lenny Bruce to the whole world and I believe that that is available to everybody all the time I mean I don't know if I would say taxpayers should pay for college I think I would say that we need college is Never Fade Away I think there's a real benefit to being in a classroom with a brilliant professor what I'm saying is I went to one of the first Ted conferences and you got to hear you know all these credible people speaking it was mind-blowing and I wasn't college-age I was you know I was whatever I was 45 or something for me and it was an amazing Spirit Jonas Salk you know I sat and listened to Jonas Salk talk in a room with brilliant people speaking in it really really great I think we can we can deliver that cheaper and that's the side of Bernie Sanders I want to talk about it's not can we get endless amounts of money these f****** people on college campuses can we pay them all the money in the world to take our children and give them something to do in between smoking dope rather just say can't we make this experience cheap enough so that anybody can go and experience it why don't you why possible for you for a few bucks to go and be in a room with a green person I think that would be a thing that would be beneficial to almost anybody at any point in time instead of the rigid structure of like you know this is you know you have to get all this work done by x amount of time that's the other thing that happens the kids to their taught about having no sleep and about beating your body up and about cramming in about getting all this work done in a short. Of time there really were really preparing them for a horrible job call the ship that doesn't work I do all that weird that weird kind of hazing s*** that we do for medical professionals you're going to work for Highway and ride right by horrible bad bad public school that had an influx of hippies from UMass that came in and experimented on us so we had no education whatsoever I graduate from high school in a plea bargain I had very good SAT so I have scholarships to whoever wanted to go but I chose not to cuz I misunderstood Bob Dylan I didn't know he was lying so I went and hop trains and hitchhiked around and looked homeless for a couple years and I never Read Moby Dick till I was 45 thank you if I'd read Moby-Dick when I was supposed to with college-age I wouldn't have gotten it but I was able to get it at the right age and now it's my favorite book and I was ready for it you know there's so many things that are on the curriculum that are very very important maybe not that day I think there's also an issue with people not thinking of Education in terms of like that it's a lifetime for Tuesday and that it's it's not something that you graduate from college then you're done we really should be educating ourselves throughout last night to end. Just accidentally or incidentally by experiences we should do it because there's things that we pursue that are interesting and now it's one of the greatest times ever to do that because of audio books you can do it while you're in the car you could do it while you're on the train you can get educated by they're doing this weird connecting thing where I love to take courses online and then fine people overalls taking courses online in their communities and then meet at like a f****** Starbucks that's what happened before in the class which is mind-blowing that that can happen to you can take in one of my huge I mean one of the things I want to do is I want to learn to play jazz on the way play upright bass I forgot to put 45 and I learn to play upright Bebop based possibly and now I really want to learn Olympics I figured maybe there's a government watch list I'm not on so I should learn Arabic give me everything learn Arabic how I can learn Arabic and it's amazing the kind of network that's developing all over the world to be able to Anythink my argument with you on the on the on the Bernie thing of pain from his college is I think we can get college so f****** cheap you can go to college your whole life well I don't think that's a bad idea you know if it's possible to get cause a cheap but I don't want Professor to be poor minutes think one of the real problems we have a budget with public education is that people don't want to be a teacher because teacher teachers don't get paid much government intervention that's doing that I would say if you got a minute to mention keeping the salary low I think so I really think so because I think that we're not having enough of the of the of a competition and stuff that I mean you know you you would pay good money to be in the room with the Steven Pinker in an astral I think that locally this is always a problem but I never figured out known I was in Greenfield Massachusetts town of 20,000 I would say. the other by other high school students I would say you know if we didn't give our money to The Rolling Stones and the Beatles and Dylan and all these other bands we could pool our money together and have a really good local band. Have a great band right here in town you know and I think that you thought of Education that way can't we get in our little area really great teachers you can teach this stuff it might be pretty boss why would be a using if we could spread education rights or any any method whatever we could do we can encourage people to be more educated but I think that one of the best way to do it really is just a lot of podcast that are educating people there's a lot of information that you can get in. Male entertainment but it's getting is with there's more information available now than ever before I think it's very different than what college is traditionally college is a thing where you go and it's a rite of passage it's like men we don't have those world and I think we could do with them I think we could do with these rights of young men I don't mind maybe his case for young women obviously never was one but when you're young man there's this transition area. Where you're a boy and then all of a sudden am I a man yet on when am I am at a lot of a lot of cultures and religions have done that stop I have a degree I'm a woman now have a degree I'm an adult and you're obviously you know I'm I'm seeing this you know it's okay to speak with an accent not okay to hear with one I'm hearing that from someone who spent an awful lot of time explaining to myself and others why I didn't go to college you know you wanted to show you weren't a loser I didn't have that I didn't say I went to Ringling Brothers Barnum Bailey Greatest Show on Earth College if you want to make sure you don't get respect that's where you go wide say I talked about it's because I want people to really know where my head was out I don't want to like glorify the car was when I was in college I went without any rite of passage at all Ryno and the closest I had to write a passage was earning my living. You also know you were on a different Pursuit like your Pursuit was the Kearney Persei can you enjoyed that and it was like a I want people to really know where my head was out I don't want to like glorified where I was when I was in college I went without any rite of passage at all right and the closest I had to write a passage was earning my living. You you are also you were on a different Pursuit like your Pursuit was the Kearney Persei can you enjoyed that and there was like a you have had a lust for it you know it obviously worked out well</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> where the rubber hits the road with conspiracy theories right now Jeffrey Epstein that are not conspiratorial reminded like what wait what the f*** is going on what all the cameras were bad or the guy was on suicide watch he tried to commit suicide and then well don't do that again and then he didn't like if you talk to people have been locked up they take away everything man on suicide watch the f****** take away everything and you find this guy a broken neck hung himself like how how do you hang himself can we see the video footage of the camera's broke yourself is wicked hard is not easy it's not easy it's not easy when you're in the jail and they told me no watch every 30 minutes for the what the f*** was the psychologist thinking it took this guy off suicide watch literally a couple of weeks after he tried to commit suicide if someone tried to commit suicide speaking as a guys had friends commit suicide they're f****** thinking about it for years man some of them they go back and forth day today, but when someone does actively try it they're not going to just be fine while they're in f****** prison awaiting trial for having sex with kids seems like Jeffrey Epstein's life was going to get really worse than what it was a few months before or other people's lives are going to get really worried because Jeffrey Epstein's now in jail and they're digging deep into his past and well we flew them 26 x 26 x it ain't a lot of time to fly with a guy I don't understand what the big deal is I know Jeffrey Epstein yes me too and a lot of them they really was that yeah I talked to him well as many people to feel like he was an agent and that he was trying to compromise people and that's one of the things about this whole Lolita Island thing is that they would compromise people they would compromise people by having a bunch of young girls or very sexy who are hired to go and flirt and maybe even have sex with people and that these people were young these girls 17 underage make perhaps underage son places to practice not underage other places but incredibly embarrassing and you know for the people and agent compromise was it the prosecutor whoever was it cut in the deal literally was quoted as saying I was told he's above my paygrade and that he was intelligent that's really the try to find a quote yes the guy said this was when he gave him the lenient sentence many years ago was right you were told wrong I think the guy I think they're look I've talked to people many times that work for intelligence agencies and there's a lot of weird s*** that they do and one of the things that they do to compromise people as they get them involved in weird stuff that could be very bad for them if it comes out and then they have influence of this person and if you got a guy with a voracious sexual appetite I mean there's a few of those fellas out and you know how I got out of that are not office now I'm just f****** hanging out and have a good time with Jeffrey we just flying around I mean come on man it's it's it's highly likely one of the guys that I know that knew him was also a freak like a sexual freak and I'm like okay I think I think I see a pattern here it's very likely that that's what was going on this guy was compromising people and probably absolutely a sex addict himself and I believe all the women and say all the all things that he did to them and hired them for things and had underage girls do sexual things with him probably true probably true he's probably a f*****-up Twisted do but many people that are involved even in good things get compromised like there's many people that work for the CIA that were legitimate CIA operatives who selling drugs this is a lot of this happened people go sideways people get involved in Shady activities are cops there's cops at wind up doing illegal things they signed on to be a cop to be a the person's going to Serve and Protect and be involved in the community in slowly but surely they get compromised and they get involved in illegal activity and next thing you know they're corrupt did happens to happen. He's probably shortly and then sometimes people themselves that knew him it was they weren't even aware of the CD stuff going on and of course they weren't even aware of the CD is done going on but he was at 100% he was also a champion of science but that's the thing about people they can be really good in some ways and horrible and other ways this idea that people are buying or your one or a zero is nonsense there's really good people to do Terrible Things is really terrible people that also do good things</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> completely change the subject if I made you know I want to talk about when you came on my radio show with Phil plait about touching the moon landing what I think is fascinating about this about clubs and stuff you know is you know I know why I've read your in there that you've gone back on a lot of bad your conspiracy stuff and stuff is the thing I've ever zero astrophysics education zero I don't know anyting about whether or not that it's possible to put people on the moon I dunno f****** and I I dunno teams and I do not. I do understand what people are bullshiting people and nothing is a lot of that with with a lot of the NASA stuffed a lot of the older stuff in particular there was a lot of manipulation of images and putting things online that may not have actually really happened because it was press releases and image of Michael Collins from like a Gemini 15 that's a very clear image of him doing a simulation like in studio with straps and harnesses and then someone from NASA or someone put that exact same image blacked out the background and used it as a photo of them of a space move and it's not real you know but they sold it is real there is some overzealous shirt like that that if you're conspiratorially minded once once you start lying yes but he's the bad astronomer he knows this s*** and I say I really want you to come over radio showing just talked to Joe Rogan about about manipulating and Phil says off no problem how to make a joke and Joe Knows also how to set you up and take you down here I don't know it'll be no problem I said you understand me smart he's a comic right not an astrophysicist but you understand that he's smart and he's also you are going into his form we're going to be on the radio this guy is done a lot of radio this guy's talk to a lot of people will just have all your facts in line men were sitting there cuz you know you were you were on the phone and you do is on my podcast with me to sitting across from me ever listening and you come in and you come in Humble and charming and sexy Edward perfect timing on everything and fill playset with Joe is wrong and Joe is going to f****** win this up so that so that it will be a thief are my whole thing of doing this web billboard and it was up to that two guys talk from two points of view I'm not supposed to be that hard if you remember for the whole show ads and I go oh by the way we did land on the Moon Pantene abuse idea was this the science team that you're right and they just goofy comic and trying to get Phil plait understand that a goofy comic was not a goofy comic and I believe but the only thing that the SATs truly passed is how good you'll be the comedian's comedian that kind of verbal it was a wonderful thing to listen to it was wonderful the absolutely was 100% wrong skilled and so moral and so thoughtful and so humble you had everything going for you that I respect except you didn't happen to be right well we don't know what happened we assume that what we see is what happened we assumed it was a scientist tells was hat with what happened we assume that what nanza told us was what happened when you say I know this happened right you're not always correct exactly I know Kennedy got assassinated in Dallas I've seen the video I know he got assassinated down I don't know if Lee Harvey Oswald did it I don't know I assumed he was involved it seems like he was was there other people involved to I assume there were and what other reasons why I assumed they were the Magic Bullet the f****** the guy who got hit with a Ricochet under the overpass you want to know that I made the shop with a man chords that there's a lot of things is a lot of things there's there's a lot of things we could you know go over the Kennedy assassination is why I think I'm not wanted to be where are we going are we going to solve the polarization America or are we doing lately it's got this incredible technological achievement it's got these three guys that look incredibly nervous at the post Landing press conference and they do look all sketched out it's got these guys that don't do interviews afterwards it's got no one ever land on the moon again after 1973 or whatever it was it's got all these technological achievements but we never get outside of Earth's atmosphere again we're always inside of Earth's orbit there's so many beautiful things that conspiracy theorist can grasp hold of somebody it's b******* but it doesn't mean it but it doesn't mean it didn't happen is the Van Allen radiation belts there's that we never even sent a chicken in the deep space and had to come back alive there's all these things but it doesn't mean it didn't happen and that my problem was and this is you know when people say do you know you sold out your ashill now and like no no no I'm just being honest now where is before I wasn't being honest with myself and I wasn't being honest about the subject I do not know whether or not people went to the Moon that I knew that people didn't go to the moon and I was arguing it that way I was on a team I was on team it's b******* we didn't go to the moon and you really can't do that accurately it can't be done you do can say this is what's interesting this is what I find Curious this is what's weird the fact is not a single technological achievement from 1969 that's not cheap for easier and faster to reproduce to that accept going to the Moon one of the rare things in life that still doesn't mean it didn't happen like Occam's razor is a slippery thing because there's weird s*** that happens if you got to take that into account like this no absolutes is not one thing you can say well there is a rule in this room must be followed and here's that rule doesn't work that way the world is made of weird stuff I'm also the idea a playful space of conspiracy theories taking me a long time to understand my daughter is 14 and she talks about you know her father did a show called b******* and she talks about how she loves conspiracy theories and this is from Paul McCartney's dead to we did land on the moon to all those things but she

you were mentioned there too but there's also another guy who does it who will do this musically she I can't even better one. Playing around with the logic that almost feels like a map radical thing or pure philosophical thing or a or a angels dancing on the head of a pin thing and there's a quality that you have learned that my daughter has learned indirectly I think from you do other people doing this all of their is a playful space we discuss how we how we share our real that is happening in The Conspiracy Theory art form and the conspiracy theory art form is now seeming to me to be more like rap or rock and roll or were you playing around with this kind of thing and I am so literal-minded so verbal mind if you know Bob Dylan's easy for me the stones are hard-nosed app easy 20th century classical ZZ but just Funk is hard for me and it's the same kind of thing here it's really easy for me to say we are doing the old-fashioned scientific inquiry in this is the Ice House of viable but there is something happening in our thinking it's really interesting that I had to have my daughter explain to me and the New York Times after I already knew you and watched you do it well champion of science and reason write in conspiracy theories for the most part fly in the face of science and reason and if you don't want to be a buffoon and don't want to be a fool I don't mind being a fool and you know being self-deprecating of being a moron is part of being a Comics fun The Conspiracy Theory World went South from me when I did a television show. Joe Rogan questions everything six seven months doing the show and at the end of it I was like okay I get it this is a bunch of unfuckable white guys that that's what it really is that's what I decided to do the one thing you don't find what you're looking for bigfoot black people you're more likely to find Bigfoot and you are black guys looking for bigfoot it is a bunch of unfuckable white dudes out camping and listen to what it did you hear that what is that you know it's like it's nonsense like you're you're wrapped up in this idea that there's a mystery and there's a something nothing equality but human beings what we want to uncover secret to want to be the person that finds out the truth because then you're miserable shity f****** life now doesn't matter the f****** aliens are real man they're here and one of the best feelings we can get probably better than coming is that feeling of aha I understand I've got a revelation and we see this all the time detective shows Sherlock Holmes you know nothing to do with police work there is a feeling that wouldn't it be nice if in this hour are able to figure something out understand String Theory you're not going to do it in our you're not going to do whatever conspiracy theories are exercising the muscles of logic exercising the muscles of skepticism playing around with the with the Haiku of if-then if-then playing around with what we feel about the government and other people and stuff like that and you're playing around with all of that in kind of a semi safe and even watching you just do it here where you will you will you bang out that stuff is a this is the stuff I question which coming out of that politically and I thought that's what even talked about when we went to the moon or not which coming out of your style of inquiry on that kind of thing your style of skepticism is just fascinating and beautiful and I see the conspiracy thing as not so much a breaking down what would I use to see it as a breaking down of science and reason by seed is rather a a creation of a new form of poetry that weird I don't know Paul McCartney still alive so she's rebelling understand that right you're a parent you know what it's like you better just told me something really important he has to dirt down to realign your daughter coming in all golf doubt he'll say to her I invented this you can't do this this is not the way you can rebalance you can't rubella get to be like this you can't do nothing here and eyeshadow you can't do it water coming in old golf doubt he'll say to her I invented this you can't do this this is not the way you can rebelz you can't rubella get to be like this you can't do with black hair and eye shadow you can't do it and they express themselves you know they want to exert power over there world</div>

Play it but John can do everything and wonder what it does one thing he does better than anybody has ever ever fought utilize distance he utilizes distance better than anybody he's the very best at keeping you here and a lot of people accused him of poking people in the eyes there have been some incidents I don't think he's doing it on purpose I think and I agree with you he shouldn't do it if your clothes fit but what I'm saying is the way his style is he keeps you out here bangs keeps you out here bad so distant it to the Lego Polly kick leg kick pops with a jab hit you with a knee keeps you here keeps you here you are holy s*** this is the big one John's like this is a fight I all his fight another day another day you have to be so much better to beat them because you're shittin your pants going in your compromised and you're fighting a guy who's the peak he's in the zone Tyson was when ties with crushing people that's on Anderson was when Anderson was crushing people's driving and they get to this point where you're you have to be so much better to beat them because you're shittin your pants going in your compromised and you're fighting a guy who's the peak he's in the zone</div>

He just had nothing to lose he was like playing with house money but now he's a better pure boxing and Joshua bit Joshua I bet you finish his mother 10 in the first fight he heard him first and then threw caution to the wind and got cracked Jeff because he underestimated Andy's resolve in his ability to recover inside that you know going crazy and trying to stop them what if you just boxes in the outside and keeps trying to lick a screenshot 678 Rosemary way down on the card like I f*** go-for-broke I think it's. Coming in interesting prediction who knows cuz he's going to this fight knowing that he's able to beat the heavyweight champ of the world win the title and Rolls-Royce now okay with champ attitude I think he's got more love and more respect than he's ever had in his life I want to see everything everything I want to see all of it I think Andy lost weight was Andy way now I think he's down his speeds trouble man who his combinations he's so fluid so so don't forget about Josh with them and you remember camp probably the Best Buy in the history of division when he was a little thick I think he's lost himself I think things he's done is he's gone less strength and conditioning and more pure box he was so big he was talking about that he said essentially is word the way to describe it is listen to this interview with him some English gentleman and he was saying that you think about you a hundred percent of your energy boxing you're not going to achieve the same amount as if you put 100% the boxing something to that fat in the gym is doing like heavy bags met smart yeah it's because if you look at you know any kind of advantage over B speed combinations so you don't want to see this big heavy bulker also if your look at Future matchups Fury and Wilder there all night on the feet you do move better better cardio prison workout mindset for this fight against Cowboys recent training video there's a video of him hitting the the shield and he misses and catches his trainer on the Chan I'd be worried about him you know being like this is the life yeah that's possible but I don't think so I think I think he's a discipline guy I think you just as wild and I mean it just likes to adopt trick Joshua this time though the first time he tricked them Josh was probably looking like I'm going to f*** this boy in the Olympics watch this that's what I think's going to happen now for all right but I just I don't see it man</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> dude how about f****** Cowboy Connor it's a very good fight it's probably time overdue right now he's so calm and relaxed in there too but there were two the top on top of the Heap mango and a lot of people say that but they don't really mean agree he f****** means and he's backed off of that a hair so we still controlled wildness pistes abroad he does not like it I don't think he necessarily is making him be just a little bit more calculated Connor Cowboy capiz kind of left out all right if anybody gets injured he's right in there see what we're in this weird place we're pretending these fights are all going to happen we hope we hope and pray that you could be the cowboy and Connor actually make it to the dance but they might not make it to dance at 55 minutes to fight for Cowboys. Carter Connors a finished comes out the gate like a f****** Banshee and then my brother text me as many notes at welterweight would they do that tortured himself to get down 45 so hard and when you looked at what he look like when he was on the scale is flexing you look like a goddamn zombie skeleton terrible so I think you don't nobody where he complains or not about Nobody Rides For Free you do that to your body for a couple of years you doing some f****** damage and it makes it harder to lose the weight afterwards right then he's going up to 55 he's you know he's obviously deleted 55 Winds of title a 55 has the great rematch with Diaz at 70 right and then comes back and finds could be with 55 again and gets mauled you he has a fight with cowboy you going to is really a 55 that can fight well to it that's the right size for him versus I don't think Nate is Phi 55 and 8 time in the future now my only issue was at 70 and I always assumed his team decided to do that 70 is when I look at Conor McGregor's a welterweight is his power the same as it was at 45 and 55 is his timing the same as speed not just fighting a guy who I think in his eyes is not really a while to it you think 5555 170 but he's really a 55 or that's fair my only issue with that is and I'm a huge Conor McGregor fan I'll see cerrone's a friend of mine so I just want to have a great fight but when people were complaining about this fight with dinner at the cats whatever to me I think it's been our fight because I think if you're a Cowboy fan you know I always said Cowboys too much of a company man the UFC and Daniel cut weight dude fight this fight do this quick turnaround right Cowboy the Legends Cowboys born jumping I f****** ships and whatever the hell is driving f****** bulls and whatever the f*** is doing the week of the fight and kill himself to make weight and I just went does it ever work out for anybody who says he was a yes man to the UFC not really but now we seen it's worked out for cowboy because this is his you know I don't put too much into titles anymore like this is Cowboys title shot you got the biggest fight in the game you fight Conor McGregor you make your make millions of dollars this is a Golden Goose if you talk to tomorrow Eastman Kobe Comfort Inn Moss Woodall to be Tony maybe not those too but it's not anyone who do you want to fight and one says, cuz you know what the biggest fighting get in the game Cowboy got it by being he's he's he's paid his dues he's earned it is getting Milling $2000000 Win Lose or Draw it's a good fiber Cowboy I think they should make a red panties and I felt I'd be cool whoever Justified Connery get a red panties night belt just like fire sound like super hot actress to wear them for a day dude I would love that and they win those this is so sick of belt would like framed red panties in it be so dumb I think he's Connors calculated and I think there's a smart fight for him because he's not fighting someone who's too big right where I feel like you know that was the argument about Nate even donated of course 555 for a long time now you know when there's some other guys that want to fight them at 170 that a real 170s like Mazda does a perfect example that Mazda. Was 155 for a long time but he's not anymore if you look at his frame like you would go look back when he fought like Michael chiesa which was like 2013-14 14 somewhere around then right so Mazda doll back then was like a skinny guy he was really wasn't defined you know what was awesome kill himself make 55 frightened and you can't pack on any weight can't put any muscle when he went up to 170 we could see who it really is 155 welterweight the other thing is is now. Conor fight that 79s options him play and 70 you play a 55 brought in 70 and I know his team was doing his manager told me about them is they won't be the coma coma Main Event against Nick Diaz and they want the Conor fight</div>

I've seen what that man does the heavyweights in training Corey Anderson it's they forgot about your Highborn your f****** dancing into the cage f*** they don't give a f*** how good are you right now and do you have a solution to it Corey Anderson brings her table and he gets better with every fight in people forget if we getting is better we'll go but you got to watch the fight how about with TVs heavyweight now and now I'm not crazy Steve Bay miocic wants Tyson Fury superfight more than Daniel Cormier Trilogy what does I was thinking technical down 100% he ain't seen nothing like that guy know nothing like a bat out of hell throwing punches at each one of them has concussion written all over it each one of them on anybody and you're a 205 or I mean the best 205 of all time no doubt but if we start John get left hook like the way we talk Gillespie gets head kicked and just flatlined up since then shut out the greater blipsy I know and I I was thinking that was a really tough fight for Kevin Baltimore who trained the guy who you fight like the most go there no black people do that move your ass to class Montreal no black people do that</div>

What happened before I fought Rothwell end up knocking me out but before that two weeks with a week before my last biking session Shane Carwin knocked me literally cold also why is Shane Carwin trying to knock you out. I think back on it so hard that dude hit so hard he's a guy didn't get a day in the sun either you know he had that lost to Lesnar we came out he was so so you put up so much energy trying to stop Lesnar not hurting anymore both with a ruthless series of uppercuts memory held them with one arm as water right hand cool story lights out and then how about Gonzaga and Bigfoot Silva bare-knuckle that's how they're doing sir they found a bare-knuckle and Gonzaga cheese big silver up is hard to do that was the rudest thing ever because his if you'd like you remembered came on trt you was such a nightmare operation on his pituitary gland tumor that was stopped mean he was literally producing too much growth hormone that's that's why you become a giant like that so then he has his tumor removed and now it is not producing anything right to take stuff how about train with Bigfoot to get ready for big nog and I didn't know they're like best friends and I'm training with great next day I'm like what the f*** is Bigfoot a giant on top of this kind of fat Russian and just f*** you he was a building he was like a building planted on his chest like you're not shaking that off DC 300 lb it's Hedley that's why when you catch a guy to like where you catch him in his career in all in like what kind of testing we talking about the reality of MMA is all when you catch them and what kind of testing</div>

I got a football from a certain school and he went to the basics course in my gym Basics so don't start back Bass Wipeout no yes he was approval Brian went back to wipe out but when I roll with him I was like who the hell like it's not his fault what do you think it was maybe a Blue Bell Blue Bell the definition of blue belt go until your greasy is you can beat a bigger stronger opponent that untrained step you're almost black. You just need to keep training to get to purple is the most painful transition in my opinion and my opinion because most people stop at Blue Army brown belt was the scariest remember you give him a belt you can carry more than one like you said Jiu-Jitsu people walking from out of town to jump into your class so yeah I know Bluetooth killing your ground up it's embarrassing for him I think there's a there's also a situation where these people are realizing that hey if you have you know x hundred students and they're paying $150 a month you can get this amount of money and Mathematics and they realize they look I am only making x amount of money I can make triple that if I just lighten up on people that you have to sell digital gift to change you didn't you didn't learn it like this and you can tap you know if you get caught an armbar even though the guy's not yanking on it past the point where it's going to snap their they're showing some control they catch you in an armbar they know they happen you have to tap you just go again I mean you can get infinite lives if you had me for a long time special training versus grappling training is one of the things that really Gracie Jiu-Jitsu from the other martial arts is that you you can learn in a real situation so like if you were in a street fight with jiu-jitsu and you grab a hold of a guy it's so normal the guys going full blast you don't do that you don't need different very very very different cuz lot of people that have black belts in karate that we get f***** up in street fight by guy who's quick who can get hard who just knows how to just hit you a mean person that's been a lot of street fights and knows how to punch in the face for real karate instructors out there that have a real good karate student but the vast majority of them sold out people for real most digits using yet though Yeah Yeahs karate is not legit yeah it's not it's not susceptible as much because you have to roll or like Givenchy you couldn't have gone to prevent without rolling but they have their ways why they have their ways like if you have a good chicken like a kid who's liked they know he's going to compete the hold them back they have a guy was a lawyer and boost them up faster you know it has to be still a purity to the game you know they can't I hope they don't try to water at all cuz I think it's going to backfire in the end because it has like so many guys come from other schools to my gym and like I don't tell you what belt am like really what they're embarrassed to tell me what don't they are it was grimy when you did it you were getting fighting with a bunch of people that seen the UFC every like holyshit it was me it was like I realized that I was so vulnerable I had these ideas y know how to kickbox I've no Taekwondo I know how to handle myself and then I do Jiu Jitsu just getting mauled I mean just just meant by people my size just manhandling me I got killed my first day and I loved it though cuz you realize so much to learn and it would show me what they didn't I was like mine blow my mind blow it's interesting how vulnerable you really are like it when you when you first learn when you first few days of classes it's different than almost anything else cuz you feel like there's nothing you could do to get out of it you know what I mean like I felt like sparring when I Spar when kickbox bar with people they were better than me Mike at least I can move wish I could avoid this guy few rounds my fight defensively don't extend myself you know don't leave anything hanging out there just play tight to my chest to keep keeps fights parksmart I know this person better than me but I can get through this round against a black belt when I was white belt or a blue belt number like there's nothing there's not a thing I can do is 100% positive it's about her what he's practicing on me it's not a thing I can do is 100% positive he's going to tap me it's about her what he's practicing on me it's fun.

What I what I dislike the most was wine with dinner really I dislike the most social kind of lubrication past tense and I always left open the possibility of some of the more intense stuff wine with dinner is delicious it's one of the rare delicious drugs like I like whiskey but let's be honest it tastes like s*** it's weird you're drinking the subject but you know one of my many problems PPL more than one Ohio but I have no skill at moderation I'm 64 years old and I've never been able to do anything with moderation so I think if you told me we're going to do acid for the rest of our lives every single day you could make that argument the idea for me that's hard like I said but I said I was meditated I haven't missed a day maybe you should microdose it baby did you microdosing do it now and I want to think about it a little bit before I thought it would be pretty boss only in back Generations teetotalers so there is never alcohol in the house never I never saw my parents take a drink when it was on TV it was a totally different thing it just didn't happen I did anything ever preached about it they never said don't drink they never said don't do drugs you just never was in the house and not statistically has a huge effect on people and then the first people I fell madly in love with you know Lenny Bruce Jimi Hendrix had been in my mind killed by drugs and I kind of said boo people that have this kind of personality when they get into drugs they sometimes have trouble and I think that maybe being 19 years old and trying to get into show business then maybe being the sober one allowed the Dumber guy to do a little better you know and everybody else kind of get out of my way as ever f***** up some of the time I could get other stuff done and then that starts reinforcing let me know longer buy drugs and I kind of said boo people that have this kind of personality when they get into drugs they sometimes have trouble and I think that maybe being 19 years old and trying to get into show business then maybe being the sober one allowed the Dumber guy to do a little better you know is everybody else kind of get out of my way as ever f***** up some of the time I could get other stuff done and the next Sharks reinforcing</div>

Sitting puts up the s*** I didn't get your camera that your hero camera that's over your shoulder that shooting Trump so you can't lean into the camera and they want a little piece used to can't leave out of the camera so that you've got about two hours where you sit up straight and you can't move side-to-side if you can't put your hand to the table and you listen to someone speak for 2 hours they're going to try to edit out to get 3 min where he sounds okay okay what does he have to say for 2 hours. He would talk I mean things obviously have changed but he would talk about I was reading this blog on the internet that said I didn't sell my property for enough and I bought it for $3 and I sold it for 4 million isn't that a profit isn't that a profit what do you think is not a prophet that would be a million-dollar Doolittle okay who was this is somebody on the internet okay you be arguing in front of us with perhaps a 18 year old guy on the internet and thought that Donald Trump should have made more from a real estate deal and this is something he really concentrate on and he seems to still to this day I thought he was wonderful is job you know if you had someone was actually a business person on that show would be the worst show in the world because Bill Gates would make proper decisions that would be no surprise if you want someone capricious and crazy with no filter that's what you want right and that's what we got so he's makes arbitrary decisions that you try another human brain tries desperately to make those make sense payments and Swine actually actually a Donald Trump junior said to me you have all the people we've had a Michelle you seem like the only person who's ever like my father did you actually seem to like that but I said you don't I have a Fascination and a respect and a affection for people who are able to get out of their filters and I said some people do that with pure genius play Bob Dylan some people do with bravery like Lenny Bruce some people do it with drugs you know Neil Young perhaps Jimi Hendrix perhaps and most people do with a mixture of stuff but I said the loneliest monk said the genius is the one who is most like himself and I said with some sort of mental problems coupled with and a lack of compassion your father is somehow found a way to throw off the filters and I will listen to Tiny Tim talk on tape for hours because I like that little bit of Asperger's and all that other stuff I'm not assuming I'm not qualified. is that much but when I do and I listen to Lenny Bruce talk forever and Donald Trump had the dark side of that it was almost like when I was hitchhiking around the country and you're homeless and s*** and you'd end up in a biker place and you know some Clubhouse and some guys just holding port and ranting I've always been interested in the people who are out on the margins you know and what what Donald took as affection like I guess was a bit of affection but it's also that if you have thrown off some filters I'll listen to your talk and so that was that was very very strange and then I really did spend a lot of time kind of sticking up for Donald Trump saying that is interesting stuff there and yeah he's he's crazy and he's venal and he's empty stop that you've never seen before you have never seen someone who has never laughed sincerely and never made a joke never laugh sincerely Twitter did you see the thing you did on Twitter the other day we put a picture of Trump Tower in Greenland they said I promise not to do this I mean I left that was funny Trump Tower in the middle of Greenland I never shot with people very much on</div>

The Ben askren standard assault because you so brutally k out need to go maybe because that same dude Vitor Belfort cut a giant hole above his head he was a super jacked really powerful black dude God damn it I can't remember his name pull up Travis Luder not Eastman Marvin Eastman for Travis Lutheran Travis Schlueter caught Marvin Eastman with a punch at the very end of the punch it was one of the weird and knock out so you'll ever see go back right here right after that watch this home very end of the punch and the punch strange but Marvin Eastman have been kayode the word was got killed twice in Camp with Tito LOL word I don't know if that's true if it's wrong forgive me but it is not the Travis couldn't punch he certainly could but that one didn't make sense now not like that and you just went out so sometimes guys have been ko'd recently you know how it is they just doesn't work anymore he certainly could but you know how it is it just doesn't work anymore maybe I maybe thought they couldn't take a shot</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> if you were to to me is the heavyweight fight that's the heavyweight fight not really interested in this by Joshua Joshua Joshua was like I used to be Josh number one The Golden Child and heating ocelots we fell off but while. Just been doing their thing well this is the fight that I want to see more than anything is Wilder Fury 2 that's the number one tip because the first one was so controversial argument that Tyson Fury got robbed Ohana Brissette the old the only argument for a job there wild or is you know he did not come down fight fight fight you know it's in the streets and two guys were going at it like that and one guy drop it on blast them and then dropped him in the end and is laying on his back and he got up and did they know it's the end of the round they decided it was the end of the fight you would say man I think he won he f***** I do. But as far as boxing rules go Deontay Wilder I like to draw did the most damage in the fight so I was like what is a drama that he gets dropped in the final round right loses one point for sure right it's definitely now a 10-8 round for Tyson for Deontay Wilder after that knocked down with a bad knocked out 9/8 what is that then if it's a 10 point must system how does it work does it mean that would it go back to even can you have a 77 round ball drop each other twice I don't think so I don't think so no right what happened to her twice I don't think something so no right what happened to her</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> play the record you broke you ran 24 in less than a hundred miles and it's a 24 hour time. But you did in 11 hours and 41 minutes yeah so it was yeah let me explain a little bit there so it was the event itself was called six days in the dome and really what it was was you could do anything from a 24-hour vent to a 48 or vent to a Six-Day event just see how far you can run within that time frame vines that event but yeah so I've been it's interesting because there's not a lot of time to events that are necessarily structured 400-mile or for like 12 hours Salat times you find yourself jumping into some of these other events that are longer in duration and just kind of using them as a way to try to run fast hundred-mile-an-hour or a fast 12-hour so the race director for for that particular event had reached out to me cuz he he he's known me for a while and knew that I was charging fast times and just said he got to school event set up at the Olympic Training Facility in Milwaukee Wisconsin at the Pettit Center and I think it would be pretty conducive for fast for Fast Times and and asked if I wanted to do it so I actually didn't have an ideal timeline to that I would have normally wanted to work with in terms of getting ready for it but the training went really well and I went there targeting the Hundred Mile world record which was 11 hours 28 minutes and 3 seconds that ended up running 11 hours 19 minutes and 13 seconds for a hundred miles and then since we have like a hundred mile distance and also this 12-hour time to event kind of structure you can find yourself if you're under 12 hours kind of double dipping and getting two events for the price of one I guess you could say so I kept running after I hit a hundred miles and ended up going a hundred four point eight miles total in the 12 hour time frame so that was another record minutes and 48 seconds for a pace for a hundred miles is f****** bunkers that is so fast that's so crazy that's such a fast-paced man yeah you know it's funny like when you look at it cuz I think sometimes people look at like a hundred miles and 11 hours and 19 minutes and there's not a lot of contacts in their mine unless they're kind of familiar with ultra-marathon running start to break it down until like the subcategories where it's like well that's like for the next 3 hours Bonds in a row or I can't remember how many or what the 5K time is there's a 63015 Cays at some sometime for sub 3 hour marathon in a row but I wouldn't classify myself as a carnivore or you want to claim you and we discussed this last time you were here where you can you take in a lot of glucose and you you wrap up your carbohydrates considerably before a race bike what is what is your what is a daily diet say in training that you're preparing for something like that's what's a daily diet for you like yeah yeah so yeah let's jump into that I think there is some new ones within that even because when you think of my lifestyle the way I like described it as if you took a calendar year and you grab a single day out of there and you grab the day where I was like a peek Training Day the recovery day those are like so drastically different in terms of my energy my energy demands so like things tend to fluctuate quite a bit and changed quite a bit and I think that's often times what confuses people cuz they wanted it they look at what I'm doing say on race day are they look what I'm doing on one of my Big Workout days or my rest day and think that's what I'm doing across the board so you when you get the folks hangover Zach follows a carnivore diet they're probably looking at like a post-race recovery day where then I might be eating almost all just to animal products lot of eggs a lot of salmon you know red needs that sort of stuff but if you pick a day out where I'm doing like a big training day doing like a 30 mile run or something like that that's where I'm going to bring back some the carbohydrates try to stop limit that activity and the best way to maybe describe it is you know there's like this this kind of train low-rate I or this car. Ization concept that's getting more momentum behind it in a more studies and science behind it to there's some interesting up folks that are looking into this anymore. if it's a really interested in doing a deep dive in it there's a guy named dr. Mark Bob's you go to book called Peak any kind of dives into kind of like some of the nutrition science where it's been and kind of where it's it's kind of heading and and highlight some of that in one of the big things they say they're starting to recognize that even with the elite athletes when you're pure dies in your training like I do your nutrition tributing. Eyes as well as pretty clear that like if you're doing a work and you taking glucose or fructose I think most sign says a two-to-one ratio is ideal for maximizing the money you can take in that any you're going to give yourself an advantage that's like Rocket Fuel so then it becomes a question of like do you need that 100% of the time or do you even want to do it a hundred percent of time cuz when we look at his ass was that the real limiter is your got so like on paper to absorption yeah yeah there's a finite amount you can absorb and you increase the amount you can up you can absorb on average if you have that 2 to 1 ratio vs all of one or the other so two glucose to one sucrose for glucose vs. sucrose is that more like a refined sugar yeah yeah yeah I think like the way I like the most most likes Sports supplements and things like that are going to be designed to kind of meet those those specific because they're looking at the literature and they're seeing like okay this is how you got but yeah so like really went to the question that I think needs to be asked with a lot of the stuff is like if I want to make workout feel as easy as possible if I'm trying if I can get in like say 60 grams of carbohydrate per hour it's probably going to do that like my Pace my perceived effort at that pace is probably and fill easier but then you have to ask a question like how often do you needed to feel that easy so for me the answer to that is like well if I'm usually really strenuous or something that's in a little bit of a gray area where it's just fast enough to dip into glycogen stores but just blowing up that I can do it for quite a while and maybe in a couple hours then you're kind of in this area where that could be an advantage for you from forming standpoint but I'm going out for an easy run of like 60 to 90 minutes and it's going to be like a 223 out of 10 perceived effort anyway like there's no real need for me to be hitting glucose during that or you know sports drink during that to make that feel even easier yet cuz my goal isn't necessarily so you know make an easy run till even easier I guess it's the way. easy nothing just Astros to few dozen miles and I think that that also brings up a really good point to wear like a lot of this stuff when we're looking at carbohydrate usage and performances were looking at Elite athletes were looking at folks that are training for like you know the Olympics you know sometimes or even Olympic medalist and that's just not a very good comparison I think to the average person is out there running you know they're they're getting their purposes are different know their jackets are different for the lights are very different like one is basically everything around us to stick to a specific date and distance and trying to run as fast as I can on that date another person maybe trying to run as fast as they can fit so many other factors in life like the other work their relationships there you know the level of training or a cable to have with the time they have and then also like you imagine your own health and nutrition because like you know at least athletes don't have a very Rosy picture in terms of long-term health either so for someone who's like you know maybe 10-20 lbs overweight he's trying to run to get into shape for trying to get into shape or something like that that they're probably thinking just much about health is they are both performance so for them to be you know shuttling in 60 grams of carbohydrate every hour during training and racing is is probably not the direction to they want to go now when you get ready to do something like this Hundred Mile Run how many miles do you run in a typical day and do ramp that up or do you just give yourself a base and know that you can push through a kind of how do you handle that yeah so I will build up my training the way I describe it is like I'm always focusing on specificity kind of being King so depending on the race distance and the intensity is kind of how I'm going to structure my workouts so the rule of thumb that I use is the closer I get to the workout the more specific to work outside you are going to be towards that race distance and intensity so for me what that oftentimes mean since I'm training like hundred mile distance races is early in a black I might be doing some like shorter interval work like vo2max like an example that would maybe like a 3-minute I'm almost all out after it followed by like a 3-minute recovery Jog and then another 3-minute interval like that some of those real short interval sessions and how many of those would you do in a row how many Sprints vs. recovery yeah I'll start like pretty easy by 3 on that and what my goal really is to every week is that kind of build volume within that so that first week it might be just three of them but buy likes 88th week I might do a total of like 24 to 27 minutes with a volume within that vehicle contact so it's it's a really interesting cuz like you know I could go out on any one day and do like maybe 10 of those but if I do that and then it takes me like a week and a half to recover from that session it's not nearly as probably a fact of it if I spread that out a little bit and said to divide 5 by 3 and 5 by 3 3 days after they give your body a chance to recover and build versus just destroying it on one and then feeling like s*** for a couple weeks exactly I like to I like to call it Mike Rowe stressing when I'm working with folks and my own training and like we want a micros if you want to stress you just enough to elicit a response and she get stronger and we want to do that over and over and over again that you where are you are you know who Pablo. Shalini is yeah yeah instead of doing all these sets to failure you would just do like half of what you're capable of and then do it again in in more frequent Pace like a do it again get on Wednesday due to get on Friday and then give yourself a lot of time in between each individual activity to particularly training for strength he actually recommend as much as 10 minutes of recovery in between sets which is kind of crap me most of the time for that you know six sacks is an hour and it seems like just laying around the gym people if you were getting people to mock you but that's his protocol I think if you can build that volume in a in a micro stressing or in like a sustainable way that's what's going to keep you or get you strong and it's also going to make it less likely to get injured how much time do you need if you got up to that insane Pace that you did when you run a hundred miles when if you took like a week off for 2 weeks how much would you lose not much in that amount of time especially at that intensity so the thing is is like 48 mile Pace we need to be kind of relative about it so like for me but when I'm out training when I'm not when I'm not when I'm fully recovered that's like a pretty reasonable Pace from an intensity standpoint so the interesting thing about Ultra marathoning is race pace is sometimes faster than even some of your easiest runs in training so your training is kind of all what we call it over speed training where are the most endurance events from like the 1500 up to like the marathon the majority of your going to be Subway space and then you're going to have like depending on the program you don't maybe twenty 30% of that be like over speed training or is it well just because the relative duration of the event is so long like you know I can't run faster if I run too fast and it just going to end badly for me but why is that with Marathon so is like the amount of stress you put on your body so if I GO train to Pekin say a marathon my my Max potential pays for that wouldn't be sustainable to do every run so I'd be running I be running too hard too fast too often and then we getting it at that kind of situation overtime before where you're starting a macro stress vs. micro stress so if you run a marathon what is your standard marathon pace a little goofy where I competed in high school and college and then I did some marathons but not really in a structured Manner and then I got an ultra-marathon running slow we done what I would consider a real legitimate marathon training program so you're basically saying marathons for pussies right is everything just said it I actually think the marathon the hardest event of them all but it's just long enough you make a mistake you going to pay for that for quite some time so you're on such a Razor's Edge and you're also just one tiny mistake away from things going really and what you're saying about mistake you talking about pacing like to go out to hard yeah I see your watch what is it what kind of watch you wearing it's a Quarles Apex I'm never heard of that one before GPS watch one of those kind of big players historically Vincent Owen Garmin and corals kind of came to Market a few years ago they wanted to try to make like take that high in technology but make it maybe later affordable and also make it user-friendly cuz now everyone's they care more about the post workout or the post run data that you're uploading to these platforms like Strava so like corals kind of made it a big point to make it real user-friendly on that and so you like I get done with the run a tight load up the app and it's up on Strava like within a few seconds sometimes and then go dissect all the data like how much elevation gain and loss your pace per mile I am you can use it for running or cycling or hiking or mountaineering or anything like that it's got like all those kind of bells and whistles on it so so if you're my question was like it so if you're running how about you are you're checking your watch if you're doing a marathon you making sure that you're not going crazy cuz it's it is it otherwise you just have to kind of gauge it just based on the pack and based on how you feel yeah and I think that's actually a good Ultra marathoning I think the metric that people should dial in the most is the rate of perceived exertion is that something that's not going to necessarily lie to you like if you based your thing yourself up heart rate exclusively or a pace exclusively you can find yourself like justifying something that's not necessarily where you need to be and it's something like that malfunctions in that was your like only compass then you're in trouble so I like when I'm doing my training and I'm working with other folks I like to use heart rate and I like to use pacing and stuff like that but ultimately I'm trying to get the person to really understand like how hard is this effort and across-the-board from like very easy to very difficult and then when we comes time to race we can kind of dialing like this is the intensity or trying to look for so that they can kind of feel that out to use a metric you say like how do you feel 7 to 10 yeah pretty much have a scale of 1 to 10. I'll use a lot of times in the whole variety like most people are going to be using some sort of like probably like zone system of training where there's like there's numbers that are associated with heart rate ranges or intensities and it'll be descriptors and you'll just one through neither some that are kind of 1 through 5 and 1 through 10 and is it weird to write because it's okay it's subjective mean the whoop whoop strap is something I wear and that uses something like that like what what's your perceived exertion am I overlooking the bar right I don't know what does that mean like it's so hard to gauge your perceived exertion especially when the workouts over yeah it was hard what that means it is very subjective I think it's one of those things where it falls into the same category that a lot of endurance events are where he's got to be patient and really work on kind of understanding that from experience to like you you find out like oh I went and did this workout and I thought that was the right pace inattentive turned out to be a little too fast I'm sorry but do do keeping a diary like today felt like this and this was an issue when I felt like I didn't have enough fluids or do do anything like that not so much anymore I did it a lot when I was in college and I did a lot when I first started when I was really trying to learn my body and going to learn what things mean and and and how I respond to them but now I've been kind of doing it long enough where I have enough of a of a understanding of kind of how like when things go wrong like why they did or something went really well like why it did that I don't feel like I need to take as detailed notes but I think it's really valuable for someone who's special while they're trying to learn rate of perceived exertion can really dial those things in it's probably worth a lot of worth a lot worth your time to write that stuff down so that they can look back at it and they have that resource available to them as their kind of reflecting on things to really truly prepared for that is based on what how you're at right now and what your Baseline is like what kind of preparation you've done before you knew that this race was available to you like how do you do that back to where we were before cuz they're going to talk about the VO2 max workout early in my training plan because Dad intensity is very unspecific to a hundred-mile you paste you know that you'll be able to max workouts are much closer to something shorter like a 5k so what are you trying to do with those VO2 workouts you just trying to elevate your your base yeah like just like the look of the different systems of training and that's kind of a higher intensity system so it's not very relevant to the race Pace that I'm doing specifically but it's not your relevant to My overall like aerobic efficiency so like by doing some of those bastards stuff things you can work on things like your form and just because when you're running that fast like things tend to be a little more dialed in and it just expand basically what you do is you give yourself kind of a bigger range of what your potential is going to be when you start focusing more in on like the aerobic side of things that we're going to see like as I would move further down in the training plan so once I kind of do that section of training to answer your question. Ideally I'll have maybe about since I'm coming into most programs not completely out of shape like four months is kind of a sweet spot for me that were to see you liked as I would move further down in the training plan so once I kind of do that section of training to answer your question. Ideally I'll have maybe about since I'm coming into most programs not completely out of shape like four months is kind of a sweet spot for me</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> definitely go down a bunch of different rabbit holes like you did we got a lot of some of the protein researchers come on and talk about some of that stuff like doctors to fill up sore breasts to fill up so fast down Layman Professor San Antonio what is the quality versus early I just may be the best way to look at it like the bioavailability of different protein sources and things like that and there's it seems like something that we would have figured out already but they're so I guess some Nuance with that even and now we're that they're saying that there's probably reason to believe that our our recommendation should be higher than what happened historically especially for athletes in elderly folks and you mean the RDA Z's right yeah something like that and I think I think they may be learning more to about just kind of what role pro team plays in bone helped to as opposed to just people think of protein is just as building block for muscle but there's a lot that goes into it with with bone bone out as well so those guys that were really interesting to hear hear about it we did a lot of stuff with the ranchers and some of the like the Savory salads in folks come on the show and talked about kind of that practice forces going to your standard agricultural production methods and things like that and Joel salatin what it what is Savory when you mean I would like Allan Savory Ted Allan Savory Joel salatin Will Harris from White Oak pastures on Bobby Gale he's part of the Savory Institute, share with us like kind of where that stuff is accident has a lot of guesswork and unanswerable questions at this point with with that some of that stuff cuz we're projecting like no way down the road with some of this with those guys to just like kind of what it's doing to the soil Health in the soil quality so one thing I've learned that was interesting was that I mean we kind of start to like throw a lot of these different like quote-unquote regenerative type practices into one bucket or one category when in reality there's a lot of different variants within them so someone can say like all regenerative agriculture is going to save the planet and then someone would dig up a bunch of studies that show like will know exactly doesn't do any and then like yeah, I'm confused is all in on this regenerative agricultural think but it is there a is there a real evidence that you can have a zero carbon gain yeah I mean it's the net positive the idea is that if you use regenerative agriculture meaning the animals graze their you're not talkin mono crop environments that these cows graze on Open Fields and then they shed all over the place and then you know that that s*** becomes manure and that this actually helps the plant life grow and all the stuff sort of it all becomes a part of a cycle that this regenerative practice is actually instead of raising the carbon footprint and actually makes a carbon-neutral footprint yeah yeah and I think we're sometimes it gets confusing as if you go and you just look at studies honor generator culture you get a lot of mixed information so what I was told and I'm still kind of going down this rabbit hole. In the way I like to look at all these type of things as I try to like look at one side of the story and then look the other side and see where the counters are tooth and it's going to go back and forth until you hit a dead end and then you know if you hit a dead end like that's where you're at for now until you've something else gets introduced in where I got to now is that when you're looking for these studies on kind of what practice is going to be good in terms of soil regeneration you have to look up adaptive multi Paddock grazing because if you look up like holistic or regenerative agriculture you're going to get a whole mess of the different ranges are different types of it and your summer effective some aren't so it's really hard to kind of peace out you know who's got the accurate stuff in that and I think ultimately some of the stuff is a weeds don't know yet rotational grazing from what I understand but you're kind of moving the the herd along to the different products and then they're like you know they're doing their thing in a what would you consider like a natural way likely would have been before we came in and shot all the Buffalo and all that stuff and then they're rotating it so the way I've been treated like the more of those products you can get the better because then you're letting the the soil in the and everything in there like really killed and in developed a deep root system as well some of that microbiome like all the insects and things that would be in there and all that stuff so you need massive amounts of land and massive amounts of areas for them to graze I think I think you would need I think the more the better is probably the way to look at it but hopefully that the soil biology but the thought of part that I thought was really interesting as with the world Harris White Oak pastures thing they just I think this study is maybe over utilize bye-bye like the the pro regenerative a multi-product group to degree cuz it's like it's what they have to answer this is the way we we found a way we can eat meat and I feel bad yeah and it's the thing that's compelling about that to me is the way it kind of happened was essentially what happened was Will Harris and why do patchers they were there raising raising animals for epic bar like that that was one of their buyers and epic bar got acquired by he was General Mills and so General Mills looked at What epic bar with claiming when they were the independent and they were saying like our our stuff is Regina Tavares you know you eat you buy our product and you're getting back versus taking kind of mindset and I think Mills was skeptical about that so they spent if it was a $80,000 to go in and have a study done on on will Harris's White Oaks pasture to really see if they could back that clam up and they went into the did the studying it actually showed like a gnat carbon sequestration versus like they weren't even neutral they actually pulled in more than they put out who this is from Epix environment or area so I think where people run into maybe a potential problem is can we extrapolate that for two other areas are we going to get that same results or is it going to be different right that's what's important is important to look at that honestly cuz even though you do have this one area where is that because of the environment where this farmer taking places because of the particular sort of soil quality like what are the factors that allow them to have so it's it actually takes carbon out of the atmosphere at a certain percentage so instead of adding carbon it actually remove some yeah cuz I guess the way it was described to me as at the inputs of that type of system are so low that like you're not it look as if you look at a normal like agricultural setup you know you have all these inputs of like manure and all these other things are going to add to that then that not a factor that that that negative effect of animal agriculture so when you reduce the inputs down to next to nothing because your inputs are all kind of just Manpower where you're moving these things around letting the natural course of things happen all the time that's where you can maybe minimize some of these like I guess what you needed to look at tertiary damage of animal agriculture but yeah I think I think we have a lot to learn and stuff with that stuff too but it it's about it's like spending a lot of time looking at that stuff because if they're right about the number of harvest we have I think that's maybe by 60 Harvest slapped me clearly regardless of whether you're vegan carnivore or somewhere in between we need quality soil right we're in some people think that there's a real promising that because you're not you're not using soil at all you're not using your not devastating they already deployed ground soil you also don't need to do all the the harmful things that are involved in monocrop agriculture right like that the devastation on the wildlife displacement of wildlife pesticides combines their indiscriminate believe indiscriminately chewing up small rodents and bugs and rabbits and anything else that gets caught in their blades yeah yeah you know that be interesting I don't know a whole lot about it other than what it is I mean I'm all for Solutions somebody sent me a link to something that is some indication that there might be some promise and hydroponic agriculture but the suit but the thing about this whole idea what was the name of the farm where this was done where the white oak wide are cashiers is that sustainable like nationally don't forget about global ability even naturally in terms of like to the needs that people have for for beef me we use so much beef in this country yeah I don't know for sure like what the scalability that would be my guess is like at this point it would be cuz it's pretty small like even from a percentage standpoint of what is being how much of that type of process is being used it's like a single percentage or something like that so historically and so it's not Reinventing the wheel as much as it is just saying okay what we did here obviously is not sustainable or potentially not sustainable so let's look at what it what do we do to get back to where we were before I guess maybe the way they look at that butt</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> bodybuilder own idea of what to do what not to do but I I learned this from a guy named Chad Ward his label on Instagram is Whiskey Bent BBQ world champion Pitmaster this f****** guy can cook his ass off and hunting camps and his food is insane he's so good and that's his philosophy is the reverse sear method is where I learned it from a learned from him get the secret on the outside and then to try to finish it off and you can do that that way but it's not as good it's better to bring it up to temperature slowly inside like a pellet grill another good method is Susie ever suvee things I I haven't yet I've had it from restaurants before they make their all their stuff more uniforms when you get exactly what you did the last time I comes out well. I've had that happen right but the suvee method is fantastic to because say if you have a steak and you want that steak to be 135 degrees you basically put the the the setting at 135 degrees you put in there for 4 hours so when you get it it's just all the tendons and ligaments and all that stuff is broken down all the fast is broken down and it just so tender but it feels weird cuz you're boiling it in a f****** plastic seems so wrong seems like you're not I mean I know it's a different kind of plastic but you're not even supposed to drink water if your plastic bottles been sitting in a hot car so I kind of apparently you can that's not an issue at all you know what to cook in it but it makes me feel weird eventually will here in 5 years that that's going to give us cancer let's go down the suvee rabbit hole why is it okay to suvi your food and then why doesn't it leaked what is it bcp's is that what they're worried about bca's which is supposed to be what you got some NASA scientist I don't think we're dealing with that but it just sits it feels weird but it for as far as flavors of phenomenal way to cook and it particular Wild game it's really good for because again you don't overcook it like if you want to cook an elk steak 230° and then blow torch the outside that's what a lot of people do you know that that's how you finish on a suvee basically he's a f****** blowtorch so I have this musk flamethrower in the back I would literally could use that cuz it's basically the same thing it's just a f****** torch and you towards the outside of its getting nice you know caramelized crust and then the inside you know it's perfect for Tucker yeah it's AJ me you don't like it cooking it every day off like when the director of the code was in here I was f****** have a hard time saying his last so hilarious soy Luisa voice was in here he was explaining how he was eating a lot of fish before he became a vegan he he was eating a ton of fish and his mercury levels it really shot up because a lot of fishes like a lot of f****** Mercury and if you eat fish for morning-noon-and-night everyday day after day after day you can develop how to fish before he became a vegan he he was eating a ton of fish and his mercury levels it really shot up because a lot of fishes like a lot of f****** Mercury and if you eat fish for morning-noon-and-night everyday day after day after day you can develop High Mercury mercury levels</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> doesn't make any sense I was reading something where people are going after Tulsi gabbard for being on Tucker Carlson she's like I'll talk to everybody and I'm glad she doesn't it by the way it's like it's hard for her cuz she's kind of an outside candidate it's hard for her to get time on his other networks and so they want to punish her for being on Tucker Carlson's and then they have this you know reductionist of you who he is he's a white supremacist like they always she supports white supremacist she goes on a white supremacist is that what is ratherly what is a lot more than that there's a lot going on there so you guys are f****** with life you know you're f****** with the reality of life and you're saying it in these sentences your printing out in these paragraphs as fact and you sending it out there irresponsibly it's just really strange that people don't understand the repercussions of that when we talked about on our podcast like you you don't invite somebody like Tulsi gabbard on to CNN MSNBC or they're kind of excluded from the same platform other platforms and then you sit on that platform so you're illegitimate I'm at that kind of propaganda saying is is pretty constant in the use of the term terms like what white supremacists with Tucker Carlson minarik there a million terms now that used to just kind of throw at people and what they're trying to do is create the sex Factor around people right like someone get the label associated with them then nobody wants to be associated with that person and they quickly kind of dye out of the public scene and I think that's really bad too no it's it's like a it's it's just an anti-intellectual way of dealing with things and then I think it's so it's not good it's weird that so prevalent that's weird that there's so few proponents of a more you know but open-minded way of thinking right yeah and just to take the odd you know she's a presidential candidate you may want to talk to me when you hear what she has to say but they immediately go to the maximalist interpretation of everything and then what they're basically saying when they ask you those questions are do you want to wear that label to run cuz she's got it already so if you have run again. You're going to have that label and people they see that you know and and so you know people who have who don't have a big following and who are who are worried about their careers and it money and advertisers and stuff like that babe they think twice about you know interviewing that person the next time ya another way to get a speech exactly in again I don't know how you get out of it you know and I mean I've experienced some blowback I guess but it doesn't hasn't worked yet right you know I mean it's not real it's just like it just words like okay but your I think your audience is rewarding you for for not not fouling to it you know and I think that more people if they took that example and said I'm not going to listen to what the the pack says about this and not going to be afraid of being called a name you no f*** that I'm going to talk to you when I want to talk to and I'm going to you know explore whatever ideas I want to explore then do this kind of stuff wouldn't be as effective so yeah do the people in so easy for them 2D platformer people that always and Shadow Banning and all those other weird sure that's going on channeling people and pushing people into these areas of their platforms that makes them less accessible and I know where it comes from and you know I was young and politically active once you know you want to change the world you want to make it a better place so you're in college and you don't have any power you don't have any way to make something into legislation you know what I mean so what are you do you know social media gives you the illusion that you're having an impact on the World by you know maybe getting somebody deplatformed or taken off Twitter or something like that it feels like it's political action to be an but it's not you know what I mean it's it's it's something that they that is open to people to do but it's not the same as you know getting 60 convert in 660 send it to to raise taxes on a corporation has been invading them for 20 years you know what I mean like that that's real action this you know getting some random person taken off the Internet is just not change you know but what people feel like it is and and they wanted they want to do the right thing so I get it but if not he no real political action I don't think I get it but it's not enough full real political action I don't think know it's f****** gross so little logic</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how much is Media shifting now like you've obviously been a journalist for a long time ago how much are things changing in the light of the internet while lot in this is my me I have a new book out now that's really about this right there what why the business has changed what's it called a tank out now and it's it's really about how the press the business model of the press has changed a lot news agencies are always trying to push narratives on people trying to get people wound up and upset and that is a conscious business strategy that we didn't have maybe 30 years ago and you think about Walter Cronkite or what the news was like back in the day you had the whole family sitting around the table and everybody watching Survivor unifying experience to watch the news now you have news for the crazy right-wing uncle and then you have news for the kid in the shade t-shirt and they're different channels and they're trying to win these people up you don't get them upset constantly and stay there and a lot of it has to do with the internet because before the internet news companies had like a basically free way of making money they dominated distribution the newspaper was the only thing in town that had a few wanted to get a want-ad it had to be through the local newspaper now at the internet internet is the distribution system anybody has access to it not just the local news and so they're easy money is gone we have to chase clicks more than we ever had had two before we have to chase eyeballs more than we have to so we had to build new money-making strategies and and a lot of it has to do with just her monetizing anger and Division and all these things and we just didn't do that before and it's it had a profound difference on the on the media as a writer of you personally experienced this sort of the influence where people have tried to lean unidirectional clickbait perhaps maybe alter titles that make him a little bit disingenuous in order to get people excited about the story you know what my editors at Rolling Stone are pretty good in it and they gave me a lot of Wheatley way too kind of Explorer whatever I want to explore but I definitely feel a lot of pressure that I didn't feel before in the business because especially in the Trump era and and you know I've written a lot about the Russian story right but do you know that's an example of one side's media does has one take on it and another media has another take on it and if you are just a journalist and you and you want to just report the facts you feel a lot of pressure to fit the facts into a narrative that your audience is going to like and I had a lot of problem with the Russia story cuz I thought you know I don't like Donald Trump but I'm like I don't think this guy's James Bond consorting with Russian spies I think he's corrupt in other ways and there was a lot of blowback on my side of the business because you know people inside April Point liberal media you just haven't there's a lot of pressure to have everybody fit into a certain narrative and I think that's really unhealthy for the business very unhealthy right as soon as soon as people can be manipulated to conforming to that narrative then all sorts of stories can be shifted oh yeah yeah absolutely and you the job used to be about challenging your audience every now and then right like you think a certain thing is true with our job to give you the bad news and say that you're wrong about that that used to be with the job was to be a journalist now it's the opposite now we have an audience we're going to tell you exactly what you want to hear and what you were going to reinforce what you think and that's very unhealthy a great example of this was in the summer 2016 I was covering the campaign I started to hear reporters talking about how they didn't want to report poll numbers that showed the race was closed they thought that was going to hurt Hillary right leg was in other words we had information that the race was close and we're not telling this to audiences because they wanted to hear that was going to be a blowout for Hillary right and that didn't help Hillary it didn't help the Democrats not warn people about this right but it was just because if you turned on MSNBC or CNN and you heard the Trump was within 5 Points or whatever it was that was going to be a bummer for that audience so we stayed away from it and you know this is the kind of thing that it's it's not politically Bennett if anybody it's just we're just trying to keep people glued to the set by telling them what they want to hear and that's not the news that's not that's not our job you know it drives me crazy crazy that what you said about journalism being used to be something that you're challenging your reader you're you're giving them this reality that may be uncomfortable but it's it's educational expense of you the world where where do they get that now they don't that's the whole problem you get you can predict exactly what the each news organization what their take is going to be on any issue by going just need to take an example when when the business about the Isis leader al-baghdadi being killed hit the news instantaneously you knew that the New York Times CNN and the Washington Post that they were going to write a whole bunch of stories about Trump was overplaying the significance of it that he you know that he was telling lies about it it would you knew they were going to make the entire thing about Trump and then Nemo Fox had a completely different spin on it but how it was but but new Sciences didn't have anywhere to go to just simply here who was this person why was he important what were the rest of the people in the region think you know what kind of what it's going to mean going forward is it actually going to have any impact you know is are we going to have to continually you know is there going to be a new person like this every every time I do we actually accomplish anything you don't get that anywhere all you get is Trump is a s******* on one side and then Trump is a hero on the other side I think that's not the news you know and but the thing is it's like the business aspect of it is so weird like you have your guys like Hannity or you can absolutely predict with that guy's going to say every single time you know what side he's on and he's blatant about it and when you see someone . Hugo okay well this is okay where is this is this is Peak b******* right so where where do we go where I see both sides where's the where's the where's the middle ground where someone goes well this is true but you got to say this is on his two and this is this is what's going on on this side and the Republicans have a point here and you don't you don't there's no mainstream media place where you can go for that right now there is no nuts there's a complete loss of trust that they feel like people are not being honest with them right and they're not being straight and you know that they come to people like you and and a lot of other people so independent folks who aren't like the corner quote mainstream media because it's not really thought it's not reporting it's not anything if you can predict 100% what a person is going to say that's not thinking that's not reporting that's not it's just Mark a text, like me that's so disturbing I'ma f*** comedian in a cage fighting commentator when people are coming to me like this is this is the source where you go for unbiased representations of what's going on the world that's crazy let me in where it where is that coming from how do you know that you know like journalism brain surgery that's all it is is still a simple questions optimind when you when you're in a situation like where this happen how do we know that I would not true and but there's a whole generation people in the presnet who just simply do not do that go through the process I just asking simple questions how do I know that's true like at after each store you report your supposed to kind of like wipe your memory clean and start over just because somebody was banned the last time you cover them doesn't mean that they're necessarily going to be the bad guy this time you cover them right I have to continually test your assumptions and ask yourself is this true is that true is this true how do we know this and we've just stop doing that like the it's just the morass of like Rewritten takes on things and it's it's really really bad and you can see why audiences are are are fleeing from the stuff they just don't have the what's really interesting this the lot of this is unpredicted consequence of having these open platforms like Facebook and it like what were people getting their news and then the algorithm sort of direct them towards things are going to piss them off which I don't even think necessarily was initially the plan I think the plan is to accelerate engagement right to him they find out what what what you're engaging with what stories are engaging with and then they give you more of that like re my friend beer actually tried this out and what he did was he when our YouTube and only looked up puppy videos and that's all he looked at for like weeks and then YouTube only serve recommending puppy videos to him so it's not necessarily that Facebook wants you to be outraged but that when you are outraged with her it's over abortion or wore whatever the subject is you're going to engage more and their algorithm favors you engaging more of your engaging more about something very positive you know if you're all about yoga and meditation your algorithm would probably favor yoga and meditation cuz those are things you engage with but it's natural for people to be pissed off shirt to look for things that are noisy specially if you're done working and you like, this world sucks what's going on that sucks worse and then you go to your Facebook and I'll Jesus look at these goddamn border crisis and then it saying all I know how to get mad all fired up I'm going to f****** send him some abortion stories right and then that's your feet right yet exactly but the but there's so many economic incentives that go in there like they know that the more that you engage the longer that you're on Bryant the more ads that you can see that same Dynamic that Facebook and in the social media companies figured out that if you keep feeding something somebody something that you know has been proven then that person up and get them wound up that they're going to they're going to come back for more of it and they're going to keep coming back and actually you can expand their desire to see that stuff by by making them more Angry overall and they will they will come back and they will spend more more more time will the news companies figure out the same thing and that you that they know you're going to you're going to just be in an endless cycle of impotent rage all the time what is kind of Addicting you know and they know that in the end it's so it's more like the Tobacco Company State they know it's a bad as a product that's bad for you and they just keep giving it to you because you know it makes money for me yeah and it's just the thing about it is all of it is about ads total how many clicks they get an advance if they just said you can have a social media company but you can have ads there's a new federal law no more ads on Facebook no more ads on YouTube NORAD Twitter no more ads on Instagram good luck right yeah I'll collapse but that seems to be what it is it's like they figured out that your data is worth a tremendous amount of money and the way they can utilize that money is to sell advertising yet know that they could have coming and going be there not only sending you ads or or but they're also collecting information about your habits which cell again is it the media companies they're basically they're just consumer businesses were there their trading attention for ad space right so if they can get you to watch 4 hours of television today they have that many at slots that they can show you and they know how much money they're going to make you know but the social media companies get it two ways there they they got it by attracting your eyeballs and then also selling selling your habits to the other the next set of advertisers but this as a consumer business right like Americans he's a very conscious of like what they put in their bodies you know they won't eat too many candy will depending on who they are right but people at least look at what the calories are but they don't think about the news that way or social media what that what they put on their brains and it's also a consumer product gone over that many times you have a mental diet as well as you have a physical like food diet absolutely have an information diet a lot of people just eating s*** with their brain it's the worst kind of junk that it's like it's like a cigarette sandwich was it so f****** bad and it's getting worse it is it is getting worse and it's which weird is that this is a ten-year-old problem and no one saw coming and it's kind of overtaking politics it's over taking social discourse everybody's wrapped up and is social media conversations they carry him on over to the dinner table and it gets people in arguments at work and it's all this stuff no one saw these that no one saw that this outrage economy from you no social media sites from things like Facebook no one saw that and no one no one ever predicted that your data was going to be so valuable no I want a fucksaw that I don't think anybody I mean I think some people in the tech business probably saw it early on the potential for this but if you know in terms of other other businesses has been enormous Donald Trump trump really was just all about whatever you're pissed off about I'm right there with you you known and people are just little pissed off about lots of things these days because they're they're doing this all day long and if you if you can if you can take advantage of that thing you're going to have a lot of success and I think I think a lot of people haven't figured that out and some of these things are real causes like people are upset about real things but it's just Wesley Wright people did not see this coming and they didn't prepare for it's just weird that it's one of the biggest sources of income online and people didn't see it coming I mean Facebook is generating billions of dollars and now potentially shifting global politics yeah and the whole issue of a couple of companies like Facebook having control over what you do and do not see it yeah Norma's problem but nobody really cares the few times I've written a couple of features about it I might help what a serious problem is it look if you look in other countries like Israel China there there are number of companies where you seen this pattern of Internet platforms liaising with the government to decide what people can and cannot see and they'll don't say well we don't want to see you no Palestinian protest movements we don't want to see you know the the Venezuelan Channel telesur do you want to take that off you think about how that could end up happening in the United States and it is already a little bit happening it's a little bit but it seems to be happening only in the terms of like to lean towards the progressive side which people are okay with other things especially in the light of Donald Trump being in office this is acceptable censorship yeah but they're wrong about people where they think all this is never going to happen to me you know like you can do that bad thing to this person that I don't like but you do as long as it's never going to happen to me exactly the wrong me history shows that has happened to you you know and that's so we're giving these companies an enormous amount of power to decide all kinds of things what we what we looking at what what kind of political ideas we can be exposed to dangerous talked about when the initial Patriot Act was enacted when people like hate this might be fine with Obama in office right it'll baby Obama is not going to enact some of the worst Clauses of this and use it on people or the with the ndaa so it was some of the things were just completely unconstitutional but your tools aside for whatever f****** president we have like what if we have about Trump's Trump write me we never thought we'd have a trump right what if we have a next-level guy post Trump what if there's some sort of catastrophe tragedy attack something that really gets people fired up and they vote in someone who takes it up to another level and then he has these tools and then uses these tools on his political enemies which is entirely possible I mean we've already seen that a little bit I mean people don't want to bring this up but you know a lot of the stories that have come out about Trump. leaks of classified information that are coming from those warrantor programs that were instituted after 9/11 attack the NSA programs to collect data like they're they're unmasking people like we have a lot of evidence now that there's a lot of the couple that came out about a month ago that showed that the FBI was doing something like 60,000 searches a month at one point where there aren't they were asking the NSA for the ability to unmask names and that. so where these tools are incredibly powerful than probably dangerous but people thought after 9/11 they were scared so you know we want to protect ourselves so that's okay for now you know we'll pull it back later but they but you never do pull it back right now and always ends up being used by somebody in the wrong way and I think we're starting to see that that's going to be a problem yeah I'm real concerned about pit places like Google and Facebook all terrain the path of a free speech and and leaning people in certain directions and silencing people that have opposing viewpoints and the fact that they think that they're doing this for good because this is how they see the world and they don't understand that you have to let these ideas play out in the marketplace of free speech and free ideas if you don't do that if you don't do that if you don't let people debate the merits the pros the khans what's wrong what's right if you don't do that then you don't get real discourse you don't get real Disco you're essentially you've got some sort of intellectual dictatorship going on and because it's a progressive dictatorship you think it's okay because it's people who want everybody be inclusive and you know I mean this is this is a weird time for that it's a really weird time for that because as you said people are so short-sighted they don't understand these like the first amendment's in place for a very good reason and set up a long f****** time ago cuz they did the math they saw where it was going and they're like we have to have the ability to express ourselves we have to have ability to freely Express thoughts and ideas in challenge people that are in a position of power cuz if we don't we wind up exactly where we came from and courts continually reaffirmed that idea that the the the way to deal with that speech was with more speech yes and they did it over and over and over again you know we we the legal standard for speech still I think remains that unless it's directly sitting balance you can you collect you can have speech that incites violence generally and Springport even upheld that you can have speech that's that comes from the material that was stolen illegally that's okay but we had a very very high bar for prohibiting speech always and another the libel cases the cases for defamation you know that also established a very very high standard for punishing speech but now all the sudden people have a completely different idea but it's like you know me but the fact that this was a fundamental Concept in American Society for unit 230 years would it change it without thinking about the consequences of a guy like Trump could be almost like a trojan horse in a way like if you want to play 3D chess would you do you get a guy who's just so egregious and so outrageous and then so many people oppose him get that guy let him get into a position of power and then sit back watch the hour change bubble and then take advantage of that funnel people in the certain directions mean I don't think that's what's happening but if I was super f****** tinfoil-hat e that's how I would go about it I would say this is what you want if you really want to change things for your direction put someone that opposes it that's disgusting and that way people just a rational intelligent person is never going to side with him so they can decide to the people that opposed him and then you can sneak a lot of s*** in that maybe they wouldn't agree with any other circumstance Minnesota like another 9/11 right like you know 911 happen all the sudden people who weren't in favor of the government being able to go through your library records or listen to your phone calls and all the sudden they were like so freaked out when suddenly had two very different ideas about speech in like they ain't you know they that guy so bad you know that maybe we should consider Banning x y and z yeah I did say he was conceived as a way to discredit the First Amendment it went and some other ideas that would that would that would be a brilliant 3D chess move super sneaky how many steps ahead he was conceived this as a as a way to discredit the First Amendment it went in some other ideas that would that would that would be a brilliant 3D chess move level many steps that had exactly</div>

I have I wear a rubber nose and f****** I've covered in and what they're like they're unbelievable for some of the t-shirts are amazing you know it like Trump 20/20 fuckyourfeelings you know what I mean like The Punisher you know that the Punisher skull with a thing like oh my goodness I might have to get one of those I mean he's the t-shirts with a trump wig on it so I saw that I need that shirt unlike it an 8 year old kid write a mother with her little kids in the trench Trump Punisher skull but do they sell that shirt on Amazon can find out the shorts thing sold everywhere they like Embrace that s*** it's been patrolling aspect of all of it is like the fun part for what they get off on is how how freaked out you know clump of liberal audience Yeah by their appearance their attitude and everything and they lean into it you know what I mean which is which is interesting because you know that kind of like group camaraderie thing that you don't really find that on campaign Trail the Democratic side is different in different entirely but yeah it's crazy well it's dumb and that we had a thing that he sort of like captured is this place where you can be dumb like it's fun to be dumb and say grab her by the p**** like everybody knows that's kind of a dumb thing to say public course that you can say it there because he said it 70 rpm like you were going to cut this b**** off at 70 there's no high-function here and then cut it off at 70 and just let it rip totally totally and and this particular thing right but they are all their chanting you know what I mean like they're all into it and all the Crowds Are there so huge like I was in Cincinnati and I was late to one of his events and I made the mistake that I couldn't drive in because they blocked off all the bridges if you've ever been there right you know I was in the Kentucky side so I had to walk like three miles away and walk over bridge and I thought I was going to all the way into Kentucky like a mile down the road I mean had a thousands of people to get into this event it was imputes incredible in that people that seat it was like 17 or 18 thousand it was the video person crowd in Queens a couple of weeks ago that you'll see crowds that big but Trump's Crowds Are just dating back in 2016 they're just consistently huge every everywhere and and it again just before all the reporter saw this and they all said that Hillary was having real trouble getting four and five thousand people into her events and so we all you know we're all talk to each other like that's got to be in it a thing that's going to play a role in the election kind of brought it up or they they explained it away I think they felt like if you discussed it and brought it up that somehow or another you you were contributing to Trump being did Trump winning right but that's that's a fallacious way to look at it because covering up the reality of the situation I think created a false sense of security for Democrats sure they thought they were going to win by a landslide that's what everybody was saying but it wasn't throughout the campaign for Hillary and people I think we're too afraid to to bring up a lot of the stuff because they didn't want to be seen as helping Trump but that's not what the business is about we're not supposed to be you know helping backbone don't have no political indications were supposed to tell you what we see</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> if I was coming like off the couch so to speak six months or be a little more appropriate you ever off the couch only if I'm injured and I've only been injured in any significant way since Ultra since they're altering running once for about 5 weeks what happened I had a stress fracture on my right sacral ala flat running that I was actually pairing for a race at a lot more climbing and descending so I started changing my training tomorrow climbing to sending and when I did that like one thing that sometimes happens when you're running a lot of flat hard surfaces is your like ankles in your hips can get pretty tight from that real like kind of uniform like a mechanic that you're doing so like my range of motion was semi limited Sonos doing some of that hard downhill and Uphill running has probably wasn't very efficient with my form and it ended up Alberto Tomba for those impact forces ended up in the wrong spot and then the stress fracture occurred is crazy you broke your ass you literally broke your ass so where Jesus Christ was when I first had the pain surface for that it was kind of in like the like lower back glute area is where it surfaced so I thought I had like a sciatic I went into the doctor and they were like okay let's try some like Active Release therapy and let's see if we can get this thing to loosen up and we just were working on working on it and like it would like clear up where I wouldn't notice it if I was walking around but then every time I go for a run or try to go for a run I get that sharp pain right away and so after about think it was maybe four weeks or so we just we had been doing a ton of Active Release a ton of Mobility work and then like it wasn't going away so he's the coolest get an MRI and see what's going on in there and the MRI got the results back and he said there's nothing there so you start run again so I started running again I ran like I think it was two or three days maybe very short like two miles and then three miles and maybe 5 or something like that and then I got a call back from the doctor needs like the MRI there is a stress fracture it was it was a very fine stress fracture it wasn't I mean sometimes when people have a fracture on her say kirala it's like a big enough fracture where like they can be out for like a year and yeah yeah so it could be a really bad injury but he said maybe the mobility in the strength work I was doing while I had that to try to rehab kind of strength in the areas around it enough that when I just was running flat really slow really easy that protected that area and I'm pregnant feel the pain anymore so after that I think I took another like 2 weeks off add that to try to rehab kind of strength in the areas around it enough that when I just was running flat really slow really easy that protected that area and I'm pregnant feel the pain anymore so after that I think I took another like two weeks off completely just to make sure before I started building back up and then I started kind of building back up again</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you are doing something really Bonkers right now right you are attempting to run across the entire country into the break the record yeah so this is kind of in its infancy of it in the planning stages so I probably won't happen in the immediate future but someone you're very familiar with that Justin Wren one thing I've kind of been interested in since I started ultra-running is this route is a 3100 my route pays for that goes from San Francisco to New York and it's been done by you know quite a few people with walking running picazon like he's got the course record on the average like 70 miles a day yeah yeah so it's like it it's it's a pretty insane route and I've always been interested in doing it and I just haven't really been motivated I guess to really attempt it or just an idea I would and then last year one of my one of my sponsors Aldo's nut Butters that shave my friend Riza and oh I don't know why they believe that the name should be changed nut butter has a negative connotation to heterosexual males who think that it's sounds like something comes out of your dick Better Price better name. I love their stuff yeah I know they make a great product and they had actually proposed Al after that I think they just were maybe spitballing a little bit there like a would you be interested in doing that like go running in that cross-country route has a Gavin actually wanting to do that at some point just haven't gotten around to actually planning it out as a statement God damn dude how would you prepare for that yeah you know I mean it might be in super Uncharted Territory cuz I've just haven't done anything like that before so it would be difficult you be allowed lot of learning on the Fly I think really the big key thing there is your managing a lot of stuff with that like you want to make sure you're sleeping well throughout that cuz obviously if you're not sleeping well it could end badly for you pretty soon I think you just end up trying to do as much specific things as you can to prepare without going boardsource lot of time on feed I'm you can imagine the pages of incredibly slow this problem be like walking brakes and not going to be like you're certainly not from Hell face but might my my first thought is like I'll probably Target like a 12 to 14-hour range per day and whatever I get out of that 12 to 14 days or hours is what I get and then that gives me kind of the flexibility to have like at least 10 hours of buffer to kind of like trapped in sleep and get ready for the next day didn't you wear what he did or you ran the entire length of the UK in the outside of it it with no training right cuz he's an animal down he really is a special person really is a special person I remember only knowing of him as a comedian and you know it had seen him do a lot of stand-up before and then I watched this documentary where he's running let me know how many mile how many different marathons was it was like 26 marathons in 27 days he didn't wind up taking one day off for his feet were literally mangled blisters and only imagine it wasn't in shape but you just f****** crazy just sheer willpower I mean just to 1 marathon when you're not in shape I just can't imagine but the gist of f****** sheer amount of just we'll just pure will that takes to do something like that until just keep pushing left right left right left right left right you know everything you had your brain your feet everything stop stop stop f*** you left right left right left right mean he ran how many thousand miles is it the entire length of the UK over the outside of 43 marathons 43 f****** marathons article 2009 clean Illinois celebrating after finishing his 43rd marathon in 51 days he's really really interesting guy and he likes women as a man he just likes dressing as a woman he's just a really unique. But it but he owns it sand like he is who he is sub 5-hour Marathon the connection seem to finish, so far my misses Target by 30 seconds give it to him but when he's talking about these marathons like a good Lord man like it's hard enough for someone to do who's like you like for a guy like Jeron 40 what how many marathons 40 what 40 days is f****** Bonkers right for sure you know about a 40-day ish time frame give or take so you're really I think the biggest hurdle or planning thing is to find a timeline where you're going to run into leestma weather issues cuz when you're going across the country so you're going over the Sierras and you're going through the middle of the country and then all that stuff so obviously you don't want to be going over mountain passes in the middle of winter but you probably don't also want to be going through the Midwest in the middle of the summer so some of us are planning around around that there's probably like some good opportunities in the spring in the fall that kind of catch that window of moderate temps forces extremes before a peacock do you know Pete yeah yeah man runs from San Francisco to New York southern tip of Florida all by himself with just do it like one of those push strollers and he averaged like I think was like 50 miles a day or something like that I'm like at United login always runs on Strava so it's hilarious to see like these these weeks after weeks where is like 50 miles a 50-mile a 50-mile day like you like 354 mile weeks and stuff like that and then if you like zoomed in on his route you could see like he be on this route also he seemed a little bit you do me like there's a grocery store there that's why I think you stayed at hotels if I'm not mistaken I have to look bad to bring the baby card upstairs you're bigger better and baby stroller from Alaska to Florida what the f*** man did you talk to him at all about this idea I haven't yet Noemi that's Betty are you going to yeah I'll definitely be good about it just really usually comes down and actually your Justin work with someone earlier who did it walking I think I think I may be with a slightly different route but it was basically the same promise and he walked like something 20-some miles a day or something like that was Raising raising funds and awareness for fight for the forgotten to so will maybe talk to him a bit too so the ideas late summer early fall something like that you want to get away from winter but you also want to be down before the the worst part of Summer with the global warming do you factor that in 18 so I could either do it now or I get to be a little lesson 18 up I finishing so I would either maybe try to do it like this fall or if I don't have enough in place by then Target kind of the end of winter for 2021 yet so I don't want to necessarily like a cat fight list had to put a date on the on the calendar right away and then find out how do I need to like and there's a lot more resources I have to try to acquire make this happen and do this in terms of logistics they don't know on the calendar right away and then find out how do I need to like and there's a lot more resources I have to try to acquire make this happen and do this in terms of logistics</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> amazing what people can do when they decide they're going to do it but yeah I mean I think with four for this particular run you know I probably would have kept punching it down the road and do you know what had I not talk to Justin Wren to be honest with you like when you do something like that part of the reason I think you do that is for me anyways when I see you like endurance alter endurance poor to give you a very selfish sport because of training race day is like an all-day Africa on the people helping you out like they're taking time out of their schedule their day to come out their crew pay essentially like be your peer support system while you're out there kind of trying to know too well these things so you know part of it is like I want to try to give back in a way as well as it supposed to just always going out in racing for my own my own sake and what will it be absolutely no doubt about it yeah and I think I heard it again just listening to Justin Wren podcast his interviews to people I try to say like what it kind of comes in the stages where he tells his background story like his experience with bullying and at first you just your heart just sinks for the guy you thinking like will how could anyone have to go through that I would never wanted to go through that and you're going to transition into this phase of like you got to get nervous and anxious cuz you're thinking like will did I say something mean to when I was younger or negative way and then can you just want to try to do something to support and you know it's it's really went when you look at someone like Justin Wren it's it's mind-boggling to me that this guy isn't like an internationally-known hero or leader yet anyway buy them specifically and it's really the suffering that why you would never know talking to him like you just goes about it like that I got in Bellaire like most people would probably say okay I went over Africa I got malaria I helped some people out I'm good now know some will raise some money for the charity and will send it over to him or something even though he keeps going back and keeps getting Justin ran is like next level when it comes to like a leader I think and I think in the current session of current climate like you know our leaders today tend to be you know people are celebrities athletes and then politicians and things like that and it's like you look around and it can be very underwhelming about just like nope some of like like how how badly are like how badly are people actually trying to help people and how how much how many of these like politicians actually call poor people how many of them actually care about someone who's disenfranchised or how much to tell me about do they actually care care care there's no worry at all about ulterior motives they don't exist does no ulterior motive to sleep on a dirt floor in the grass Shack with the pygmies like he's done for months at a time he's just doing it for love I want to do things that are good for Humanity but often times they don't have to have that example to kind of like to lead the way they look into avoid in some cases and I think Justin is the type of person who you know if the more people we can get to know about him his story and what he's trying to do on the the wells in the farms and with a pygmy as well as his new branch on anti-bullying the better so when I reached out to him I was actually like kind of surprised Jon renau it on I think Instagram and Twitter and I thought the key Finance EXE not following me and you responded in like less than a couple hours that you followed me responded back and he's just like this is so awesome I feel super honored that you'd want to help out in some way and it's like he's just always looking for opportunities to help so then you know when I got that response from him it was like clarification but I think I already knew about the guy just been listening to him on your show and others that you know he's really in this for a big reason and if we need to fast-track this cross country event to bring him some some awareness we'll see what we can do but he's in everything he does he does to help and promote other people even when I was trying to talk to him about his parasite I had to get it once shivering in the pale white my bro what is going on with you like what is this my doctor he's amazing I stop stop what is happening he doesn't want to talk about himself antibiotics one of the side effects is a lot of times people get injured like your ligaments get injured cuz apparently there's a weakening of fact it was really kind of it's really fascinating when you think about the human body as an overall organism and that it's really an ecosystem and that when you flood antibiotics into that ecosystem to try to prevent disease from destroying it you also have these unintended side effects and problem is we can ligaments there's a lot of the correlation between people getting staph infection and then blowing out knees ACL you know tendons and things along those lines afterwards so both of his shoulders are f***** you know and this is post antibiotics and yet he's still talking about fighting so you can bring more awareness to the pygmy somebody please stop just get your shoulders fixed whatever you got going on the f*** this parasite is like you don't even know what this didn't even know this is he's not even thinking about themselves like if I can get in and get a fight in by the end of the year by the end of the year man tits f****** December or stop it you're not getting in by the end of the year you're not getting in the beginning of 20/20 let's heal up and he totally selfless person for good for those people's the people that live in the Congo and what he's done for them I mean I don't know how many Wells they've built so far but they made an alliance with the cash app which is one of my sponsor so every time someone download the cash app when they use the code Joe Rogan whether it's for Google for Android or for eye for an iPhone for Apple you get 10 $10 goes to this caused so they've raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and they're Building Wealth right now it's just it's amazing thing that he's done and he's just like you feel like a piece of s*** like when you're around on me like why nice it's it's like it was enough for him to find people who are hard off yet to go and find the most forgotten most hard off people and how much better would he be if he was selfish and I spent all this time training and not getting malaria three times not having unknown parasite that they think might be in his f****** brain even know what I was just reading the story about some guy who is having seizures and it turns out he had all these worms in his brain and I'm like and I was thinking about Justin thyme leaves from uncooked pork from this guy off and Justin they think the problem with the Congo is it's so remote and you don't get a lot of people to go there and get diseases and then come back so they they don't even know what this is might be something that no one's ever got before sure and then made it back to Western civilization to be examined yeah wow yeah wow what the hell man yeah and then you would never know talking to him needed everyone I guess you know it's an interesting I'm not just an interesting it's a it's a beautiful sort of expression of what can happen to a person when they experience deep pain and sadness and then they find a way out and then they find a way to help other people and that's where what he's done you know his is childhood was really rough and he came out of that a super kind person as opposed to being angry and mean Municipal we need more than all right we need more people building people up and helping unless people tearing people down and then hating me so much of so much of what social media is used for in so much of what the internet is used for is hate his anger is so much anger you know and to see someone like Justin this rare soul that is found a way to almost universally liked everything he does is channel towards good all of it and including kicking people's asses how do you make that good I found it on the way to make people's asses a good thing beautiful I'm really honored to be his friend so he's one of my you know they were the rarest people that I know ya no doubt it's been cool to hear his story and you know I think thanks to you probably got a much bigger audience to so a good thing beautiful I'm I'm really honored to be his friend so he's one of my you know they were the rarest people that I know ya no doubt it's been cool to hear his story and you know I think thanks to you probably got a much bigger audience to so</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> linked up with Sean for Shawna such a polarizing figure carnivore go-to guy and he's like a full-on carnivore Zealot as it were and he doesn't even see things vegetables are bad for you sometimes gets misrepresented and part of it is just like on social media and stuff but he's on like before he I think went full carnivore but on Twitter and I thought he was an interesting person not because of what he ate so what you doing back then was easy low carb I think something similar to what I've been doing maybe maybe less carbohydrates and his activity levels are like really short and fast and I just thought he was an interesting person because of his background I mean he's you know Highlands game athlead freshman rugby player he's doing this high intensity and that I do but he's doing the exact opposite athlete type stuff he's twice the size of me what kind of 200 expect end of the spectrum from like an athletic standpoint so like I was just interested in kind of like you know what he was doing and what he was up to that's kind of why we started the podcast together and about something so it's like you know it it gets to get stuff for someone like him who gets identified as be like the face of the carnivore movement because then like you get all the positive and a negative coming your way too and then you can feed into that but I'm asking questions and things like that and it's it's it's it's a learning experience I think anyway so what he clearly enjoys f****** with vegans well yeah and it says he's been on this fruitarian kick lately which is kind of hilarious I didn't know there was that many of those people out there yeah one of them just died one one fruitarian doctor died during a fast for most active on it it's like they're either take it one hundred percent serious or it's like kind of a Joker game and then when those two polar ends meet its that's where you get the big kind of like blow up interactions and then and then it becomes a like kind of a game of life vegan told me that I should die or something like that I'm going to go tell that vegan that you know this summer will come up with like a picture of like here's shoes that humans you know Josh system in this clearly means we're frugivores and then someone else they will look at the the digestive tract of a human being it is clearly designed more to be eating meat or animal products and you know they go back and forth with different like parts of the human anatomy to try to like prove that were vegetarian or vegan what we have here is people who can have to have specific traits that are good for eating fruits and vegetables and some specific traits are good for eating animal products so we're omnivores Tools in fire thousands of years you Knuckleheads you know who one of them my favorite podcast we've done was with the sky eye doctor bill Schindler he's an archaeologist out of a thing as Washington University and he's such a cool dude he like totally what he said something I was really resonated with me where he said you know humans were were unique in that like we we we we we like overtime developed ways to use like tool some things I got to liberate nutrients so to look at anything in its raw state is kind of the missed the point of why humans are the way they are sure will like lentils and eat it with their own teeth and go go eat a squirrel with your face swell cassava they didn't have the jungle they figured out that you have to cook the stuff in sink drain it and it's and it's a primary staple the diets of many people that live in the in the jungle if you don't do that cyanide is produced by one of their primary Foods they just figured it out just like you figured out you have to boil lentils just like you figured out you have to cook beans I mean you can't eat most of these things that we eat are not good to eat if you just prostate something's like fruits are some vegetables are but some just or not and this is the same with me and this this idea that you're supposed to be where we're clearly an herbivore because of the fact that we can you know we're not supposed to be you know killing animals with our teeth like that's so dumb like week we kill animals with tools and we've done it for so long that our bodies of adapted we've adapted to the fact that we have closed that's why we're not covered in hair even f****** idiot obvious stuff people who live in the coldest climates of the world aren't covered in hair you know yeah you know it was interesting because like what what you're saying to when we had bill on the show he he's got us Unity spiritual he's actually gone in and visited these indigenous tribes have been relatively Untouched by modern society took basically with the one question little how you eat so he's been he seemed like a variety of different stuff I think even had a show on National Geographic for a while that looked into some of this but he they just show you the polarization of what humans can kind of do he he went he visited the sombrero The Witches of a branch of the Maasai over in Africa you know they're they're basically drinking blood and milk for the for a huge portion of their nutrition manual that basically on of primarily animal-based nutrition plan and they're super healthy he said that there may be one of the most healthy groups of people he's seen from just like a physical stature like to tell that sort of thing but then he also down to ankles in South America camera the name of the tribe but they found a way to basically liberate nutrients from a poisonous potato and is that what it was literally dig like a pit and put like some like thousand pounds of potatoes in there and let them sit there and like from and I guess like up to six months and then they would actually make display that they were using cuz it was still a toxin or something that they needed to kind of prevent from like interacting play kill you I guess but with the clay it doesn't and it's always like how the f*** did they figure that out I want to know Salat time and energy into it but yeah it is interesting to think like how they all got passed along from generation to generation and how about fine-tuned where it is today but I think it's it's cool to look at that stuff when it comes to the gyro nutrition too and kind of when you understand like it's less about like this food is bad for me or this this food is this particular food item is bad for me across the board and this one is great for me across the board more so about Elizabeth this food does well this is what this one does well so let I like you mentioned mix-and-match to where you get to get the profile that you're looking for I think the problem is what we're saying before is it people were entering into these conversations with this goal that they want to achieve this goal being a plant or bad for you or meat is bad for you or we're supposed to be only eating me or we're supposed to be only eating plants and here's why and you know you have this confirmation bias you're not looking at any other piece of evidence and protect yeah I mean I can eat peanuts all day long if you're allergic to peanuts your dad if he want that means it's weird strange creatures and what was his changing we got here Jamie the ancient and the ancient and ancient Indian tradition of eating clay may have helped to protect health good for you I found a way to like package the dust and dust this is a whole history of potatoes and Toma teen toxic compounds believed to defend plants against attacks from dangerous organisms like fungi bacteria in human beings we are dangerous organisms cooking often breaks down and Toma teen are affected by heat in the mountains wow say that word Juan guanaco and wild relatives of the Lama lick clay before eating poisonous plant the f****** llamas figured it out the toxins stick more technically absorbed the fine clay particles the animal stomachs passing through the digestive system without affecting it mimicking this process mountain people apparently learn to dunk while potatoes in a gravy made of clay and water eventually they bread less toxic potatoes those some of the old poisonous varieties remain flavored for the resistance to favored for the resistance to frost clay dust is still sold in Peruvian and Bolivian markets to accompany them wow resistance 240 favored for the resistance to frost clay dust is still sold in Peruvian and Bolivian markets to accompany them wow</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> look at like seasons of racing is kind of Tookie ones you have like your spring early summer and your kind of late summer fall / winter seasons was kind of too so I'll basically just sacrifice one of those seasons for this and I probably won't really know what to expect I've never done anything quite like this before but I'm planning on dedicating one of those Seasons towards that exclusively today but this is walking was a huge spectator sport in the late 19th century they would bet money that like you couldn't do it and that's when you had to prove what you were doing daughter Duo who needing to raise money to save their Farm in Spokane County Washington responded to a $10,000 public wager that no one could make it by foot across the country Helga and Clara s be left home with $10 between them as well as a compass and knife a curling iron and a Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers don't f*** with those ladies don't curl your hair and shoot you in the dick they made it to New York City 7 months later but for reasons known did not receive any reward for their toil on the way home Helga and Clara took the train what the f*** why didn't they get paid some jackass and a 1980s somebody's to me I was doing it at his team scramble to get witness signatures the whole way across and he could prove that he did it when you get it and then I finally did it the train there was a guy think before Pete broke the record that I think got caught cheating trying to go cuz I know you got a document stuff pretty detailed and you know I'm crazy like you think it would be enough to track it on your watch and upload it but like you know what people do goofy things like I get in the back of the RV I guess and drive really slow but sing like that maybe they should be some sort of a video recording of it like if you have a GoPro on your head I want to do a live feed just have it on all possible listen man we're in will help you whatever we can do sounds like a very worthy cause and it's a crazy undertaking and we'd be happy to promote it to and let everybody know and have people f****** honk their horn and drive Aiea</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and everything else with that and you know that you brought interesting point to not to keep going down the rabbit hole but the other thing that I thought really interesting was when you look at waste components I feel like we're not maybe looking at that as much as as we should be when we're talking about trying to feed a bunch of people that will maybe we should start with what we're throwing away that we wouldn't have to oh yeah and I actually asked dr. Schindler about that he actually did a study with some of his grad students what they looked at think I took 30 whitetail deer and they they processed it down to like the very last potential calorie to find out how much is wasted even in like a you know of a deer that can say you can go and you shoot a deer and then you can take it to the the process and get it all done he said it was between I think it was between like 13 to 30 days worth of human nutrition that gets wasted single whitetail deer so like there's a problem with that idea of waste is only if you do something with it if you leave in the field there's no waste right but if you just killed a deer that it's not it just left it there is no waste since you're feeding animals right that means they're going to absolutely destroy that thing is going to be gone a short. Time including the bones and if they don't eat the bones the bones will eventually deteriorate and become part of the soil this is what happens when animals sure so I guess maybe the way to look at them is like what are we if we're looking to just if our objective is to feed as many people as possible and we're maximizing the amount of nutrients we can acquire from a specific staying like we're leaving a lot on the table or we're giving a lot to different areas like different animals and things that are blue lentils are disgusting and this is not how it's supposed to be it supposed to be animals are supposed to have access to what's left over I mean this is what would happen if a bear killed a moose I have a bear killed him was going to consume a big portion of the body and then it's going to leave whatever's left and then rodents and vultures and and then eventually insects and bacteria are going to break it down and this is a natural cycle of life for Anna this is how it's supposed to be when we do is we take it we cut it up we eat some of it we throw some of it away we put that it'll in a plastic bag with zip tie it we did a f****** hole in the ground we threw that bag in there it's not it's Ludacris yeah it's we know better we do know better we understand the whole process of these things breaking down in the wild and what happens to them we understand there's animals that their entire diet consist eating animals that other animals have killed and they leave some of it behind us we're supposed to leave it behind it's supposed to be a part of the of the whole cycle of life we were supposed to compost all these things are supposed to be natural and when I was a kid my mom and my stepdad were part of this Cooperative Farm thing and we started composting and I believe we didn't do it for very long cuz we eventually one that moving and we stopped we stop being a part of this thing but really interesting cuz I was a little kid I think I never thought of that before you take your food waste and you separate it from like pay-per-view paper waist and then you have like leftover Tomatoes or something like that in all that would go into one specific Ben and that Ben would go into this big thing was like was made with like chicken wire and leaves and you have a little over it and like it was a wood box and you would throw everything in there and it would all sort of rot in compost than you would take stop and you would use it in the garden and this is this is how composting is done this is how fertilizers made in this is what you're supposed to do small-scale regenerative farming and what we're doing is assholes we take our food we put in f****** bags with zip tie it shut and we Chuck it in the ground it's dumb it's a really dumb way of doing things I just feel like that is something that we could really leverage at the educational level like that schools are we we are housing these kids and like you know one of the biggest hurdles I think of that we got them indoor sitting in desks for seven eight hours a day and then we what why not get them out and learn that and do that and you have these many little like regenerative areas go to earn it and then it doesn't get forgotten when your adult as easily teaching kids how to complete this this life that they're born into the way it's established for the parents the way it's established for the neighborhood get your car drive to work work all day come home and eat what you can throw the rest of the garbage go back to work in the morning and this is nonsense this is not how you have to do you don't you don't have to do anything there's a bunch of different ways to live this life and there's only a hundred years if you're lucky so this thing that we're setting up kids to simply be as miserable as everybody else before them doing the exact same thing that everybody else has done like maybe you can get lucky like I have been or like you've been and you find something that you actually enjoy doing then you get lucky like oh my God you know Zach found a job that he really loves and he got really good at it and now he actually has joy and what he does but there's there's a lot of different places in this this country alone where you can live and you could do things in a in a non-traditional Manner and you can get by and you'll probably be healthier and happier than someone that gets stuck in the same goddamn civilization cycle this industrialize cycle sure that we're all in and we don't teach kids that we teach kids as it hears history here's math get your SATs in at the score go to the college that you want get a job and this is the the standard path it seems to be rewarded in this is what and if you say why I'm going to drop out oh good luck loser you know you're going to f****** your life you know what are you doing man you not even going to college Jesus Christ like and it's very important that we have this incredibly rigid system and and it really makes people feel like Venom that made me feel like a failure I didn't fit into the system I just because of I have ADD or whatever emotional issues whatever I had I just could not sit still in class and concentrate I had way too much energy this is just for me I was twiddling my thumbs on tap in the floor and looking at the clock and I couldn't get anything hit I was gone and I didn't want to do home I'd literally didn't do any homework my entire High School career didn't do any I just got by being smart enough to pass test by learning what I learned in class and not putting in any f****** extra effort I just want to get out and I found something that I was good at it figured it out I finally got lucky that I did that but for a lot of people to just live these lives of frustration you know what they never do find ascendant not talk to find a thing and there's also I think there's a great satisfaction to working on something that you enjoy whether it's working with your hands or working on something that's creative and working with the land you know you talk to people that run their own little Organic Farms I got I know this couple that runs an organic farm and man they talk about their their food they talk about vegetables that grow in the stuff they grow they like beam that they natural natural is a gravity that we have towards that it's a natural human reward to be able to cultivate your own food make a salad out of some stuff that you grew yourself man that feels amazing it really does and there's people that could be making a living doing that and never encouraged to do so and they might be way happier than selling insurance no I agree to run an organic garden and you do Campo if you don't use pesticides you do everything organic and everything is regenerative and you'd actually can feed people my God like how good would you feel get it set up for you got 500 kids going to turn them into not losers how do I get 500 kids and not be a loser well just standard path you know like the like the standard American diet slick standard American Education standard path that will work for x amount of people you get 10 people seven of them won't be losers be just shove them into this machine and put them out in this f****** form yeah it's a bummer advice from a teacher for five years so you're a successful guide and unusual thing you know you found the thing that you really excel at that you actually enjoy that is for so many people the ultimate goal of life if you can make a lot of money in this life but you will not be as happy inside it's really contrary like capitalist ideas we were taught to think that the more money you make them to happier you'll be that's definitely not true but you will make more money if you're happier with what you do which it sounds like a contradiction but it's not you'll Excel and if you're excelling you'll probably through whatever you're doing is profitable obviously some things that you can excel at that if there's no f****** way to make a lot of money as a bowler you know if you like I'm really in a bowling well you're kind of locked find something that you enjoy you'll have an infinitely happier life it's just you you can do that you just have to find those gift explore those things I think that's where we fail kids we fail kids and giving them this landscape of possibilities that actually does exist I think there's a landscape of possibilities for what you can do and everyone is dead I don't want to be an ultramarathon Runner man right if you and I are competing I'm f***** champ I'm not I'm not the guy that supposed to be running 200 miles it's just your round and it's also it's not what I don't desire to do that conversely if you had to become a stand-up comedian you probably will f*** this I don't want to do anything about things that's funny and then with the first time you bomb and like what am I doing with my life and it's everybody has a different personality and he's different personalities and he's different interests and desires they take different paths and I think we need to open that up to people more and then just sort of Amway encourage people to seek more to seek to genuinely try to find things that introduced maybe you should be a fly fishing guide you know maybe you should be a guy who makes homemade mugs out of exotic hardwood you know maybe maybe you're a knife maker maybe you're a person who you maybe should make f****** dreamcatchers I don't know put on the wall and go what the f*** am I doing Native American but there's things you can do man you just have to find that thing and I think that's so hard for people and it's my people when they find someone like yourself is doing this unusual unorthodox thing in your extremely successful at it had become so attracted to people to hear your story it's never guessed I'd be doing what I'm doing out at 10 years ago you know it is it is it is interesting when you think about just where you thought you would maybe be in then where you end up and all that stuff in between and ultimately I think if you think you want to be be smart about stuff like I didn't necessarily just quit my job and Sam would be an ultramarathon Runner you kind of have like a few different options available or you just keep options open to like for me personally I like to coach to so I'm going to do some of that and that help supplement things and then he's always been a fun thing to do so historic that I would go on podcast and then a couple years ago is like them too so I think we kind of really exploring where their Curiosities are find the different Avenues to and they just kind of snowballs a little bit supposed to being hit maybe start out making a dreamcatcher and then you become something else they must be fun to do them too so you're starting each other I think when people start kind of really exploring where their Curiosities are you find the different Avenues to and they just kind of snowballs a little bit supposed to being and maybe start out making the Dreamcatcher and then you become something else</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do any training on machines or is all your training essentially Dawn on the road the running is all pretty much done on the road in the trails I'll do like some Mobility work and some strength work in the gym and that's where all all kind of go inside I guess for it I've used treadmills and stuff in the past and I do use them from time to time but usually if I had the option to go outside I'll do that in Phoenix so it's sunny most days oh yeah that's right you're at the Comerica yeah I'll be there for sure right now probably maybe 65 or so I've been there before the summer July world record it was through the August so my training was like a hundred Ten Degrees and the funny thing to is the Pettit Center where I did the race it was actually built for Speed skating and some hockey rinks so they keep it at like 60° I remember one day when I was running it was like one of the hottest days this summer I'm thinking like I'm going to race literally a half the temperature I'm no expert at it by any means but I think there's some pretty cool like studies and stuff that of the effects that happen when you are training and some of those Heats like what happens if the way was stuck to me that kind of simulation training at altitude to a degree so who knows maybe some night sounds similar to Hot Yoga right that's they're doing some studies at Harvard I believe I think it's Harvard some was explaining the whole deal to me is not something that I read but essentially what they're doing they're trying to find out whether or not hot yoga these 90-minute Hot Yoga sessions replicate some of the known benefits of sauna because you know they keep it the hot yoga place I go to I think they keep it a hundred five degrees vs so now you know it gets much much hotter than that you're in like the 180s with what I like and but the idea is that when your body is extremely stressed when you're doing is posing you're sweating like crazy that your body core temperature rises basically to the similar level than if you're just sitting in a sauna so you get a very similar response yeah yeah it's it's really interesting so I try to remember that when it's the summer in Phoenix so I don't get too miserable with Jim which is one of the most famous boxing gyms in history Emanuel Steward who was just a wizard of boxing and you train Tommy Hearns and you know some of the like the all-time greats of that era he would crank the temperature is in Detroit they would crank the temperature up really hot so you going to that gym and it would be that way like four a specific reason cuz he believed that it increased endurance stuff but I'll still take January and February of like how do you hydrate yourself in like what kind of decorations we talkin about Xavier if its 110 degrees outside 120 what was the hottest year in at I think 1:10 is relatively early so that it's not like 110 from start to finish so like say at like 6 or 7 in the morning you know it might be in the 80s High eighties and be working his way up so that like I'm finishing it might be 110 for Mikey work us the way I structure my training usually when I'm kind of in picas I'll do them my biggest work out in the morning and then I might go out and do like a second-round that's like a little shorter or quite a bit shorter in most cases and really low intensity and you know then sometimes if it's the afternoon of Phoenix that's when I would see like that 110 but I'm usually not out for more than like 45 60 minutes so hydrating is is interesting because I grew up in the midwest so I was very familiar running in hot humid stuff in the summer and you know the dry desert heat though it seems like you get thirsty a lot quicker and a lot more frequently so I one of the things I learned the first summer I was in Phoenix is knowing where the water fountains are in the kind of planning your house around that you drink out of public water fountains earlier this year he was in early June call the San Diego hundred and it's got the spot in the middle of the course we're the bait stations are a little further apart of the Nine Mile Stretch and 7-mile stretch and I kind of miss X how much water I did so I filled up my water in a stream and it was probably not an ideal dude but I roll the dice I'll be awfully would but it is really bad already know I've never had it but the people that I know that have had it say it's really bad but do you know if you could just bring a steripen yeah but you can always stop huh yeah I'm in a race I wouldn't want to the situation is since the track is the race is on an indoor track 400 like I think 42 and some odd meters I was doing a lot of my big long runs on 400-meter track when I did that I would just bring out like a cooler I don't have ice and water in there that makes sense I do some of that to ya historically have done a lot more flat runnable stuff but now that I'm out in Phoenix I like to try to split the year into two halves and do some trail stuff and half the year and some look flatter Rogue or crack or runnable stuff in the second half the year you bring water when you run Trails do you bring a backpack or something like that like one of those you know what it was back yeah but the tubes the f*** is that camel camel camel backs and you can pack a lot of water usually unless I unless I'm going to be away from a potential stop long enough usual Do Is All I'll use the pack will have a smaller little like little flasks off blacks in there nice without like you got to know how much does SIP yeah you know where it where the pickup spots are from or run with friends with my dog in the summer when it gets really hot I bring a Hydro Flask in a backpack in a mug collapsible dog bowls cuz you know I don't want him drinking out of Puddles and right so but that just having that extra couple pounds on your back it did makes a difference you can feel it yeah yeah go as minimal as I can with water if I if I can get away with it obviously if I go out and do like a big loop where there's no potential stops I'm going to have to carry it all from the beginning but if it's a spot where I know like I can get to water every 5 6 7 miles then I'll pack a little lighter and not be caring as much at any one given time to hydrate up before you go yeah I kind of need to be hydrating like between sessions cuz what I use you found out as I could go out in Canada collect hydration for anyone given Lacroix Noir workout but if I did that then the next one I pay for it so for me than big motivation to make sure I'm on top of hydration during any given run is cuz I know like if I don't then the next one is going to potentially be miserable it's amazing how just normal everyday life like you could feel like a little run-down you barely notice it but once you start physically exerting want to start raining when she start doing something hard that's when you become like really in tune with what how you're screwing your body up like drinking for instance like have a couple of drinks and then run like oh God you like well this is what it's doing to my body I got to stop drinking I like drinking a thirst that use you with my gauges and I haven't really had any issues with it with that with that so I'm going to run 25 miles today let me drink x amount of liters of water before I go out know before the Run yeah I know I try not to like do too much like kind of like preemptive hydrating because I think that what you went with people often times didn't do that as they drink too much and then that comes out of the expense of your electrolytes to cause your body to Industry so if I'm if I find myself could you just supplement you can yeah I'll do a lot more that question the heat to just in general is like having a like electrolyte supplementation and things like what do you use for I use a product called Hydro ax mostly with your water by so if I'm running and I have like one bottle with some in it already little like this big deal to do that and ivory felon want to put more and I can just going to take him all pop it often and for that in a lot of other people will use you can make like a little caps that you just swallow with your water and it's got like the formulation of the different electrolytes in their kind of dialed in and you know that's so I think that's a little more hit or miss I still like big where people feel you need that some people tell you don't really need looks like that all just need to sell your food and things like that all the way to you taking X number of these every hour you take getting blood tests and finding out what your levels are pre and post-workout or anything along those lines yeah I haven't done any like post-workout tests they were looking at some of that stuff too and like any time I've ever had a blood test done nobody like my my electrolytes of my sodium potassium levels always been in range so I carbon high fat athletes and I think they were looking at some of that stuff too and like any time I've ever had a blood test done nobody like my my electrolytes on my sodium potassium levels always been in range so I haven't really tried to eat one of those things then where it's like I'm probably not going to try to fix something that's not broken</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> did you ever think about doing something like Fugett Revelations post-training do the things that I always have after like really good hard workouts first of all I'm always feel filled with gratitude and I'm always like really thankful we have a long hard workouts and I thought about doing this thing called the Gratitude Series where I do a podcast like immediately after like really hard work out nice and just talk about my feelings and let me know corny and it's been self-indulgence but realistically I think there was some lessons that I learned off of really hard workouts you know where is like at the end of it you know when it's all done first of all there's always this feeling like 8 out of 10 times I don't want to work out really 8 out of 10 just shot that part of your brain up and just start moving and then once you start moving you start breaking a sweat when start breaking a sweat becomes easier it starts feeling good days start getting some satisfaction I almost didn't do this today here I am doing it and you know and sometimes it's f****** you know sometimes I'm looking at a 3-mile run which is nothing for you but a mile in my f*** two more to go Jesus Christ I didn't know when I get back to the car and I'm saying hi to people hey what's up how you doing playing in the neighbors dogs exhausted I'm happy everybody's pumped you know it's like and I feel good I feel warm I feel friendly I feel loving I feel you don't want to call people and tell him I care about him it's like it's like there's a moments like post-workout in particular where you just feel really good and I think life is sometimes about getting over those periods of kind of shity or low energy your lethargic or unrested where the f*** it is and just pushing through that because you know the territory you've been there before and then developing a habit of being able to do that being able to know and have faith in the process and understand that this is yeah I know you don't want to do is shut the f****** and go sing like I get that from a lot of different workouts but the one that I really love is like when I get closer to a race and I'd like what I saying before you start dialing things and be more specific to the to the activity you're trying to prepare for I'll do a phase of training where I'm running kind of in an area of about like a hundred 5255 beats per minute so I can go like it's just fast enough where I feel like I'm really kind of like working but it's also slowing if I can go for quite a while so I can like a really big run and when I was training last race job that at at the Pettit Center I had a training cycle where I hit I had a 4-week block where I had one dealer we go to the face a reduction in volume and intensity and three buildings called DLow Dlow. Because I like reducing volume or build up once I like a hundred thirty mile weeks and weeks and they were just like basically loaded with like kind of just faster than or right about kind of hundred-mile intensity so you do in it you can maybe pull it up I think I have a picture on my Instagram page of the I did these key workouts where I go to a track and I would just do loops around the track and it be like anywhere between 27 de like 32 miles at that kind of intensity and you just getting to like a flow in a rhythm and it just want to kind of get moving it feels great and afterwards you feel great a whole rest of the day and you just want to go and do it again you almost have to be careful not to not to do too much head Saucony go back to were talking about the beginning like when I structural plan ideally I start out I started with a good bass a good aerobic base which I typically kind of retain almost year-round I'll take like offseason but I like to follow principal where I'll let myself and lose some of that Peak Fitness just so it's sustainable cuz staying at your Peak Fitness levels not sustainable so I let myself get like just out of shape enough so that I'm not always at that level and then I start kind of building into the structure toward is it selfish start to the shorter faster interval since they're further away and I get closer and closer to the race where I'm doing things that are more specific so like the next step would be I be doing some longer intervals or kind of like what you consider like an anaerobic threshold type workout which generally speaking is about like your max intensity if you did like a 60-minute all time trial and then you know that's still not specific to a hundred miles to them out there for 11 hours so I'm I'm kind of still moving closer to that slower race pace and it's just follow the principle of hitting all the systems of training like you would in any other periodized endurance plan but always keeping that Compass of the stuff you do for the other than Tessie on the race itself is the type of work you should be doing closest to it so you're really does optimizing when you're closer to the race itself how do you know what your Peak Fitness is like when you say that you want to you can't really maintain the Peak Fitness you want to back off a little bit so that you can just your training running how do you know where that is and how do you know that you can expand that and then ya know it's a great question it's somewhat subjective to I mean you can analyze things if you want to go into like heart rate variability type things but that's a little more on the micro level for me personally like usually I'll get to a point where I like I'll do a race and that you know you can just kind of towel like I'm exhausted from then and I like to think of it kind of two folded we're like physical recovery in mental recovery so if I The Big Race and afterwards like I can't even like bring myself to think of another big training black I know I'm I need to like let myself kind of get a little bit out of that Fitness state that Peak Fitness State and just kind of reset or hit the reset button prepared for this 100 mile race and you know you're going to have to run for 11 plus hours with a long day for you yes of the longest run I did for this particular was three and a half hours it was I think 32 miles or something somewhere in that neighborhood I usually don't push up much past five hours in my own training if I'm going to do much more than that I'll just jump in a race like the nice thing about phoenixes there's a erase company called everybody and they put on like 30-some Ultra pants every year so it's wow you can basically every weekend pretty much yeah the guy who rejected Jamil he let me jump in events when I want to and so sometimes all if I'm going to do something like say I want a 400 Mile and I want to get a really long day like a 7/8 hours session in you know I'll just pick like a like a hundred k type of vent or like you know if you just do that at like I like to say like keep yourself at like maybe 80% of what you're capable of and get that good long stimulus but not initially beat yourself up so much that it takes away from the race you're preparing for 50 miles would take you or how long will it take you on the course like I just did a 50-mile are actually about a week and a half ago all the JFK 50-miler that took me five hours and 42 minutes and that course is kind of its got you go over the Appalachian Mountains for 60 miles and you get on a really flat tow path for about a marathon and then some rolling Street so that's not as fast as you can find you can find any you can go on a track how much elevation is going up and down that one was about three thousand feet so it is but you know there's a lot of interests are so 3050 is actually considered a relatively flat bass course the Flagstaff and a group of Marathon guys are trained up there and they I got a lot of inspiration from from two of them specifically for this last reset the depression at the Pettit Center in one guy's name is Jim Walmsley and he's for my money probably the best ultra-marathoner we had certainly in North America is not the world I mean he got the course record at the western states 100 which is the most tested hundred miles are in North America he's got the course record at the Lake Sonoma 50 mile by approving March the two fastest times but the next closest person is like 18 minutes behind or something like that and then he's also got the course record at JFK 50 mile the one I just was mentioned before and these three events are three of the most tested courses that we've had and he's got the course record at all of them and he can probably go faster training Partners Jared Hazen so if Jim is the best Ultra Runner North America has from the male side Jared Hazen is by far the most underrated so this guy here in the western states 100 this year gym finished first Jared finished second Gym broke his course record by running 14 hours and 9 Minutes on a course that has 17,000 feet of climbing 23000 feet of descent with that much yet in 14 hours and running course the most part 2 like there's crazy ones I get way worse than from a climbing descendants 10 and 14 and 1/2 hours this last next year he broke his first record with the 1409 Jerry came in second and I think it was 1423 or 26 just behind Jim busy pushing them all day so any other time Jared would have won that race except for that year and it would have been like funeral a huge story for him and you know it just amazing performance in those two guys just watching kind of their training and then their performances Subs out there prune pacing my wife was a huge motivator for me when I kind of got into the training build up for that rates at the pennant Center so itsfunneh with ultra marathoning cuz you have such a variety I think we talked about this a

		<div class="paragraph"> what people do what I got to do to stay alive yes that's just so fortunate we don't have to do that you didn't go to Crossroads and have a nice vegan real feel you want so you're not really worried about staying alive anymore will worried about a primarily about yeah but you know and these people this is what I've really gotten into after Christ was on the podcast recently debunking the game changers news talking about the positive net benefits of regenerative farming I don't think that's clearly been established worldwide or in end in large-scale like in terms of and maybe can be like can we do it I feed yeah yeah can we feed the entire country on that yeah you know I think that's how are we going to feed they're predicting like in X number of years and I think it's interesting and it's certainly worth thinking about but like it's also like well how far do we keep taking that ball down the road before we find ourselves in a situation where like you know then what's the next question 15 billion 20 billion and so on and so forth and eventually like you know we just over populate the world in it and really badly for us overpopulation I think the real key for us I think is going to be in I think this is within our lifetime is going to be lab-created meat and I think they're really close to doing that and I think if you have some sort of ethical lab-created nutritious meat where you don't have to worry about suffering or death if this has been established then we open up a whole new Avenue of exploration cuz now you can say okay all these people that are vegan for this moral and ethical sort of stay high with animal agriculture killing animals suffering let's take all that out now you can eat lab-created meat that has absolutely no suffering attached to it let's find out how healthy things really are and then what's going on how many people stay vegan and how many people revert to more omnivorous diet which means there's this is something that vegans hate to hear but it is a fact 84% of people start a vegan diet quit now is that because of taste is that because of any of those of the argument that will people that do it all concrete of time you get a higher retention rate that's fine but 84% still is the number it doesn't matter if you get a high retention rate for people that have doing it more than two years and more than three years give you stick with it you can do it another just more committed but the reality is 84% quit this is what's been firmly established what what would the number be if there was ethical Humane lab created me that I'd no suffering attached to it at all just science-based made with compounds and you know whatever they use to create the stuff that would be interesting and be interesting to find out could we eliminate large-scale animal agriculture in favor of lab-created meat and what is any environmental factors would there be that would be negative that were attached to lab created because he got to think whatever you making anything right industrial large-scale you're going to have waste what is that waste cannot waste be mitigated can they figure out some sort of way to have some sort of net pause back for that waste is utilized in some sort of form where it's it actually can contribute to the natural processes of no soil regeneration and manure and Binoo composting and things on those ones ya no I think it's I think it's interesting and weird and interesting time for sure it'll be interesting to see where they get with with that it tribute to the natural processes of you know soil regeneration and manure and Binoo composting and things on those lines yeah no I think it's I think it's interesting and weird and interesting time for sure it'll be interesting to see where they get with with that it</div>

We don't know no medical test you know you're the Foreigner I Want To Know like I'll never get to play with headlights or else like you to care hope you never fight with head but never comes while I mean remember the old days said you would hold out of their biceps about you and punch you in the face with a very dangerous attack a giant dude like that very effective mean why can't I use my head to hit you right if you can kick me in the head it what is was so much more dangerous about me using my forehead to hit you with long-term long-term repercussion I don't know would it increase the level of concussions or decrease the level of concussion too good for me that's the major syniverse port the concussion the concussions we have to take that away if we can take that away I think will be better because it's healthier long-term I'm hoping that medical science somehow steps in and comes up with a solution that's legitimate similar to solutions for repairing ligaments right like if you have we're not going to Outlaw heel hooks right there their they're legitimate part of game but if you get someone in inverted heel hook and you crank on that f***** you might rip that guy's knee apart so that guy might have to go and get everything replaced and get you know cadaver ligaments in the fake ACL and all that jazz. That though it's a legitimate side kick to the knee that we see a lot of guys to use on the upper thigh with it a hyper-extended this going to be someone get their knee blown out I'm sure it's happened in other organizations I don't think we've had in the UFC they have I haven't heard about not only heard it but I don't know yet if it blew out and then he went and did it right away and also to Darren till Wonderboy repair brain damage repair ligament damage be so happy and I'll need some Philly IV stem cell some some way let me know they're experimenting with things and I know they're having some positive effects but you know nothing is like hey you tore this go to the doctor he'll fix that you know we're not there yet cuz I thing is like with it with the headlights the fighters are going to go in train headbutts after going to be hitting the bag and be doing those things going to do to their head what does he does Pat's in combination with pads and a head but I don't know.

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> use one of your Expressions all the time the touch of death and there is no better example than what we saw Saturday night with Deontay Wilder Jesus Christ in that guy punch I had a losing all their own yeah me too and I thought one of us could go either way but I had at 6 to none and that right hand my God so crazy it doesn't make sense when you look like kind of like let him not even know usually here feel powerful puncher you could days a guy that put them out the way he did ya end up to 41 Knockouts one Decision One draw two credible undefeated 41 Knockouts in 42 fights mean that is Bonkers and he was getting a box like the best boxer care to box yet he knows it's such a crazy strategy because out of anyone that is ever fought in the heavyweight division he is the one guy that literally can shut everyone's lights out with one shot everyone's a knockout artist Frazier Tyson of course was a knockout but not like this guy another level of craziness I would agree I mean he knows himself so beautiful if you was less strategic you would have started fighting really early and maybe stop. Power he has but he knows he knows exactly didn't care he lost six rounds and then we had no qualms about it and he got hurt just before just before you knocked out Lewis he was hurt and he said, he's like oh now you're going to come for it and I are going to walk into the right and thank incredible and the first part was very similar in that the first few rounds was very little let it start to pick up and then Ortiz start to fade parties put it on him in that first fight if you watch that first fight like wow this is a crazy rematch for him to take but in this fight he just fought a perfect strategy just waiting and people on Twitter reading people just did you not see what happened you say can't block he's undefeated he's a f****** heavyweight champion of the world he has Muhammad Ali for the most title defenses ever we can talk in fact he's a professional boxer go in there with him then who is it if I placed you are providing for the you would be like if I you turn white and Faith the when he punches is so strange it's so strange and you know when he fought Tyson Fury he told me weigh 209 pounds hand of cards that guy's got four aces and he put some right in your face he understands what he's good at and he fights that way just brilliant students fighting is two things it's one is level you got to get to a certain level and then the second thing you have to figure out your style like you have to know everything about what you do like for instance if you look at Ali and Tyson default totally differently to equally in my opinion like okay we could split Harrison to who that would be very competitive whoever you think would win in a fight it would be very competitive Ali fights the total opposite of Tyson at least circles supposedly the wrong way if you look in the book of boxing until you don't Circle to where's the power side he doesn't care and his style it makes sense he's up on his toes he's driving he rarely ever throws a body shot he throws its own a handful of body shops in his entire career where is Tyson is towards it emerges forward he has that peekaboo style yes. glove tied up to his chin and a totally different style if Tyson tried to fight like a leech he would lose you know better at the same level that they figure it out hey what am I good at what what advantages do I have physically what this is matches do I physically and that's what I want when you have to figure out your style and I feel that's where most spiders fall apart they never forgot they're still there trying to do with some trainer told him to try to do with the guy they are the most admiring the rings does Dan ever find out exactly how they what's best for them good point because it's such a creative art form in that way and I I do believe that martial arts are an art form I really do because to me it's so beautiful like even that right hand that Deonte landed that to me was gorgeous there's never been a prettier sunset or more beautiful mountain just black spray that the way you see the spray the sweat come off his head and then Ortiz crumbled away like this chest up like a motherfuker he dropped them off right away like you know he was calling me when he walked up to you he knows it's a creative Endeavor you're you're trying to figure out how to land shots and you're also trying to disguise what your ideas are what your tactics are and you got to figure out what sports best for your body type and that's so open-ended martial arts are so it's so open-ended once the referee says fight there's all this creativity involved and that's something that I think a lot of people don't really appreciate a hundred percent sometimes have a trainer kill that creativity because he tells you look this is how you fight right and if you go outside of that mold none are you reprimanded so meet me of a fighter wants to drop his head should you drop your hands in a fiber should you hold them up all depends on you or if you got incredible eyes and you see shots coming from a mile away in your room Hold Your Hand mm or 100% then keep doing it but you got out that's why laughing sparring so important as when we Spar we actually try it now we tested we're testing hey does this airplanes fly or is it going to crash and burn while we better test it in the gym before we take it out in the arena and find out it doesn't fly and I was stuck if you're if you're fighting with your hands down show me in practice that you're successful then I won't I won't say anything I'm fine. It doesn't fly and I was still guys look if you have if you're fighting with your hands down show me in practice that you're successful then I won't I won't say anything negative I won't say I won't change. I'll let it be but first you have to see that you're successful because there is one thing but then when you get in there and try to get ahold of it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Deontay Wilder won this weekend so I don't know but the way he's winning it's got to be got to be something special this tournament that's right cuz we have are we a week or so away from the rematch between Andy Ruiz and Anthony Joshua that's got to be coming up soon Joshua look so good in training and Andy Ruiz man you can't judge that guy on his belly you don't know nothing if you think that's what it is you think that's was fighting in his hands or spectacular the fluidity 15 * after I paint a middleweight chance and he's so fast and he's such a like a sweet unassuming guy like he wins the titling like f*** yeah happy for him but you think of him and this is from people that really know what's going on this is a can't give specifics apparently Josh will get knocked out in training I really has like a couple weeks out like that and that's one of the reasons why they say his father was so furious at the promoter after Ruiz knocked him out and it's also why the reason I said that he had some sort of a panic attack in the locker room leading up to the fight so if he was compromising annuities compromise and you know as well as anybody there certain knock out so you can get in the gym that can f*** a fighter up for months. Yeah yeah I've seen it in the practice room I don't like rough training I don't like rough training like certain Fighters were coming up to a fight I'll let it go further I get it we need intensities but I don't like to go in the gym and see this guy knocked out this guy then this guy this guy that there's nobody there the next week so if I had a real Champion any sparring and I felt one of his sparring partners was out of control I would have to have a talk with him not using anymore like when George when George sparse all his rounds but they have to be have to be reasonable round not not and I mean not touch boring but not also being malicious and try not to injure each other but George told me that you told certain guys to try to knock them out so I put it on him Tinder everybody swiping right for you you're the one I got from them up because they're too too much you know what I mean if you're trying to like you sneeze when you know like if I see you're trying to be rough overly Rock is in control and then I put in a fresh guy that first gas have some control is what what is your just tired though I know he's fatigues excetera so I mean balance there's too little too much so if you get knocked out of practice before title fight it could be an accidental but it could also be negligent so I guess we're just too rough cuz I'm going boxing gyms in this like killer be killed inside the gym because there's I'm not just once a week but twice three times a week and they're going like it can cost them I taken cost on Tuesday and Spar again on Thursday and that's very very common. Solute and there's no regulation no one's stopping you from sparring if you got head kick tomorrow no one stopping you from showing up on Saturday and put your mouthpiece in and going into class just it's nutts it's not safe it can cost them I taken cost on Tuesday and Spar again on Thursday and that's very very common. Suitland is no regulation no one's stopping you from sparring if you got head kick tomorrow no one's stopping you from showing up on Saturday and put your mouthpiece and going into class just it's nuts it's not safe</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> listen man Kevin Lee come out to you worked out thank you by the way he set us up together like a little bit lost and trying to figure out is why you need a head coach I'm like who fights like you George St-Pierre I mean but it's George fights like that with wrestling and great striking and submissions you mix it all up he's unpredictable when is it taxed like is a very similar there neither one of them are particularly long both guys are very physically strong I might come on man I guess this is the guy he has a great training team already he doesn't have somebody kind of put it all together gas and you know what you were talking about Styles and he's a bit of a like his personality is a walk yet like he's so you know that I'm like calculated I'm a scalpel a blind little bit of discipline little bit of time and place for discipline your very very very mother so very much and he was very disciplined yes he didn't Veer off the game plan at all and he got the job timer that kills I can also told them all that s*** that he does he's getting moving up to the cage is dancing around going crazy with my Bandit hat come out like a f****** Samurai man you got in serious work to do now that stuff is complicated on your mind cuz then you have to think all will all I did if I lose right now I'm going to look stupid with all that dancing and and it just all this pretending that you're not feeling the the feeling that you're feeling right now you're feeling this incredible moment cuz you six months of preparation getting ready for this one moment here it is and bracelet that is gozen man being be empty play Focus for this one you can tell yes I was really hard because I like guys will come in the gym in the work they don't skip practice and like if I'm not in today for whatever reason I think you should be in but you don't want to come in what can I do but he was very disciplined he came to all the practices and it worked out beautifully I can see now little Moses Kevin Lee 2727 what's a birthday September okay sweet just turned 27 yeah it's f****** not even in his prime you know and he's also experienced failure and endurance fights we didn't live up to his potential and I think that ultimately will be a motivating force because we see what he can do when he's really focused that Gregor Gillespie is a dangerous spectacular don't understand how good Gregor Gillespie is that kid is a Savage and so when I found out that Kevin was going to fight Gregor in his fight back to 155 a good comeback fight dangerous, a very high risk and also getting down to 155 what did you guys do differently to get them down to 155 easily this time to put our heads together and his trainer is really great fantastic amazing I mean I love working with him brilliant guy his brother Keith what kind of like together we like look we got to keep losing weight at this rate no matter what it takes and if you if you protest like you know if you wants to buy Keys up will listen to about you he's got he's got to bite the bullet at one point we can't go fall behind this rate of losing weight to lose a pound an hour every hour have to lose 1 pound and pound in our you talking about for the week cutting weight cut Yahweh tribal what is he coming in Monday morning what is he waiting in your phone so a little smaller but healthy didn't look sucked in he didn't look like he depleted himself did you do anything different in terms of like weight lifting or running extra running I wouldn't lift weights if I was him I got to want it to last a weights cuz he's not really like I I like I like bulking and then cutting I don't like cutting cutting cutting nobody came to me was six weeks before so we were in face like I don't want to bulk up because in 6 weeks account bulk and then cut he's already very naturally muscular is very naturally strong naturally already so I don't doing Road Work World work not too much part of metric not like a little bit but I don't want to put any size on it because he's got enough size so first thing is evaluation does he need muscle know he's plenty of muscle plenty of power we need to we need to create endurance and disciplining him think we'll make it the big difference and some technical issues and we cut the 24 hours before he was 174 174 so 20 lb do we hydration process I was with him the whole time do I wake up at Friday morning Friday morning I play right now is my great okay so so in the morning it was 164 in the morning to go 5 in the morning he was 163 that's when we start so I let him sleep for a couple hours for hours for hours sleep wake up so you woke him up at 5 yeah the day of the way into the day of the wind wow wake up wake up wake up by the makeweight at 10 he was 155 oh wow so he went through from 5 a.m. all the way to 10 yes and what is he doing during that time by bath towels let him sweat in the towels and then no Sana no no sign up for this one how come some guys

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Matthew this might experiment imagine you have no martial arts training none take everything you learned throw it away take away all your physical training you walk into a room full of people how you feel psychologically their unskilled to deal with a situation that might occur that occur any moment yeah it's it's such a gift to train a like I train all my students might make it by 6 my kids is mandatory training to a certain level is mandatory it's like mathematics is mandatory to a certain level of high school not illegal now remember I'm not sure I think it is now but it's like you need a certain level of education and I'm not sure enough high schools it like what's a elementary school elementary school I'm not sure double check but I am pretty sure it's illegal now at this point I think that would stop a lot of bullying and I've said this before but I think it's counterintuitive to people that think that bullying is a mean person and if you taught him how to fight they become meaner but that's I don't think that's the case I think believe you are cure if you took away that and they got to really establish through training that they have character and if they're worth something and they don't have to be insecure and if they did they build up his confidence you wouldn't going out and then picking on people and had so many parents tell me I do recognize my son when he's with you he's so disciplined any so kind of soft-spoken is I got homies an animal he's he's like he he acts up he's like really won't hear if you did that will be a problem you know like make people respect the dojo they respect the environment because there are other guys out there that put you in line I remember one time was an airplane and a guy punched the back of my seat I swear to God I lean back he had a laptop on his tray when I lean back a crush is a laptop that I don't know the guy has a laptop but I'm allowed to leave my seat back in the pool I don't never talk like that somebody never why because you learned through martial arts you know you like respect everyone respect is huge one day you're the the hunted went the other day with a hunter and it's just like the the way life works you know like have respect why should like this guidance to getting a fight now we know what violence is it I would have been nice to him about it because we know the realities of violence like some people don't know the realities Apartments I got two new people like on video that like they're in a certain situation and act all crazy 8 this might spark some violent event here like you don't want this you don't know what finances you seen it on TV scene in the movie you think what you think you know what it is to be punched and kicked if you know what it was I come as I see people starting a fight on Micah's person has no idea what they're talking about like they've never been in a fight to instigating a fight a flight medic renew my regret it like they don't know what it is to be hit to be attacked to be to be in a fight so like I just find a friend always like jaw-dropping when somebody's going to instigate a fight over something so small and they don't even know how to find which is even crazier so bad yeah you could hit old lady soon pull your chair back I told him off let me know when an airplane to cycle mouth like mad and yell or anything but I told him off as I told me to really know I told my think of that guy shut his mouth but it's like to do you want to fight over this laptop like seriously like that no one can possibly know that you have a laptop open Palm someone's chair the last thing I want to do is fight when was the last time you saw fight at the gym never maybe casely some guys get mad if some guy doesn't like I was nothing but a bar Jesus Christ and I think most people don't think most people are scared of it and I think that's why they posture that's where the Pumpkin Fest up that's why they pretend but

		<div class="paragraph"> Thompson's and Axle example that he fight so well with his hands down and he is to me that consummate karate style fighter that is made the perfect transition to MMA because he fights so well with his hands down you don't know where stuff coming you don't know whether it's coming up with her it's coming around with her going straight at you and that you don't see it until you're looking at his body and these things are coming up from his hands being down like this any standing sideways you can take him to the wrong. let's say he was really young and he was forbidden that style cuz I'm trying to do that they forbid a certain type of maneuver or or or style out altogether like in the 70s most trainers would not train a right-handed or left-handed boxer this with your amount of time that you got to be right but that's a that's a day extra men to the fighter because your trainer is limited in what he only understands fight one way and I'm going to limit my fighter it it's it's it's totally wrong in my opinion what do you think about fighters who say that even if you're right-handed person there's an advantage to fighting as a southpaw because you have your most Dexter's hand-to-hand that you've done with the most control of is your lead hand and you're also fighting in this unusual stance that is only like what is southpaws like maybe two out of ten people something like that right here in the West I think you know the the wheel of the cars on the other side and there's a stick shift I don't think a left-handed World almost a lot of things are the other way around ya like the driving to the side of the road of the the drivers on the other side of the car so I don't know maybe it's maybe it affects the way you develop but I agree like I think I was still Fighters try both sides and see which one you like better I can't tell you which one you're more comfortable with maybe one of your eyes is a stronger so yeah you never know until you test so I like to let the guys figure it out so what's up people tell me do I grab it like this or like that in some instances there's a right way and a wrong way for as far as we know one way is right when was wrong and some as it doesn't make a difference I apologize grab like you're comfortable cuz I do it the way I like to do it I don't do it with my trainer told me so in this particular instance I say the question of comfort like it will freak out if you have a few more like this with your thumb I don't in some instances I grabbed the camera with my thumb in some instances I don't show people both innocent look that Parts up to you you certainly can finish it with by using the thumb and some of his and some instances cuz you're better than controller clamping down on you actually isolating it get me some people are just ridiculous grip with their hands to play a factor in there as well do you remember semmy schilt yeah so he shall that hands are as big as his table and he grabbed ahold of guys wrists and they think just f***** like if you were in his guard he just grabbed your wrist Rochelle that hands are as big as table he grabbed ahold of guys wrists and they just f***** like if you were in his guard he just grabbed your wrist like yeah he did that with fedoras like</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I'll tell you I think I have a couple things come up and just kind of run what you're what you're saying in this is kind of my perspective on it when you know what we talked about hey when you go in somewhere you've got to know what the in-state as you got to know what your you know where you're going and when you're going to leave I have an extra crunchy what's really hard about that is we don't necessarily know and War sewing predict unpredictable that you may you know there's there's a chance you wouldn't kill konafi and all the time benevolent person steps up and all the sudden you've got this flourishing democracy okay with a Chance of that no very small but you don't know that it's going to go into this completely failed State you have high hopes maybe your Intel people are saying you this it's like when we when we did the Bay of Pigs all the Cubans in America will like you up as soon as you guys at the beaches all the Cubans R&amp;B on our side which means you got to have once again like the open mind to say oh this isn't going the way we thought it was going to go how we doing with just right now to prevent this from getting worse which means what you really have to do is prior to intervening in other countries you have to assess what sacrifices you are willing to make to to get the result that is positive and you and it's talk about if you're going to go to war you got to have will and that will comes in two forms number one is a will to kill because when you go to war you are going to be killing people you can be killing the enemy and you can be killing civilians. That's not what we're trying to do and believe me the US military goes through Great Lengths to prevent that from happening but it is going to happen in war so you have to be willing to kill you have to be willing to happen happen and you have to be willing to die because when you go to war there's going to be American Kids not going to come home until you have to have those two wheels that's before you go in so you can look at intake while you know we can go in a movie with music and probably it'll turn out okay so we don't have to worry about what the sacrifices going to be another thing to think about when we went to war we went to World War II World War 1 those kids 18 years old 17 years old those kids went to war until the war was over they what they went on like now you know in the in the Navy in the Marine Corp 267 month deployment in the Army sometimes it's a 14 month appointment and then they're going to rotate back to the states in World War II war you'll be home when it's over so five years for years if that was our attitude going to work this is so important to us that Johnny is going to get on a ship and he's going to sail to the Pacific and if he comes home and could have been 3 or 4 years 5 years when we start looking at going into other countries me to start thinking okay what level of commitment do we really have to make this successful and like even when I look at Iraq know I was in Iraq apartment rack promo granular perspective being on the Ground Battle of ramadi 2006 the citizens of ramadi the normal citizens and it was like we were we were angels to go there and help them rid of these heinous Al-Qaeda insurgence which eventually came became Isis unfortunately you know we kind of we we did a great job ramadi was the model of counterinsurgency for about seven years and it was less violent than many cities in America and I had great pride and at least understood the sacrifices my friend that will kill my present never came home my friends get to have kids right they did all that they gave all that and I was able to look around so you know what these folks in this foreign country they're going to have an opportunity for freedom and unfortunately because of politics and whatever we said okay know what we're not staying there when we leave as soon as we left everybody they've been on the ground in Iraq was like this is probably not a good idea to but you don't we leave a couple brigades worth of men then oh it will probably be able to handle any problems with that happen while we didn't we left completely and and those those insurgents that were there they were looking to Amber's and they started to they started to get fired up again and then the next thing you know you had I sent by the way Isis March back into rahmati and they know the reports we got from people on the ground that we knew was that Isis came in and anyone that had worked with Coalition forces and maybe level they would murder the whole about 500 families that were completely murdered so when we talk about these things we have to be very sure about what we're going to do we have to recognize that we can't predict everything cuz we can't I don't care how good you aren't care how many analysis you put on something when you start throwing human nature into a leadership vacuum how many of our brothers and sisters in uniform are we willing to sacrifice to make this happen and how does it help our national security I believe right now had we stayed there a pretty strong positive place right now if we had kind of completed the mission the way that we should have again when we go back and say okay what what what what countries is it worth going into you where we going to go with how do we draw that line how do we make that decision for me this is this is what we do as Leaders what we do as Leaders we look at a situation and and sometimes obligation to go somewhere if there's a genocide happening if there's another Rwanda happening where 800,000 tootsies are killed in hundred days with machetes if that's what I have a moral obligation to try and do something out that hey that's a decision 4100 Americans that are going in there trying to shut this thing down but that's what that's the type of thing we need to think about and that's why as a leader you want to have an open mind you want to have your ego completely out of it because it's really do think that's what we do with this is going to win treasure to try and get that play stabilized we've done a decent job we are almost there and we left early and now all the sudden look around and go but that's why these things are important to to think about thoroughly as hell she said before you go we don't know what's going to happen and if you're going to get in a street fight Joe like you look as capable as you are as capable as I am at street fighting that's great there is that 10% chance that that guy pulls out a knife that 10% chance but that guy pulls out of Nike and sticks in your neck are you willing to sacrifice that now if the guys doing something to an innocent person and you go you know what I got to take that risk right now I'm going to go in the morning to get this handled those are hard decisions to make</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> people using these debates knowing that they're going to get the sound bites and knowing that end and you can see some of them work like yours of Kamala Harris and some of them don't like when she was attacking Elizabeth Warren for not wanted Trump to get kicked off a Twitter like you read is Twitter that's fantastic if you're on Team America you want that guy to keep tweeting you know what's going on no one there's no comedians that have that skill doesn't care what people say about him basically and no one's really had to contend with that until now do you watch the original Republican debates when he was running for president and he starts attacking these guys you see them all the nicknames bathroom soap and all your all hanging out in there together during the commercial breaks yeah but did you say anything to your contact with her know. Maybe every now and then but I honestly like yeah I'm probably not on the top of her friends list Battleship and then Clinton family and there she is the hero to many people of the democratic party and you two are scrapping Democratic National Committee had to remain neutral in the presidential election which it was my plan to do so I really made the decision to resign from that seat so that I could endorse Bernie Sanders largely be corrected largely because of his difference with Hillary Clinton foreign policy you know Hillary Clinton had you know very much of an interventionist it in my opinion the Warhawk regime-change War policy that she had shown throughout her time both in the administration as well as US senator and Bernie Sanders you know any other ways he's more of a non-interventionist I saw that in those debates at that time the conversations that were in the media was not bringing up this difference between the two of them so that voters can make an informed choice of who they want their commander-in-chief to be which to me just as you know as a soldier as a veteran does American like how can you not be putting this issue at the Forefront so I resigned from that position endorse Bernie Sanders start going out and just talking about raising these issues on the campaign Trail but I remember one of the first interviews that I did on MSNBC the host of the show saying aren't you afraid of what the clintons will do to you said this on live television and interesting to see the reaction like the days after when I first went back to DC after I made that announcement of endorsement and friends of mine you know politicians in Washington they were fantasy like go with god sister with Joe Biden well there's there's I mean the people who are saying hey look you know there are lists that are kept in your political career will be over that was really the message that I got from from people's been around the block a few times I am the most recent thing that that came up with what Hillary Clinton said about me is is not it's not it a spat between two people it really just shows the the complete difference and the conflict in our foreign policy views of of the what I called the Clinton doctrine of interventionism regime-change wars and and warmongering versus what I'm putting forward which is let's stop the regime-change War World Police policies worked in this new Cold War in arms race put the interests of the American people first always ensuring that we have a strong and capable ready military to defend our nation and our people and honoring that service and sacrifice that that our troops get by only sending them on missions worthy of their sacrifice maximizing diplomacy engagement with other countries in the world through cooperation rather than conflict and always seeing War as a last resort so that conflict that you're seeing in the media that's been playing out and again why you're seeing so much of the corporate media and the political machine attacking me is because of this difference is because of this change in foreign policy and bring it out because when it comes right down to it you know whether you're going back to back to the cold back to Vietnam War back to Iraq war overthrowing Saddam Hussein Libya Gaddafi the media is always kind of been this cheerleading voice for these wars to happen sending a very clear narrative out to the American people and and it comes down to it's good business for them good rating what she said to you or about you other than she said that you are Russian asset that was that was the insinuation right yeah what was the base of that and how to that's weird right how does someone who is running for president and it is one of the most prominent politicians in our country how do they get away with something something something that's such a huge accusation with no information to back it up it would be a good question for a normal person but when you look at the power of the Clinton machine when you look at the power of medical establishment which is made up of people who are either you know part of the the Clinton so-called family or who are part of this political establishment that is built on the same Foundation that that she Hillary Clinton laid when you look at the media establishment have been pushing a lot of the same narrative lot of the same message then you can see how somebody gets away with calling a sitting member of Congress for president soldier actively serving Army National Guard veteran of two Middle East deployments basically a traitor to the country that I love and that I'm willing to lay my life down for and get away with it without any evidence or base whatsoever. But no push-back know that was the most bizarre thing on what do you mean by that sing The Rush is behind her to try to to do something against Bernie or Elizabeth Warren or whatever the consensus pick is like what are you saying there was no no questions like that there were no questions like that and and look even if there were waiting or unwitting so she's basically they're saying that I'm a traitor to my nation or that I am an unwitting asset which means basically you are too stupid and too naive to know that you're being used to further the interests of a Nation other than our own both of which are are deeply deeply offencive and again without any base and I think that that's the like this is bigger this is this is really not about me that the danger here of what she did and how the media responded and how almost every single other candidate for president refused to comment refuse to denounce she said Bernadette Bernie is an exception Marianne Williamson Andrew Yang couple of them had the courage to say hey look this is ridiculous the fact that that was that was the response is really it has a chilling effect on our freedom of speech in this country and it sends a message that whether Tulsi gabbard or any other American or any other veteran who dares to stand up and challenge establishment challenge this foreign policy narrative call for peace call for an end to these senseless unnecessary regime-change Wars then you two can be smeared your character can be smeared did you ever think you could reach a Tipping Point where this happens not this kind of thing happens where you just say alright I'm done with the Democratic party after what they did to Bernie in 2016 right that I'm sure that had to be a dick for a lot of people that said wait a second this is the guy we wanted and you totally hosed him and now we got this this woman over here but we didn't want him how much how many times can this happen before people go oh you know I'm done with this iic this is something that's bigger than just the Democratic party because we see this we see how this kind of foreign policy Elite and establishment in washing it is crossed both parties over different times and it's something that I can much deeper than that I'm I'm working to bring about reforms in the Democratic party to make it says more democratic more open more transparent more inclusive and welcoming of people who you don't agree on some issues disagree on others but one that is actually serving as as a platform for the people fighting for the people thinking about what's in the best interest of the people that that's the kind of change and reform that that I am working to bring about in the Party by think the forces that challenging here are actually much bigger than that you got to give a lot of credit to the Republican party because the establishment Republicans the last human being in the world but they wanted to run for president Republican ticket was Donald J Trump Lego independent and that someone who is popular perhaps you would go independent and suck a lot of the boats away from the Democratic Party People disagree with the directions going and then that's how the Republicans win yeah I'm not I'm not going to do that I've been asked that a ton of times since I don't know months ago and every single time I've been asked that I've said the answer is no I'm running to be the Democratic nominee I will not run as a third-party candidate and I didn't got something else that's that's been interesting and again very transfer if you're paying attention is no matter how many times I answer that question from reporters and and no matter how many times my answer is consistently the same know that was another thing that Hillary Clinton and others continue to point out like oh we think we think she's going to run as a third-party candidate and she's going to be the reason that Donald Trump wins and again to raise that question people's minds and to raise to do there the candidate and she's going to be the reason that Donald Trump wins and they're clearly trafficking and things that aren't true again why to raise that question people's mind and two rays that suspicion intended to do their best to try to undermine the support that that we're getting from people</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> both of your veterans and both of you I'm sure have things you agree on and disagree on but your urine a really unique position here you know an inn since you been on the podcast a lot of things have happened big the big one is when you rightly called out Kamala Harris on her her past and what she's done and and then it seems like everybody's attacking you like that opened up the floodgates and then there's all these hit pieces on me as a person Observer watching clean outside is like what look at the machine work look at the attack dogs go like look at this very transparent then what's going on but if you just happened upon one of those articles president like I knew you when people didn't know you that well and then I'll send people know you way more and now you're kind of a household name so the watch this process in the watch all the Machinery sort of move in your direction and it's very interesting we are up against the most powerful overall political machine when you when you look at this this peanuts revved up their engines to try to you know Define me as something that casts suspicion or doubts or whatever in people's minds you know pushing information that isn't true or all of these different things and I think there's a few reasons for it our challenge is like we are battling the political establishment in Washington and it's because I'm telling the truth it's because I'm challenging the status quo do that represent and ended they profited off for for a very long time so you know my campaign we don't take any contributions from packs or lobbyist fueled completely by contributions from Individual people and they are out spending Us by many many multiples where we need help to challenge their narrative with the truth but tell him he ate this is who I am this is why I'm running for president this is experienced in the background that I bring this job we've got to be able to bypass that mainstream corporate media and just go directly to voters and what is the experience of being attacked feel like I feel like I'm used to it so it just I mean it's just like it is it's nothing that I've ever really taken personally because I understand the situation you know I understand that whatever this mirrors are however radical they are you know it shows me that they feel threatened and they are concerned about both the unifying message that I'm bringing because we have Democrats Republicans Libertarians Independents who are joining this Coalition that that is fueling our campaign and it's a campaign of by and for the people and and one that's but that's actually speaking the truth it's calling for an end to these regime Infowars calling for you know what the escalation of tensions between the United States and other nuclear-armed countries and enter this new Cold War nuclear arms race actually hey let's focus our limited taxpayer dollars on actually serving the needs of our people that that's really the message that we're bringing and it scares the hell out of them what's interesting is for me again as an outsider it's it's a clear clear recognition that what they want versus what they say they want very different exactly the Democratic parties parties always been like we want a woman okay got your woman how about a woman doesn't veteran check how about a woman is a congressman how about that congresswoman veteran minority minority from Hawaii all these positives you know in order for Democrat to beat Donald Trump in 2020 you're going to have to be able to take Trump voters you're going to have to win over those Independence who stayed home in 2016 or even some of those Democrats who voted for Trump because they feel like our party has left them behind guess what check check check check we're doing all those things instead of saying hey this is really something that maybe we should get behind instead they're saying oh my gosh there's something very suspicious and weird about her because she's actually stealing kumquat in such a crossfire like to be taking this much heat from the party that you know trying to represent is it seems I don't remember this happening. Harris had a real shot and she would happen if you look at the direct correlation between Warehouse was standing and where she's at now and that debate it just you put holes in your boat which which was I was Raising some very important issues related to Criminal Justice Reform you know pending the federal marijuana prohibition and essentially pointing to to leadership because we're all asking to to lead this country and bring the experience that each of us has it's very distinct indifferent and in her whole campaign was based on the premise of being a prosecutor for the people being the Attorney General here in California and okay you've said you're proud of your record this is what you have done when you were in a position to make a positive change for the people instead you chose to do otherwise and I think that speaks louder louder than words when you are more bullets in the chamber 2 because there was other things you don't even think you didn't really touch upon her saying to single mothers that she was going to prosecute them and lock them up if they didn't get their kids and Skip and go laughing as she did so with with a fear of jail for kid didn't go to school now that that's that's the challenge of this this debate format that said so frustrating is you know you've got 60 to 75 seconds to get your point across to be able to talk about hey here's my position here's what I would do with you know North Korea here's how I would deal with no immigration reform in 60 seconds or less you've got 60 to 75 seconds to get your point across to be able to talk about hey here's my position here's what I would do with you know North Korea here's how I would deal with no immigration reform in 60 seconds or less</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I want to talk about something you brought up briefly earlier about the media being sore cheerleaders a lot of these wars or allow these military actions what do you think that happens because this ensures that they get access to think it happens because conflict is good for their business do you think it happens because if they don't act as cheerleaders they don't get access to the leaders and to the important politicians and military leaders I think that the underlying driver is that conflict is good that's crazy that that is their decision how to cover things and what it's been it's it's it's the war machine you know that that they're apart of and that they are driving that they are driving force for you know I think that yeah they're they're in there been reports any overtime I dating you and Matt Taibbi hear recent where you've got you know journalist who are more or even papers who are who are more interested in covering for their you know CIA relationships rather than actually bringing forward a story that the American the truth you know that the American people deserve to hear don't you know what I think there are other factors there that drive the media really playing heavily influential and dangerous force in continuing to push this this war-mongering narrative that that is you know I mean it's it's costly in an immeasurable and measurable way or the coverage is so influential in that influence changes the way people accept or don't accept things that are happening internationally you know when there's something I mean what was the what did you remember when I was there was a time when Obama had talked about attacking Syria in 2013 like it was my first year in Congress like rejection of an idea Global nationally that I've ever seen and then he kind of backed off it and I was like okay I think I think that was one of the most Brave decisions that he made to back off from it where he actually know he didn't take that position in that example of just kind of being the obstinate stubborn like nope here's what I said he drew this Redline I'm not going to go back on it no matter what no he did I think listen to the American people and ultimately he chose diplomacy with this is an area where people have been critical of you lose your position on Syria and the fact that you had met with Assad and this is something that gets brought up in organic has brought up in these little sound bite things that are seeking to Define you without any Nuance or any any complexity to try to let light just let this little tiny sentence or to Define your position then they can repeat that other people that really knowing what they're talking about what is your turn on Siri on a sod and how did all this conflict know this weirdness with you in the end of subject begin I think I didn't get it it goes back to again the the opposition that comes towards me from the the political establishment you know the corporate media the military-industrial complex because of the the leadership in and the voice that I've been bringing calling for an end to regime whether we're talking about the one in Iraq Libya and in in Syria with my choice my my choice will always be towards diplomacy because if we lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends in the pursuit of our own National Security and peace the only alternative is war. That's the way it is so will always choose to maximize all diplomatic means and measures and talks and negotiations to further our interest of peace and national-security recognizing that war should always be the last resort if necessary it's very difficult for people to understand that these things are insanely messy and you saying that you would always leaned towards diploma does not mean you support dictators not but that's exactly the way they frame it but if you look at the famous Hillary Clinton speech after Gaddafi was killed we came we saw he died and she was laughing Libby is a failed State now they have they have slaves that they're auctioning off on YouTube and you could watch slave auctions that someone filmed with their camera on their phone and they uploaded to YouTube Lippy has gone I mean it's a chaotic place right now good when Qaddafi was running Libya but it wasn't as bad as it is now so the idea that supporting Kadafi is supporting a dictatorship and your monster for supporting and like maybe not just it's kind of worse now because the world is a very messy play and and it's not even a matter of quote-unquote supporting it's just saying hey we're not going to come in and overthrow you a right government letting that as it seems that that's the issue here in and the contradiction when people are criticizing me exercising diplomacy and calling for an end to the regime change war that we've been waiting Syria since 2011 but then they'll say oh well of course I was against overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq right there's there's no intellect there's there's no consistency there and I think that the issue with Libya that that so often gets overlooked is again we look at what what will the consequences be of these regime-change wars you said Olivia the completely failed stayed there more terrorist organizations in stronghold in Libya now than there ever were before when Gaddafi was there the people of Libya are suffering far more now than they were before we also see this other effect on our own National Security where our to our regime change War policy has undermined our ability to negotiate with Kim Jong on in North Korea towards denuclearization you have leaders of of North Korea of time and time again and said hey look we're developing nuclear weapons as the only deterrent that'll work against the United States coming in and overthrowing our government set it over and over and over again and they pointed to examples like Livia saying that will you guys are saying you want to come in and negotiate with us to get rid of our nuclear weapons you told Gaddafi the same things that a good off of Garrity or nuclear weapons program will leave you alone and then you went in and overthrew Qaddafi will this be any different with us and then you got John Bolton as as than the National Security director for for Trump going on television or giving speeches saying yeah you know we're going to approach North Korea with Olivia model he said that and so when we wonder like hey why aren't these and I I I think I'm hiding Trump was right and I said it probably Trump is right to have direct negotiations with Kim Jong on but he hasn't gotten anywhere and you got to look at why and this is one of the reasons why continuing to hey no we're not going to overthrow you and your government Kim Jong-un but on the other hand your your continuing the policies that directly undermine your ability to to make that agreement that that'll be that'll that'll hold and that'll stand as a result now you know we have North Korea that that's nuclear weapons program is continuing to escalate their capabilities are continuing to grow and it poses a threat not only to you know Oaks Inn in Hawaii the people of Hawaii given our proximity North Korea but their capabilities now they're extending across the West Coast Express extending across the country posing a very direct existential threat to our country and to our people so you see how that decision that was made about Libya these decisions that are on going to be pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement North Korea says hey you guys made them tore up that agreement why should we think that's going to be any different with us so the president elected tore up that agreement why should we think that's going to be any different with us so these policy decisions that are being made her very directly connected in in having the effect ultimately of undermining our national security and making the American people less safe</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> interesting proofpoint of this is I can go pull came out yesterday on where the American people stand on impeachment and something like seventy-five 80% of fox viewers oppose impeachment and seventy-five 80% of NBC MSNBC viewers support impeachment and they're covering the very same impeachment inquiry and hearings and we know witness testimony and and all that I don't think you understand what that means not even has a chance of happening and I'll base now I I don't think I don't think people do either they don't they just it seems like some fun talking point some got your thing where they've got them you know Ukraine time we got them got them this time stormy Daniel didn't stick but this one this one's going to think yourself is Stormy Daniels hilarious girl I don't know who she is. I send you that video where the girl is getting into people to get pumped up about impeachment and she she's got like like rainbow colored hair and she looks like a liberal I think she even has one of those pink kitty cat hats on and and she gets them she's like Propecia delicate explain what you got probably just let him finish his term it is hilarious it's hilarious because it's a sport it's it's it's basically replacing it's it's a sport for people don't like football their their idea of who's winning or losing this game is very personal and they feel like their team got killed in 2016 and then we could come back and kick ass in 2020 and that's what's going on and everything they can get out of Anatomy that I mean that it's it's that but then you've got some folks who some some democrat leaders in in Washington who are saying well you don't we need to get rid of trump through impeachment to protect ourselves from possibly losing the election in 2020 which I think is just like a an open and you know it well we don't think that we can actually beat him at The Ballot Box so we're trying to use this political maneuver in order to get rid of him even though it's it's unlikely that even if the house does vote to impeach which isn't fully clear this point but even if that were to happen the Senate is not going to convince 20 is highly unlikely the Sun is going to convince 20 Republicans to vote with every Democrat to to actually physically kick Trump out of office and let this is why I may I have I have always maintained that you know I look forward to beating Donald Trump at The Ballot Box for the America people can unequivocally let their voices be heard saying nope we're done with the leadership and and all that Trump brought to office and we're choosing to go in a New Direction have you thought about what kind of nickname he'll have for you cuz you know he's going to come up with a nickname I got to take out of it but they do it's it's a it's a it's a super short clip but basically they're like there is a villain amongst all of these candidates and that villain is Tulsi gabbard strikes fear into the hearts of every other person up here at something like that like a Despicable Me type cartoon villain Vape portrayed me as like a Cruella Deville out they don't show you farm like like bro you need to take some time off when you get you in a hyperbaric chamber how many energy especially cuz Donald Trump has energy and he goes onstage for an hour and a half at a rally with no teleprompter no 30,000 people without no drink no bathroom break like an animal up there any funerals in I didn't mean while you're looking at Biden and you're like Ruth's house this evening to work out his teeth are literally falling out here the campaign has names wrong</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> he's a really important conversation to have with you right now with you you're in the middle of this lawsuit with Google explain that so the first debate that we had this presidential election you know we had hoped that I would do well going into it and that people would go and start their internet search to hey who is Tulsi gabbard never heard of her before and so we went and got it you know Google add setup improve everything was ready to rock and roll was the most Googled candidate of the night as I have been for every debate that I participated in the issue was during that first debate you know what wall that. Was happening or our Google add account was suspended by Google with no explanation whatsoever no like hey you guys are there was nothing like you're freaking out there like man this is what we were waiting for now you guys took our account on tell us we got to do to get it back up and say we didn't hear back for a while once you start hearing back be heard back from different people with different answers nothing clear-cut to say you did this wrong fix this will put your tongue back nothing and then all of a sudden you know hours and hours have gone by and then our account was reinstated without any explanation about what happened and you know this is this is bigger than just wasps in opportunity that that my campaign had because this happened on that night during that Peak. It's a bigger issue about the power that this Corporation has in Google in interfering essentially in Fair elections and in what kind of information they are willing to put in front of people don't they don't Boston Dynamics to does Google own Boston Dynamics I'll tell you what you get you get extra double bonus credit for me right now till 10 cuz that right there is so crazy for you black cats bad for me but it's also bad for the American people have been stuck at bad for me undefined and no investigation into it and still you put out this lawsuit there's really no way to find out. It started to force that conversation that we're continuing to push to the Forefront about how particularly with Google and Facebook the inordinate amount of power that they have to as we sit and type in a Google search for whatever or we know what's popping up on our Facebook feed they control that I think that we have a real issue in this country with advertise in those things in in Google and Facebook a real issue that it's never really been fully discussed cuz those things just sort of came up out of nowhere you know we had social networks we had my space and we had you know we didn't think anything of it and then all the sudden. Only the here but they have this extraordinary amount of influence they have algorithms what people put up algorithms that figure out what you're into and then show you that so if you just really in a conflict which most people are it is showing you conflict all long is getting everybody riled up so it's having a direct effect whether it's planning Gordon or not it's having a direct effect on discourse in this country that has and I think it's one of the reasons why what you were talking about before work. They're out with us or you're against us and it's never been more hard-line than it has been right now and all of this is because of advertising money like what are you even selling all your staff portal to connect people with each other and through that you're gaining it insane uneventful in an extraordinary amount of money is being generated and we never agreed to it look down we saw the ad and then everybody's just getting bought and sold and it's happening to a point now where that is one of the main Town Halls one of the main places where people discuss ideas in the world is he social media networks and they're not getting smaller growing and they keep stacking up in with Google or Facebook or Twitter and the amount of influence they have is insane and they're just people right there just regular folks like the fact that this guy has so much power we are not ready for this and this is happening right under our noses now it's happening so quickly and then when something like your Google situation happen words like Bobobo-bo not only you properly but now you're f****** pulling strings you're showing us you're pulling strings and everybody's like exactly but one that's saying hey you guys are too f****** big you're going to break up monopolies and provide the kind of oversight and accountability that will protect the consumer that will protect the American people protect fair and honest discourse protect freedom of speech that's the issue and that's that's a difference between me and and somebody like mayor Pete for other candidates and he's not the only one other candidates who refuse to take a strong position in recognizing the threat to our public discourse and and our democracy that these Tech Giants have really was in the hands of just a few people you have this is just broken the news recently Mark Zuckerberg who you know people are taught he's like wanted to run for president not that long ago and was Bruce Lee considering it and then you know he's trying to start his own cryptocurrency wants to have his own currency that he controls like the amount of power this guy has and that he wants to continue to grow as is so dangerous he decided not to run for president but he and his wife started emailing mayor Pete's campaign manager saying he hears some guys we think you should hire for your campaign and so they hired two of Zuckerberg Facebook guys who are not working for me or Peet's campaign and so they're going to have a seat table should this guy get elected which means Facebook's going to have a seat at the table did the weirdest little sips of water I don't I don't trust a person man woman or nonbinary creature to take sips of water like that that's just not the way you drink water we drink Waters like I'm thirsty I'm going to have some more what the f*** is happening here what is happening here the water didn't move before we move if it barely likes do you feel like these most like you coming out strong against Google Facebook saying that you could break up those types of monopolies strategically wasn't the best call because you know you could have not been so strong against him and played along with him a little bit maybe they look at you and go through the list that. Joe went through earlier which is your a veteran you're a woman you're a woman of color you're from Hawaii you got this experienced congresswoman you got all the stuff they can increase your chances of getting elected then you get elected mayor and I'm going to break you guys up do you think strategically or is that just you're the type of person you are as like you know what I'm just going to I'm going to tell the truth from the get-go is that basically what we're going to tell the truth and call it straight no matter what and and you know no matter who who I'm dealing with because that's who I am and the people are sick and tired of politicians who play this game and do this political dance as they're trying to get people elected and like okay we'll fight if I just say this or if I just kind of cozy up to these people or these interest they can help me get elected and then when I win then I'm going to do the right thing will guess what as you do when you win all of you okay I've got to win the next re-election that means I need more money from Wall Street I need more money from Google I need more money from these guys so I can't say anything to piss him off just yet I'm going to wait until I get reelected then that's when I'm really going to start to do the right thing and I think people across party lines are sick and tired of the same just yet I'm going to wait until I get reelected then that's when I'm really going to start to do the right thing and I think people across party lines are sick and tired of the same old politicians who say one thing and do another and instead are looking for real leadership</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> snacks like where where where you at right now I think our initial challenge or the initial goal that we're seeking to meet here is to get I'm not qualified it for the next debate in December do you have to do to qualify we need to do two things one is we've got a surpassed 200,000 individual donors that's hilarious you need money right now we are at about $199,000 Joe Rogan I think they require a certain number of poles and I think I need one more pool to meet that requirement which is again is directly linked to look at to look at a guy like Pete buttigieg he spent nine million dollars on social media ads in order to get like a 4% bump in the polls you look at what some of the other guys have spent the billionaires that I think steyer spent 37 million dollars in order to qualify in the polls on the debate and so are challenges we just need we need to get out and get in front of people in order to make sure that that we're bypassing the corporate media and we're actually talking directly to Folks at home is there a real possibility sometime in our lifetime they can take money out of politics like that yes there has to be there has to be the more people learn about how completely lopsided are our campaign Finance system is that does two things it favors those or it is helps those who are taking money from corporations and packs and lobbyists further deepening The Divide between the politicians and and the people that they are supposed to be serving and representing and instead you know you've got this this inside or culture of lobbyists and politicians who are just hanging out and making the decisions and yeah I mean Elizabeth the second thing is that that you're seeing how corrupting that influence has it is on the on the but the politicians and the influence that they have over people and how much it disproportionately helping the strengthen the power of a two-party system where those parties can can literally take like for me if if you wanted to give me a contribution you could give me the limit is $2,800 per the prime that's it you can't no matter how much you want you can give me any more money but if you wanted to write a check tie the Democratic party Republican party doesn't matter unlimited amount of money that you can give to the party so what does that actually mean it means that the party has a hell of a lot of power that they can leverage over individual members of Congress elected leaders to say if you don't play ball if you don't vote the way we want you to vote we're not going to be there to help you out in your lunch and we're not going to run tv ads for you we're not going to hell when you're getting attacked by the other guy with just makes the problem that we already have worse where instead of leaders voting based on what they believe is right for their constituents to write for their the the country or based on their conscience instead they're being goaded into voting for the interest of the political party putting party ahead of the interests of the country and so that that's in the more people are learning about the consequence of our existing campaign Finance system or they're demanding change and reform so that we are electing leaders who are accountable only to the people have you ever had a conversation with someone where they have tried to influence your vote in one way or another in that way you just described I have so so you know I have met with and in a lobbyist will say here is why I want you to vote this way and and you know by the way what will will be there at your next fundraising dinner or something like that I have a history of bars I got no calls from any lobbyists none when I said no Pac money no lobbyist money automatically they're like well obviously we can't talk to her for not giving her money crazy what is not playing again exactly and then I I haven't seen it in established very quickly in Congress that that I don't play political games and then I'm not going to be bullied into taking anybody else's position if I don't think it's the right one to take so I have not experienced that kind of like the party has never helped me in any of my elections ever for city council for State Legislature for congress so them come in and say we're not going to be like dude you were never there for me ever anyway but I've seen it happen with some of my friends who may be represent swing districts or her demo you were never there for me ever anyway but I've seen it happen with some of my friends who maybe represent swing districts are who are Democrats who got elected Republican District are always going to have a really tough race I have seen it happen in real time where that those bully tactics coming to play</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how do you navigate this testing it seems like the it seems like okay if you want to get the Democratic nomination you got to be pretty far to the left right but if you want to actually win the presidency then you got to be more moderate so that seems like a tough little thing to try and get through as well I think that that is the conventional so-called wisdom that just isn't true anymore I think this is what you need to hear a lot of the political pundit talking who's fart Centrist modern who's this this that I think what's what's proving to be true is is more about you know who is who is who is the establishment candidate versus who is anti-establishment and that you know I don't fit into any one of those boxes because I look at every issue based on its merits I'll look at the substance of the issue look at the arguments for and against and go with the approach that I think actually that's a reasonable and that's a thing like these people are like oh my God we can't figure her out cuz she doesn't have any of these labels but but that is where the vast majority the American people are you have these these extremes on the fringes who are all about these you know purity test where you are either with me on every single issue or you're done you're finished your unacceptable that the vast majority of Americans again they're looking at what is real leadership leadership whether you're talking about the guy who's were working in the manufacturing warehouse you're talkin about a blue collar worker you're looking at okay here's here's the here's the issues that keep most people up at night do you want to make sure that if your kid is 6 evenly of their they're going to able to get the health care they need you want to make sure you have a roof over your families had their their basic things approaching them in a way that is pragmatico pragmatic common sense and solutions-oriented is not only the right thing to do I think it's the thing that makes it so you don't have to stay on the primary I'm only going to talk Democrats and the most radical and extreme among them and then I'm totally going to flip the script and then speak to the whole country after I win the primary election that's that's ridiculous this is why you know I'll go on Fox News MSNBC CNN and I'm delivering the exact same message to people and will we're building and growing support in PA who watch those three different channels who actually listened like me like she makes sense like she's not crazy she's not spouting some party talking point she's not you know going down a radical path just to appeal to the the Twitter winds that are blowing one way or the other it's just about 8 but let's do what's best for the people and for the country I'm stunned by the bluebird to for you going on Fox News the people actually upset that they do not think that you should Grace snooze screen to you you're doing a disservice to your party which is interesting while I get the same stuff and because I go on Fox News and why do Fox News Fox News invite me on the Fox News never invited me on I want to talk about it is about leadership because of what we're doing is human beings as we're leading other people that is just your family or whether it's your business or whatever or it's on the field so yeah weird that you would get attacked for going on Fox News when actually anybody that looks at that from a strategic you would think oh she's actually accepted by by this this right-wing nude organization maybe she could get some other you do moderate conservative books maybe we should think about bringing her and it is a candidate because you could win what's wrong with going onstage or going on camera with someone that you opposed someone you disagree with and having a dialogue about what you disagree with that's the weird thing about this cancel culture this was strange timer living and you're not even supposed to communicate with people about idea that you disagree on one thing to say okay you're going to go on Fox News and you know tussle with Sean Hannity about things you disagree on but I think what they see is more dangerous is finding areas for you actually do agree right that's you know on Tucker Carlson I have a platform to be able to speak to millions of people across the country about the kind of leadership that I bring in the area foreign-policy what I would do here in this country what I would do there in that country if I were president today and opportunity to deliver that message directly to people's living rooms are offices are wherever they are and you know I think in some of these areas Tucker Tucker and I will disagree on a whole host of things but on some of these issues of foreign policy he'll say yeah I agree with you and I think when you look at this this cancel culture how you know I was attacked on the debate stage 4 going on Fox News how do you think you're going to lead this country all Americans if completely not only shutting out and not willing to talk to half the country that watches Fox News but you're in fact disrespecting and dismissing them just because they may disagree with your they watch a different News Channel then you do I think that's the bigger issue here is yeah you know there's a political consequence you're never going to be able to have a dialogue with what to speak of win support from people who you treat like garbage you disrespect you called same to you call deplorables but how do you expect to lead as the president of every single American in this country when you've thrown half of them away and say you know what I actually don't care about you I only care about people I agree with that that's to me the the the worst part about all of this completely divided and sent people to vote for the opposing candidate like you're going to call me deplorable or really watch this and that their calculated in one of the things I do appreciate you about you is that I think you're not I think the way you view things is you would far rather speak your mind truthful and have real legitimate opinions on things rather than have some weird slimy sort of Shifty take that's been created by a bunch of people that think that this is going to be the right thing that you could say that's going to you know and get you a little closer in the polls and move you this way and move the needle that way that that Shifty style of politics I really feel is dead I just don't think you can do it that way anymore I think people because of the Open Access to information that people have today in the way that people can communicate in and find out information I just don't think we want to buy that Shifty politician talk anymore I think we're done with I think we realized it's Antiquated it's it's never served us it sucks and it just it just gives you the same thing every time you get someone to get to the office and they do the completely different things and what they said they were going to do before they got in yeah that's even know I thought about all the people are they heard deplorables I heard 47% and that's bad but yeah you're right what it really made people think is oh behind the scenes you're totally different than you are when you're standing onstage I know what your liking I'm not voting for you</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> ideally candy platform people and somehow know that weakens the position that you don't agree with it's the opposite the opposite happens you pump up the only hope that they have of getting their side of the story out there their sides door is going to be represented by Trump and Trump Sports and I don't know what the president can or can't do to sort of enforced some sort of Emmy we obviously have a new situation when it comes to communication this country with social media and tech companies now it's one of the biggest things when income in terms of discourse and how people communicate and how people form opinions about things that's a tremendous influence our culture and the fact that this isn't protected by the First Amendment we we have a very strange new force in our our country when it comes to discourse and I think laws need to be formed that we need to have some sort of a parameters that you mean there's laws on virtually everything and virtually thing that has massive influence over the way it affects our country and that's one where there isn't really there their they're independent companies and then they're not there. They can do whatever they want with you but also been bigger kind of culture War that's happening in our country this cancel culture that exists that I mean it does it it threatens the kind of of freedom of speech and and discourse I think we'd celebrate in this country for so long where this is the country where you can stand up and say what you believe no matter how terrible I may think it is or how strong they may disagree with it you know people like us are willing to lay our life down for your right to do that and that's that's what is at risk here with this this culture this this cancel close at 7 chilling effect where people are maybe afraid to say something that may be seen as controversial as you've seen how people's especially Republic fit your whole career can be just like gone finished chance of cultures real simple everyone now has a rock and there's a big window someone throws a rock at that window and they want to and that's what happened check the rocks in but then they feel like they have some sort of a population of a politician gets taken down there like look I helped my Twitter feed my Twitter feeds Phil was calling the first one I think that that's and he mentioned that happened the debate Kamala Harris's shoot she'd like launch to petition or publicly was calling for a Twitter to delete President Trump's account yeah and she really really made a big deal out of did a whole media tour like all this call. Elizabeth Warren all this stuff I was asked about it by reporters shortly after she had made us downside I did not even heard of it like a what do you think about Kamala Harris calling on Twitter to cancel Trump Twitter account said well you know I disagree with not everything but a lot of what Trump says but freedom of speech freedom of speech so no I completely disagree with her and the response from her campaign spokesperson no kidding Tulsi gabbard Fox News talking points freedom of Fox news is saying oh well what about freedom of speech by the way Richard Spencer loves her I will stand up and fight for your freedom of speed I may disagree and I may disagree publicly and strongly but we've got draw the line here for freedom of speech and being able to have this dialogue and discourse where we can and I think that we should debate strongly and passionately about some of these issues not seen that is a bad thing that's been the strength of our country gaps ones that'll just be yeah I didn't but people have told me Tech friends of mine that say they say that immediately turns into what is it 4chan and 8chan just completely goes into the gutter Doc's anybody don't give up anybody's address and threatened anybody would do any harm and just talk crazy and do it anonymously and that's what a lot of people are doing it but it's it's very difficult for even the people that felt like they were deplatformed or their voice wasn't being able to be heard they don't want to join into this crazy s*** posting pictures of your dinner menu get you do that on Instagram and if it's a dead deer or something like that you or your risk of getting your picture taken down it says the amount of power that's being exhibited by these social media companies again no one anticipated this could be done what do you think should be done like say you you get you become president what would you do so I think there's there's two things here that we talked about the freedom of speech to control over information I think up part and parcel today we didn't really talk much about is how much of our private information these tech companies have and what they're doing with it but maybe without us even knowing about how that's that's helping to drive up there profit letting it sit both of those components you got to be concerned about a number one is we look at our antitrust laws that exist in this country for the protection of the consumer against any giant Monopoly from coming in and Indiana position to abused their power and apply those laws to these Tech Giants back that Facebook owns obviously Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp I don't think that I think that is the definition of a monopoly across platforms that many of us use because there isn't really a legitimate alternative option available to us saying that the first thing and in looking at breaking up these these monopolies I think Facebook's co-founder Chris Hayes I think is his name I didn't he wrote it and very argument against Facebook Monopoly saying they have gotten way too powerful they should not have been able to buy these other companies and the second thing is Congress actually digging down and passing laws that provide actual oversight and level of accountability to ensure that our freedom of speech and our freedom to access information is not impeded by these Tech Giants whether it's for their own profit or to pursue their own political interest there's people inside of Twitter that are like Jack Dorsey believes in the least according to what he's told me that Twitter should be like a town hall where everyone should be able to have access but he faces resistance that inside the actual company that he's a CEO of that there's so many people that don't think that the way it should be and they think that they have a political or social obligation to limit certain voices because those voices radicalize young people like what do you say to those people I mean with without knowing examples of what their sighting here's the thing is is what they may view is radicalizing young people because of the ideology that day as individuals may hold onto may be seen in the opposite way by people who different political ideology you know I think this is something that's that that we're seeing happening offline as well you know whether it's in in college campuses or another places where both sides do the other side as indoctrinating young people or indoctrinating people with their ideology ideology uniting this is something that that that we're seeing happening offline as well you know whether it's in in college campuses or another places where both sides view the other side as indoctrinating young people or indoctrinating people with their ideology</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is all the time there's like something happens in the news for the political candidates running for president it's who can get their tweet out the fastest on the issue we saw this recently with the situation in Syria with the Kurds and who can get the truth out the fast people are asking me like hey what you have to say what you have to say in like I'm trying to understand situation first I'm actually trying to understand what happened and why we are in the situation that we're in once I do that I'll let you know what I think was another one of those end-of-the-world scenarios that unfolded you know we Trump pulled troops out of out of that area and it was like oh the world's going to end and look there was some bad stuff that happened I get it some Isis folks folks Isis terrorist murderers Escape I got that some some courage were killed like some bad stuff happened but it wasn't the end of the world and and one thing my second appointment we weren't we started doing counterinsurgency operations instead of counter-terrorist operation so we we we changed our strategy and as we did this we were we were starting to kill a decent amount of bad guys about above these insurgents so a few weeks go by and I got a message from up my chin implant and they're like a charcoal we get that you're doing these missions but right now we're not seeing any changes in the metrics as far as attacks are happening happening right and luckily I had read the the counter Insurgency manual that was written by Jennifer Tracy and and I part of that explains that a average counterinsurgency takes 7 years to work itself out right and so I said hey you know boss the average counterinsurgency takes its 7 years to to flush itself out it's only been three weeks can I get some we think that some news event that we can fully understand the news event within one hour of it happening we don't have any understanding you need to let these things develop and and see where they actual long-term effects are we can't be snapping judgment and making radical decisions or split decisions when we have to actually accept what is really going on until the depressed for sure is the left we meeting right-wing media and one of them is a great decision ever know the ones most horrible thing that ever happened and there you go and you know no one can even make an assessment for just happen cuz it only happened 14 minutes ago how about we see where it plays out about being first rather than actually being accurate and presenting the American people with here's what has gone on you can form your own opinion you can form your own conclusion but here's the course of events that took place a b c d and e and that's that's exactly what we're missing in in most of the time I think if we were talking about earlier think were poisoned by this desired have our information fed to us very quickly and that the fact that there's so much information coming at us we don't have enough time to sit back and read a manual on how long it takes counterinsurgency efforts to be fruit fruition 3 tuition the fact that that's hitting you in the military that you would think that the most pragmatic the most disciplined people that understand the long game they're playing 3D chess those are the people that you would telling people like you what you can and can't do the fact that that kind of thinking is even filtering down to special ops crew was crazy what was nice that we do have decentralized command inside the military on my boss isn't what I told you to do cocaine make sense explain it to me that makes them cool move forward that's that's a very positive boss tells me to do something that doesn't make any sense I'm a boss this actually is a bad plan we should do it a different way and if I have a good boss my boss says okay I didn't see that angle and that's another thing that you know when Kelsey was talking about how politicians we come up with a plan and plan we're going to do and I'm going to wait for that feedback company the problem is people are so insecure or / Toriko so big that they won't notice by just going to stick with the same plan no matter everyone else is dumb no using you see through it so we need to make some changes or wrong for the political leadership to civilian leadership that sets the policy that the military executes is so often lacks that foresight and that that planning of actually looking okay if we pursue course of action a you know we call it here here will be the second third fourth order of effects right here's how you know the enemy or the opponent's is likely to reactor here's how other actors are likely to react to our action so we can try to anticipate that and then we can okay this is how we would respond to tell their likely to respond actually go through this so that we don't end up in the situation that we too often find ourselves in where you're like all right here's the here's the mission guys go for it and then you whether it's a week or month or yearly like how the hell do we find ourselves here like you failed As Leaders the leaders of our country failed to ask those questions about you know what happens what happens next you know after we go in and topple Saddam Hussein and we completely obliterate the entire Rocky military what actually happens next what will be the consequences to this will be the cost to our troops are military what will be the cost of the Iraq EPP show me the cost to American taxpayers is the is the objective we know what the objective is is it achievable what's RN State an exit strategy when you look back in and I've just I've seen this throughout my 7 years in Congress sitting on the Foreign Affairs committee sitting on the armed services committee where we're questioning and providing oversight over the Department of Defense and Department of State asking bleeders these questions and when were not given answers or given ambiguous answers or things like secretary Mattis once and hearing about how Al-Qaeda has gotten so strong in Syria to where I mean right now they they control an entire city entire city of idlib is controlled by Al-Qaeda and I asked him at that time I said why aren't we going after al-qaida in Syria in a very serious and concerted way and his answer was well it's complicated it's complicated and it's it's it it's frustrating to say the least but I think it's been a very transmitted bit of it's been a very clear window into the lack of foresight and good judgment and just the ability to look at these challenges and situations with that that basic understanding in a non-emotional way and understand what it what the objective cost and consequences before we launch judgment and just the ability to look at these challenges in situations with that that basic understanding in a non-emotional way and understand what it what the objective cost and consequences before we launched this action</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> well that's also argument 14 Trump minutes Trump's argument is what he's doing he's boosting a business in the United States and whether not you love him or hate him what he's doing is having a positive net effect on the global economy particular United States economy and that's going to make us stronger when this is whether you love him or hate him you got to look at that objectively and go okay will do is there any Merit to what he saying I don't understand economics I don't trust people that study I don't have the time but they're saying yes he's doing things that benefit business I think that I think that the trouble with the approach that Trump has taken in we obviously he's got her stick and he's got the things that he's got to talking points the things that he says but he is continuing this mentality when we look at like the trade war with China and trade conflict that he started with Canada and now it's different European countries it is it is it the 07 that in order for us and our economy and our people to win then the people are the economies of these other countries have to suffer and that's why I agree with what you just said Jocko about you know building a strong helping grow a strong global economy a shared Prosperity I mean you look at the opportunity that would provide for peace and less conflict rather than what we're seeing it and it says it's playing out in real-time with China right now where you see this trade war that is Escalade pet care for the desk leading I have met with farmers in Iowa who are hurting tremendously because of this trade and tariff or fart manufacturers small business owners and the danger of this continuing to grow and continuing to escalate economic War can very easily turn into a hot war and again we're talking about a nuclear-armed country where these ever escalating tensions push us turn closer to the brink of of nuclear catastrophe something nuclear strategist are saying that we are we are closer to now then then at least in a generation and this is where the foreign policy that I'm that I'm putting forward to the American people that I will lead with is one that is focused on on engaging with other countries being that Force for good focusing on cooperation rather than conflict in every respect being able to work out yeah we do have trade differences with China there's no question about being able to do so in a way that is not further pushing us closer and closer to the brink of a hot war and potentially disastrous can you get into that like what is the trade what is the issue with China like what what is Trump feels like we don't have a fair deal right that's what he's dated diagnosis imbalance with China and Soviet shoes with with I stop sending those of the top two that that come to the Forefront the problem is not with the diagnosis of the issue it is how he's going about it in a very shoot-from-the-hip kind of way I mean he's he's like almost conducting his negotiations via Twitter he's got negotiators were sitting across in the Chinese and he okay we're getting closer to a deal we're going to work this out and all of a sudden something goes out on swimming like a whole thing which you know it's it's Maybe funny when when when Trump is putting out something with Trump Tower in Greenland but when there are such real consequences of the day-to-day lives of the American people and when we're pushing us closer and closer to the brink of a nuclear catastrophe s going these tensions with countries like China and with Russia this is I mean it's serious the stakes are very high and and so this is this is more about how Trump is doing this in such an irresponsible way that's destabilization and uncertainty I both with our economy and also in our relationship to the country suits everything that made him famous as a businessman all the brashness all the shooting from the hip exactly but what that means is he's unpredictable in the bar that you look at me like I was going to give that guy little extra credit cuz he looks like he's crazy so I think that might be what he either thinks he's doing or or not but here's the interesting thing about this I don't want a quote from the continent caricature Boven we're eating our Factory we're doing everything here now there's things like labor labor is more expensive in America could we pay our workers because they're awesome and so it cost a little bit more to build a product if you have a Chinese company that can make it to G2G and they have their paying the workers a dollar day literally and then they can chip bag you over here welding making penis on the price that the quality is not as good but they can be 70 bucks for this Chinese guy or a hundred bucks for this American be so and this actually this part happen again the details I can't quite remember what they said hey work we did we're not going to put a tariff on Deez coming into America because they can't be made here because they can't be made here I'm stepping out I'll let you have my buddy Pete come on this podcast 3 p.m. forever though we said no. are you the only company in America the only company in America that is making me</div>

Like cool Lincoln we're good. Good let me hang on for a little bit after what would seem like a lifetime of that sort of witnessing that and doing that and watching things that you recognize Injustice at the idea of someone getting stuck in the blame and as of Vendetta in that I can I can see that but you see how that's really probably why we're still having problems now is definitely some part of it right yeah it's like my great great great great told me you know what sort of like dipped in that Kool-Aid of because it my great great great great great felt this way I'm supposed to to because we're related so and so he could change the world in his businesses I said how about you and I you so what you mean is so we'll use your money in my I will make films and the first been so I'm jumping careers at this stage I'm going from a being a fairly successful still photographer really busy to Career why I had really no business doing it I never really made a film before not even really a short film and I so I'm nervous I'm feeling sort of full of myself like I'm at stretches great career being on it on a boat and my kids with you on vacation with her family and my kids does playing on the beach with another kid it happens to be Steven Spielberg's kid so Steven comes over onto the boat to meet Jim and I made Jurassic Park using Jim's computers with no silicon graphics and after I had Steven alone for a few seconds I said you have any advice for first-time filmmaker what's the first film we did was the Cove but at least you don't have actors and special effects and boats and animals it's just a part of the story it's not like you're like with him I think what he's meeting like Jaws exactly I have cuz they do you have to match shots and people want to kill you cuz when we did if it was a subpoena was exciting but dangerous work yeah I mean they made these claims like all the sudden people got stronger and faster and more endurance if there's no evidence to support that there's no evidence other than their anecdotal statements of what they did there's no one is ever put anyone on a vegan diet and then run them through extreme endurance test and found a significant increase in vo2max or muscle strength or any of those things none of this has never been done so if it's if it's true anecdotally for these people it would been really interesting if there was some actual data to go with that where they showed studies me we have James talking about his ability to do the battle ropes but all the sudden he could do an hour and before he could only do 10 minutes I find that really hard to believe that you gained 50 minutes of your battle rope time just from rope snap that was the only thing in the film that I found hard to believe he not have to let it go I mean the guy's an athlete is an amazing athlete currency is excellent martial arts techniques I would just buy it at face level at face value but there's a lot of those there's a lot and we can go through it and talk about I mean there's a problem which is there's no. Evidence to back that up but even the anecdotal evidence is a little shaky is it when we start to talk about some of the athletes in the film and then also examples of athletes outside of the film who switch to vegan diet we look and see what happened to them after they did that the problem here is something that I called a vegan honeymoon which is you know you take someone who's been on a standard American diet they're eating KFC McDonald's Etc on a switch from that to a plant-based diet of course they're going to feel better from eating absolute crap to real foods and so for a. Of time they're going to feel better for sure but then what happens over a longer. Of time you know not getting enough protein just in terms of quantity and not getting the right quality of protein that starts to have an impact micronutrient deficiencies you know vitamin-a zinc calcium iron things like that take a while to develop so you're not going to see that decline in performance happen right away it might take 3 months and might take six months might take nine months it depends on all kinds of factors genetics health status going into it the type of exercise and activity that they're doing the way they're implementing the diets do you have to not just look at what happens a month after someone goes vegan you have to look at what happens six months a year after two years after it was a gamble that adopted child from Russia and they thought that the child was a little kid and it turned out she might have been 30 they don't know how old she was she had to kill them 30 year old with some sort of a metabolic disease that will that serves you right for trying to be a do-gooder you know they'll never do anything again for anybody will never do one thing cuz we'll try to bring it up she likes the idea that there are midgets dressing up as children and trying to burrow into family so that they can wake up in the middle of night and kill them is truly the funniest thing that has happened in income something else was she okay whatever she was she is like a growth disorder that keeps her like looking like a small child video recently where it looks like a kid was getting thrown off a bus looks like what the fox says think they were in on it no I don't think they knew the people in the outside didn't know I think the guy threw that guy off the bus and that was a scam and then the dude who is this the little person in the hoodie he was in the scam and the world going to do that so she's going to poison them or something like that because it was scary stuff because you know you got to think who knows what kind of abuse this little kid had gone through watch that thirty-year-old Razz as a little kid threw in Russia you know and I'll get her homes and foster care and you say that happened in Russia Russian kid in Indiana Ukrainian kids isn't that odd to look back and be like remember when we all went to Disney World know they're probably hate this page isn't growing I think they said that they were actually like they would wake up and see your likes standing in the door like I think it was things that she did that yeah very very bad</div>

What's up with that f****** Brown water turn it back up put that back on how about you fix that f****** toilet water you got your kids swimming around in that water it's disgusting they just charge cards I mean this is hilarious we all wanted the guards on night he killed himself create the public I don't think there is I mean I don't think that bar the attorney general has any real desire to get to the bottom of what happened I mean this is clearly obviously sexual blackmail Epstein was involved with intelligence whether it's you asked whether it's Mossad it's somebody is island is a Honeypot had powerful people in compromising position he was in that probably like an access agent where he would give these Intel agencies access to a powerful people ex-presidents people like that open up that wound because it's just that it's never going to stop bleeding and guys like bar who are you know this is a guy that's participated multiple cover obscene you know I don't think he has any really interest and he's he's a lifelong government official get you could say teach day Tuesday whatever it is but he's just a career and his job is to protect the interest of the power factions in Washington these government agencies there's no way they open this up and there's no there was no way that they could have KFC in an open chord pointing fingers at maybe Prime Ministers and presidents it would tear countries apart to be the biggest political scandal in our lifetime I just can't believe they just mark them like that though they didn't just mark on them twice his what I want to know when he tried to commit suicide the first time with a camera's broken into great question I don't know I don't we never heard that while we didn't see any footage of him I've never seen any footage of him American nobody even comment on it remember the first time and he attempted to commit suicide I needed yeah I don't know that's a good point I mean I think they day he he they found in the transfer them I don't know if they have photographic evidence of him doing that Google what happened the first time I've seen tried to kill himself cuz that's interesting next time you got to do it like this you're either not stronger you take off from the chair my favorite thing is cellmate the cell mate that they gave a yell when she's like a lot of it was a huge skinhead looking dude would stereotype of the last guy you would want in your want to be in a cell with big guido and a corrupt cop with giant muscles yeah listen to stay here forever you like killing people to watch the bad enough they can do this but I got to watch the bank accounts obviously the people that are paying off people pretty smart there's ways to hide money but somebody got paid off substantial amount of money somewhere somewhere that might not have money might not have been passed around right like somebody just might have called in favors he's just hide here where is just laying Maxwell yeah somebody said she was in and out burger with a f****** book and they stayed photo was thinking like all America will forgive me if they see I'm eating fast food I don't even know about CIA agent intelligence right yeah that was something that was actually said by was it one of the attorney-general's when they're Prosecuting is an angel would belong to intelligent look at advantage of this opportunity to promote a f****** film The Seth Rogen movie placement in the in the background of a human trafficker we should get good taste in old iPhone elements of the CIA or the Mossad would condone the abuse of children to get leverage and information on people but that's kind of what happened before yeah I think they just figured look these 15 16 year olds they're going to keep their mouth shut when we're bored talking about 1 when this happened this is all a long time ago right it wasn't that long ago when did he start bringing people out to the Island. The island it's too late 90s early 2000 understood the concept of social media where I can you go what's really crazy is like no one's ever accounted for how that f****** got all that money will less wax near who was the head of Victoria's Secret was like his mentor and they were buddies in Blackshear gave them and you know so funny but the mainstream press you know the Wall Street Journal Ransom article How could a guy who sold women's jeans forever you know get ticket totally Bamboozled by Jeffrey Epstein that's like not nobody there thought that it was maybe I'm a pathological relationship and if those guys knew each other and maybe were in the similar stuff or whatever I don't know but maybe there was a mutual benefit to them knowing each other they think that somehow this billionaire got Bamboozled by Jeffrey Epstein which is just insane to think but that's the way the Press I'm sure he didn't do anything untoward Yeah well yeah that the prince did the interview with the prince of him he's did you look up a lot strip and yeah yeah bro you got it a lot of people now for whatever reason it's becoming more and more obvious more diagnoses or diagnosis even talked about it before that people people are not socializing with each other face-to-face as much and so there's a little like awkward people that you know maybe around the Spectrum and maybe aren't there trying to ban clapping because you know they're going to ban people for real time with loud noises yeah fukin o l prince Andrew forced to scrap visit to flood-stricken your cuz he's called into crisis talks at Buckingham Palace how sad summoned Resa crisis talks all right now but he's clearly he was clearly at relationship without seeing it wasn't good I think I'm seeing knew how to do it yeah I mean nothing. Clinton so I flew with Epstein all the times 6 times as many times but that when Tony gets out at 4 whatever he's doing Tony looks like a like a like a feudal Lord that disemboweling chambermaid whenever they find the bodies in his yard you will be answering for that they're going to find home video of Tony with Joker costume like I'd like a feudal Lord that this about a chambermaid so whenever they find the bodies in his yard you will be answering for that they're going to find home video of Tony with Joker costume 100%</div>

Exposing yourself yeah that's the difference between someone who knows how to box a little bit and then starts lagging versus someone who's smart ride someone who understands that when you're going to try and be able to see everything start swinging and barely pay attention right you might land and might not go out still still have power it's not an absolute thing right but when you look at guys who are really good boxers like Floyd Mayweather does not get into f****** slugfest right you know he is actually cute everything down and breaking them down but that these guys did what they are as they both like at a similar level the reason why it's so fun to watch it's as though they're both like they can hit a little bit they both are good athletes and they're both kind of learning how to fight in the world super f****** Famous online yeah and then they get together and then they're even bigger terms of like entertainment value but I think if one of them learned how to just box just stay like a f****** Samurai and just box and never let that emotion get ahold of you hard to do it. fights like Here Comes Here Comes Here Comes it's happening rides like to all the preparation all your nightmares you getting knocked out all the weird feelings you like you get hurt and training you have to work around it still hurts me get in there all that stuff that they're dealing with when they go in there is like stand-up * a million like the thing about stand-up is it like if you do your prep work and you get your s*** together you could do it many many nights in a row correct they can't do that one chance one chance I just came out like s*** f*** I wish I could do that show again well they sometimes people have moments like that athletically like you just f***** up your chin was up high you came in swinging you got clipped once you got clipped in the first round you tried to box in the second and third and he takes you out in the 4th you like f*** if I just played my fight right and play my game right I could outbox them instead I did something stupid course by Chelsea Handler black sheets for the Gaza Strip and do Halo guys it's me Chelsea and ski gear man hello Tuskegee selfie Chelsea and ski gear men hello Tuskegee</div>

be the phone she was like the phone's going to be inside of them except the older ones close to you corrected what what else is the keys screen X green X big key ft Neptune didn't kill himself that's big that sounds that before they start Google she's the first met him wasn't because of his not being when I first saw like 911 road to tyranny was when the First videos of ever watch I like woah it's one of the First videos ever open my eyes up to certain conspiracies and one of them conspiracies of using agent provocateur is to incite violence and riots in sight that feeling of chaos yeah and then that these as an excuse for the police to come and start arresting people she does now it's no longer peaceful protest and it's they do it all when the cops come in and clean everybody up and then they actually made it a no protest Zone and Tristan a guy went through or woman I forget which but had a pen with a w t on it with a red line on it they told me how to take that pen off yeah date America yeah well it's just every every protest resistance movement has been infiltrated the FBI did a coin tell Pro Black Panther want to go into a safe house and then the police released them that starts with the police the police release them by their hair pink and like going to Portland and start throwing rocks at Ben Shapiro back then they were just allowed to wear ski masks and s*** what guys know what they're doing it forever yeah I know that's like standard operational procedure 100% blocking this is a weird time for conspiracies on mainstream which is that says Cornelius very smart guy you wrote the Franklin Scandal which is a book about the original Epstein thing like the original sex trafficking say what's that well the Franklin Scandal was a it was a scandal out of Omaha Nebraska to Franklin Credit Union where there was a guy who was embezzling money and then he was being investigated for that but he said he's all he has all this money because you kids to you know people in Washington DC and New York and it was a headline in the Washington Post of the washing times it would like to call boys get a tour of the Reagan White House you know this was the scandal with real victims wanted to testify and then people started dying in a private investigator they hired his plane broke up one of the girls that they testified was found guilty of perjury in the truth put in solitary confinement they had to use to grand juries in Omaha to get rid of this Scandal and it's what it now it's not as sexy as the blueprint for the government you know using marshalee resources do to silent people that were victims of this stuff this is not new Congressman Senators black male being used by intelligence agencies none of us knew was pioneered by the mafia you know telgian take Whitney Webb who lives in Chile and I've had quite a lot about this stuff you know this is you know if you want people to talk you need info you need to leverage there's nothing no more leverage than you having sex with somebody then they own you forever if they have photo audio video of you doing that so these things have been going on for a while one of the first but you know the guy who wrote Defending Brian called me today because I can't get any agents is very hard because like you know the reality is mainstream media is uninterested in in in a lot of these stories unless their current and their sexy and online friends people are only interested if they're insane so many of you he was there and they were like I was just try to give him an impromptu tour of Dallas because they were like his where Kennedy got wet and I'm like yeah this is how it happened how many people you think of stood there angry you look yeah I'm just trying to have a little fun sure surely could have been in on it he could have definitely been in on or you could have definitely been set up and he said those things are possible there it is so that's where he is and that's the building up there and see that's not that far I think they said it's just like a hundred and fifty yards or something like that it's not when you're actually there it looks even closer than that so you know how many yards was it Jamie find out how many yards Oswald had to shoot to hit Kennedy but it's totally doable and people that say that's not your crazy people that say that you can't load a gun that fast maybe you can't I bet you someone can do it faster than you guys use bolt action rifles fast as f*** yeah cuz I get off three shots in that amount of time I don't know but I'm not I don't think it's magic I don't think it's like something impossible he said was like that the scope was off like and what he said about the Scopes his hand a little bit drop it 183 m is what I just found hundred a3m from from the supposed location so I mean okay so where he went when he got the final shot was 200 yards separate I didn't know that 283 was 200 yards that's crazy kitchen said that the Kennedy assassination was the movement that the like that Moses the psychic movement of the 60 start likes that was a fraction of reality for a lot of people in the same way that maybe I've seen was where it just kind of Reddit saying that like 911 of course almost yeah you know Sim yeah no I'm not like those are the events you knew somebody 911 yeah probably bigger than you think it's possible that down the road not to the government like that but did they find out that it was a substantial cover-up you know we didn't know about Saudi Arabia their involvement for a while there's eat for 911 being done or who was involved in the I know that there was a bunch of hijackers and they flew planes and those buildings but who is behind that who the f*** knows you how would we know what part of what part of Saudi Arabia where they all came from a cool where they get their orders from like this yeah they said that thing to the flight the the rubbish the wreckage was scattered from miles I mean there's just no way that there's a lot of things about that day when you look back at it and you go it's just weird weird weird NCIS on attention attention to the flaws in his way of thinking core and the one who thinks he found out was that the version of tower 7 that most people see is a person is very quick it just implodes and it just falls down but from minutes before that you can watch the center of the thing collapse inside of it will Holograms when do Flames New York doesn't exist that's not what I want to see the uncut building a plane hit the Pentagon it's okay but just released that's weird show me the I want to believe the Rover on the f****** Moon's taking Beautiful video I don't know but I just want to know why we just as no one video we got to see if it isn't that crazy why am I crazy for saying can I just see one video of the thing happening that you said happened will did you know that movie this is not true in Jamie's going to be in the area in the Pentagon that got hit was refortified was the same area where they were doing the accounting yeah where they were trying to figure out where the trillion ours is missing that Rumsfeld was talking about just a I think the day before right what are you interesting situation did he say that there's like missing money of the Pentagon that held the accounting I don't think I tell you what I see if you see if you can Google the area of the Pentagon that was hit contain the accounting offices when I look at this picture I don't want to believe in anything that's the whole thing like I want there to be a Playa I want I want it all to be what it is I I know that we know that a bunch of leads were going to an island to have sex with underage girl cuz I know how much is this is true like this what is wrong with you no one's going to an island to f*** it but it's the same thing it's like now that that's on the table you look at other events in your life well we don't know necessarily Howell of these things happen that we don't know we don't know we don't know we just have to go there solicited conservative firefight like fire companies from Queens right but not by Long Island it like because they've gotten sick and stuff and these are not like crazy people do people just go listen we will dying from First Responders things we just you know we want to know exactly what the hell we breathed and what the hell's going on what's all the burning chemicals from the the basement of the building right was nothing idea is Macy's great saving people at night alone oh no she had an apartment that was near the site of the building that summer is running in the building I think you live down there Matthew have an apartment down there the wreckage was not going to the range this living this living in our apartment okay I think that's the the idea of course they're probably very sick you got to go back to work eventually write a week later two weeks later guess what they are still f***** up yeah I'm sorry to hear about Donna Summer yeah I'm pretty sure that's correct yeah a lot I just like 2,000 she was coming back she really stood out like a greatest hits album do you and your ad blocker you son of a b**** does ad blockers when New York City during 9/11 living at an apartment near Ground Zero. I became almost paranoid about breathing the air which was Heavy with a rancid odor in the months and years following $11 feelings intensify One Source tells us that when he was around. She would constantly spray some sort of disinfectant the air Danny Terrio the horse host of Dance Fever tells us when he was around Donna post 911 she would hang six sheets and ground on a post 911 she would hang six sheets in her dressing-room prevent dust from coming out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> alright season 5 of Fear Factor I remember thinking I don't know how much longer I can do this what was it about it that was really should too much repetitive it was the same thing over and over again we did a hundred 48 episodes right it was just after why I was just like Jesus Christ how many animal dicks can you serve people but I didn't have as much money back then and also it was a lot more money than I got the first time it was like a big deal cuz they were I think it was but it was a big deal it was going to come back but I'm mediately regretted it immediately had older daughter but I'd already paid for most of that do you think about 2 children and you think about two children that are like at the time too and one he like oh my God like this is this is serious that took care of my family for a long time ago probably okay but I felt like this overwhelming responsibility squirrel weigh more money more money digital sound level to return okay but what it was was the show had to get more more extreme it was very dangerous like it was freaking me out right cuz they were taking a lot more crazy risks like one of them you had to set of keys and you add your partner was handcuffed to a tree and they were attached to a bungee cord that was attached to a f****** helicopter okay in the helicopter was that has bungee cord taught and they're flying in the sky above a giant Canyon I mean way to f****** that right so you got these keys and you're working his keys and the idea was the first person to get the key lock open right you unlock the saying and then the person is shooting in the sky and I remember seeing him going terrorist don't let the terrorists take away your Fear Factor are coming in that are putting themselves in these positions know because I would have done it when I was broke moving on to a real career is Michael Yo Michael yeah right was on season 1 of Fear Factor episode yeah 148 episodes three people per episode for reality show on Food Network and they had me on Sat for about an hour and they were like yeah this is not I said I said like three things into the camera and they go none of this will ever this is not going to work</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I like I listen to your interview with Matt Taibbi and and you know the point I was thinking about it cuz you were talking about it politically how we're just leaving an echo Chambers now so you go on social media or republican you're only going to see stuff about it that caters to your view and algorithms or even optimized for that because they know that you'll click on that more and I will lead to more ad dollars yes so but it's similar with nutrition so you know if you're vegan you go on YouTube you can see vegan videos Indian perspective same with your Facebook feed etcetera and to be fair it's the same for young people who are into keto or low carb or carnivore or whatever they're into it's the same thing yeah you just getting this reinforcing confirmation bias you know supporting access to information that is a weird thing about social media algorithms is that they're giving you what you want to see what you would say all great well that's what I want to say it's like there's there's so there's so many counter-arguments what especially talking about nutrition science there's so many discussions on both sides of the fence and it seems like both sides are preaching to the choir yeah well you know I mean we're biased as you said my story is a lot of people knows I was vegan and somebody said videos use are the most vegan sounding non-vegan ever I mean yeah I was I was vegetarian I was raw food vegan macrobiotic vegan I have a lot of friends who are vegan at patient sitter vegan I have nothing against vegans and I totally get the reasons that people become vegan but I like Mike many others and my patients in my community my health was harm by that and and now I mean how was your health my digestion got really screwed up I got depressed I've never been depressed like I've never been a person who gets depressed I felt anxious I know it just was clearly not working for me and again I that's not to say it can't work for some people do you think the cause of depression had something to do with the diet because of the lack of cholesterol it's 12 hormones and yeah for sure but you know now I mean it's funny to some I don't actually I make a point of not reading comments usually yeah but occasionally I come across him on Twitter or something comedian I don't see any evidence that for elite athletic performers that it's the way to go and I don't know anyone that's an elite athletic performer that follows those diets maybe endurance endurance running if you want to include someone like that guy that ran the Appalachian Trail in 48 days whatever you did yeah I mean which is no small feat for sure but I mean Zack bit or ran but he bring on a 100 mile race in 11 hours and 40 minutes which is 40 something that which is f****** but no running and after that and you know you mentioned Scott jurek a Belgian Dennis shattered his record by five days a couple years ago and that guy was eating like Snickers and tons of crap so I'm I'm not saying that he did break it I broke it away from him again and then like Michael Phelps you know Guys pizza guy eats 12000 calories of like sugar Swiss French toast Pizza Usain Bolt in the Beijing linked with the Olympics when you shatter those records if you can't he ate a thousand over a thousand chicken nuggets I think somebody calculator I'm such an insane amount of calories for work 900 hard you can kind of almost eat anything when you're when you're in that mode yeah yeah this is obviously not comparable but we did sober October last year with his fitness challenge I was doing cardio no no joke at the minimum 5 hours a day sometimes six and seven it was insane and I was eating everything Box Cookies go pop bottles of soda my lost way too I did my not really a giant like coax like a Hanukkah I was drinking like a cream soda drink that s*** 2.8 kilograms per grams per kilogram of protein per day is the RDA and again that's just the basic minimum that's not the amount that's needed for Optimal Health and performance such as the absolute basics for not for what amount attrition however even that number now that's based on outdated nitrogen balance studies for determining the RDA and there's a newer method called the indicator amino acid oxidation technique r i a o Target should be 1.2 grams per kilogram and again just a basic minimum bare minimum not optimal so it's now gone up from 0.8 to 1.2 and if you use that number if you pull up slides AJ me that's only enough for an adult that weighs less than 130 lb study the average vegetarian get 71 grams a day which is not only do you know the RDA vit 70% more that's using 20.8 number but if you use 1.2 grams per kilogram per day then a lot of people are going to be protein deficient on a vegetarian diet and we're not again not talking about Optimum out for athletes were just talking about the RDA basic bare minimum they weren't referring to Vision so you actually could get egg protein and Dairy so so that's in a 1.2 is the RDA with if you use this newer method but for athletes James to his credit does acknowledge in the film in athletes need more protein than the regular non-athlete people but he doesn't say how much more so again if you use these methods they've done this newer technique to look at athletes and they found at the range is somewhere between 1.4 to 2.7 G so we're now way higher than that 0.8 number and just a fool people aren't familiar with kilograms let's say we take the median number there 2.1 grams per kilogram per day will anyone who's ever been in the bodybuilding weight lifting Community will recognize this that's one pound of protein per pound of body weight a day has been the common recommendation in that Community for gram of protein track even Arnold in the movie says I weigh 250 pounds are used to eat 250 grams of protein do you know like that's that's that I can do and there's nobody you know so a 200 pound athlete would need 200 grams of protein a day and Jamie if you pull up slide 10 this is what you have to eat on a vegan diet to get that amount of protein and again were just talking about quantity we're not talking about qualities 3 3 cups of cooked lentils 3 cups of chickpeas to cups of quinoa 3 oz of almonds three slices of silken tofu and 10 tablespoons of peanut butter that's the day he's good but the problem is the score for all of those like the bioavailability and amino acid profile would be horrible compared to meat eggs dairy what would I have to do cuz I know they've done this study there's a study that I'd read or heard about I should say where they compared rice protein to whey protein and they found that at a certain level of grams like whatever it was they had an equal effect is it lutein Lucy Lucy the muscle protein synthesis video today dr. Ryan Lowery and that they were saying that what that means is that correct me if I'm wrong but it is is when you get it once you hit a certain level of leucine it's a point of diminishing returns there's no there's no added benefit to having more leucine in your diet so if you hit whatever it is I think it was 48 grams or something like that have 48 grams of this and 48 grams of that you put the two of them together it's essentially the same this is the same effect well I'm not sure about that but I mean loosing is very important for anabolic signaling and muscle protein synthesis it's it's one of the essential it's the essential amino acids thought to be the most important for that and it's it's low in plant proteins and the other issue with plant proteins that you have is that they have limiting amino acids so these are amino acids that actually interfere with muscle protein synthesis is so because the levels are so low in that food so lysine is it at limiting amino acid in grains like wheat and rice maybe that's there was leucine and lysine discussion maybe there and then assigning and cysteine are limiting and legumes like soy ISO Jamie at slide 6 I made a chart comparing amino acid profile and beef to several different plant proteins like white beans soy beans peas and rice what you can see there is beef is higher in free single amino acid other than than every plant protein is compared there with the exception of soybeans are slightly higher in tryptophan than beef look at leucine so beef it's 2.23 vs 0.584 white beans 1.34 soy has higher and loosing than any other plant protein which is why it's often used and then like 0.34 peas and 0.014 rice if you get to a certain number or certain level of all these so if you ate enough food that you would pass a certain marker wood would it be possible to have the same effect by eating cooked peas or being it is possible a lot of vegan bodybuilders and athletes end up using protein powders because you can to those amounts Easier by using the powders and you can also blend like a PO 70% p with 30% rice to get the right amino acid ratio easier with powders so like Patrik baboumian is a good example of that you know I did you see the video that Bobby got Geist made none of his so there's actually a video on you know what he eats on a daily basis and it turns out to be a boatload of protein powder and just shakes with all kinds of powders and supplements and things like that so yeah we can go through it so he starts with a bunch of different supplements in the morning multivitamin nutritional yeast seeing glucosamine magnesium calcium B12 and iron they need has a protein shake with soy protein powder creatine and beta alanine which probably is because he's aware of the research showing goggles and muscle creatine and carnosine and in vegans beta alanine and creatine with a dress that has a post-workout smoothie with soy or pea protein powder glutamine beta alanine creatine and dried greens and then his first solid meal of the day is fried falafel french fries soy sausage fried peppers and tomatoes and then he has two more protein shakes and smoothies throughout the day so I don't know strike me as a super healthy way to eat what what do you equip rum do you have that well first of all I think we should primarily get nutrients from food whenever we can I'm not again supplementation I think there's a role for it of course like you know especially with things like vitamin D that you might not be able to get enough of from food or therapeutic supplementation if you're dealing with the health problem but like getting them like eating a diet that is not sufficient in the amount of nutrients that you need and then using supplements pick up you know to to address that doesn't make a lot of sense to me well in his situation he's got a very unique situation that he's a he's a strength athlete that's all he's doing is trying to lift a really really heavy thing so he needs to maintain a certain amount of bulk have an enormous amount of protein protein and he's very heavy you know and that that sport is also that's a steroid sport I mean it's just one of those Sports where it's like body Matt everybody steroids p*** I'm so you eating massive amounts of quantities taking chemicals yeah it might not be the healthiest thing but it's also like just the sport itself might not be the healthiest thing I'm you seen them carry people on the he was doing that the intelligent way if you want to be vegan and do what he's trying to do right I don't know if he could eat just vegetables and pull that off couldn't but that's kind of the point there are a lot of other strong man that do just like Robert over that you had on the show a lot of the strongman like the guy who played Gregor in Game of Thrones top of the food chain strongest man in the world competitions it's not it's not a comprar Lee different weight class the problem is in the film they don't make that distinction and they try to pretend that this guy is one of the strongest man in the world he's not he's very strong no doubt and he definitely is broken some records and some competitions and you know and do you have different weight classes and different but you're not talking about a guy who wins those you know Magnus Von magnusson f****** competitions where they're carrying trucks and s*** how an athlete can thrive on a plant-based Whole Foods diet I think it is though because for him for his size you know fruit to be a guy who's 5 foot 7 in scaring that f****** enormous amount always obviously doing something that's very impressive and he's doing it while he's on this vegan diet and again I mean just the discounting all the illegal supplementation because I don't think it is illegal in that sport it's tight you kind of have to do it because you want to get that big but if you want to do it and good as a vegan he is showing you that it's possible so in that sense I defend what he's doing because I think that he like that's the only way in that this is a very sport specific area of a performance you just talkin about lifting insanely heavy s*** and then he's doing that since arriving on a vegan diet yeah no doubt you know enormously strong and he's succeeding I would argue that he might do even better if he was eating meat and nutrient that more nutrients what are you that he might do even better if he was eating meat and nutrient that more nutrient night food and he might need to take fewer supplements and drink last powder Whole Foods person and you know that's where I'm coming from</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> a problem that I had in the filming especially in relations to sport is the Nate Diaz Conor McGregor comparison of all Nate Diaz is not a vegan Nate Diaz eats fish and he eats ex and he he does try to follow a whole food vegan diet I think during Camp so I have to talk to him about that I know he's done interviews talking about that but I've definitely seen him eat fish or watch them on the Anthony Bourdain television show and he was eating fish I know he's eating eggs he doesn't eat land animals I think what he does is avoids red meat, fish and eggs take care of it you know fish is actually higher often and then meet in terms of protein a ounce ounce for ounce it's also very high in collagen which is super important for recovery and repair and explains the lack of collagen probably explains why a lot of vegan athletes get injured which we can talk about more later and then eggs as you know or super you know they're really high on the DS yes score scale their bioavailable lots of other nutrients so here's another problem with that hole comparison first of all Nate Diaz is a fantastic fighter he's bezo longtime mixed martial arts veteran he's outstanding in all areas he has a fantastic submission game his brother Nick Diaz won the best in the world is also outstanding and all in his brother Nick I believe is vegan he's probably a better example cuz you know I'm even though Nick hasn't beaten like some of the Top Flight fighters in a few years back when he was in Strikeforce who's top of the food chain he seasonally Fighter for sure I'm not sure if use vegan back then I'll have to ask him what the point being that Nate is a exceptional exceptionally skilled athletes and he was coming in that fight on extremely short notice so he was most likely following his off Camp diet which is eggs and eating fish and things on those not anything you said was partying Mexico so who knows what the f*** he was doing was like 11 days out they call him and they set up his fight I forget how many days. It was very short amount of time Connor Was preparing for 155 lb fight against hop El dos anjos so he was reducing his caloric intake dropping his weight down to try to make this hundred 55 lb weight class it's a big cut for him so when when you do that you you are in anticipation of the person you're fighting is also doing that so you both kind of agree that you're going to be in a certain weakened State when you actually weigh in $155,000 I don't like to weight classes below is normal let me go make this is that was the first and only time is it well except that rematch with Nate was the only time they spotted 170 so they made a decision to fight at 170 instead of 155 cuz Nate did not have time to reduce his calories and cut the way and it takes a long time it's a slow process of needs a big fella he walks around probably over 200 pounds easy and he drops weight and he didn't want to drop that much when he's a big guy that he's big and long and Connor dropping his weight down to 155 Suite 10 days out and just start the packing on food eating as much food as you can not only that but stylistically Nathan nightmare for him Nate has a f****** evil submission game he's tough as Nails his endurance is always fantastic because offseason he's always doing triathlons and he's always doing like a during Sports me he's in phenomenal shape and is Jiu-Jitsu so many levels better than Connors me he's a Jet top of the food chain MMA black belt in Jiu-Jitsu so they have this fight Conor gets tired they beat them up get snow on the ground submit some and they're saying this is a victory for veganism what they don't say is 5 months later they fought and Connor beat them they fought again they they fought they decide they are full training camp, prepared and was a very close by to should say you could have you could have scored in either way I mean it's it was a really close by razor-thin but the fact remains Connor beat him in the rematch turn into lead us out of the narrative like vegans are dominating look he can dominate it but he's you know what this is up last minute by Connor goes up and wait Nate Diaz you know steps in and takes care of business and wins the fight but it speaks more to how good Nate Diaz is that a vegan diet at 4 months later 5 months later whatever it was he loses like a certain window of it but they don't show what happens afterwards we talked about the vegan honeymoon so Bryan Jennings the boxer yes they talked about you we went vegan and 30 2013 with 17 an hour before he's vegan and he's been so you 7 and 4 after that so you can't say that that's because he transitioned to a vegan diet but you can also say Nork nor can you say that veganism improve his performance write objectively he gotten worse since then well argument against that would be that he's moving up into the upper echelons of the heavyweight Division and it's filled with Killers again he combat Sport and that as he got in many fighters don't make it to get in and he lost to one of the klitschkos yes I think he lost Vladimir I think he lost his Latimer Klitschko and a decision and that he handled himself very well is very good fight for him he look real good but yeah mean that upper loan you get to the Sandy Ruiz Deontay Wilder I mean Killers like not most people to get up into that Division I start losing a good example to this principle of context being everything cuz he's in the film my early years growing up in Philly the only thing we knew spinach in a can collard greens and Popeyes KFC everybody frying chicken I grew up not even knowing about half these other vegetables asparagus to me just came out like 5 years ago do you know a really good honeymoon. Going from going from like a crappy standard American diet to A Whole Foods diet I don't doubt that someone's going to feel better but what do you think that felt better like you said eating some grass-fed bison and some a bellini and along with all of those plant that's the question</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you want to talk about fake meat sure yeah I know but it is much in the film really understands it to talk about it so people get this could be a standalone Club so just for people who know where their companies like impossible Burger &amp; Beyond meat that are promoting this idea of fake me that tastes like me and but it's made typically from so I so impossible burgers Main Ingredient Source or GMO soy coconut oil sunflower oil flavors beyond meat is pea protein isolate canola oil unrefined coconut oil so impossible Burger has publicly criticized holistic Land Management and regenerative agriculture and saying it's not really that different acting in fact sometimes the emissions can be even more than feedlot beef but there was a third-party lifecycle analysis full lifecycle say looked at the whole process not just cause burping but the whole process at White Oak pastures which is a beef operation to the Savory Institute Hub so they're following us that regenerative Savory Institute practices and they found it there beef operation with a net carbon sink so again it actually sequestered carbon from the atmosphere was not admitting carbon it was you know Carbon not not neutral it was taking carbon out with cows is just to add a certain amount of seaweed to their diet when you add a certain amount of seaweed to your to their diet apparently mitigates the meth in the methane issue I don't know about that yeah I think that they'd find that Jamie that's something that was offered up as a response to I don't think it's a large amount of seaweed I think it's a fairly small amount of seaweed in percentage of the overall diet I think the amazing thing about the regenerative livestock or holistically managed store grassland the Computing to restore the soil improve the soil so you're not only producing this amazing nutrient-dense bioavailable food source you're actually improving the soil and helping to reverse this really dramatic threatening problem that we're facing of soil seaweed can help make cows burp less methane and cut their carbon footprint LOL diet supplemented with red algae could lessen the huge amount of greenhouse gases emitted by cows and sheep we can just figure out how to grow enough so I guess I have to wonder where those how about you know what's what kind of energy is being used so back to this so this this life cycle analysis at White Oak pastures showed that this holistically managed beef actually removes carbon from the atmosphere now this is the same company that performed a life cycle analysis for impossible Burger on their fake meat and what they found in that analysis was that the fake meat was less you know of a greenhouse gas better than feedlot beef but it was still actually an emitter whereas the holistically managed beef was taking carbon out of the atmosphere it was the same company so you know if we're going to take give them credit for the analysis they did for impossible Burger we have to give them credit for the analysis that they did for White Oak pastures impossible Burger so the primary ingredient is called soil egg hemoglobin or slh so this is a engineered protein additives that adds meat like tasting color it does not meet the basic FDA generally recognized as safe the grass designation because it's not a food or even a food ingredient and there's a document you can get I think it came with the Freedom of Information Act its online I have the reference in my show notes and in the discussion in the stocking it with the FDA impossible Foods admitted that up to a quarter of a team ingredient was composed of 46 expected additional proteins some of which are unidentified and none of which were assessed for safety in a dicier impossible Burger put the product on the market despite admitting to the FDA privately that they haven't done adequate safety testing and according to these documents quote FDA believes that the arguments presented individually and collectively do not establish the safety of slh so I laid hemoglobin for consumption or do they point to a general recognition of safety so they don't know what the f*** it does what's in it but it doesn't do anything doesn't mean it's bad just haven't done an adequate safety testing tours in the opinion of the FDA to release this as a food product the company to do the test on this impossible Burger versus the regenerative what is that company again Qantas International and so it's the one did they're the ones who released the information for both studies the same company that did it for impossible burger and they turned around and did it for White Oak pastures and they found in pots Burger still emitting carbon where is White Oak pastures is taking it out I think it that's that's very critical 0.20 criticizing fake meat by this woman Dana pearls who's the part of an environmental organization called friends of the earth and she says quote instead of investing in Risky new food technologies that are potential problems masquerading as Solutions shouldn't we be investing in proven beneficial regenerative agriculture and Trent organic food that consumers are actually demanding the only issue that they would have with this is yes but now you're talkin about killing animals and we're absolutely morally and ethically opposed to killing animals I mean we go back now to this this 2018 paper that I mentioned earlier that examine the impact of plant agriculture on animal deaths and found 35 to 250 Mouse deaths per acre Mouse Death Mouse death deaths of my and up to seven 3 billion animals killed every year from plant agriculture if you count Birds killed by pesticides fish stuff from fertilizer runoff plus reptiles and amphibians poisoning from eating toxic insects from the pesticides 7.3 billion animals kill over year in terms of life there's far more life taken by plant agriculture then there is life taken by animal agriculture even factory farming I'm not killing 7.3 billion cows right so the question is do we value the larger animals more are they are fish and insects less significant life-forms animals are small mammals like root rodents less valuable than larger ones like cows is it better to kill many small animals for food like grains and legumes or Turnberry nutrient-dense and don't meet our nutritional needs than fewer large animals that are super nutrient dense I mean I'm not claiming to have these questions but I think their questions that haven't been adequately raised and addressed in this ethical argument they haven't even been breached and this is one that people dismiss offhandedly this is his bees are alive by meat eaters to justify their their consumption but what you're saying is it it is ethically different than animals being killed as a sort of side effect of plant agriculture saying that that's valid argument but I've heard that argument make it to value a valid argument cuz once you're aware of it you're doing it the same it's like the argument about with people when they say that I don't kill animals but I eat meat therefore it's better than what you do because I hunt and I say we know you're killing animal with your credit card awkward you're killing an animal you just get hiring someone to do it for you you still go to jail for murder if you hire someone shoot somebody and then you're more disconnected from the whole process barbazzar it's the whole thing is very very strange I think that's very important though that you listed those those numbers that data cuz that's irrefutable and it's one of those arguments it comes up that they just want to bury their hands head of the sand about if you're buying agriculture unless you have unless you have your own organic farm where you are 100% aware of every single aspect from seed to plucking and cooking if you're not if you're buying from large-scale agriculture you're part of the death machine that's right and you're also part of the environmental destruction machine because he's huge and industrial-scale monocropping operations are incredibly harmful for the environment and if you know if you if you again like you think is like pea protein you know that's an incredibly processed food like the amount of first of all this growing peas at the scale you're going to need to have the world's largest pea protein company all of the processing that needs to happen from taking a pee too isolated protein powder which involves fossil fuels and all kinds of industrial processes that is not an environmentally friendly process so you know is that better for the planet than having cows that are you know being raised on in on land that couldn't be used for growing plants or other crop production and rotating the animals in the weight storage grasslands and improve the health of the soil that actually sequesters and removes carbon from the atmosphere that again like Dana pearls was saying makes a lot more sense it's a proven system then like scaling up industry to make more powders yeah scaling-up industry to make pea powder and killing Untold numbers of rodents in the process or natural habitat yeah scaling-up industry to make pea powder and killing Untold numbers of rodents in the process or just drying natural habitat features you don't have the Habitat For Those Animals anymore</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> all of the people who are amazing athletes who they didn't start out vegan they weren't born you know two vegan parents and then were vegan growing up and then you know how to make all these amazing records in performance they built their strength or their agility or their speed or whatever on a diet with animal products and then at some point they became vegan and you know maybe their performance continue to continue to do well like Scott jurek or Dottie bow or maybe they had the vegan honeymoon where they did well for a while and then decline or maybe they just decline like some of the NBA and NFL athletes we talked about but this is a critical point because there a key developmental. When we were kids and also in utero that like if if you're not getting the nutrition you need then it's going to carry through to your whole life yes and so it's like what did your parents eat what did that your mom eat when she was breastfeeding you what did you eat as a young kid so we follow that whole argument through if everyone becomes plant-based it's going to have a huge intergenerational impact on performance it's not like people who built their strength and performance eating meat and then they go vegan they do okay for a little while it's like what are the consequences of that happening that were the consequences of growing up a nutritionally deficient pregnant and becoming deficient during pregnancy and then the baby being breastfed by Mom whose nutrient deficient and then the kid being fed a vegan diet and developing beat B12 deficiency which then becomes your reverse has irreversible effects are there any top of the food chain world champion vegan athletes like the best of the best well there is no. There's no vegan UFC Champions World Champion vegan boxer alien do you know him he's the weight weightlifter that I think in the same weight class is Kendrick Farris it was in the film two-time Olympic champion where I don't I don't think Kendrick has one he's not want to Gold Medal stripped of his title is because he tested positive for steroids bro once again give me the old from the RR was he in the film he was originally supposed to be for them if I'm pronouncing his name correctly use that he's like the freerunner parkour guy who was going to be in the film and then he had this very public I'm not vegan anymore cuz it was just wearing my house video on YouTube for the first time it was like poor bastard he was doing everything but he did a 30-day water fast everything to stay on the vegan diet I'm going to eat salmon sharp teeth that all comes from Milton Mills a 1987 paper from him he's an emergency room physician has no training a medical anthropology or comparative Anatomy or anything like this he is a creationist Halo he thinks that we were just built less way and with the so how come we don't have the teeth to that you know how come you can't just grab a squirrel and eat it I've actually heard a guy say that while he f**** face how come you can't eat lentils you got to boil them what are you talkin about man. Try eating cassava without cooking it you'll die after lengthy cooking yeah I mean going back to your question I'm sure there are high-level vegan athletes but the thing is a lot of the people who commonly referred to like the view that the Williams sisters Serena and Venus are not vegan them in the film and I was like wait a minute they're not vegan because they're often people often called them vegan occasionally will have periods of veganism I gather that they're not vegan they eat meat animal products on Brady is another example of what it looks like a mediator predominantly plant-based I guess but eats meat especially in the winter William sisters so powerful I mean it would be a great like cats for that team if they were vegan just like look at the athleticism that these girls have but no but it was weird they didn't say they were they just showed them I saw you like I do they're the best they don't need to say it country bride, show me a picture what is he doing I do that f*** Epic Meal Time we did a video with them like 5 years ago eating 80000 calories steak and egg sandwich he didn't you know he didn't he wasn't then when I pushed all of his athletic of course he did everything spectacular with meat and now he send you good news it's ya you know I'm sure vegans would take issue with that guy arguing with someone about this once I talked about the season I'm 90% vegetarian and this was his argument like that like vegetarians way2go I'm 90% that doesn't make any like I said before all it takes is it a little because like organ meats and shellfish and fish and eggs are so nutrient-dense you have to eat a lot of them to get to get meet your nutrition information evidence of intelligence there an older creature and they're they're just dumb hunks of meat you can scoop out of a container and we have no idea you're there they have just basic movement with a clamp shot that's it I mean they're not going to stop no they're not trying to get away like a fish mollusks just f****** way there and they happen to be like I said that's and that's always been associated with male virility important how many different functions yes and that's always been associated with male virility important how many different functions that are also</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> B12 you know that's the thing that came up in the film a number of times so we should talk about that a little bit because there was some actually just factually inaccurate information about B12 and I want to correct so they claim this is 555 Jamie James said B12 is not made by animals it's made by bacteria that the animals consume in the soil and water before industrial farming fire mantle in humans can get me 12 a.m. traces of dirt on plant Foods or by drinking water from rivers or streams but now because of pesticides and antibiotics and chlorine kill bacteria this vitamin even harm animals as far as that's all just factually wrong so first of all. But it's animals don't get it from consuming Soil and Water the the so in ruminants like cows the in the room in which is a chamber in the stomach the bacteria convert Cobalt that they get from grass if they eat into cobalamin which is B12 and then they are forgot fermenter so they can absorb the B12 Vape the bacteria produce in their intestines and utilize that themselves so primates including humans also have bacteria that make B12 but we're hindgut fermenters so we cannot absorb the B12 that our own got bacteria make well that's not exactly true chimps and gorillas can but that's only because they eat their own poo that is one potential strategy for meeting your beautology so we cannot get B12 from around got bacteria and that end if there is any B12 in soil it's only from manure you know that's come from animals there is also zero evidence that B12 is fed to cattle and there's no evidence that humans have ever been able to meet their B12 need from just eating Soil and Water if you put 556 Jamie Jack Norris she was a vegan dietitian we don't agree on a lot of things that I appreciate his rig with the science he has a big article on B12 on this website and it said he says the suggestion that humans have ever relied on unclean organic produce vitamin B12 doesn't have any reliable evidence at this time so I don't know where to go with these that claim cuz it's I don't know why you said that either but I just think that that's something he probably heard he's probably having a conversation with someone and they told him that and he just repeated it I mean it's one of those my maybe one of the doctors on the show so don't people repeat a lot of these things and then they become Dogma so here's the other thing that the second part of that claim was up to 39% of people test including meteors are low on B12 as a result best way for humans get enough B12 whether they eat animal fries or not is simply to take he didn't provide a reference for that so I can't it's hard to check that but again this contradicts you know mounds of evidence on B12 deficiency so there you know there's there's four stages of B12 deficiency I don't want to go too far in the weeds here but basically serum B12 which is the marker that usually used only goes down in the fourth and final stage of B12 deficiency there are other markers that will go out of range earlier that are more sensitive and detect those earlier stages so that the most sensitive holotranscobalamin are whole OTC so into studying 2013 this is 558 Jamie they compared B12 deficiency depletion according to holotranscobalamin levels and vegetarian vegans and omnivores and you can see the results here only 11% of omnivores had B12 depletion 77% of vegetarians and 92% of vegan that's a pretty big difference big difference a big difference how is responsible for energy and that's why the reasons why when people were feeling sick to get a B12 shot will it's also required for the myelin sheath in our nerves B12 deficiency can cause serious need an irreversible neurological damage a lot of the harm that comes that happens with kids on a vegan diet comes from B12 deficiency can decrease fluid intelligence that can cause neurological damage that's not reversible even after they start eating meat again maybe that's what's going on with them legitimate neurological damage is that possible it's possible there is no running about one more time just passing about this cuz it's super important 559 so homocysteine is a marker that is also more sensitive than serum B12 it's a sticky inflammatory Protein that's associated with heart disease and dementia so 9 out of 10 comparisons it looked at B12 levels or homocysteine levels in vegetarians and omnivores found higher hummus levels in vegans and vegetarians higher means worse and it means more B12 deficient and in fact the study they said the prevalence of hyper homocysteine emia which is high homocysteine levels reflecting low B12 among vegetarian may actually be higher than among non-vegetarians already diagnosed with heart disease so this is kind of a big deal it's like the B12 issue is serious and even folks like Jack Norris to their credit do ignore and strongly recommend that people who are on a vegan diet supplement so if people watch this film you know I'm glad to hear James saying that that vegetarians and vegans should supplement I don't think omnivores need to usually but you can watch that film and get the idea that B12 you know is maybe not that big of a deal the big deal you know I'm glad to hear James saying that that vegetarians and vegans should supplement I don't think omnivores need to usually but you can watch that film and get the idea that B12 you know is maybe not that big of a deal the big deal</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what else was a bummer well you want to talk about the boners you entirely hilarious ruthlessly unscientific and like the whole thing with the guy saying you know I'm going to eat with a gorilla eat when they're showing this guy who's protecting rhinos who being slaughtered for their for their horns like what does that have anything to do with eating meat they're morally equating eating exactly what they're doing is pretty obvious what they were doing even though they didn't say that themselves to indisputable cause everybody wants people to stop shooting rhinos for their horns everyone does if you don't you're an a****** don't eat meat they are parents bed to the urologist and he puts penis rings on bunch of NFL players and then he looks it measures the effects of different meals on their erections both the the the circumference I guess the size of the direction the duration and intensity of the directions so he feeds the players burritos with me and them and then he feeds them the same burrito with like a plant protein or not sure what it was Tempe nothing like that and then he claimed beans okay maybe he claims that the athletes who ate the Pure Plant burritos had 500% more frequent erections and also increased strength of erections so what can we conclude from this experiment absolutely nothing because it was just an experiment it was made up and down in a film it was not pure reviewed there was no it's not scientific at all open scientific if they did it in different orders so they put the the the penis band on the dudes one night they had to meet whatever the f*** they had to me you know I think was steak burritos and then the next night they put the penis bands on them again and they have them eat beans and so they say they got more erections did you guys jerk off in between then did you guys have sex did you get used to having the penis band on when you slept with it the first bother you didn't interrupt your sleep at the second time when you're more comfortable with it did you guys try to reverse it one day the first day on a different group of people give them the band and make them eat a vegetarian diet and the next day give them the band on the second day and make the meat steak did you did you switch that out you can ask any number of questions and that's the whole point is that's why we have science we have a process of peer review that's why we have reproducibility meaning even if one group comes up with one finding it's not really until somebody else reproduces that something like ninety 90% or more of findings scientific findings are not reproduce that's that means that we can't trust them so I would like to know if they were asked to not engage in sexual intercourse or masturbation during that time. Because that would that would make sense that they were getting more erections and more Fuller erections next day of the young guys that are no Savages football diets are better for erectile function and in lower the risk of erectile dysfunction couldn't find anything I did find studies one study of Mediterranean diet which includes animal totem animal products produced erectile dysfunction relative to a low-fat diet your animal products diet quality is more important so high in processed foods rich in flavonoids containing foods with B that's fruits and vegetables reduced erectile dysfunction but none of that says it has anything to do with me just says like don't need a junk food diet I don't want erectile dysfunction yeah it's just deceptive another did get more hard on under that circumstance but as you said what does that mean what does it mean and can we even dressed it I mean frankly given some of the other stuff in the snow it does show that those guys did get more hard-ons under that circumstance but I just said what does that mean what does it mean and in can we even dressed it I mean frankly given some of the other stuff in the film right can you trust it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so then there is a whole section that you probably remember about chicken and fish causing cancer dairy products causing cancer they started just really kind of went from just like you can do well on a plant-based diet as an athlete to like animal products are horrible and I'm going to kill you there which was a big leap so they had one study Cancer Institute founded vegetarians had one or more servings per week of white me like chicken and fish more than triple the risk of colon cancer that's scary you know I don't want to Triple my risk of colon cancer but again if you look at the totality of the research slide 42 Jamie 2017 a meta-analysis of 16 perspective studies with with almost two and a half million participants found no increase in cancer risk from consuming fish or poultry and then you have a leaving from the American Cancer Institute itself saying as for other animal products organizations that do comprehensive evidence reviews to make dietary recommendations currently do not recommend against poultry like chicken turkey ground or fresh fish or dairy so where's that coming from then one study that looked at Seventh-day Adventist who added some of those Foods back into their diet this is a perfect example of healthy user bias because Seventh-day Adventist or not supposed to so if you have a Seventh-Day Adventist who's bucking the trend who's who's rebelling and eating me then what else are they doing that is also not healthy and not following the dictates of that healthy lifestyle and it was what I called him SDA Rebels you know that they're supposed to eat vegetarian but they what else are they doing that I mean the reason why this is relevant is this is the only study that we know of the does show a correlation between there might be other individual studies that do but this is why we have these large reviews that look at you know this one looked at 16 studies with two and a half million participants and found no association and that's why you have groups like the American Cancer Institute USA can't do that people been told to avoid red meat that I said there's no risk at all eating red meat we're taking that off of the list of foods to avoid and everybody went at hate they just went ape shitt let's talk about the lack of a better term papers all in one review it was millions of participants they reviewed all of the available literature on red meat and its relationship with any disease heart disease cancer type 2 diabetes it was dozens of studies following people for up to 35 years and millions again millions of participants he looked at randomized controlled trials they looked at observational cohort study Etc and they found quote only low or very low certainty evidence that red meat causes any kind of disease and then in the editorial in the animals which is what it was published annals of internal medicine the journal was published and they said quote this is 519 Jamie over and over again they the authors stress that even if the results were statistically significant their certainty was low and the flute differences seen were small and potentially confounded meaning could have been that they were smoking more drinking more or Rhino not exercises whatever the editorial also said this is sure to be controversial but it's based on the most comprehensive review of The Evidence to date because that reviews inclusive those who seek to dispute it will be hard-pressed to find appropriate evidence with which to build an argument unless you have a nice documentary yeah yeah really frustrating thing for people's also recommend process it's unprocessed and processed so the dogmen always been wild to stay away from processed meat and you could have really no difference with fresh but some difference for the process red meat you know I think you could make a strong argument that process too much processed meat might be harmful because of things like and nitroso compounds that are formed etcetera but even then you have to consider contacts most popular eating hotdogs with buns and french fries and big gulps well it might this probably a different effect and having bacon a couple times a week with your Whole Foods diet or having some salami and nuts you know not the same as eating you know fake processed meat all the time and it's weird about this whole conversation is it there's a Battleground Silicon Valley gets thrown out there like this like boom it's okay to eat red meat and see the side scrambling to refute the evidence and and then fire back with all these epidemiology studies that show that red meat and kill you and red meats cause you to age quicker or red meat kills your boners and red meat does this and does that and it's like it's a religious war going on religious war going on it's the same weird thing we're talking about earlier now when you have some kind of political event or some event that happened that gets spun know if you go watch CNN it's going to get spun one way if you go watch box it's going to get the funny either way it's the same event but you can have these totally different interpretations yeah</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> a lot of someone's reenactments as well you know like when James is sitting there with the knee braces on that was not after surgery happening back into the Journey of starting as an omnivore and then you know having this real Disney's realization turning into a vegan but the problem was that Journey happened long before the film was me exact name that was a little disingenuous nothing at the end my boo boo I'm done just didn't our Pro if you did an hour you'd be f****** drenched with sweat you be exhausted you wouldn't they sprayed you or something like that by this fine I believe you really did that I don't believe he's a liar but like you said he's clearly why it's weird because that's clearly acting do you recreating these moments but it's billed as a it right marketed as documentary cuz he's talking about it having just happened right after we switched over to a vegan diet all the sudden could do an hour on the battle ropes and then they fill me up able to swallow and gat you know and I'd like the scenes of him doing a self-defense demonstration could you get to see he truly is a fantastic martial arts really doesn't know his stuff that's a lot of great aspects to that I like I said I like that guy a lot but there's a lot of f***** in this movie man so I mean a couple of the most ridiculous things from the movie Get the boners we can get the boner 64 remember this morning this is the guy who's like in Africa he was a former Special Forces sniper items and he says this whole fantasy we need to eat me to get our protein it's actually b******* I mean look at a gorilla Grill f*** you up in 2 seconds what is a gorilla eat I just do the same things these big great things out here that we're trying to protect elephant rhino KFC what is a gun is a tool how do we develop tools cuz we started eating meat and fish and we came down out of the trees and we weren't spending more than half of our waking hours eating leaves and low-calorie fruits you know we don't like comparing our digestive like what we should eat with the gorillas just asking if that's a problem because they say bring that up all the time they say we have the same digestive tract as an herbivore that's just not true this objectively false the large for a gorilla the largest volume volume of their digestive tract is in their large intestine which is ideal for breaking count tough Foods in fiber seeds in those kinds of plant Foods where is in humans the largest volume of our digestive tract is in the small intestine what which is better for absorbing nutrients bioavailable foods like meat and cooked Foods cook tubers and things like that in order to get the amount of protein strong and 40 to 60 pounds of food a day and they're eating for more than half of their waking hours so it's really you know that's just not comfortable at all to compare us to to be also had a really different genes is the same thing as strong as an ox Knox without eating meat have you ever seen an ox eating meat while I say have you ever seen a human with six different stomach standing in a field eating you know grass for 14 hours a day the quality of the argument being made it did it really does know when they're like you dispute it that's the problem when you know that's why I bring you aboard I'm in and then there was the Anthropologist women remember that mean in the end we're sheet. That's where I really started rolling my eyes cuz she was making the arguments that humans have always followed a plant-based diet did you remember that part okay so where to start with that so I mean we've got isotope studies that show that humans have been eating meat at least two and a half million years and if you go back even before we are really actually human there's a lot of evidence now that are chimpanzees testers were also eating vertebrates and it's one of the biggest shocks for people has been the observation that chimps hunt and they kill other Aunt monkeys and other animals and eat them I mean it kind of blew apart like this whole idea of primates only being you know eating plants and if that happen if if an animal evolves complex Behavior like hunting or tool use in order to eat certain food it means that food has a lot of value or else that that behavior wouldn't have evolved but then we have bone collagen studies let me see if I can find the slides Jamie so that's 47 and 48 so these are bone collagen isotope studies are much more accurate than some of the previous methods used and that the earliest hominids that were study but these were neanderthals so there's three Studies have been done and Neanderthal groups ranging from 130000 to 28000 years ago and then they compared those isotope levels with contemporary species and they found that neanderthals were similar to top-level carnivores so they all derive the vast majority of their protein from animal sources likely to be large herbivores and then on the next slide 48 why is there a pterodactyl fly in the background while they bullshiting us things Live 60 f****** million years before that's so stupid you know there's a limit to what stock photography what's a Homosapien which is only $500,000 you got stock photo well let's talk about Homo Sapien so there were there two two stable isotopes bone collagen Studies have been done with modern humans Homo sapiens sapiens in the first group was 13000 years ago instead of 240 thousand years ago unlocked which is in France and they also found that they were predom yo carnivores large herbivores but the French group consumed a more diverse next protein including Seafood so the fossil record clearly clearly indicates that humans were humans and Neanderthal Homo sapiens and Neanderthals eating a lot of meat either lame anatomical argument that we have you know relatively flat molars like herbivores do and we don't have claws we don't have sharp canines I guess what we got Forks we've got nice and we got fire we've got fire to cook our food I'll be at 5 for a long time that make those anatomical characteristics that do lion or you know her or carnivorous animal has unnecessary I mean that's that's just like Anthropologie animal food consumption among hominids and the argument that human beings over 2 million years ago the doubling of the human brain size corresponds with the learning how to hunt the end of tool marks on Bones correspond directly with the doubling of brain volume to reduction in our got volume which indicates a move to a more nutrient-dense diet the increase in the volume of our small intestine relative to our large intestine and then what's called the graceful ization of our job which means our teeth job became less robust and that's thought to be an adaptation to more digestible nutrient-dense bioavailable food we're not like chewing cud or chewing on leaves or low-calorie fruit like a gorilla is all day in this argument about nutrient density this is why this that that term is very important because people always want to use that for plant-based Foods nutrient dense plant-based Foods meat is far more nutrient-dense per calorie per ounce keto acid profile with essential nutrients yeah so it's essential meaning nutrients that we can't manufacture our own and that we absolutely need organ meats are actually at the top of the list in terms of the nutrient density organ Meats in shellfish take the cake then you have herbs and spices are actually pretty high too and then you have other you do muscle needs eggs all those things foods like grains and legumes or tend to be towards the bottom of the list what's vegetables in it in the mail right but that sound good nutrient dense plant-based food sounds good it sounds like you're doing the right thing in this is like there with his lingos coming from I mean this is where I argue that plants do belong because of plants do have certain nutrients phytonutrients fibers and things that actually don't see us but see our gut Flora did I do think are important even though they're not considered essential vitamin B12 or vitamin or something like that I do think they're still important any other raw what I'm talking about is a difference between caveman altering its diet or the modern Ancient Man altering their diet and is doubling of the human brain size corresponding with consuming More nutrient-dense Foods what that means is meat yeah absolutely living in coastal region bioavailable nutrient-dense Foods definitely Mentor living in coastal region has more about bioavailable nutrient-dense Foods definitely what weather Salinas this is the anthropology argument that just doesn't seem to fit any of the state-of-the-art sign doesn't fit yeah I completely contradict</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> there's another thing that was deceptive or at least it confused people that's when they made them eat a bean burrito and they checked their blood and then maybe you know with me without me they measure their blood afterwards big surprise if the people who eat meat which has more fat and more saturated fat had cloudy or but well that's normal that's just naturally what you would expect from your process of eating feet you was temporarily have more fat in your blood has nothing to do with health so what is better for you function cuz they're clean was that eating the animal protein reduces your endothelial functioning and it increases inflammation so this there there was one study a lot of the there are a couple studies that show a low-carb diet impairs endothelial function but they tend to be short-term like 4 weeks that look for longer-term studies there was a 2009 study that followed subjects for 12 weeks find a low-carb diet actually improved and a thelio function where is a low-fat diet decreased it and then there was a 2007 study that followed subject for a year and there was no change in endothelial function on a low-carb diet we actually there's strong evidence that high blood sugar and insulin resistance impair endothelial function so you know low carb diet that would lower your blood sugar and improve insulin resistance would be expected to improve it from that perspective so again look at the actual science the actual peer-reviewed research you don't see that relationship that they're talking about they didn't even I mean that when they're showing it to you it's just Scare Tactics they're not they're not talking about what that means this wasted you know people see it now in the football players are in the experiment saturated fat is not only healthy but probably necessary well I don't know that it's necessary but I would I would say that you know why should say cholesterol is necessary that we have in our body we manufacture it doesn't come from the diet about 30% comes from the diet about 70% we make it exactly varies depending on the person and you have some people are hyper responders of dietary cholesterol so they'll absorb more from food but it's you know it it plays a vital role in the body there's a genetic disease called smith-lemli-opitz syndrome which results in severe cholesterol deficiency in its its fail so you die with not enough cholesterol I'm not however one of these people on the other end of the spectrum that thinks hey if your cholesterol is 450 don't worry problem is you know like you know just write it off I think the truth is somewhere in the middle as biological variable variable yeah and if you can get through the door with a full lipid panel and I have people who are doing keto super low carb diet to a totally optimal normal cholesterol and then I have people who go from eating you know moderate fat diet to like a high-fat keto or low carb diet and their ldl-p goes up to 2500 or 3000 and their LDL cholesterol goes up to 300 so yeah I mean stepping back a little bit as we talked about this with Joel but cholesterol for decades was it was the boogeyman you know it was like that led to like egg white omelets and boneless skinless chicken breast and you know bagels with nothing on them when I was growing up and now even the margarine margarine oh my God I Can't Believe It's Not Butter better than butter to eat if you leave it out in the garage really so Ganda so yeah you know that you do you ask quietly actually removed the limitation of dietary cholesterol they used to limit it to 300 mg now that they don't have that anymore because the evidence to justify having that in the dietary guidelines we are the last industrialized country to do that every other company country had done that years ago but because you know the how in French that was in our country and I think you know that they don't want to lose credibility Sadie's been saying not to do something for so long then to turn around say actually there's no evidence to support that it's it's it's you lose face and when people talk about saturated fat and they talk about it as being only a meat or animal diet issue one thing I would like to bring up his avocados yeah there's a certain amount of unsaturated fat and saturated fat every food has all three facts in some proportion so you saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated and dairy products are actually the only category of foods that consistently have more saturated fat than any other type of fat pork for example off and have more monounsaturated fat than saturated and even sometimes Yung lean beef and what's really interesting about that is that studies consistently show that full fat Dairy which would be like the highest saturated fat class of foods is is associated with reduce risk of heart disease reduce risk of diabetes reduce weight and all kinds of other Improvement full fat Dairy is. Thousand Years 12000 years ago we didn't raise animals for dairy so there was no need that we only had to digest lactose while we were breastfeeding in hunter-gatherer culture as soon as you stop breastfeeding you no longer had the need to digest lactose and so we're our bodies are efficient we stop producing lactase which is the enzyme to break down lactose and for the rest of our adult life but then about 12,000 years ago we started how many figured out hey let's drink some milk from that ruminant animal over there and dairy products help people avoid starvation and there was a good source of hydration and nutrients and so that mutation started to spread and now it's about one-third of the world has lactase persistence which means they can digest lactose all the way into adulthood and 2/3 don't and it depends a lot on your ancestry so 2/3 people are lactose intolerant world so the people who tend to be lactose intolerant or people of European particular northern European descent like lactase lactose intolerance or lactase persistence approaches like 97% in Scandinavia so Denmark Norway Sweden they can almost all day just milk in the east African so you have like a massage you know people who've been raising cattle for a long time to have those that capability whereas I can Asia other parts of Africa in other parts of the world not as much what difference if any does it make when it's not mogenized and pasteurized in terms of your digestion cuz for me I don't have a problem with raw milk. Milk seems to be easy for me yeah I think there is a difference I mean it contains enzymes in it that help you break down the lactose lactose so that can make a difference but I mean just I would love to see research that further differentiate the health benefits of dairy whether it's organic or whether it's modernize or not and all that but even just talking about Dairy as a whole category and you had dr. Walter Willett in there saying there is evidence of hiking High consumption of proteins from Darius related to higher risk of prostate cancer the chain of cancer causation seems pretty clear but if you bring up a 544j me this there's a 2019 study largest review of dairy ever been done before it was a hundred and fifty-three meta now that they were viewed so not just individual study they review 253 studies that were also reviewing other study and 84% of the meta-analyses Andheri showed either no association or an inverse association between during cancer meaning when its inverse means people who hate more Dairy have lower rates of cancer so I just it's frustrating you noted to see someone make a claim like that and then you go and you look at the full to town the research and you see a just exhaustive study like this with 153 men and houses and 84% are showing no relationship or a beneficial effect of Darien cancer why wasn't that mentioned in the phone while it's consistent with the way the message is being distributed through the entire film that's it's a propaganda movie I mean that's essentially what it is well it's consistent with the way the message is being distributed through the entire film that's it's a propaganda movie I mean that's essentially what it is. So it might and Reefer Madness for meat</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I was when we're making that film there was a point we went down to the the IWC is international whaling commission meeting down and and and Shelly and we were trying to get a an interview with some of the top people there from that run the the organization because you know whales dolphins are killing them in Mast and we have the footage at that point and we just hoping to get an interview with somebody at work for the international whaling commission and going from Houston to Santa Santa call the plane was full I couldn't even sit next to the you know my my partners on my buddies in the in the film crew there's one empty seat next to me and you know they're waiting for somebody else to come from another slight and right before the plane door closes incomes accurate nakamae he's the head of Orsi's fishing for Japan that the head bull Goose loony moony he sits down right next to me and looking at my buddy so you know on the plane my God if there is a God you know he has a good sense of humor sit down next to me and said I didn't want you know him to like find out who I was and then move so I waited till dinner was served like an hour or two later and I said you have an idea of what I am he said no I said I know who you are film condensed version of Killing these intelligent animals The Flash is poisoned you know any of those recommendations for pregnant women to eat this is Flash the Japanese Ministry of Health site and he said I'm not in charge of food safety I'm in charge of food Security in other words he's he does not to worry about the health consequences of his job is to provide enough meat on the plate for the Japanese people and it gives you an Insight of how he's thinking out he's in charge I think there's a hundred 45 million people in Japan in the area about the size of our California he says 70% of of the land area of Japan is only you know a good enough for growing crops on or living on or we have to live in out turn to the Sea for food and at that point they were also caught skimming stealing about 200,000 tons of endangered bluefin tuna this is over by the 20-year. Out to get when you start talking about picking up but I can't imagine you know it's hard to imagine it but imagine like how are they stealing is too well do they have quotas and they're feeding their quotas every year in which means that they're taking away from other countries so it's not just like everybody every country has their allotment and once you reach that you're supposed to go home but the Japanese kept on getting more so that the Australians actually caught them now they figured out over a 20-year. That they went through the books and saw what they reported it was actually sold at the ski Gmarket found out they say it's Kim to 2010 S5 big train cars we like two trains full of danger to not like. Cars but the whole trains 110 car trains five of them full of that tune as endangered you know you think of tuna as being something that you just get at the store like tuna tunies endangered most people like a tuna endangered like their hearing is going to endanger or we talked to be to work at the fish market they live very clearly tell you that is a radical difference between the amount of tuna that was available 30-40 years ago vs. now to 10 years ago I mean we're down to the bluefin tuna to 4% of their historical levels at incredible and there's no way to stop this does Noah mean it seems like and everyone's waiting for someone else to do something and do in the meantime everyone's just trying to make money a lot of money unfortunately it's sort of that what happens with endangered species the more rare becomes more valuable it becomes and so there is very little incentive to do the right thing and you know but this is happening with all the fish stocks mean watches like refusing like what fish are sustainable have seen them you know go through the fish docks and so less and less you know we start at the big animals that we start to you know slowly go through all the fish docks until like where you know like McDonald's used to do halibut now it's Pollock which is a very small white fish from Alaska and now that's being so we're going to these fish. successive generation adapts to the diminishment of the previous one that's what that's going on so I just stopped you know handing out Seafood guys and now I'm tryna preemptive so I don't think the big question is seven and a half billion of us on this planet soon-to-be 10 is there enough wild animals to defeat us all there isn't you know you look at the biomass of mammals on the planet Tina between livestock and humans be occupied 96% of the biomass of mammals and 4% of wild you know so we can all be eating wild fish you know we lie about that you know you never go out and say look this get some land food do you say you know what that we do you know Sienna there was Market hunting and North America and a lot of the soldiers were done with world with the Civil War rather they we're hunting and they hunted all the deer the bear the antelope the Buffalo and they got down to like incredibly low numbers elk to this day I think or only in 10% of the original range that that that they were at in the 1700 and that was all from Market hunting from people just going out and buying you no meat from these Market Hunters that are shot these things and they didn't really have refrigeration back then so it wasn't like they could freeze it and and they got down to the incredibly low levels until Teddy Roosevelt and a lot of other people that were conservation-minded realized like what was happening here and they put a stop to it all then started in acting programs to reintroduce these animals to the areas where there extirpated and now you see historic level so especially whitetail deer this more whitetail deer in America when Columbus landed so-and-so but it's been 6 killdeer almost a farm animal because there's so many of them that exist in Iowa and Kansas and around farmlands like they literally exist in fields and a lot of them live off of GMO crops that's very strange so like I will a buddy of mine my friend Doug Doug Duren who has this huge piece of land in Wisconsin and he's like the deer in my area are essentially eating these GMO corn eating Monsanto corn like this is so weird like that yeah they're wild but they're also kind of farm animals you know because they didn't exist in record numbers because they've got so much food to eat and no Predators yeah I mean the only Predators they have their mandate to have some wolves now very few and some some parts of the driftless area in Wisconsin I think they have they have some bears too and coyotes a lot of coyotes it will kill all the Fonz I lived in Boulder CO golfer while we had a lot of bears and mountain lions come through our Lord our yard cuz we're right at the base of the foothills of the Rockies and a neighbor I woke up one morning the neighbors like looking at a minivan there's a big dent in the side and he's trying to figure out like how to get a dent because it was parked here all night and he found out an antler in the bushes mountain lion block sitting on a hot tub covers in the winter holding a deer with one you know in his mouth with one antler attacked and slammed it into Jesus Christ I lost a dog and Boulder to mountain lion wow I had a little dog is part of American Eskimo pulp part Pomeranian mountain lion got it in my mind I think that our cat if it's not them at the fox credible credible place and you'll be driving down the road and you see it's weird like the deer in Boulder know that they're safe so like we were we were looking at this house in Boulder and we will open up the door to the backyard and there was this enormous deer to stand there staring at us and my wife thought it was fake I don't know it's a real deer just like what and then it just turns because it wasn't even remotely freaked out that there were people with a stone's throw away from it it just so used to being around people weird the neighborhood members neighborhood bars planting rose bushes on the front of their property and you have all proud and then I remember driving home like later on that day there so you're coming to the Snipping the tops of roast to do what they did for wild animals in North America because it you can't regulate it the way you can wild animals cuz and wild animals if they have a particular area you could make it so people can't go in that area but the ocean is so enormous like how it is anybody, but some sort of a repopulation plans sure sure there was a project first work on biology he's wrote the book on biodiversity is considered the father of modern about diversity is about to get in the right around 90 years old now but looking at his he would do things like go to an island and I'm pretty much exterminate everything on it and then try to figure out well at what rate do the animals come back and what's with sustainable and he's figured out that to save 85% of the wild animals in the planet you have to put aside half of it for them you know that's hassle of the plant half the planet yasso the ocean you would have to literally make half the ocean where people couldn't travel in it on a travel and it just not exploited you no no no fishing and so Sylvia Earle is working on hotspots you know these things have a lot of biodiversity try to keep those away from fishing in equitation how do they do that though like I mean it's you would have to get everybody on board right the high seas are you know that's that stuff right the Japanese were fishing in a national Marine Sanctuary for decades you know so you have to let you know this really tough when you have organizations that really don't have any teeth to it did the attitude that he has that pragmatic attitude about feeding population you almost can sympathize with them write me a hundred plus million people on this tiny place the size of California and just pulling mostly fish out of the ocean I mean it's it's a crazy place to be in terms of his position but yeah I don't envy at all but you know what it what do you do Jimmy John's on Florida Dolphins and send it to do that while we're endangered species or mean I don't know what you know what sustainable anymore and is it possible to me I know they've done this in in some places outside of Hawaii where they've they've bred animals fish rather like sushi fish like Hamachi and they've had these pain set up and then a lot of times storm will come by like a huge storm break these pans then those fish get wild then people start catching them well that's like salmon like you know what I go I went they would find it in Japan when we were doing the Cove we went went to University with her breathing the first bluefin tuna these are from eggs you know so there this is when like like what they do at some places where they if they catch him then he put them in these pants and they fatten them up these were really hard to do right there they were shoveling the saddest back when I ate fish they were shuffling these macros like what I would feed my family with like a family of four they were showing it to the tuna and I said do Hornet like how many how much does it take to make a pound of tuna so about 7 until about a 150 lb an app that takes 14 lb 7 oz of wild fish to make 1 lb of farm-raised fish I mean it's like going if you know you know cuz you want a crisp $5 bill and say let me know give me a couple couple twenties but that's if you look at you know what are they feeding you know a lot of these fish are feeding him you know what is farm animals the fish that are raised and I don't know what the data behind it but they're at they have eight times more pollutants in it then wild fish scuba diving and swimming around a few fish like when you're under there you would like you expect you're going to dunk your head underwater with those goggles on you're going to see Hall that's why all these fish swimming around his nose not much you don't see much yeah there was a about 10 years ago I was getting married and I took his daughter out to I didn't know it at the time it was our first time snorkeling and we were in the area. I've been to about 20 years before and there was nothing there's nothing there was just like a desert and I heard her screaming through a snorkel I thought what was wrong and she was screaming cuz she saw a single orange Tang it was the only life-form we saw there where we used to be see clouds of schools of these orange and blue tank now there was nothing I thought my God she thinks that that's beautiful and it is it's just you know a single fish but you know again that shifting Baseline the generation before when I was there is probably look like The Land Before Time places I went to with with Clark you know Rajan pot where you see through you know if you go to the Caribbean you might see 30 fish on a different species of fish in a diving in Raja ampat used C300 and it was just miraculous and when you're taking pictures you actually see more detail with the picture than you can with your hero. I can't comprehend it also going when you get back and you see these reefs that we you know we lit like jewel boxes you see how much life that there is there are but there was just unbelievable study amounts of while I bet that's going on all over the world in the Great Barrier Reef you know we lost over half the Great Barrier Reef in the last 2 years he was never that good anyway you know 15 years ago I let you know after being to these some of the best pizza places in the world that have been to a Clark we looked at the great the Great Barrier Reef lost half again so I mean if you're just putting your head in the water for the first time and you come from you know Iowa or Wisconsin play bark that many watched half again so I mean if you're just putting your head in the water for the first time and you come from you know Iowa or Wisconsin or Boulder that looks pretty good but if you knew what came before that you're you're seeing this this no-salt against you know nature going on</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is taking out the Great Barrier Reef for heating the planet where heating the water it's it's it's bleaching so those those those a couple things there was multiple insults you have runoff from fertilizer and pesticides from agriculture you have the heating of the water these events with that when I say it is dying it's dying it's not like I was going to come back once wants to corals dead that's it it's it's it's not going to come back as well probably not there is pretty fairly remote like hell over in Hawaii it would or the Caribbean but it's pretty remote you have to get out several miles to get the Great Fairy weakness if the further north you go the more isolated as we went the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef and it didn't look as if they got slightly better as he got North but there's only a couple boats there is not like you have you know thousands and thousands of tourists out in the on the beach vacation the burning of fossil fuels is at this acidifying the oceans is now 30% more acidic than it was you know 50 years ago and when you make you know there's more Carbonic gas in the water makes it harder for the the coils to survive and it's a bit basically at least multiple insults going on at the same time it's probably not just one thing but it was a massive bleaching of that two years in a row and Great Barrier Reef and so it's it's his disappearing in our lifetime bikes I might be the sewage coming out of these off Falls at Lake if you swim through these so you know I've been out there you know at least be beaches you can literally talk to somebody on the Beatrice Queen tomb on the beach and they have this green water coming out of sewer pipes 200 meters away 300 meters away and so they're dumping semi treated sewage on The Last Reef in America this is going on all around the world and you know what we do I don't know but we treated with this is the last generation that we have that can actually do something about it because we're seeing it does appear in our watch and that's what I'm trying to do is try to tell that just create the awareness that something's going on that we have to do something but try to create action that that's what they reported so it's it smells like sewage smells like crap but if you leave to go to the website it says it's just semi treated they're not you know putting it through the aerators and not going through the whole system but it smells like s*** to me you know you come out of the water and it's like you know we all stinky smell Hollywood Fort Lauderdale border this is not like semi treated sewage it's a very good question you know there's so many things to work on in the act down there working on this Earth just trying to get people to see it to know that this is going on and if you know what I think they close the beaches down when you know when the wind shifts and it starts to push it on Shore but if you look it up you saw if you were on the beach and you saw what was going on are you going to be sending your kids they're going to be going to Florida but if you knew what was going on on that beach we can make arguments about whether not you go to Florida all day long and I want one with you 100% but I just can't imagine that they would allow this I mean how much more would it cost to treat it vs. semi treated how much more would it cost I only have an answer or people get sick and they probably don't even Christ oh God and ascended we're not talking like a little drain pipe to like literally you could swim through it not standing at that is big like four feet five feet tall now why anybody have an argument for Why That's Money Matters Costco gas benefit that they've decided it's worth polluting the ocean by pumping sewage into it you know it's a good question we did too now that we call this is like 5 years ago we tried to get an interview with the key people down there but try to it like a few if you want to talk to somebody about this and I don't want to go on record to talk about it because it's it's really bad for tourism it's in and it's not good for the political right here video of It video pumping green s*** into the ocean by the way treated treated that way everything in the Spectrum. Blue or green food coloring with fish lovely naughty sewage they can they can eat pipe and it it looks like like a cloud of poison is is being jettisoned out of this pipe and into the ocean it was an important part is if you came up you would see people on the beach but how in America is that possible but that is a really good question we try that you know we try to explore some of these issues but trying to get talk on the record about this is really difficult is there any other part of the country that has something like that. That I know f****** Florida Jesus Christ of course it's Florida I mean it is there a place that is so worthy of all the stereotypes like Florida is I'm seems like every time you think you've had enough with all these fit just swim boil boil in Florida ground it's all just covered with algae and that's kind of the point like they what I'm saying is like we always think somebody else should be doing something right this and you know that's why we do films is not just a crate the weariness and now to try to get something done about it the ground it's all just covered with algae and that's kind of the point like they what I'm saying is like you know we always think somebody else should be doing something right this and you know that's why we do films is not just a crate the weariness and now to try to get something done about it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> has anybody come up with any sort of comprehensive plan or anything that makes sense where they can viably repopulate the ocean I mean the idea of stopping and slowing down fishing would be wonderful but it's a me if we give really gets to a point where we've got to somehow or another independently grow these fish and reintroduce them to the wild me is there any talk of doing things like that or is it impossible I think it's impossible to scale of what's going on right now you know when I was in Japan they were saying that always to go out all the you know we could fill up a boat a day now it's you know 8 days now we have to and then we have to go out 30 and we're competing with the end of the Koreans the Chinese the Taiwanese you know that sits and everybody just going gangbusters and we were using military gear 2 I personally don't believe that fishing to feeding this planet currently you can do it with fish I don't think you can do it with you know and we know what's you know that the unethical side of raising you know for mantels for this as it's just I think we have to transition to another form I think it's going to be you know 10 or 12 years but I think we're headed that direction people I think what you're seeing now is that there's a direction towards enough people want to eat healthier they want to eat sustainable and I know I know your Hunter I mean I was 102 I hunted fish and you know I understand like when you come back with the goods you come back with an animal and you're feeding your family you're feeding your friends you feel like the man you to feel like you know you would do something you tap in this really primitive in a really genuine white that makes us feel good about who we are that you're providing and I know that that happened when I was when I was a fisherman the fish with your friends and there's a group thing going on in everybody's there they're enjoying themselves and it feels wonderful but we can't do it with wild fish and you know what the 4% of the biomass being wild animals now and the rest of it being is it's not sustainable and I wish it was because that that this is something we lost with that but we have to transition worth that. Right now we're all we have figure out how do you feed a planet that's the real problem how do you feed a planet how do you feed a planet that made double its population in the next 50 years yeah well this is talking 10 billion by 2050 and we're already at a point where you know we're at the people San Jose area going out hunting for their food or fishing from now so what are we going to eat you know and I think the you know that the way to do it is you know drifting more towards plants getting enough I was last week I was in Loma Linda California you know where that's at and report about the with the Blue Zone and out there that don't might not know about its fellow anger and without chronic disease than any other place in the planet so it's out there last week at the at the brain health in Alzheimer clinic and there's two researchers I started when there wasn't one for miles around and they open it without the one out of three people in America and the next 10 years ago be affected by Alzheimer's either they have at their mates going to have it through be taken care of somebody that has their parents so it's going to overtake heart diseases are number one disease that we have given up the brain health clinic there was nothing else on Earth Clinic nobody came about half the population of Seventh-Day Adventists vegetarians by religion and you go to the grocery store they don't sell meat evo2 they have milk their cows milk but it's on the bottom shelf do stuff a few things of it and they to find people initially they had to go to San Bernardino across the road across the highway there is nothing different geologically difference between but they have a different diet but they're living about 10 years longer than everybody have San Bernardino's one of the unhealthiest populations in America and another side of highway Teddy have one of the healthiest populations in the entire world and it living about 10 years on average longer they're doing other things to it's not just diet it's a big factor sleep mean dr. Matthew Walker has been on his podcast do so well renowned sleep scientist was discussing that it's one of the biggest corollary one of the biggest actors were they determined that the less sleep you have the higher likelihood you have of Alzheimer's disease that's really Stark like that the numbers are there their they're pretty undisputable yeah well for principals who buys you know Dean and support the big ones out of the 3,000 people that they have the Alzheimer's clinic clinic now only 19 of them only 13 of them are vegetarians and three vegans so it made me look at you know if you look at if you break it down the population like how many of the 24,000 people there that are vegetarians about 15% you'd expect knows several hundred of them to be Day Adventist diet which is vegetarian but what you're talking about in San Bernardino's a very poor Community unfortunately in and I think you know as well as I do a lot of people in poor communities heat terrible screen on your eating junk food and sugar and all that crap mean that that's one of the primary factors when it comes to poor health and education is related to definitely to brain health unfortunately it says supposed to do that they're they're stupid it's just that they're the right they they're not either do not eating as well they have to know the McDonald's was in San Bernardino you know it was a really went to the museum are the McDonald's Museum of all the Ronald McDonald's from the beginning to the end everything sold that they've been really good about keeping fast food out of out of Loma Linda for 15 billion people you're going to need Titanic swaziland's play slot of wildlife we're going to have a lot of different chemicals to get released into the ground unless you're doing regenerative farming in which case you're going to have to use some animal products anyway because you have compost and fertilizer you need fish for fertilizer or something that creates nitrogen result there's a lot of issues even with large-scale agriculture when you're growing crops your you doing something that's wholly unnatural if you have you know a thousand acres of corn or soybeans or anything that you're growing and large-scale that's not how nature intends it nature intends everything to be combined together right but if you look at the amount of crops that are out there the most land is being used to grow crops to feed animals so you know well sort of a lot of its being used for V10 was a lot of its being used for corn syrup in a lot of different than we can warn on that I could get rid of it find out how much of your DNA is corn-based me like what like what is going on how much your your your cellular structures corn-based it's like how much corn is in your diet and then you go through the supermarket and go and pick up box after box and read how much corn is in there cornstarch corn syrup different proteins they extracted from corn and I asked you how you know if we have to feed 10 15 billion people in the future how do you think you know we should be feeding the populations good questions right to question I have hope for this is fake meat s*** not not the plant-based stuff were they using oils and but the actual physical meet that they can figure out some way to create meat without animals die a guy I'm not a fan of factory farming the reason why I got in a hunting in the first place I saw a lot of PETA documentaries and I just didn't want to have any part of any of that s*** and I know there ethical ranchers that raise their animals grass-fed and they they let them Roam and you know I'm just a guy named Joel salatin who has this thing called polyface Farms or heat he teaches people regenerative farming methods and teaches people how to let animals be animals in the polar opposite of factory farming when you see these and I'm sure you've seen some of these disgusting videos of these pig farms where they have Lake assuage attached to these Farms where these pigs are in these warehouses stacked in one on top of the other and then they're all their waste goes down through the floor and into these giant huge Lakes of s*** and piss who is sprayed on the crops pigs like that it is a reason why they have these ag-gag laws and those are another thing that hurricane in my eyes to the same thing that the way we feel about dolphins in captivity in a place like SeaWorld build a gag laws agricultural gag laws they keep people from divulging the horrors of these factory farms and there's got to be a way to stop those laws first of all that you you should beat these places should be transparent if something there do this abhorrent is something they do with you you could see the lives of these animals so then they're treating this horrific ways it's not necessary it's not it's just they're doing that for profit and this is why you can get a chicken sandwich for a dollar 99 whatever the f*** it is yeah I mean has real potential the same way cell phones used to cost you know $1,000 more than that like what was what was like Milos big Motorola bricks remember those things that like they were really expensive like when he was walking on the beach with that thing I want like I was a baller he's got a phone he just walking with no cord now everyone has a phone when I was in Brazil and people are walking around it iPhones cell phones made their way throughout virtually all of the world how much or grin we're going to see that in this survey Factory created meat because the original Factory created burger that they made I believe it was a quarter of a million dollars that it cost to create one and people ate it and then like this is beef this is like real beef I think with Innovation there they could figure out a way to do that so we don't ever have to have these factory farming situations I mean I think that's possible I think it is to talk to us some of the people that are working on that look at how fast cells can reproduce and we know such a matter of scale and getting the right texture paste yes what I do is available to everybody, I go hunting in the mountains most people don't want to do that you know when I do it with a bow and arrow know what most people don't want to learn how to do that there they don't have it in them they don't want it it's not interesting to me it is if I chew one elk as 400 lb of meat One Life feeds me for a year and I feed my friends I feed a lot of people and I give Alchemy now to a bunch of people I'm under No Illusion that everyone can do that but this everyone can't do most of the things I do I just do it because it makes me feel better than going and getting something that's factory-farmed if I saw what they did the chickens and I knew that my chicken it come from these horrific environments and I ate that I feel sick yeah so that's why I became a hunter in the first place yeah well that's you and I can eat you probably better than me but I can eat how I want to eat you say I eat better than you know what you can afford more as what I'm saying you easier than me I'm excited as I'm not finally I've seen what you have around here this place to look nice little cozy Mandan you have down here but boys you should see what's up there it's like the ultimate man cave man vegetarian my best friends is Ian Edwards I love him to death I don't I don't dispute that we're in a conundrum and then we're in a terrible situation as a civilization we've certainly overpopulated the planet in many ways and we've certainly allowed something to take root in our society that I think is disgusting that's factory farming of animals there's there's something vile about it undeniably vile and there's a reason why people are prosecuted for exposing what makes everybody sick but if they exposed it it said look I'm going to take a picture I'm to show you video of how these cows are living and you take the video on the couch just wandered around eating grass no one would give a s*** right it's when you see these people taking these cows and when you see them alive when kosher the way they do that or they they they have to slice their throat and they have to do it with one cut in this is why people want kosher meat like some ancient ridiculous idea of how to dispose of a life being all those things II people which is the reason why they have those laws keeping people who work there from videotaping exposing in the first place Kosher meat like some ancient ridiculous idea of how to dispose of a life Wu mean all those things sticking people which is the reason why they have those laws keeping people who work there from videotaping exposing in the first place</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> a great favor the future Estes the shows a picture of the 19 of the 1900 Easter Parade in New York City and it's all horses from a building at know if you find it was one car and then 13 years later it's like find the horse that these transitions they take you note about 10-12 years you know years ago we were punching the number to Kion are flip phone six times to text a capital c and end in I think what if you know we're going to be doing the same thing with you know with the transition was filled I think it's going to be going that way to know when they're going to be up for all those lab-created meat what do you what do you think about I mean I know there's there's some process that I don't totally understand where they're able to make actual by Logic like bison meat tell me when I had dinner on Saturday night two nights ago with Okuma the guy that's founded Memphis meats and you know I've had the same sort of making us about you no go in that direction but he showed me these pictures on his flip on his phone of of the chicken breast that he's making and you know I stopped eating meat about 10 years ago but I thought it look bad you know it look they had to like the chopped you know so that it was grilled and it. You know I have the sort of revulsion against it myself cuz I've got myself off of it but I looked I looked at that and I thought you know what that looks really looks good pose of a bunch of different natural ingredients right whatever I would ever create a turkey breast it seems like it's just a matter of innovation and technology and proven to the point where they can recreate that you know is that he knows better for you then you know the Whole Foods plant-based diet or a real question right cuz that's where things get healthy versus what is ethic this is what makes you feel like you're doing the right thing morally you know the way you know I stopped eating you know made about the 1986 and 1/2 I was doing a story for Fortune Magazine on the biggest indepently on cattle ranches in America there's one that's so big in Oklahoma they had their own slaughterhouse and they supposed to be another they kill the animal with the captive bolt to the brain is supposed to happen instantly but there was one animal that came around and it was still alive and it was at that point hanging upside down is flushed and its hide with stripped off and it's looking at me with its eye and it's falling my eye as its hide was stripped off and was still alive and it's and it's turning around it was to turn his head and it's still held my eye and I thought the son of a b**** is alive and I parted so I stopped eating meat shortly after that and so I thought why I have to eat something right after you eat an animal product because you know you're going to shrivel up and die if you don't and then became a pescatarian that's all I ate for animal protein 12 you know what the milk and dairy but I didn't eat any myself to things that that didn't want for me and then when we made the co there's a scene in it where we take up a sample of hair from the deputy minister of Fisheries there and we tested for mercury and when we know why it was out at 11. But how to get minetest it to cuz I was a lot of fish I love that my son still a professional fisherman and I had a freezer full of fish all the time stocked up of you know Fresh Ocean for the next fresh but frozen ocean fish and I had it for breakfast lunch and dinner all the time and you know we got his Labs back of the sample back it was eight times higher than was high which is like you know you don't want any mercury in your body Marcus most toxic non radioactive element the world am I if my levels were 44 Times Higher experiencing any physical effects of that I was having trouble with my short-term memory I had an ache in my shoulder that was there for probably decades and I try to get a massage down it maybe start looking through the problems with with Mercury you notice if there's there's a whole Litany of things that causes depending on how bad you have it but my doctor said it's the worst he's ever seen in Colorado so I had to get off of it and then this is so we're here in La for the Academy Awards and I met my first vegan and I said what do you eat and she goes everything else all protein originates with plants and that that was how I got started and it took over you know I thought okay well quickly has a half-life in the in your body in about 70 to 90 days and so it took me about two years to get it down and I thought well I'll just try a little years to get it down at your body of 70 to 90 days so oracle's to 2292 180 so I thought okay then I'll start eating a little bit of fish and then I know he had a test right away and I check backup I thought okay camping also for sure that's what that means when I was in Japan I went to minamata where they had the they called minamata disease but it's not a disease it's poison this was a accompany us intentionally polluting the bay with his lot of fishermen and the kids of course got it while the cat's got affected first cuz people give the fish to the cats and the cats would head to the called dancing cat disease know you're the expense of expression mad as a Hatter that's because they had the felt from a hundred years a hundred fifty years ago they used to cure the phone Beaver felt on on top hat but they would use mercury in the Met hours ago mad in minamata the cats got affected in the kids and then you know that the people that couple hundred thousand people got affected and disease work remember this 1950s remote remote Villages and an American researcher went there and saw that everybody looked weird and said something's going on here and I found out that they're dumping you know mercury into the bay I saw a doctor there that study minamata disease he was a guy that was in charge of figuring out compensation for out with with the old people and he showed me these brains of you know they sliced open and it look like swiss cheese what we're talking about the convolutions of of the brain and out dolphins have more of than sleeping with people that you know and the ones with the slices that look like swiss cheese with this whole set of this is heating up in the brain and so you don't want you know once you see that you said you don't want that your so I had to get off this and become a vegan that bike for ethical reasons but because of I just couldn't eat it. Just for health reasons but I'm doing just fine. That most fish is poison like that is such a crazy thing to think that the ocean is so f***** up that most of the food you pull out of the ocean is a mess do the fish that were eating I think 54% is farm-raised to know what I would have bet that again I just read it this morning in Los Angeles magazine yeah and the health consequences did life-forms neavin plants they don't have the same nerve endings they don't really move the opening shot and there are a viable form of animal protein that is just so primitive it hurt that it's did they're just not it would we think of them as life-forms but so is broccoli at the life-form as well but there there's actually more evidence that plants are intelligent than there is that mollusks are Mauser it and Incredibly ain't life-form but then again don't you get some sort of mercury poisoning from them as well whether they're on the bottom right usually in their their filtering so you're you're getting whatever poison would rather talk suzara I'm not going to say that much poison I just wouldn't eat it I'm going completely different direction but I've heard that before that most of them to break down there even more primitive but yet more nutritious Astoria Polynesian oysters and they have the big oysters that they get you know but different curls and the muscle that holds all the the organs and stuff on you know if when I said only in America we eat the whole history like what actually pretty good but you know the idea that we're eating all those other filtered or organs Coweta hoerster like what tastes like it's actually pretty good but you know the idea that we're eating all those other filtered or organs the stuff I just don't know I don't know you don't know I don't know</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> subject of dolphins has been a music huge bit on my 2016 Netflix special about an experience that I had when I was in Hawaii high as f*** on Edibles and we ran into dispatch wild dolphins and they were playing with us they're playing with us and we were yelling like Yang flips for you putting on a show and I remember having this thought like holyshit they're playing with us these are these wild creatures they're having fun with us another start doing all this research on dolphins and dolphin communication I became obsessed with Dolphin because this one I mean I had I have been fascinated by them before but I became truly obsessed and this was this experience was more than 10 years ago and since then I've just I've been overwhelmed and and also massively disheartened by just you know by films like yours and by seeing SeaWorld and by seeing what was going on in Marineland with my friend Phil and they've had him on a bunch of times to talk about his lawsuit to me they have done everything they can to try to silence that guy and then the stop him from revealing all the whores that place but slowly but surely he's had a massive impact on that place has business to the point where they're trying to just get him to shut up and he won't he won't me and then he was mean unlike you it's it's you know it's I love the fact that we can get that out there I appreciate it I mean no swimming with dolphins in the wild there was a over there was three groups of Resident dolphins that so they're there hang out there all the time you get to recognize him and we're playing with him in the more you play with them the more you can spin around the more you can do the more excited they get only do it for so long and I remember once that we were doing it we finally we have scooters and we thought well so often looks at you you can't you look like you're like in a wheelchair what dogs do you have your high from the experience of being with him in the wild and they took off that we saw that they were is about 18 foot long Hammerhead and they were taking turns Ramey away from us so it was like not only were they playing with us they were protecting us the Dolphins were big quite as long as this table but there's another 3 to 500 lbs in there maybe 7 ft long and they look tiny next to the shark that's why I'll that is wild occasionally see they'll do Drone footage off of the coast of Malibu and you see like a great white swimming around there just a few hundred yards away from surf wrong and my son doesn't with drones easy without his kayak info into a Muslim my friend Peter Peter attia he said he's done a bunch of like crazy endurance things and want to think he did he swam swam to all the islands in Hawaii and what to prepare for this he had to do a lot of swimming he was in San Diego and swimming in the cross out there and he was swimming literally Boosie what he say like a couple days after that guy got bit in half down in San Diego to San Diego incident I want to say it was 10 years ago somewhere the neighborhood of 10 years ago and then it was in one at Santa Barbara that happened about 4 years ago for 5 years ago you know occasionally they slip up thinking person's a seal or something you know what's what's the time when I could do with a lot of shark before I usually only get them around you if you're feeding him I just feel so or horrible just so unnatural I won't do it anymore but we are going right. I couldn't be around it with some friends of mine that we're feeding it be up there in a feed and I was I was about 50 yards away and I thought I just want to be part of it and I was just feeling on the reef and these silvertips came over and I don't know if they're excited by the house had a camera with the strobes on it but they just came in attacking me and I had a rebreather out there without with a rebreather so you can scream so I started scream as loud as I could through this thing I was pushing pushing them off and they were like working together you can see it was like Pac you know like when we go look like an octopus with four lights on it and I could push him away but then one of the guys that we had that they were just it was because the feeding over there so I can I don't even want to be in the water these days when people are feeding sharks cuz it's no joke when you're under the water your this out your is how they can just run to run up a tree now play helpless and that's our natural environment and that's what they're there for their the yard clean-up you know any of this week ending is f***** up and then you know and he'll get caught Slippin there their they're for population control there's a really powerful video off of the street probably turn off of Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco with a bunch of tourists are there boom that's great white snatches a seal right in front of everybody and just just thunderous explosion of blood and foam in the water in like whoa it was the cape somewhere on the Cape Cod where there's like a 20-foot one next to a boat and these guys were in this boat in this this great white just swims right up next time they start f****** screaming freaking out and it's enormous it's like 20 feet long the only if you don't feed them they're usually fairly if you're feeding him or if your spear hunting then will come near you the dangerous for spear Hunter yeah what is this record-breaking year for sharks off Cape Cod yeah apparently there's a lot of them out there now what do you think that is that because of the large number of marine mammals or or drones we could actually see him.</div>

plastic to make it valuable for people to be able to recycle it otherwise great solution is hemp plastic it's biodegradable and comes from this plant menu you can make hemp plastic and it we can grow it and it's an easy crop Israel is that scalable it really doesn't it's it's an it's an insane plant you can make hempcrete out of it which is far better than any building material we currently use it's far more resistant to Flame there's there's just so many positive benefits of it in terms of insulation installation factors better than wood or plywood it's really lightweight but incredibly strong as yours like grabbed a thick ham stock of you ever held onto one no it doesn't seem real like this Oak but yet it's a light like balsa-wood it's so strange it feels like it comes from another planet amp is an extraordinary Planet it's a most extraordinary point we have heard about is all the essential amino acids I love hemp protein at one of my favorite proteins for we sell it on it we sell hemp protein it's one of the very best proteins in terms of being able to mix it and like a protein shake and on-the-go your body digest it super easily and it's like what's amino acids it's very easy for your body's digestive process you can make oil out of it that they used to use for f****** for heating lamps you can cook your food in it I mean there's so many different things you could do whatever you can make clothing you can make far more durable cloth for more durable the paper is far superior in fact the whole reason why William Randolph Hearst demonize marijuana in the first place was to protect his business because he had paper mills and he was trying to kept it from him because on the cover of Popular Science magazine they come out with a decorticator decorticator was a away in the 1930s they devised to effectively process hemp fiber because for years they used to use slaves to process hemp then when they figured out the cotton gin cotton became easier to use and then slavery became outlawed and so people who shied away from him while they came up with this decorticator in the 1930s was on the cover of Popular Science magazine hemp the new billion-dollar crop or William Randolph Hearst didn't just own Hearst Publications newspapers he also are owned these huge Forest they were making paper with so he along with Harry anslinger and using his newspapers demonize marijuana to stop the commodity of hemp yes they came up with these stories that these Mexicans and black men were taking this new drug called marijuana marijuana wasn't even a term for cannabis marijuana was a term for a wild tobacco so they came up with his new name they call it this drug everybody freaked out because they didn't have the internet back then no one at access to real information other than first newspapers Hearst Publications we just f****** out-and-out lied and made up these crazy stories in front of these documentaries and then marijuana became illegal and still is to this day and you still have knucklehead like Joe Biden literally yesterday saying that he thinks marijuana is a gateway drug we're still in the forget about marijuana psychoactive at all the idea that Hamp should be illegal in till really recently in this country is a f****** travesty it's horrific its food it's close it's paper doesn't even make sense that I could be so many things literally like one of the most positive plants the Earth's ever known okay I'll look for it this morning you should be locked in a cage for experimenting with your Consciousness and the freedom to to to do whatever you want with your body that is especially with marijuana that's not poisonous no one's died of it ever ever in the history of the human race is there a single overdose from marijuana and this knucklehead saying that it's a gateway drug no pain is a gateway drug trauma is a gateway drug abuse as a gateway to it to drugs not marijuana Moana is just a a time-honored psychedelic substance that people been enjoying for thousands and thousands of years before Congress or anything I'm not even running for my neighborhood's whatever the hell it is there but I just saw a post over there did he run for mayor better joke I'm not running for anything ever I have three jobs and three kids I'm busy and have a lot of hobbies too many hobbies I'm just trying to chip away at Hobbies but if I can get Joe Biden shut the fuk up I'm very happy crazy assholes so many people that smoke pot in this country he's so crazy for him to come out against that is so goddamn dumb how do you smoke pot on the show and still hold a conversation though I know how to do it for everybody and I think it should be used carefully because look I've said a lot of dumb s*** when I've been high I've thought a lot of dumb s*** I've been paranoid it's not for everybody I think it should be treated cautiously but there's a lot of benefits to it I really firmly believe that it's made me more sensitive person made me more interested in it's made me more aware of how important it is that we're all connected in the we all converse with each other in a calm way made me feel better about about

That's whenever I've gotten in like a little fender bender or of course you know but in that there is no you do you have to stay so and if there is no out or can you let yourself drift in a meditative state and I don't think I can I think if you drift you're f***** I mean I think first of all do how do you spell how do you stop things like you know guess who's hungry hands up all s*** you know I mean I think he does it so often that he knows how to get into that state but you know there's also like look at that little thing of go that Backpage do it talk about saying yes you know it's already done you'd have to say it's already done I don't know why you I think you just got to go Left Foot Right Foot Right Hand left hand and then you also have done it many times with ropes but also on when you're on the ground you're like want to hang out and he's like like like it's Tuesday there you don't I mean most people you and me included would be dead we wouldn't be able to do what he's doing I'd be died of a heart attack on the parent from realizing I was going to try and he's such a mellow guy to that's what's really interesting climbing or I don't know if there's something cuz I'm was like well I'm going to go for that metaphorically I'm going to take that energy like what we think of as the the boundaries of human performance what someone's capable of doing well it's certainly certainly there's a weird Epiphany when you're watching someone do that cuz you're sort of like I'm doing the exact opposite of this person that I'm watching that you're like not risking thank you for doing this I can finish this movie supposed to finish this movie because what he's doing is essentially a spectator sport but there's no audience until after it's done right so it so It ultimately for the for the climb must be singularly about you I mean it must be the how I don't know how you how you include someone else during that no thing about the moment I think he's just like I said right hand left hand and they just you just keep going and you know the poor thing that would be akin to Sabino some the greatest meditative mind that's ever existed but it's different if you said now he could up and climb this thing please there be a certain amount of no no I'm still messed up where you might be like no I'm doing this so I don't have to do that at through action that's a different kind of meditation because the consequences are so grave</div>

Never been there I heard it's amazing know something really interesting happen to me there now when I not only is the square that we want to and we stand on this Earth Mound and this guy whose nickname was gorilla giving us this wonderful tour just have spot the most romantic to her ever exist for such a rough play and he goes wait right here and we're in the Giants and he runs down the stairs I don't know it's a hundred fifty feet away 200 feet away in Augusta Square was built with these mountains here to be able to speak at this voice to 250,000 people to go straight around that pyramid and make a left. Swear those mountains are and and the other thing is in these that's the same shot from a different angle that's near where these hypotheses Shaman lift the shaman headquarters like an area of this place and never thought this there's these sort of things what are these May said their reflection ponds and I've never considered that you don't look at the stars by but that really you look down and you mark So in 7 years when it comes around again you like a pattern to look at the reflection of the stars come out here the shaman did that was like in their neighborhood and the way were Chalmers if you had a birthmark on your head when you were they made it for like two boards broke and just put two ports and rope to and body at a lifetime of of like so you're a shaman which if you had a lifetime of that you be like high Shaman Shaman bloodline what we are and that that is significant because it felt to me immediately you know you don't have a thing on you so yeah if you want the birthmark yeah I mean that's a really good good like entry to know at the gate when you went to that did the Aztec Temple as a musician when your sooner did you like didn't make sense like the Acoustics like the way it's set up does the way the Sound Works does it make sense to you like a real tetrarch today and it left a very lasting feeling of we're supposed to be here and that you know it just really restored a lot of faith in humanity I didn't focus on the ritualistic murder that was going on there it was just one set of people the other set of people built this and they and they knew and you know much like the Great Pyramids that are really you know in the shape of Orion's Belt exactly that same concept of what's going on here matters and if you if that is your focus think of how wonderful you know like how did those people know how to make that with no without the essay without the wheel slaves in a. Of just a few days after the construction of that Temple yeah so that was like don't tell me I actually don't worry about it I'll take care of it I think they can do that they were going to be slaughtered I think it was kind of like part of the gig maybe it wouldn't sound surprising that you have some cooperation I mean it's hard to imagine 80,000 people at once going sorry and not be like a f*** this man that sounds like a Cooperative event to me somehow unless they were somehow another locked up in the brought them out one by one that's an awfully big cage of got there it is yeah play music is I thought okay that means these Acoustics are so perfect lacoosa how do you discover that are you in a canyon and while the sounds start doing the geometry for how that works in like someone eventually geometry first though cuz I don't know how does that how to construct about Acoustic sound kind of the Pythagorean theorem and it's just like that that's just magical that's so old and so amazingly constructed terrible idea of what they were like like horse and we don't know well but it sort of dawn on me at some point there was like Oh you mean the people that wrote our history was wrote it as from the perspective of by the way we're way better way better but okay here's the story of these other people do what they did cuz what is the emotion when you when you're in that space I'm trying to I'm trying to think of the right word to describe how I felt there right and I guess all right yeah it's it really is it is off but also there's a there's almost yeah reference there's almost like a some strange gratitude thank you for I'm so thankful to be part of this even just by living in the time to appreciate it feels it sucks it feels like knowledge expanding that I I don't have so I just feel like all if I could have a piece of I can understand a piece of that but just standing there was sort of understanding it with cars and planes and all that this is the best way to visit word for it I can't can you try to find such a thing what is the word this a word for the word definition is to believe the arrow you're in is the finest of them all I think it's some kind of dick head syndrome honey you're the best to this is the best your number one don't worry about him you don't worry about him cuz he's fine you're the best yet it's like the same thing with the Native Americans and the settlers at the settlers were imposing their lifestyle but the people that experience the Native American lifestyle they wanted to stay living like that for sure ability that the European perspective like when Pizarro and all that you know was a 12 of them conquistadors kill like a thousand natives in in a in a matter of hours when you know when they land it looking for Gold Everywhere I am at first they have this this belief that something big will come across the water and be their God and here comes a ship with a bunch of dirty assholes that literally factually dirty assholes have written across a boat and you know I think about that perspective where they obviously would like to see if they're nice but I've had enough of this relation of invented ships were better so let's kill everyone here Gary come over and look at this it's just it's impossible to Fathom man riding a beast there probably in the funk with like Rusty armor from being on a f****** boat for months yeah like looking like s*** being desperately like like all the stuff in there like maybe we could do this with some Goodwill but quickly it's like you guys are too primitive or just going to take over here even thought they were going to do it with Goodwill I think it was any Goodwill back then I think you were just murdering you think that there's perhaps that more people took more lives in a way like per per capita or something to think that it was a more brutal way of Taking Lives of I'm sure people take more lives today and wore for the thing to act and it was pissed it was Amazon ripe but it seems like more percentage of the people that are alive had an opportunity or the possibility to kill someone today too so it's like if you if you are with 150 people all of which have killed at least three people and then maybe maybe you are like we got to kill somebody and rape something and take something as quick as and they're being nice so you're like these people up in five four three men showing up in phots and killing everybody that they met and then kind of doing their own version of a selfie on the dead body resume at Cortez just to be there and see what that was like when these people would never encountered Spaniards before these guys show up in these boats with two app and Lily different beliefs I'm perspective that was about to go down as crazy as that is why Mexico speaks Spanish and people don't get that in their head like omex is why all of Health America getting in her head like Mexico speak Spanish Wireless and hats were saying Spain's where the f*** over there how it how is it makes no fucken sense but then you realize our call my God they were conquered by the Spanish D2 from Spain through wind and storm the Nina the Pinta the Santa 1492 1492 which by my watch is a long time ago it is it is but it's not you know I got a joke my ACT about the United States being founded 1776 people live to be a hundred that's three people ago that's real though what website do you think that's really true yeah it is right I mean that's seems like yesterday to me I wasn't alive and I'm ready to admit that but I guess. Seems like all that is just very yeah yeah that's right thing is anything that happens before you were born seems like a million years ago of course. But also 1776 seems like yesterday to me I wasn't alive and I'm ready to admit that but I think that seems like all that is just very close</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> help me get Blackboard how much do you pay attention to criticism zero good for you I don't I haven't read about myself in over a decade amazing way to go the first time I did remember I got a computer and I was like you can sometimes I feel like such a like a dumb nuts like I know you can talk to someone people like to bond over what they don't like and like and also they like to pretend it makes them feel better to pretend they have intimate knowledge of you Joe Rogan about Joe is UC I was like I don't know actually I'm doing this, said you're not the real thing and I just let it be known yes I f****** am and then all the signals like hey Josh go door-to-door and correct people's perception getting wrapped up and doing just that because they've been responding to criticism and going after people and you know what it's because they don't want to be blamed they don't want to be misunderstood when I totally understand I understand my wife has been one of my biggest Inspirations ever like that that thing that I really learned from her is like you can't blame that when you blame someone that's like saying for them when you point the finger it's like saying you're guilty before you even have a chance to talk and save your perspective what that's nobody likes that you know what I mean nobody wants to like start by being blamed for something but she shut off immediately and now you have these disengage people blaming each other and being mean to each other and again if we're talking about doing what you like I don't like that and I also friends I really low that engage in that quite a bit and it's a trouble spot for them and so instead of doing it myself I tried to like look at that and say I don't I don't want that I love my music and I try to make it as real as I can and I try to make a difference I can and then I accept if you don't like it but if you have a vinyl or if you have a CD still I love it if you don't it's still a hell of a coaster right it's not bad Dart looks cool and I need to be okay with that and accept that because otherwise what I'm pleased like it when you're off you're not looking at that review right that reviewers wrong then I've had moments of that before because I really have always fairness and justice but especially in the last bunch of yours so you know it's like I have to be okay with what I did for me and people don't really know what the f*** they're talking about and what really goes on but if my expectation is that I'm going to get take everyone to a spot where like this is what actually happens but I'll be sad and you also an aging people that don't want you to be a good do you really want to go f*** you you just want us to think that get worse of course I know and I'm actually kind of investing time and energy into like no but yeah but no right also into your persona or your public perception I don't have a Persona I've had many times wear because of being like like feeling strange about things are angry about things are this I take them out on the stage some sometimes because I grew up watching bands like Iggy and all the stuff were sometimes you go see abandoned scary and wonderful to be scared by this music is like whoa and everything that comes with it it's so f****** real Lookout actually drive you backwards that's exhilarating and also on stage that's the place for that out in real life doing that like while you're at the ATM not so much cut your toddler's loose and go I don't know what I'm going to do tonight which I have done many times and walk out there but I will embody the emotion that I'm feeling right now and you can go ahead and take that shifted ATM and deposit that cuz that's what's going to happen the problem is if you're not doing well and that's how that I'm going to feel that when you get out there I'm willing to do anything up there I don't know why because take us to place that's why because that's the place for it it's. The art of it was also what you said that you enjoy the randomness of it yeah I mean I think that you're mean talk about manifesting if you go up there with that Spirit enjoying the randomness of it than the sometimes the spirit will move you in a direction that you didn't even expect right yeah because you feel one with your actions so in the now you have no choice it's too late it's already done the preparation is over it's like a fight that like you're not going to learn anything extra till it's over. You have to be in the moment there I enjoy that because I enjoy that it's too late I love insurmountable odds that's all I need to do something is tell me like there's no way you're going to make it but I also realized I like how I guess the manifestation aspect of this is God important to me again cuz it's what I did in the beginning and as I have these moments of being lost and feeling like I don't understand what's going on and wondering why when really it's cuz of me that that the best thing I can do that's why the record I'm so dark cuz that's all I'm seeing and it has to be real so it is real dark you know but there's a beauty in that too but I don't want to make s*** my new normal this s*** you know cuz it's like once you get used to that you like normal people end up people you love end up going no it's not and you go wait a minute but I'm so used to it while I thought you were going to hop in the jacuzzi with me the Templars great it's just I'm really like I'm so thankful to have like a great group of a family of artists to get to collaborate with and like my some great kids I got three of them every time I go in a room there's another one of them in there you know there's so many f****** cousin and my wife would like really has the courage to help has had the courage her whole life to like go that's it's time to go you know it's time to do this like you know someone that has really inspired me to have a partnership like that is f****** rap you know I mean talking about someone that that's had a really rough Beginnings but never blamed doesn't spend pointing the finger and blaming cuz it's it goes nowhere some of the most interesting people in the world the ones about a rough beginning yeah because it's getting too yeah well that's the other thing is the strength to strength to go right now and get that strength for is so inspiring for me it's getting gives me strength through hurricane</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> about this I've been watching &amp; reading this woman Esther Hicks channels but putting that aside to not some precondition anyone her her discussions on manifestation and her explanation of of that that the physical body that you have thoughts and thoughts are bigger than your body simply have a bag that holds your protector thought so they can occur and that when you think something you begin to bring it into idea which is the on the process to bring it into the world and so when you say I can't certainly cannot right and that it's okay when coming from a position of I can and it's already too happens and I'm just meeting up with what's already occur especially when it's not wrapped in a selfish thing but manifesting happiness in and things you love and that that attracts other that's what's contagious in oh and I wonder when I see a photo like that about the connection of and her point being is that she's like all day long you're thinking thoughts and acting on them because the that mind and body are one they're executing the same process together you know dependently like that is the embodiment of thought and Body in action together and being ultimately in that Vortex of being aware that Esther Hicks lady is very strange I'm very torn on that because I listen to the actual words in the things that she says when she's channeling that what is it like for him is he like a dead guy or an alien what is it sexy thing is is I'm kind of like was listening stumbled on that while I was driving and an investigating a reconnecting with the law of like the Law of Attraction and how to like it's like when you get your motorcycle lesson they tell you to look through the turn because you you tend to go where you're looking you know not a lot of people are walking backwards and talking to you as to go forward and end so that it served on me of the connection between just looking for something your love and not bonding or focusing on all the s*** you don't like as a as a manner of walking towards what what you desire this kind of Reawakening with that concept is very near three four weeks old for me before of like someone's got Washington white it's going to be you let's let's let's let's go for it and really go for the only way to make it is to really honestly go let's talk about with your band before you guys made it know I'm talking about a way of acting regarding anyting okay I love music and music has always been my way of of being the most honest I can be and I think because of that it's if that's what's helped gravitate people that have stayed so long in that however also I realized that I put so much of who I really am in total into the music that there are times that I should have done that in in relationships with friends or people it's like and family and that it's really it's important to do that in life to you know to be engaged and also show your real self. Kind of where the vulnerability of all that is really powerful instead of weakness at opposite of weakness you know so I think I think pursuing music that way is great but not if it's keeping you from doing that in life and so it's not just that I would think that way so my ban would do well it's that I would think that way so that I could I could do well and I could be well you know so that's why I start listen to her not seeing any of the opening Gambit of of her transforming into Abraham Abraham and not caring and understanding what that means just going like I'm just listen to what you're saying while I'm driving and hearing that and the way she speaks regarding those things is really fascinating I choose to detach myself from judgment yeah because cuz I know one thing nothing plus it's it's it's weird because she sang very wise things right and but it'd be a shame to get the just cuz I don't. The rapper I would pick that I don't like the candy inside the channeling part of it yeah so it's not it's not exactly how I would do it well f*** this then it's like you're listening to wisdom but are you listening to wisdom from someone who's made up a fairytale that's where it gets confusing it's handling well put on Yoshi Channel but I also think that to be able to learn something this this again this Awakening Amy is so new like it it's in all honesty it's it's like a month-and-a-half old but it feels really good what happened it's just that you know I think that engagement in life you know also feeling a bit lost and and not knowing how to ask for the how to ask for help sometimes you know what I mean and and and not really knowing something exists at all you have feelings that's a little too big for my point being that like all the sudden engaging in something engaging and something that you're that you really love not focusing on the negative part of it but really chasing after that thing that would make still going to change your perspective absolutely and in fact and in fact that I realized like what's you know it's fine it's not fine to go like nope that's not that's not over there yeah how can you get stronger and less you turn in really really look into it aware that something scares you yeah yeah yeah I mean I really nine times out of 10 you didn't need to be afraid of it and that one time you do you know it's true and you know what it is right and M. Seems like a successful and in dealing with that to you get the chance to say I can do this still alive I have no idea you have to separate the things that don't fit right right the husband has to be there with everything too. He died without having no preconceived notion and just hearing this as I drive them the next YouTube Sting started playing was like who is this who's Abraham there's no there was no contacts for me I was just listen to the words and I was like eight is great interesting about it it's remarkably consistent like that she doesn't say anything that's really foolish and she never changes her tune about look and I started to dig that she was saying we cuz until I understood that she was like channeling something I thought it was just a really beautiful way of saying we what we want to tell you is like as if you were already there and really what you was talking about his or being there anyways like you will have an idea you will form a habit of one type or another which one would you like it to be and I know this if all you can focus is on what sucks but is yet to be just wait a sec it's coming and what we're conversely if you were like I got to worry about that because I like as much time with out as possible let's focus on something I do like until she gets here that you naturally look through the turn as long as you're not trying to turn into a wall or a Cavalcade of s*** but if you're trying to turn into something you love you actually will turn into something you left in that case you should probably Embrace challenges right now you should probably welcome them because when they happen they will test you and then you can figure out whether or not this philosophy is actually well I mean I haven't I haven't I have been testing cuz you know I always like difficulty by shielding it putting into the music or putting it into the some dark closet somewhere and grin and bear go Downstream with the stop fighting it cuz you damn all that s*** up put in the corner. Behind and really one day just like gives you a massive bath of your f***** that's damn breath because I feel like everybody's trying to describe something that there's some element of Truth to but that it's really complicated and it's not as simple as think it and manifested they had a lot of discipline involved in that there's a lot of hard work and creation and thought and doubts and hopes and dreams and there's a lot of other things and then also Fortune wallet got a lot of people I feel like when those when it could never I would never use that for Fortune for me the fortune would be like that your relationships an emotional connection get deeper lucky and I think that's one of the main things right there is understanding the difference in thought because ultimately what you're saying what one is that hard work that you're talking about and all those things are sort of getting out of your own way and on learning how to say how to be so doubtful about it all and just say I'll take I'll take something I like and I'll just think about that for a bit and let that be the first step and then go what do I keep going down River Downstream of that idea getting closer and closer to something you really love because saying you know saying I don't like this water bottle sucks but but sang at least I don't have to drink it is one step away from that and if you just keep taking those steps away and going down that River that's the right direction to be going because focusing on this is like how's that going to help you to think about how fortunate you are Jeff is it me I guess it kind of is it's it's blocking well it's blocking you from feeling fortunate but saying at least don't have to drink them everyday is turning the right direction and heading towards abortion that you are and if you keep taking those little direct that those steps then soon you get to like I feel fortunate to be here I feel fortunate I'll have to think about this bottle of water all the time that's why I have King about positive things and working towards those things it clears your mind of a lot of the just the natural traps that we set for each other dumb nuts baggage us those hurdles we make are TaylorMade cuz they're made by you for you right right they have not work highlight your actual real insecurities and fears that you know you have that Lillian and you go me and I think what I like about what I heard her saying is that because it came from no context whatsoever and I just heard the words it said can you get out of your own way that's what I would like you to think about first is that there's an ancient Tale the tale of two wolves meaning how to live your life like you have I know I want wolf is filled with fear and other go. My mother just just gave it to my kids paraphrasing about this Frame thing like they're two wolves and one is anger and when one is like love and they both exist but ultimately it's like which one you going to feed that it's it's really think I'm correcting and saying well I think the younger you know Native Americans as well how do I how do I know which one how do I not let one take over it's like well which one you going to feed ultimately concentrate on positive things and the less you concentrate on negative thing for sure you're freeing your mind up in your you you gain the momentum of positive thought in the momentum of of living your life with positive thought it becomes easier to do Star War. Do I think but I think it's also necessary to say I'm not talking about walking around and collapse you like going to like smile and then Works into an idea and then a smile or just it's nice to 2 something nice and also understand that I'm not talking about walk around like you know like I'm not talking about being some goofed it's dumb nuts m*********** that's what I'm saying is do something do something nice and start that way and leave it at that and I think there's something to your thoughts are filled with this just frankly last room for me to think about this water which I dislike just there's just less real estate yeah and because the contagion of enjoying it cuz things that are positive are essentially what things I like I'm enjoying being here so this water doesn't really I don't have real estate for that I've got too much enjoyment and to be here that'll do completely by accident or not you know sometimes things just slam down on the table and say you got to be engaged this at the moment to do do it or not and nothing inside to change like that that's it sort of a gift actually it's saying it's struggle now but if you struggle through this it's going to get better you know and I'm actually really thankful and that sort of moment I don't mind the risk of all that that's what it's all about how do you stumble upon it though I just was like looking for like looking for through the Law of Attraction and and finding a way to change my thoughts to two things I loved and I listen to a couple of his driving and it just clicked on hers at Auto played and there was and as I said without any sort of judgment and I'm the last person that's kind of a joiner or would be used to being hippy-dippy whatever like kind of like someone who's scared so it just made sense to me but get out of your own way keep it simple listen to your thoughts and she talks about how what you're doing with your thoughts in the way you Lincoln the way you sort of interface with reality is you're creating reality with your mind right right and I'm choosing how I want to take that and have that mean something to me see if I need an application for that in your life and also I'm within the within the spectrum of all the things he's talking about I simply am looking for ways to in my immediate life with app go to close to me how to be more engaged and how to be more engaging myself because as I said I've had a lot of trouble times in the last few years because of just feeling lost and not knowing how to deal with that you would put that in your music but maybe I should be putting it into more than just that to it doesn't negate wanting to your music to be truth that's what it's for but also it should be inspiring point out another directions to are you bringing this to the band like if you guys want some this channel a lady no no no because I mean I'm surprised some sort of revealing and here it's because I'm not a disciple of anyting Ray's net I think she's supposedly channeling some ancient but forget all that the words she sang resume and they're also sort of like consistent across the street as I said before I'm mining in a specific vein of like okay the people I care about most how do we how do we all grow right out each other and how do we do that right because that is the goal the golden to to be alone and it's also whether it's whack your whack your shin religion but I always had a lot of people find some great meeting in it you can this I don't know how much of the world is weird and complicated get real wisdom from s*** that sounds like nonsense well if you reserve the right to be surprised by life to have an open mind you certainly have to unlock the door open that that's a great way of looking at it is my goal in general and life and also now it's my it's my mission because it's a bit like when I said like mess around with you no illegals like the legal sub things that like that you wrote you yet those things are sort of like I tried all that pearls too long and that didn't really go anywhere so what else is there what else is going on right now do you tried drugs and then you like was got to be something else that's going to fill this void or give me some peace or yeah or like um I certainly can't stand here either growing or dying and I'm like what else what else we got this doesn't matter that I think what's important is when you said he bring this to the guys in the band I was just about to say yes until you said are you telling her about this lady because to me I'm like oh my God because I think I've always looked at music this way we're psyched locks concentric circles and at one point they all line up and you can see through the door to the other side and once you've seen it you can't unsee that if I if I have a song and we have to those concentric circles lineup it almost feels painful or criminal not to go to the other side when you know it gets so much better there I feel like what I've been kind of learning is I also should apply the same understanding to the people I care about you know like if there's a way for us to have something more meaningful that's all that being meaningful is like money is green paper you know these are like it's fun to have collecting but who cares it's the it's the relationships you have and you know when you have kids and stuff that's like having enjoying that s*** even when it's rough that's that's the thing take that hat you know what I mean that's what I'm kind of getting from that from what she's saying and so it's that works just fine well if it works if it works it's not exclusively that either you know it's just like it's a tool that's one of the tools that I would use every situation is situational and so I feel like with greatest have a bunch of tools and not pretend to know well if it works if it works use it right it's not it's not exclusively that either you know it's just like it's a tool yeah it's one of the tools that I would use every situation is situational and so I feel like what's greatest have a bunch of tools and not pretend to know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I was wondering how come you're trying to ask this as many musicians as possible but how do you guys create music do you do right stuff out and then come to the band to some of the guys bring their own ideas for for a b or for a concept or well you know I like the randomness of it all and again I love collaboration I've never done anything just me all by myself that doesn't there times when I you make a request of people you play with real like I hear all of this can we just try that first because I like to do that when someone says that in return if they feel like sometimes you hear everything all at once and that's that is a gift and you kind of don't want to mess with that you want at least start from that point because if someone does have an idea at least they're starting from understanding where this how this is their idea if they have one is rooted in this instead of being kind of arbitrary you know does that make sense but it's great to hear that and also be asked to kind of be a soldier sometimes Jarrell play whatever it is you just trying to help them realize it same to be misunderstood in that moment when really what you're saying is oh my God I have this idea can we try just like this for a start and once you're emerged in this understanding your ideas to better it will be based in understanding this you guys are very unique and that you don't sound like anybody else but that's the point it is the point that. In fact in fact I was looked at that like well that's the minimum obligation you know that sound like other folks yeah that's too and I was like what the point you already have that they want to I love that song asking for help to this to do that for your all your stuff is not just unique it's Unique in itself like your songs are different each song is different than the other song you don't does not like a Queens of the Stone Age sound but I think there's a band called weaned that I love so much and early on my first bank is that was trying to sound like itself itself but singularly I was feeling painted in a corner a little bit by the fact that it had to be in this mode we toured with this band ween because who would play anyting do you know who they are. Or they're so brilliant and they play Mister would you please help my pony and we're going to quiet what the f*** is that about it and then they play Riders on the Storm for 28 minutes Ohio gun country it sounded incredible because they were like cuz we can do that why can't we that manifesting what you love. And so I just from being around them and seeing things like that and then starting this desert sessions project which is what I just put out recently words just collaboration and it could be anything because it's not all you know but yet it's you and so it was that's how Queen started was like What if you just played anything it was good no matter what it was and you let every song I had a friend of mine once said to me you know not every song can be your best and I and I just looked at him and I was like why was that why is that I don't even know why that has to be a possibility why not what if you if you see through those spinning locks through to the other side and a song could go there you should take their right that's a weird pessimistic attitude isn't it like not everyone can be your best and I was like oh I see you're talkin about are you talking about you but then the rest the album would almost feel like filler again that's another thing right it seemed to me at one point in My Hope was that okay in the spirit of trying to do something different I call it on Supply demand you know what's out there cuz it's out there what's not out there at that would be interesting to hear it's tell me what what you don't think we need and let's start there right for we're just trying to fill in the gaps and beautifully fill in the gaps of what's not represented and and thereby having this Limitless ability to play whatever you thought was right in the moment as long as it was honest than you be fine you know and so that's always been I just I feel like it would be fun to try that so that's why it's so jumps around stylistically but I do think people listen to whatever they think is good and they don't care about genre what unless you're a teenager when that's important to you or the Surly was to meet I'm why is genre important it seems like if you work at a record store it's important cuz you're filing these under like you no nose flute in the key of battle something runs over it with its truck tire Hugo and I love to lick that again it's a song we can tell the band made something that they like yeah you know I mean this this is another thing early on when we left the desert and my first bank is and we were so proud like we knew we found a different we thought this is cool and so you make records you love and you listen to him all the time cuz cuz it's supposed to make your favorite music I mean I was 15 years old what else was I supposed to make I can't wait to make the music I hate the most that doesn't make sense right I just wanted to wedding so you mean these bands you like you guys listen to records cuz we would be in the car onto or listen to our records and play our records and they be like not out there so you create it that's it seems like that's the job actually you know and how can you look how can you love my stuff if I don't write the f****** chances like 0.0 is such a popular and people really loved it but you f****** hate to do this really wonderful thing happened took over and they own it because we stopped and so they took it over the fence kept it alive and some people gave it a name Stoner Rock what he is doing Rock was like Ozzy when I was a kid baseball shirts show I want to be a punk rocker because whatever I like right right right now you could call it Jazz rabbit style of music can be like f****** fantastic but I just like what I like in that anyways yeah it's just a noise you're making with your face Charlie Brown's teacher Charlie Brown's teacher stuff for not like it's good to feel part of something</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you answered the fifth-round Kelvin you said I'm ready to die then was I looked at him and I remember I collected Diablo he was looking at me and he just had this like looking into swinging his hands and I said you're not going to beat me I'm prepared to die and I'm meant that man I swear to God on my life I meant that I'm even getting Goosebumps think see that like I meant that s*** cuz I was like look and this is how I die but I was trying to get him I was trying to kill him I knew cuz of me if I'm ready to die I'm ready to kill you have to be willing to give something up as well so in that fifth-round when I was throwing those shots when I was four times or something crazy like leaving the last one like went from Heaven hit him I wished I didn't like and like roll over on them cuz I probably could have got him I would like to second left but I was trying to get him out of there then and it's sad to say but I was ready if he had taken it to me and he anatomy and I didn't wake up so be it well that was evident in the way you fought because you didn't you didn't you know was a close fight but it look like you were head on the judges but you didn't take me any break at all you just threw yourself into the fire instead of being cautious you know I love you cancel a lot of my trips cuz it's also compete on my knee but also just fomo being away from the gym like you feel it after a while. Level like after the fight because that you can see the Target on your back people smile in your face you know and then yeah what's up how much do I seen a lot of people in this game Rising 400% all the time so I want to get back to doing what I do best you you probably like can live a social media free life now they still make money doing real hard Dave doesn't he's one of the only people that I know that does but he's so intelligent about that kind of s*** he doesn't engage in that doesn't engage in other people's opinions of him so I can use my phone doesn't judge it's always somebody getting ran over by a car the minute you do the pocket check you do like all four pockets in first thing you said f*** interview with the worst thing is a person that's going when you're going out with a group of people in a person whose phone just ruin the whole f****** not yet because then you got to go f****** search for it I ran around go back be quiet to call my phone to be like you got your phone you losing everything and I lost the phone and I was like I went to sleep and I woke up what time it was 10 hours on the phone about to go crazy over how to people f****** do this how do you find out directions Ari shaffir went without a phone for four months for it was a reality show reality show he just decided to go to Asia I travel all around Asia went to like what the Vietnam can't now Wu-Tang was designed like to come together for a common cause right and that cause of course be in to express our art2ride ourselves out of poverty in the feet are family so that was that was the foundation but it is not designed to fall apart inside Wu-Tang that's why it's called Wu-Tang forever white bulky come back together we always got to come back to the same like to expose it all to the world through one Outlet do you like the name a group of six Society she said she said Donnell I think suicide is falling apart I said Niger it was supposed to fall apart is supposed to fall apart but with his fault fault does it land somewhere you can grow something else like I knew it was only three people that were going to be stars that was for other people ever going to be writers okay I got you there so that word you said fall apart I didn't even though like everybody everybody everybody had the chops everybody wasn't a superstar right and it's proven to this day some people like this the party was like it was going to go there and then it was just going to be like if all I did is Yo-Yo it was good we all got it and I want to know that this strong enough to date did Diggs it cuz exist independently of two different areas but I always come back together if they want to leave the individual out of it and ask how much Social damage is caused by any of those things and alcohol number one I have been a free ride it's incredible to me. Like if I said to you that I was on the board of Philip Morris you would say that's that's pretty screwed up 3 * the social damage then what Lamar's is produced except except alcohol advertising and sponsorship but you go to a college ballgame and you know Bud Light will have will be an active sponsor of the event will have some huge relationship with the school this is crazy it's crazy right just like this is the drug that is causing so many problems for you yeah, well I got people with ticket where is it's not you know I don't know why people are so messy and that is a very good example of how messy we are nuts directions Subway sandwich shop that's hilarious great show you have just dice on the road and someone announces him like that everywhere he goes. desk drawer and I was like no you don't no way they would never have around your kids because I do and he said he bet me $200 and I'm like and you know I don't have $200 I can't make that bet and I do and then he left his thing and just don't look in there yeah I never did that I was in the room why you think Freddie did that impoverished population suffering from PTSD who don't can't afford to go to Johns Hopkins to spend tens of thousands of dollars to have a clinical treatment I think this democratizes the the use of salt Ivan and microdosing that could be a benefit across our society and then why posing as you stocked with niacin and the reason is you take one tenth of a gram of psilocybin cubensis microdose the 200 mg of niacin now if someone tries to get high by taking 10 times as much so I'd like to grams of niacin this is Flushing niacin vitamin B3 and that flushing niacin will give you such an irritable reaction of skin itching of people taking vitamin B3 they know this for microdosing but moreover it excites the nerves at the end of the peripheral nervous system neuropathies often times present themselves a deadening of the fingertip the nerves of the fingertips and toes and it's also a vasodilator to this three attributes of stocking niacin with soulside mushrooms that prevents abuse becomes the antabuse it dilates the blood vessels to deliver the neurogenic benefits of psilocybin to the endpoints of the other peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system and then and also excites the nerve ending so I think those three reasons this could I hope to see in the future silicide mushrooms me over-the-counter vitamins approved by the FDA stock with niacin that allows for the universality of use Jamie pointed this out that there's a congressman and he released a series of tweets and the first letter of all these tweets if you put them all together it says Epstein didn't kill himself or did not come so so it is it's didn't he did Paul gosar what are the odds of this guy did this accidentally really small right that's kind of like one of those monkeys typing Shakespeare things could work it backwards right so you didn't see what the puzzle was until the last tweet because the last time he doesn't eat got a tweet from someone about 35 minutes ago. f****** that crazy mask is that his s*** to okay Lewis Carroll was famous for that was he yeah that was one of them did a lot of tricks with words to read the book Godel Escher Bach know the whole bunch of stuff in there about people who used who put puzzles in text probably the most blatant example of a public murder of of a crucial witness of a seen in my entire life or anybody's ever seen and the the the minimal amount of outrage about this the minimum out of cover it's f****** fascinating what's amazing to me just as you know somebody works in the media is that this was shaping up to be the biggest like new story and history and the instant he died or was died or however you want to call it the store just fell off the face of the Earth Hyde or was died or however you want to call it it's at the store just fell off the face of the Earth like nobody's doing anything about it and I don't a hundred percent understand that I get it why why that's happening but it's if it's just amazing well</div>

	<div> <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWvzJSlEX-M"> Matt Taibbi and Joe Rogan on the Brilliance of Hunter S. Thompson </a>
		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> one of my favorite books ever about politics is Fear and Loathing on the campaign trail and I wrote the introduction to that little had a great example of someone who knew that they weren't a part of that system so they could talk about as an outsider he knew his only to be covering it for a year and he just went in guns blazing got everybody f***** up drinking on the bus making it regularly to all of them yeah and he says that in the book I don't have any friends I have to keep you know so then going to tell you everything that I see and f*** it and and that's that's a real problem in reporting when you when you hit you write a beat for too long you end up have developing unhealthy relationships with sources and you end up in a position where you're not going to burn the people who your dependent on to get your information and when that happens to reporters like I think that's one of the reasons is it good to to kind of cycle through different topics over the course of York you get stuck in the same same beat too long eventually that you fall into that trap the Thompson of course it never did that like every story that he covered was he let it all hang out and just said whatever the hell 80 thought and let the chips fall where they may do that all the time probably was great it was amazing and there's no other examples of it no no level is like he is being also kind of like a novel cuz it's it's this story about this person who's like obsessed with finding meaning in truth but he he he goes to the most fake place on Earth which is the campaign Trail to look for it and it's all these depictions of all these terrible lying people they're just so hilarious and and and so it's kind of you know it's almost like a Franz Kafka novel at the same time like he's telling you how the system works and how he'll elections work and really valuable for that so yeah that was brilliant he also changed a lot I mean he actually affected politicians like the s*** they did with Ed Muskie wearing a game that was fantastic Dick Cavett Show and The Dick Cavett asked him about it he goes well there was a rumor he was on I mean it says he literally that he got in that guy's head oh yeah and they remember that he put that picture of Muskie and he's got a picture of Muskie and it's a bad option is Muskie in the throes of enable game friends right and you can get away get away with that now like he just needs yeah I'm with the wind right now I want you to rip in the process as much as he did not book so it was great it was a fantastic book yeah I mean he had a bunch of them that were great but that one particularly its you can sort of redo it you can reread it every time we get to an election cycle he needs her to let go let you know these are these repeating Cycles this this is just like that the same s*** that he was dealing with various different forms you can see it all itsfunneh the reporters everybody's read that book everybody covers Canton campaigns 5th right now for a rolling stone like I had to have his old job and everybody has read that book and so they're at they unconsciously try to make the same characters in each election cycle so there's always like a christ-like McGovern figure there is there's a you know a turncoat quisling spineless musky fish there's the Avengers the villain Nixon and Trump is Trump kind of fills that role for a lot of reporters now and then they all alive and try to behave in the same way that their characters behave in that book so you remember Frank mankiewicz was was McGovern's should have Handler and he was having beers with with Thompson after the events and, you know strategizing with reporters trying to do that they'll try to do that with the candidates and their handlers now they try to get all those same relation it's just interesting I think they're really reliving the book you know that's a problem with someone that's really good you know only they did they take on so many imitators for somebody imitators take on their demeanor and their thought process like and Hunter was just such an iconic version of a writer but it's it's so difficult that you're a fan of his to not want to be like that guy totally I mean I know that I'm ready for the same magazine and covering love the same topics you have to immediately realize that you can't do what he did like it heat houses raining was incredibly ambitious and and unique he he was using a lot of the same techniques to the great fiction writers use like he was creating almost like this four-dimensional dino story but at the same time it was also a journalism like you can't really most people couldn't get away with that be a great writer I'm not talking like a rare Mark Twain level talent to really get to do what he did which is kind of mix you know that ambition a great Fiction with journalism so if you try to do that stuff it's going to be terrible and I've done I've certainly you will go back and look at my red and you'll find a lot of like shity Thompson invitations and until I learned to not do that pretty early but that yeah look up and you'll find a lot of like shity Thompson invitations and until I learned to not do that pretty early but it's one of those don't try this at home things for Young Writers if you can get you can avoid that for sure</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this must be a personal thing for August time in American history like humor is nano unit cuz you were awarded for for stepping outside the box true in a big way like yeah you mean Dave Chappelle gets attacked but guess what he also gets rewarded in a huge way he goes onstage now people go ape shitt that's part of the reason why they go f****** Bonkers is because they know that this guy doesn't give f*** and he's one of the rare ones who doesn't give a fuk so when he goes up there you know if he thinks something crazy about whatever it is whatever protected group or whatever idea that he's not supposed to explore that's not going to stop him at all he's going to tell you exactly what he thinks about those things regardless of all this woke blowback he's not he doesn't care even more experience it with my own jokes more controversial bits get you're fired up now they love it because everyone's smothered their smothered by human resources and smothered by office politics in your smothered by social discourse restrictions and use don't feel like you can express yourself anymore this is true and in all people also don't have a they feel like they're being watched all the time and other things that I feel like I kind of can't let it all hang out yeah I think that that's that's true yeah I just I feel like I'm not a, but if but I just imagine it must be a more challenging environment but more rewarding to he said this is a great time for, because, he's dangerous again right that's true wheat like you you saw it with like Louis CK right Lil Uzi case under the microscope now that joke that he made about Parkland is absolutely Louis CK choke if you followed him throughout his career what was the joke again it's artichoke was why am I listening to these Parkland survivors why you interesting cuz you push some fat kid in the way you're laughing right like that is a Lucy Kay joke he's saying something f*****-up you're not supposed to say throughout his goddamn career he's done that that's what always done but after the jerking off in front of him and all that stuff and him coming out and admitting it in and taking much time off now he's a Target right now he does something like that and they like always alt right now like he's done outside the box f***** up but hilarious take on things and that bit unfortunate because it was released by someone committed the video that he didn't get a chance to see you was gone for 10 months and you'd only done a couple sets when he's flashing these ideas out I guarantee you he would have turned that idea into a brilliant bet they never got the chance because it was just it was set out there in the wild when it was a baby with small down by Wolves it needed to be a controversial idea that we supposed to think that they survived interesting write your f****** boring or annoying off my get off my TV and a lot of us have felt that way sure he just the way he said it was easy to take and put in you know out of contacts put in quotes and turn them into an a****** she is right it's it's taking what people thought that everybody has vocalizing that thing that thing and people can come you know come together over right that was a lot of what Richard Pryor Seymour was about like he eat he took a lot of us are uncomfortable race problems right and he's going to put them out there and both white people and black people laughed at it together you know if if people are afraid to vocalize those things I think it's going to navigate those Waters and get to the promised land of the punchline it's even more rewarding right but you just have to explain yourself better you have to have better points you have to have a better structure to your material where you while that the people who may find your idea objectionable they you you coax that Michael Mahan I'm going to take you to the woods we're going to be okay or follow me was not funny but you have to navigate it skillfully and you have to navigate it thoughtfully and you have to really have a point you can't have a half-ass point but if you can't have a situation where it's fatal to be off by a little bit I know it like the there was a writer that I loved growing up so we arrived. Shooting him about people say that we don't have as much Freedom as we used to but actually all the all the you know that the Communist party is done is break his prevented us from writing badly outlawed now is writing badly right and everybody laughed but he was actually saying something pretty serious which is that you can't write well unless you can you know Screw Up To You know what I like on the way to being creative in a good way you have to miss you know and if missing is not allowed and there's and you're not going to get art you're not going to get Revelation you're not going to get all these things and then comedy is particularly important because you have to work it out in front of people absolutely no I used to sit at a comedy club in in Manhattan when I was in college and you know they would try out their material like on a Wednesday right early and that was always most interesting time for me like they're trying stuff out and lot of it wasn't so good but you know it was interesting right and you just can't have a situation where people feel like you know one wrong word is going to ruin your career yeah yeah there's also people that are wolves and they're trying to take out that little baby joke wandering through the woods and they want that feeling of being able to take someone down right and that that's you know that's your getting that now to just just until now because that there's like Yonder bags at The Improv I'm performing tonight do they use Yonder bags to put yourself on the back when you go in there so you can't record things yondr bag it's just so strange it's like all the shows I did with your pal he uses yondr bags and ideas to prevent people from from filming and recording and you know and then eventually putting your stuff out there</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I'm kind of all for that I mean I seen this with politicians on the campaign Trail like they are so tight now in ways that they used to not be we saw the Donald Trump thing Donald Trump jr. Trump jr. they didn't want him to do they want him to do a Q&amp;A and he didn't want to do it so that they budem the right-wing people have no yelling out to be able to talk people that were like far right far-right people they just didn't think he was being right enough for who's playing the game wrong or he wasn't wasn't letting them complain to him right right yeah I know that's bad and politicians are aware of that now and they're they're constantly where they're at their on film everywhere and so they are you know a thousand percent most interesting because yeah they're they're recovering campaign in 2004 and I was Dennis kucinich give a speech somewhere he was going from I think Maine to New Hampshire and I said what can I get a ride back in the answers I guess you're so you can text me on the the van he like takes his shoes off is a cracking jokes and everything and like eating udon noodles or something political candidates would not do that now like they'd be afraid to be off the record with you afraid to be around people and just behave like people you know is not good I don't think it's the weirdest I'm ever to be a politician because it's you got this one guy who made it through being hugely flawed and just going to the f****** locker room talk and everything and so you've got him who seems like he's so greasy like nothing sticks them and then you have everyone else who's terrified of any slight misstep yet totally and you can't replicate the way Trump does this he was born this way there's like a thing going on in his head like he is in a pathologically driven to behave in a certain way and he's not going to be cowed by the way you know people are researching because yous doesn't think that way no he's but that's no one else is going to behave like that when you think about him and speed cilory he was always ramped-up he was very watch that speech you know we're not supposed to draw conclusions about but you know what I just watched Donald Trump's performance after the results of the super Tuesday rolling in 2016 badly but we going to make it she's been there for so long mean if she hasn't straighten it out by now she's not going to straighten it out in the next four years it's just going to become worse than worse she wants to make America whole again and I'm trying to what is that all about is brain one or two this happen I was going to be the man like I was the goddamn president was going to happen for me I could see it happening I saw him than in Ames Iowa standing alone in the park waiting for people to try to shake his hand. glitter on adderal and it's very effective and gives you confidence it gives you a delusional perspective you get a delusional state of confidence it makes people think they can do anything it's basically a low-level meth it's very similar to methamphetamine chemical sure and people are on it it's not good for a writer because writing is one of these things were one of the most important things as being able to step back and and and ask him I really but my full of s*** here is you are my jokes is funny is I think they are like once that mechanism starts to go wrong you know you're really lost yeah right audience with yourself in front of a computer so I don't think a lot of stuff done so that's that's good but but yeah I know I think there's a lot of people who are on it now and also thought it was because kids come up through school and they're on it to you know and they get used to it so I know I have kids I wouldn't dream of giving giving them any of those drugs you know I think it's crazy taco bowl at Trump Tower in behind them is an Open Drawer in that open drawers boxes of Sudafed and Sudafed level buzz and the the thought mean this is why I used to have to go to CVS to buy the stuff you stuff to give your drivers I guess you still do you have to give your driver's license cuz they want to make sure you're not cooking meth cooking up a batch in a holler in Kentucky and you go in and get 20 20 boxes of Sudafed are pretty much people know what you're doing there that's really funny did it so we had a bunch of Sudafed behind us in his box and you know there was that one reporter that was again who had a whole he wrote a series of tweets which eventually taken down by the way Jamie I can't find tweets he wrote series tweet that there was a very specific Duane Reade Pharmacy worth got amphetamines for something that was in quotes called a metabolic disorder Kurt eichenwald front of 1982 Trump start taking amphetamine derivatives of use them only supposed to take two for 25 days stayed on for 8 years really now is he full of s*** so interesting because he's written some really good books and finance Rachel is really really good then when I was starting out running a Wall Street I was like wow these books are really incredibly well research but he had some stuff in the in 2016 where like that's an example of something as a reporter I see that where's that coming from you know and cuz you in journalism you can't really accuse somebody of certain things unless it's backed up to the nth degree so be concerned about the Chug of leap I don't know I mean that's one time stepped outside the journalistic boundaries of what you can absolutely prove and not proved and took a leap and that's why I think he took down the Duane Reade Pharmacy didn't take it down I was still there the well there was there was another thing about a day where is this from Walker drug was diethylpropion 75 mg a day prescription filled at Duane Reade on 57th Street Manhattan not that I know things so you know get the doctor's name to dr. Joseph Greenberg counter with medical records the White House admitted to me only a short time for diet that he took it when he was not a little Wayne that's fun he says I countered with medical records they cut me off while I mean Hummer H3 sometimes you hear things in and you know they're pretty solid but you put if not quite reportable because the person won't put their name on it or you know you're not a hundred percent sure that the document is a real document maybe photocopy and that that can be very very tough reporter cuz they know something's true but they they can't they can't social media has eliminated a barrier that we used to have we have to go through a divorce in fact Checkers and now you know you're on you know right right right where you can hint at something you know and I think that's that's something you don't want to get into it says reporter too much you know yeah that's a weird use of social media right it's like service slippery escape from journalistic Rules yeah exactly you know or you can you can insinuate that somebody did X Y and Z or you can you can use terms that are a little bit sloppy like you know I can like took that stuff for Don at so if you have the White House spokesperson saying that they he took it for a short time for a diet then you find that's a reportable start right yeah yeah well I think when people get into that s*** it's very hard for them to get out of that s*** that's the speed train and I've seen many people hop on it. A lot stops nobody seems to get off with their teeth intact. You know it's the that's that's not a good old precise eats fast food and gets so much f****** energy I mean people want to think he's a super person you know but maybe he's on speed maybe yeah I know he's just going to have collapsed turnover and collapse one way a lot longer on speed and people think maybe we just do it the right way history always works where people get murdered and died of industrial accidents in bad Health when they're you know 30 all the time but the worst people in the country make it to very old agent and you know and Diane dinner alcoholic and maybe that's something right maybe maybe you know who has the worst diet in the world and maybe he's on speed and maybe it's also your perception of how you interface with the world maybe it's because he's not this introspective guy that's really worried about how people see him and feel about him maybe doesn't feel you know what it whether it's sociopathy or whatever it is he doesn't feel the bad feelings they don't get in there yeah he doesn't have the the stress impact bright and anything about speed apparently because of the fact that it makes you feel delusional and it makes you feel like you're the f****** man like I don't worry about what other people and losers who care it doesn't have the the stress impact bright and anything about speed apparently because of the fact that it makes you feel delusional and it makes you feel like you're the f****** man like I don't worry about what other people that is f****** losers who care</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this this congressman is that who does Jamie pointed this out that there's a congressman and he released a series of tweets and the first letter of all these tweets if you put them all together it says Epstein didn't kill himself or did not come so so it is it didn't he did like one of those monkeys typing Shakespeare could work it backwards right so you didn't see what the puzzle was until the last tweet because the last time he doesn't eat got a tweet from someone about 35 minutes ago. I don't know if there's a bunch what is that mask for Vendetta wasn't representative of something if the Guy Fawkes mask give me the book little Esther Bach know yeah there's a whole bunch of stuff in there about people who used who put puzzles in text 18th century before in case is probably the most blatant example of a public murder of of a crucial witness I've ever seen in my entire life or anybody's ever seen and the the the minimal amount of outrage about this then it's f****** fascinating what's amazing to me just as a you know somebody works in the media is that this was shaping up to be the biggest like new story and history and the instant he died or was died or however you want to call it to the store just fell off the face of the Earth 100% it's just amazing well when the woman from ABC what was her name Amy that lady the one who write about having the scoop and having that story and them squashing it right like this this is all stuff that everybody used to think was conspiracy everybody's think this was Stoner talk does he know what I mean like this is stuff when people just delusional they believe all kinds of wacky conspiracies sure but the reality is much less complicated will just is not possible this is one of those things it's so obvious it's so in everyone's face will lose a couple things going like there are many different ways this can play out I mean you can have a news director who just serve instinctively decides when we can't do that story because I might want to have will and Kate on later or I might want to have this Deshawn later and it's it's not like anybody tells them necessarily that we can't do this but it's a size too hot if you grow up in this system and you've been in the business for a long time you just eat these things that are drilled into you and almost at the cellular level about what you can and cannot get into and I think they're both there was some exposed to things have happened with that seem to I mean they keep that there were a lot of news agencies that killed stories about him that you know we're hearing you know so yeah it's it's this tastes bad it's terrible yeah yeah when I found out the Clinton fluno lesson 26 x on a plane with Epstein I was like dude I haven't flown that many times with my mom I don't know but I mean that many flights to have the Secret Service people involved incredibly bold is Clinton that much of a hound that he would go that deep into the well that many times 26 times that's the thing about the options for that makes no sense to me like I I thought that the percentage of people who are out-and-out like perverts who had a serious problem like with pediophilia whatever it was was pretty small you know yeah but they had a lot of people coming in and out of this compound and it just seems like it's a it's a very strange story they really up to I have I have no idea and was was it all a blackmail scheme it's just it's just so strange pedophilia aspect of it might be directly connected to Epstein himself like he might be the one that has a problem with girls are like 16 and he likes them very did like them but with the other guys it could just be girls could be yeah I mean that's why it's so crazy like how could it be that these but maybe it's not what they must but they knew who he was didn't know the extent of it probably not until he was arrested and then yes yes stories out of there that they don't want you to have this is this is like the mother of all stories in the uncertain terms of that and they're just little little breadcrumbs here in there that whole thing about Acosta you know the Vanity Vanity Fair quote from him is that he said that when he looked at the case that he didn't do it because I was told you belong to intelligence yes what does that mean Rio whose intelligence you know what I mean like what agency will work for now and then do I have friends on Wall Street and tell me I've never heard a single instance of this guy actually having a trade you know so what was his hedge fund doing you know I mean if you think about it the perfect way to do blackmail cuz you can just have people putting money in and out all the time and it would look like investment yeah so very strange story had a conversation with him write this is nonsense almost instantaneous response what real clients did he ever have what I need and what was it going to billion dollars or whatever he had half a billion under management and that's ridiculous Victoria Secret's give him a million-dollar home right in New York City like what I mean these are all things that would have been really interesting to get into try to kill himself suicide didn't happen to them like in the wire for a dollar yeah yeah usually only get through strangulation right yeah he fell on the ground and accidentally broke I can't make the story work in a way that isn't you know that's the thing it's like it gets to a point where you like okay even Michael Shermer run skeptic magazine and liquid the cameras were not working what's the innocent explanation for any reason on that doesn't make any sense you can't you can't spin it in any way to make it not a crazy conspiracy the brother hires a doctor to do an autopsy in interesting because it's because it's about villains on both sides of the aisle right the Press does not like to do stories where the problem is bipartisan right so when you have an Institutional problem when Democrats and Republicans both share responsibility for it when you know where or if it's an institution that kind of exist in perpetuity no matter what the administration is we don't really like you to those stories we live in Fox Lake City stories about Democrats MSNBC likes to do stories about Republicans but the thing that's kind of you know all over the place they don't like to do that story Epstein is you know he's friends with Trump and and with Clinton and this is one of the reasons why this story doesn't have a lot of traction in the media because neither side really likes the idea of going to deeply on it feels like to me well it's but it did the blatant aspect of it don't mean to that we have to that as the absolute murder the Jamal khashoggi murder that's the closest thing we have to her absolute murder right this one but it but it's also so insanely blatant but now you have foreign actors are involved it and they'll disperse and then this is left with this confusion of who's responsible for it that's another example you can't really say it's you know once I do both parties have been incredibly complicit in their cooperation with send indeed on the massacres that are going on in Yemen this classic example of what Noam Chomsky used to talk about with worthy and unworthy victims right like if the if the Soviet communist did it they were that was bad but if death squads in El Salvador kill the priest or a Catholic priest do you know then that that was something we didn't write about cuz they were our clients State Yemen is a story we don't write about Siri is a story we do right about it but they're really equivalent stories and they were our clients State Yemen is a story we don't write about Siri is a story we do right about it but they're really equivalent stories and yeah but you're absolutely right the khashoggi thing I don't think either party and or either sides media really wants to get into that all that deeply</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> will you get journalism back on track is it possible at this point because it is a lost art is it going to be like calligraphy I mean Japanese calligraphy kind of did the job without the editorializing I think it would have it would probably have a lot of followers right away would make money and nobody has clued into that yet like if some candy entrepreneur to do that and that would have bring back the business that or you know journalism has always been kind of Quasi subsidized in this country and then going back to the Pony Express Newspapers were carried free across in the west right that US Postal Service said that the original 19th Communications Act of 1934 the idea you can lease the public Airwaves but you had to do something in the public interest so you you could make money doing sports and entertainment but you could take a loss on news and so it was kind of Quasi subsidized in that way but that doesn't exist anymore there's no subsidy really for news anymore I'm not sure I agree with that being the way to go but it has to be something because right now the financial pressure to be bad is just too is too great you know that there's no there's no way to sorry go on this but I can when I can from the business when the money started getting tighter the first thing they got rid of where the long-form investigative reporters like you couldn't just hire somebody to work on a story for 3 months anymore because you needed them to do content all the time then they got rid of the fact Checkers you know which had another serious problem you know and and so now the money is so tight they just have these people doing clickbait all the time and they're not doing real reporting and so if they have to fix the money problem how much is a changed recently because like when that piece of the stuff that you wrote about the banking crisis was my favorite coverage of it and that the most relatable in understandable and the way you spelled everything out could you do that today yeah but I think it would be harder because huge impact on attention span so you know I was reading like 7000 word articles about credit default swaps and stuff like that and I was trying really hard to make it interesting for people you know you use jokes and humor and stuff like that but now people would not have the energy to really fight through that you have to make it shorter even TV you know that people that you don't see that kind of reporting that in-depth kind of process reporting people teaching people something because people just tune out right away that they need just a quick hit a headline on a couple of facts so yeah there's a big problem with audience right which we've trained audiences to consume the news differently and all they really want to get as a take now you know it's like the everything's like an ESPN. Take Ryan so you know so that's what we're doing right now hours and hours long and there's a bunch of them out there now the only mine is an isolated one and there's so many podcast that cover and some of them cover them like in a cereal form like the Dropout was up with that was what they called it yes it was the drop I was the one about that woman who created that fake blood Campo yes right you Susan Elizabeth Elizabeth my whole territory completely fraudulent podcast listening to him podcast Forum listening to actual conversations from these people listening to people's interpretations these conversations listening to people that were there at the time telling telling stories about when they knew things were weird noticing these days there's like tests that were incorrect that they were covering up that kind of shed that you can do that now with something like this and I think that one of the good things about podcast to is you don't need anybody to tell you that you could you could publish this yeah I know apps absolutely I think you're you're right and I think it's like this reveal that the news companies are wrong about some things about audiences like they they think that people can handle an in-depth discussion about things they think that audiences only want to watch 30 seconds or something they don't they're they're interested that they do have curiosity about things it's just it's very difficult to convince people in the news business especially to take chances on that kind of content you don't know what you'll do it for a podcast will do it for a documentary but but for for the news they just they're making things shorter and shorter you know I was really lucky to have an editor who I emailed understood the idea that we have to get into this an in-depth or else it's going to be meaningless to Brian right that's pretty rare you know for the most part they you don't see them taking that kind of bad anymore but maybe podcast will help people puncture that but the flip side of that is that they're not they're not investing and stuff like like international news in the way they used to every every big Network have Euros in every major city around the world in of Rome Berlin Moscow whatever it is right now add newsrooms full of people who are you know. They're Gathering news now there's none of that because they figured out they can make the money just as easily by having somebody sitting in the office and in Washington or New York and just you know link to something and have it take on something so I think the news is getting worse podcast agree more interesting maybe maybe there's a medium they can find in between well documentaries as well documentaries are commercially viable if it's a great subject like I could examples that wild wild country one you know I didn't even know that that cult existed I have no idea what what happened up there and then so this documentary sheds light on it does it over like I think it was like 6 episodes or something like that all over the place you have these criminal justice cases and they're terrible Injustice has happened and you know if you could really tell the whole story and make characters out of people invest the time in any added to tell tell it well people still like really good storytelling but I think within the news business they just they have this belief there hard-headed belief that people can't handle difficult material and I don't know why that is it's I mean I think there's a large number of people that aren't satisfied intellectually buy a lot of stuff they're being spoon-fed and they think that because the the vast majority of things are commercially viable are short attention span things I think that's like this real sloppy way of thinking non risk-taking way of thinking they like wasn't this is how people consume things you got to give him like a music video style editing or they did just tune out but there's thirst for actual long-form conversations and actual real in-depth exploration of something and it in a very digestible way like when they're good things about doing your podcast for this podcast any podcast really that you could listen to it while you're commuting listen to it and it'll actually give you something that occupies your mind interest you during what would normally be dead time right and you're absolutely right about the thirst for something else and then I think when people turn on most news products there they're getting this predictable set of things and that doesn't quench that thirst for them they're not they're not being challenged anyway they're not seeing different sides of a topic you know you're not approaching covering a subject Honestly by genuinely you know it's boring people you may have thought were bad or right or wrong it's just all predictable people are fleeing to other things now right they just they they want they want to just get the story they don't they don't want to have a whole lot of thing on the editorializing on top of it and yeah and yeah I think also there's a lot of under estimating of audiences going out there like we we just think that they can handle stuff and they can they're there their they're interested but we we we just take it for granted that they can't do it maybe I'm guilty of that to you know cuz I've been doing this for but yeah it it it does happen early people changed that much ya know probably and probably not it's just it's just difficult you know. Maybe it's all so we don't have the stamina to to stick with a story in the same way that we used to like now if his story doesn't get a million hits right away we don't go beyond return to the subject you know you think about stores like Watergate Bernstein first get those stories differ complete. Everybody thought they were on the run past they were the only people who were covering it and a lot of those stories kind of felt around you know what I mean that they didn't get the big response and it wasn't until much later that it became this hot thing that everybody was watching and you wouldn't so that so that wouldn't happen now right look at freshman reporters were on a story if it didn't catch fire within the first couple of of a passes your editors probably going to take you off it now what was that story The New York Times worked on about Trump and timer for a long time and it was released and went in and out of the new cycle in a matter of days nobody gave a f*** yeah with the one about his finances yes and it was like a 36000 word story it was like unbelievable it has like six times as big as any is the biggest story of ever been in my life giant take down right yeah and it was it your it was like a 36-hour thing if that right and maybe maybe yeah and people kind of said this is amazing it's kind of information in it and it just fell flat you know and that's the important thing about that is that news companies see this and they say wow we invested all this time and money we put our you know really good reporters on this way gave him 6 months to work on something and it got the same amount of hits as you know some story about you know a carp with a human face that was filmed in China know what I mean like so it's something that we the wire. I couldn't in page 11 whatever it was so then that's what that tells in the incentives now are let's not bother let's let's not do 6-months investment investigations of anything anymore because what's the point we're going to get as many hits doing something dumb so they just don't take the risk anymore so crazy it. The incentive now that it's all clicks totally it's such a strange trap to fall into you know there's nothing I wrote on the book is that there was a series of cases in the in the 80s and 90s were reporters can I took on big companies I'm the Chiquita banana thing that the Cincinnati Enquirer did remember the movie The Insider up Ryan Williamson Tobacco Company CBS right there was another one with Monsanto in Florida or some Fox reporters when after Monsanto and they so they all got sued and cost their companies a ton of money and reputation already and so after that what news company said is why take on a big company that can fight back and throw a lawsuit at us and what do we win by that we're not going to get more audience from that you know so now if you watch consumer reporting you know it like a small TV station usually it's they're going to bang on some little Chinese restaurant that has roaches or something like that they're not going to go after Monsanto or or Nino chiquito because there's no point that it's too much of a risk so they just don't do it and that's another thing that's what's gone wrong with reporting you know they date did the economic benefit of going after a powerful adversary isn't there anymore so they don't do it and that's what that's a problem. Clearly you've seen a giant change in journalism from when you first started to where we are now do you have any fears or concerns about the future this is what you do for a living what is your what are your thoughts on it where you think it's going I mean I'm really worried about it because because you need the journalist to kind of exist apart from politics and to be a check on everything that the whole idea of having a fourth estate is that it's separate from the political parties in right I mean I don't work for the DNC it's not my job to write bad news about Donald Trump GNC's job you know they they they put out press releases about them and if people see us as as being indistinguishable from political parties are being all editorial then we don't have any power anymore like that's that's the first thing that the Press doesn't have any any ability to influence people if people don't see us as independent and truthful and all those things and so that's what I really worried about right now is like people won't. Listening to the media they'll still too nice out don't trust us anymore like Walter Cronkite from you know 1972 the Gallup poll agency found he was most trusted man in America and that was true also in 1985 like for 13 consecutive years he was the most trusted with there's no reporter in America who's who's the best a trusted man in America if people think you're a joke you know and then that's why that's what I really worried about we don't have any institutional self-respect anymore we don't we don't feel like we have to watch out challenge audiences challenge challenge powerful people you know it's it's just a bunch of talking points and that's that's not what the business is about so I worry about it and you know I think there's a lot of journalists to kind of say the same thing we all kind of talk some Talk Amongst ourselves which is the job as we knew it is kind of being phased out and change into something else and and that's not that's not a good thing you know because people do need a tough time with people need need the Press is not as ridiculous as that sounds now because but it's true and I don't know if we're where we go from here legitimate journalism is so important of the people that were actually involved in it you to see it a certain way you're not going to find out from people that have Financial incentives and giving you a specific narrative you need real journalism it's so hard to find I think it's one of the reasons why we're so lost and it's one of them more Insidious aspects of the term fake news cuz God damn it so easy to throw around it's like it's so easy to call someone a big it is so easy to call someone a racist and so is it safe fake news and all that they all have the same sort of a fact they just diminish any you have to say almost instantaneously totally and there's white when you can cast the entire news is being fake people can tune it to In-N-Out but a lot of it has to do with it but who is doing the news reading now right like in the sixties and seventies maybe before reporters a lot of them came from the middle and lower classes like the you know they were it was the job was originally kind of like being a plumber right away it was more of a trade than a profession you had a lot of people who who went into the job and they had this kind of attitude of just wanted to Stick it to the Man you know like they they they didn't want to be close to power they wanted to take it on the book Seymour Hersh right like if you see that kind of personality just wants to take the truth and rub it in somebody's face but then after all the presidents men it became the sexy thing to be a journalist and you saw a lot of people from my generation who went to journal they wanted to be close to politicians and hang out with them become like the primary colors thing right where you see people who they just want to like have a beer with the with the presidential candidate and that's totally different from what used to be like Nelson out now we're on the wrong side of that rope line UCI I'm saying like like we used we used to be outside of power like taking it on and now we're kind of Steel are more upper class and in the press and we're kind of in bed class in the press and we're kind of in bed with the same people we're supposed to be covering and that's that's not a good thing P1 people see that they they they you know that's that's one of the reasons why they say they call it fake news because they they see us doing PR for you know rich people</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and that is the mushroom that was documented in the sacred mushroom and the cross where John Marco Allegro alleged that he alleged that the entire Christian religion was essentially misunderstanding it was really all about the consumption of the Psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals and that these were all sort of like captured and stories and tales and parables his work what do you think well linguistically the guy's way over my head when I read his book it's all about Linguistics translators of the Dead Sea Scrolls Way Beyond my Ken of knowledge it's so far beyond my kind of knowledge I can't make Weimar reason out of it that seems to be the problem with it most people can't so but I know but I don't buy it boys conclusion that he made but clearly mushrooms have inspired religion and itc's workshops on Gourmet &amp; medicinal mushrooms and that one of these workshops is very spiritual guy he's very quiet but very definitely walked us to look like the real deal Rams inner circle and a bunch of us take psilocybin mushrooms have sacraments and it's brought us brought us closer to Jesus closest to our religion Muslim or Christian or Hindu the idea of these mushrooms making you feel the the spiritual Universe more spiritually connected giving her cultural heritage in your reference points but he said these are extremely important out my mother was a Charismatic Christian I met some people in her group who came to their religious beliefs through psychedelics don't dislike it looks now but that's was our portal they have their big Revelation through psychedelics so the the connection between psilocybin and magic mushrooms and religion I think has a lot of credibility and has lots of greatest examples of that the specificity of some of the arguments people make I have great great doubts about that's interesting what about in the ancient Hindu religions of the ancient Hinduism some of the ancient books speak of various sacraments of sort of never been defined right so there is a connection I've always thought it curious that this last week events this is such a religious provoking a mushroom and your cows are highly revered as being sacred I would think you would keep the mother of the mushroom sacred and they want to protect the resource but again it when fables and Parables and and religious rights were controlled by the cognoscenti and they are The Gatekeepers of powerful for the general population to understand or appreciate and so they protected that knowledge and that mess that's the rule of most religions is that the Inner Circle you know who holds the keys to the kingdom and what's happened with Orthodox religion says they create institutions where you have to pay tithing in order to have a gatekeeper just to have a contact on and that I think is is the problem with monotheism vs polytheism Jack Herer before he died was working on a book of psychedelic drugs specifically mushrooms and and religious experiences and he had some really crazy old paintings that he had found that showed people that were naked seemingly dancing and Ecstasy with a translucent Mushroom around them and the idea being that this was supposed to this this image was supposed to represent someone who's tripping there's a lot of really interesting books that have been wish that show art you know going back hundreds of years even in a window into the late to 1300 showing Christian artwork mushrooms are pretty easily seen so there's there's a lot of history but historical information probably lot of it's true hard to say which is which is true which is not reasonable right now Johns Hopkins clinical studies are on spirituality this is being significantly positive their friends or colleagues fellow workers also say that materially change these people's personality but the 32-minute people have negative experiences the negativity of experience did not extend more than experience itself so this is speaks to re remembering and what's been determined is when you have these really profound spiritual experiences it sits with you and when you re remember it you rekindle that thought and this may be a web overlaying PTSD rather have the standard this associated with PTSD you were supplanted with a positive experience for the people had negative experiences during tripping did not have a negative that negative consequences did not spend more than experience itself so this was our profound insight and so John Hopkins Roland Griffiths just emailed me recently looking Ivan and then measuring the consequences of those experiences months or a year or two later and again the same thing is reinforced these psilocybin mushroom experiences create a positive reference point that you can capitalize on by remembering them subsequent from this experience by not even having to take the mushrooms again that is profound will you have a happy memory that you can anchor your holding on is a game-changer I just wonder if we're ever going to see in our lifetime centers where you can go and a trained professional can guide you through something like that happening now is it at the California Institute of Integrative studies it has a tremendous momentum indigenous peoples have a really nice structure many of them do not all but many have a really good structure for the responsible use of these substances us there are displaced people so I will call us European the pace people and many other people displaced we don't have the same constructs historically that we can operate within and so the psychotherapist movement is huge right now Canada's leading the way they could is very very positive towards psychedelic therapy because the opioid crisis and because significant resulted in the movie that has come out called Dost and its tracks are heroin addict the young lady and Vancouver it is Rohit movie it is not one of these but it is it is it is intense and she's welcome as he also does high doses of mushrooms but the opioid crisis is so pervasive they're so poor treatments available that through the Psychedelic therapies and several days they're saying a tremendous success and people breaking in a decades-long opiate addiction within a week and so the Psychedelic therapist or integral to that success and so there are there are clinics now Rising all over the world for this and Portugal and Mexico and Portugal and Mexico and Spain in Jamaica are the clinics are rising specifically to meet the needs of people who are trying to get these legally so they don't get in trouble with law so in Portugal and Spain in Jamaica the friend says that these are legal how many of these substances are</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> no there was for a long time a stigma associated with anything that had anything to do with mushrooms particularly because of psychedelic mushrooms is that is that alleviated I know the John Hopkins study on psilocybin as shown some pretty incredible benefits and there's a lot of people now they're starting to look to it for treatment for people with PTSD or addiction issues has that become more mainstream in in your experience it's there's a vast title change in medical science there's a slide these are just a few of the University's right now that I've been approved by the FDA and other agencies for human clinical studies on psilocybin wow that's amazing things well right up 20 more but you couldn't read them cuz I had to be able to just to be able to visit this is a huge shift in the clinical studies are coming out for as you know PTSD in particular has been extremely useful but one of them there came out Johns Hopkins for breaking tobacco addiction 15 patients small clinical study statistically significant 10 out of 15 people after one or two heroic dose of psilocybin 12 months later had not seen wow so I mean to break tobacco addiction which were the most addictive substances on this planet is phenomenal in the other research for a PTSD depression I'm really excited about cognition and creativity I think we can get a lot of smart people out there on smart people listening to a podcast I think the idea of microdosing and being able to increase or ability of cognition and creativity to come up with us oceans that I can get it all up and get us out of this mess just think of that we had hundreds of millions of people thinking about Solutions like I've come up with the solve some of the environmental challenges we have today for food biosecurity the loss of bees is a threat to our national security just think about the effect of our economy so this microdosing I think has an enormous potential as well think about the issues I see right now with a clinical studies is like almost two I want the statistically significant great universities great science publishing. Journals the top of their game but they these mushrooms that have so many benefits for fighting dementia potentially Alzheimer's Johns Hopkins has an Alzheimer clinical study on Gwen currently for a dose of psilocybin to see if it helps Alzheimer's patients and not go in the pool and Alzheimer's there's so many different it's almost like a chaos of data how to be true so I might Mighty Man and Pam Chris cozza MD from British Columbia we've been working with people and we have just launched today at an app that's a microdose. Me the font Andre microdose taught me it's available on the Apple Stores available Android and this is a quick little microdosing study app wildest on the App Store big shift and it's a schedule 1 drug that they're talking about taking on microdose levels I mean I'm just saying what it is right now obviously know what camp I'm in I want everybody to do it but this this is really significant is that measures your ability to hear what are your stocking it with but it's also good for non psychoactive substance use what is your Baseline so you're getting older I'm getting older I'm getting younger do I have a new thing that I bought for you I figured it out but the idea is great bass lines you know and then you create a baseline overtime find out how far you deteriorated so stop me is it will create a massive datasets massive amount of data and then we'll offer this to conditions for them to see signal from the noise I suspect hypothetically I don't have the evidence but several doctors are collected case studies of tinnitus or tinnitus that with pronunciations are correct of the buzzing in your ears and then being able and people have resolved that from doing microdosing have hearing loss or more overtime how much hearing loss leads to depression because you can't hear your loved one say things and you can arguments and I didn't hear you and you didn't say nothing I'm just adjusting ramifies how so the ability of being able to have better cognition a better neurological development and helping hearing Vision depression if the interesting thing about the microdosing that we've been collecting is that people tend to be happy and they're happier with a more creative and with a more creative for happier you learning a new cata the next day you nailed it you're up and going to do it again you writing a new book you're doing an artist work so creativity Breeze happiness happiness breeds creativity and then the opposite is true malaise and depression you're not a creative you're you're you're not enjoying life not looking forward to the next day so I think it's binary choice the idea of using microdosing and that the definite microdosing is is has a variable interpretations so the using these solasofia cubensis scale which is the most common psilocybe Mushroom in the world one gram is Lift-Off 5 grams is what parents would say was the hero's journey you might say but when you do one tenth of a 1-gram you don't feel it 120th for sure you don't feel it so the ideas you do microdosing below the threshold of intoxication but then it benefits neurogenesis these are some numbers but basically one gram is almost equivalent to 1 mg per kilogram of body weight 70 kilos is 152 lb on so at 1 mg per kilogram of with these mice that's like one grandma cubensis that's that's a dose floor and they gave a tone. seconds later they were shot so the other tone again few minutes later on 40 seconds later they got shocked after 10 rotations that mice realize like Pavlov's dog when there is a tone there could be a negative consequence of shock and fear with a microdose one versus a full dose interesting legal 10 rotations of noshok the tone and their shock before they forgot or became re-acclimated not to have the fear conditioned response with the microdose 1/10 of that and I took two rotations two rotations with a microdose and they'd Associated but there's any PTSD why do you think it's a it looks like the neurogenic benefits of microdosing are greater than the neurogenic benefits of microdosing yes that is all beneficial for changing your life but going microdosing over the long term because the nerves don't we grow and 6 hours but over weeks of regeneration of nerves with microdosing it seems to me that the microdosing instead of flooding and overwhelming all the receptors are feeding these receptors they allowing for neurogenesis now this is a again hypothesis if so many great people studying this right now but I'm advocating to all of the Clint clinicians at Johns Hopkins at Stanford UCLA at Harvard please do testing of the patients for hearing and vision and other behave test that are not just about emotion and mood and PTSD but let's actually get some physical measurements so then you can track prior during the during his tooth complicate this is too into much intervention your trip your brains out you'll have time to be tested to do for a vision audited but then post wise and then looking out that the residual effects know the Doctor James fadiman he has call was microdosing one day on 2 days off 1 days on my protocol that I'm suggesting is 4 days on 3 days off and James are good friends we talked about this we laughed and we were just basically a hypothetical potential treatment comparing data between the two of you will do we want call the following Protocols are using it with niacin where you do have a lion's mane what are you using within lion's mane that's phenomenally powerful neurogenic Lee and blue those two clinical studies out of Japan with mild cognitive decline and dementia showing very positive results taking 4 2224 grams of lion's mane per day to mycelium that's interesting. There is much more powerful and we just Contracting with neurological testing laboratory in France and we just got some amazing results back showing that when we had lion's mane extract so the mycelium exposed to neurons and they deposit control was the brain derived nerve growth factor factor and it was s uses a baseline for measuring neurogenic compounds comparatively and the neurogenesis benefits from for a potent stem cells stem cells that then differentiate into neurons and the bdnf clearly shows on standard protocol with a lion's mane it also increase the number of neurons and then we started looking at analogs of psilocybin and the analogs when we out of the lion's mane mycelium with the cells have an analog pressure perfectly legal what is it exactly is psilocybin analog reporting a literature does Bay with system and nervous system are two of the more prominent ones now I'm a psychonaut and 1960 biosystem report of a child died outside of Kelso Washington from eating mushrooms in his yard the family and just add the mushrooms they went to the hospital the child developed eventually adrenal failure and died by the name of lung and then a Benedictine Tyler picked up on this they analyze the mushrooms looking for a new toxin the mushrooms were identified as being so lost to be real sisters it is a mushroom that grows in Washington state and Oregon sometimes in British Columbia but not in Northern California is very rare species but wasn't charged when they analyzed the mushroom looking for a new potential talk soon as they found is Uncle Lloyd said dimethyltryptamine base compound and they named it assistant after sloppy BOCES sobredosis and had the reputation of potentially being a deadly poisonous toxin is present in cubensis is present in many silicide mushrooms in my book sells how much of the world has charts that show him Space Systems anything but no one had consumed because this reputation I obtained some Pure Barre system laboratory legally have no soul Simon in nature provides I don't people make this very clear but I can have dogs and so since there was no reports in the scientific literature or was it was truly toxic or not I with my doctor friend of mine MD that measured my vitals and hook me up you know your blood pressure ECG did all of the Biometrics that are needed and so we did end of one study I decided that even though the history of potentially of a killing this child I think that's a false positive I think it was bad science I can find no one who ever ingested this so I decided I would ingest it now my friend Pam know she's an MD that goes into into an article she's the only doctor on a research vessel and so she goes down there and she gets up in a roommate has me working really hard we had all of our planet Antarctica with the plan this for months and then did we decide will just before I go polish do the the bail System test you know we talked about this for months we finally got the time to do this but the next day we're going to Antarctica soap and looks at her cell phone and Russian research vessel crashed into a reef tour hole in it and it's like it's now the trip is canceled I mean triquetra capitalist money because I can't we can't go this shut the trip from cancel. Super high anxiety I told him I'm at my doctor friend I I I can't go too crazy and then she kind of look at me go on this for months you know please and I listen to her and so I did 10 milligrams my heartbeat blood pressure and then she checked in with me every 10-15 minutes 20 minutes usually have left off one hour or full-blown into it and she talked with me to talk with me and didn't get high Secrets how do you feel and I said I feel great I have no anxiety everything this trip is going to be fine so here we found a analog of psilocybin that does not get you high that's legal that reduce anxiety I think is the tip of the proverbial Iceberg because all the clinical studies are proved right now for Pure psilocybin what about the analogs they activate other receptor sites you know in your field and in neurological field and that's why I think this is why I'm looking at the natural form of these mushrooms standardized to a soul Simon a certain concentration versus the pure molecule I think that is the way of the future because pure psilocybin this up to 6 $7,000 and you can translate that into growing psilocybe mushrooms for $2 a gram now there are people out there listening Saint mother prices coming down and eat it it's just down baby dove to a thousand to $500 a gram but how many people in the urban low lower-income in impoverished population suffering from PTSD who don't can't afford to go to Johns Hopkins to spend tens of thousands of dollars to have a clinical treatment I think this democratizes the the use of psilocybin and microdosing that could be a benefit across our society and then why posing as you stocked with niacin niacin is you take one tenth of a gram of psilocybin cubensis microdose you had a hundred to 200 mg of niacin now if someone tries to get high by taking 10 times as much so I'd like to grams of niacin flushing niacin vitamin B3 and that's such a nice and will give you such an irritable reaction of skin itching of people taking vitamin B3 they know this so becomes the antabuse for microdosing but moreover it excites the nerves at the end of the peripheral nervous system and neuropathy soften his present themselves a deadening of the fingertip the nerves of the fingertips and toes and it's also the Violator of stocking niacin with sauteed mushrooms abuse becomes antabuse it dilates the blood vessels to deliver the energetic benefits of psilocybin to the endpoints of the other peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system and then and also excites the nerve ending so I think those three reasons this could I hope to see in the future silicide mushrooms being over-the-counter vitamins approved by the FDA stock with niacin that allows for the universality of use the benefit of our cultural what we were talking last time is there any other evidence of people taking these analogues and having this anti anxiety affect other than you mean to seem very small sample size rice just one person yes there are antidepressant as far as anxiety and depression are interrelated there are reports James fadiman and his studies 30 component but other clinical studies at Johns Hopkins also the anxiety of dying from cancer is very profoundly stressful situation happening something you prepared for for a long time then all sudden was gone and all this money's gone to go try to figure out how to get it back to its immediate maybe with these other people they didn't have such an immediate anxiety moment and maybe there anxiety will be harder to measure weather is coming or going why isn't anyone study this needs this is just to let people know the other one with the other people that have experienced it but didn't experience any anti-anxiety there's no one else that we know in the scientific literature you'll handguards mentions he I probably saw three addresses within the most potent psilocybe Mushroom in the world darts says and one thing that he was asked and he said that is equal to that of psilocybin I don't have high confidence in a statement I considered a assistant I was ready for liftoff I was hoping for Lift-Off I know but lift off feels like and I didn't get it so so this is this is what happens in science so much is a scientist when you can't do a clinical study we buy our last night this is very common this is how Albert Hoffman you know discovered LSD bioassay to Sony and one for this famous bike ride but then he did it purposely after that but never licensed what are scientific you know Psychonauts must do sometimes come out one that I've mentioned before is a population of several hundred thousand prisoners and there was a 18% reduction in violent crime and 22% or so of production and larceny and theft in a population where they reported they had one psilocybin mushroom experience and statistically significant now Association may not be causation about can be but a more recent study from the British Columbia I find it so fascinating is that they did a large population set and partner to partner violence if your male partner had done one psilocybin trip to statistically significant reduction of the probability of that partner being violent towards their other partner statistically significant so I was not if there's a dating app maybe you should have Simon yes well that may be a better candidate for predating so I think psilocybin makes nicer people and I think we did a lot more nicer people that are more creative there are dedicated to helping the community and I think this is a potential paradigm-shifting a drug unquestionably and this could be profit these companies that are seeking to profit off a pharmaceutical drugs you can profit stop with particular with the protocol that you just described in the adding nice intuitive and show the people of doing only microdosing luqman this could be a very profitable Enterprise for some company and the benefits if if people can mirror the benefits that you had of the alleviation of anxiety my God that's like most of what people struggle with so many people out there listening to this right now like f*** I wish there was something that didn't get me high but just to leave needed this f****** angst that's so people struggling with everyday I'd say that's a massive disease complex has swept our Societies in facing all these problems how could you not become depressed while you cannot become depressed by becoming creative and I think that's also Ivan and microdosing enables the creative Pathways for Ingenuity for us to feel that we had meaning we can make it meaningful difference and it's really important yeah we better than the 6 x26 greatest Extinction event in the history of life in this planet we about to other Extinction events from asteroid impacts 250 million years ago 65 million years ago but we're are now involved in a massive Extinction event and the research that came out today and the other resources come out with 75% of the insect population 40% in an immediate Jeopardy the research article came outside in Europe and North America I don't so we can have a measure of the insect loss in the Amazon but if you're a trout if you're a bird if you like drinking coffee and you like chocolate and almonds these are all depends upon pollinators so we lose these flying insects we lose the pollination services and it threatens worldwide food biosecurity this is one of the biggest threats I think we can invent our ways out of this if we creatively expand our abilities to come up with novel Solutions and I think of solutions are literally underfoot and all around us today we just have to wake up like I woke up to helping the bees out there if they just started realizing that nature is a deep well of evolutionary knowledge and that we have evolved within this complexity then to delve into that library of knowledge and pulling out a political Solutions vetted by science controlled but not looking at these pharmaceutical pure molecules as the way of the future but looking at the pain the complexity of the microbiome they complex interrelationships and selecting out microbiomes that then great Guilds of solutions that are applicable to the problems that we face today. I like that idea all of it it's it's a it's it's beautiful that there are these natural solutions that you know maybe if we could just shift people ideas about how we view psilocybin how we view the analogs how we view the interaction with people in nature that you can you know we can make it a real change make a change that tangible inside of our life time and again selling the stuff like if you were seeing what's happening right now with medical marijuana and then shifting to commercial marijuana and now hemp it's Giant and it's a huge industry through its change Colorado Colorado Denver's real estate gone through the roof people are moving there so much that they've got traffic problems now they never conceived of in the past it's it's changed our economy and it's changed our economy due to just a really obvious shift here's the shift marijuana is not bad for you if not we thought it was it's not we're sorry you can have it now and now you can sell it and now it's legal federally we're still dealing with schedule one so it's it's the chefs are happening these companies are investing money there's a lot of profit to be made in a lot of people are proud but it's still in this weird transitional stage has but this is a people's Revolution we have decriminalized nature coming out of Oakland which I'm fully in favor of how dare we make a species illegal at then there are no sense to me specifically there they've made Ayahuasca psilocybin what else all natural products with psychoactive properties to the best of my understanding of both Denver and Oakland they remove the funding of the for prosecutors and judges in the court so you can't public funds and order to prosecute people for possession so there's a vehicle arrest them for it though while law enforcement officers not getting paid is not doing his job is violating his code of conduct arrest them and you take them to a prosecutor probably goes I've no funding for this. You're wasting our time you're just coming years wasting my time that's a really really good question and I have the thoughts on it that's controversial because this speaks to the ability of some people having access and not if you want I only trip on psilocybin mushrooms once or twice a year that's all I need is Terence McKenna I think I'll watch say when when you when you get the message from the phone hang it up so if you just have these your backyard or you know how to collect them then do you only need one or two doses a year and even microdosing you don't you could get a lot more extension of that but my my view and I never had any problem with law enforcement in Washington Oregon to British Columbia Canada particular law enforcement has a very pretty mature attitude towards us if you have a small amount and you're not trafficking and your for individual use it just doesn't raise the level of the need for enforcement I understand that but I just wish there was no incentive at all there was nothing there but just the idea that you have to rely on the good grace of a cop understands there's no incentive to arrest you that seems like horseshit to me like we're grown adults in 2019 with a mountain of evidence this is not we're not living the Dark Ages anymore the fact that it's still a possibility to get arrested or you get you could face some sort of criminal charges for having something that's only been to be good this is why is a Citizens movement the federal government I made the Republicans and conservatives and Libertarians are all about state rights they said people's movement they should get behind this because individual Community rights against the big man against the federal government the federal government is because we we have a country spreading throughout the entire cities in the next 16 months they're going to have decriminalization at the city council's I also think it's significant solution to this problem that we're facing with pills and a lot of destructive drugs there's a lot of self-destructive drugs that people take him because he's people hurting what would psilocybin gives you that these drugs don't it gives you a potential to heal it gives you a moment to reflect that gives you a change in the way you think and you interface with the word and that just doesn't exist in those other those drugs are Escape drugs and The Need to Escape is what we got to eliminate and I think that's one of the things to psilocybin can help it can help alleviate the Need to Escape and a shout-out to Rick doblin and Atlanta a gillooly of maps maps. Org and multi Association for psychedelic studies and bringing forward psychedelic drugs for PTSD and clinical studies maps is now on face 3 with MDMA they want to help people and several of them have said they've never seen it was so stop in particular a safer drug with such a dramatic impact was so it's in frequency of use one or two times and so the movie that just came out called fantastic fungi and and Michael pollan's in there I'm in their Source Berg as put it out he spent 12 years were working on this movie is fantastic comments a Grassroots movement theaters are selling out all over the country they booked at New York City for one night they have to keep it in for a week because they're standing lines as Standing Room in a long line to get into the theater and it's all about the use of mushrooms and the Johns Hopkins studies with end-of-life patients it's very very well done but it speaks to this is this is literally underground movement of swelling up and the and the the attraction that people have for this is a reflection of the title change that is happening now this is a worldwide movement that is sweeping through the mycelial Underground through connection so something I very much encourage you to to see fantastic fun</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> mushroom is figuring they'd be very prominently important for saving bees and that's where our research has been astonishingly interesting lately I where is that thing that you have brought in with his that this is this is some contacts to this important because of morality of multiplicity of benefits only revolutionize Warfare not only left for the portability of fire for us to save ourselves in the coldness and then we might go to the Europe from Africa and I'll need to be caves use it for smoking but fly fishermen use an Ulta or drawing flies but we have found at this much time is extremely powerful for reducing viruses that harm bees and we are it's been described today and CNN Abby insect apocalypse 40% of Abby of insects this just came out and this is all hands on deck moment but I'm optimistic visit I think we can find solutions in nature so with my colleagues and then I was here before I talk to my work with a bow Shield while defense program and these would conchs are very strong and anti-viral properties against flu viruses and herpes excetera I use these ideas and I had a waking dream and I real the bees were being infected by mites with viruses and the deformed Wing virus in particular has the worst virus and so I contacted Western State University start doing some research and I'm really really happy because I love Skeptics who become my supporters we published in nature only 7% of the article said that the nature get published the nature publication ecosystem to this day or articles in top 1% of all articles ever published in publication ecosystem now that's phenomenal because that's the most credible scientific journal in the world it is right that extracts of polypore mushroom mycelium reduce viruses and honeybees and the this mushroom the Amadou reduce the deformed Wing virus 800 x the one with one treatment in and then the reishi mushroom mycelium reduces the lake Sinai virus more than 45,000 to one Cedarwood concert growing trees and we all grew up with Winnie the Pooh but no one made the connection before me apparently that bees are attracted to rotted wood because of the mythological benefit so Amadou and reishi mushrooms we found it we published in this article that high significance and I think the reason why this article is not top 1% of all nature articles is that I've been able to present the theory and with proof now that are natural product can I have a broader bioshield a benefits than a pure pharmaceutical up to this time there's been no agents to reduce viruses and bees now the deformed Wing virus is named after by the varroa Mite came in 1984 and then Jack viruses in the B's and so it's all good dirty syringe and these viruses debilitate the bees and shorten their with their ability to fly not look at that poor Bumblebee turn it up to a thousand flowers a day and the average flight time of like honeybees was used to be 9 days a thousand flowers a day every almond you eat was visited by a bee so 1 be confounded a thousand flowers a day 9 days was our pollination flight time now it's been resorting to four days so we lost by 50% and if CNN article that I did we just showed in China now their hand pollinating flowers with paint brushes no apples cherries almond strawberry in the absence of its really this is you know I'm really optimistic about the future because we have solutions in nature that we can now amplify and be able to deploy and so one of my inventions and I'm giving these away the 10,000 of these for free I've come up with a citizen scientist Beefeater she's extracts into sugar water and if we have a sign-up sheet is for free so funjet.com bees give away the first 10,000 of these and just basically allows citizen scientist to help wild bees because while we were in about 80% of the benefits if you go all the way down and then click on the and we just so here is a Beefeater missing you bail bond YouTube folks and says be mushroomed feeder be mushroomed all one word and then feed her time to do this and so these are something we going to make these available all over and I don't want to create vertical Gardens and and apartment buildings to get beeswax I have 200 feet you create ladders than Echo logical ladders and then this is why the citizen scientist all of the world can take action to be able to help bees from collapsing and then eustachian these in neighborhoods for bumblebees for other types of bees and that we have it with a wifi-enabled device with solar panels and then we upload into the cloud all this data about bee pollination visits sewing on the Baseline of bee pollination services so if you see a bees that are declining in suddenly below at Baseline and Oklahoma 2 years ago 84% of the beehives. I think if you're a cattle rancher exhaust 84% of cattle so the idea is immune system and the week rate baselines was beefeaters upload the data and just becomes a new form of Internet because they have Wi-Fi ability so sister did not work as well but they where is the Wi-Fi on computer company making all the instrumentation and there in that big data so we have a solar panel going in here we have a blue LED lights that bees are attracted to Blue Light and they will count the number B is going in and out it's going to be find a daytime we don't need a battery and so will the solar power will then upload the data into the cloud Millcreek Mega data sets and then we can look in Africa Indonesia uploading to the cloud was it using the LT LTE they can teach their children the importance of natural systems and they can take action seems like a great one I mean I love this idea afford to give away 10,000 itok to this computer company that everybody knows but it asked me not to use her name and they ask how many do we need I said 10 billion billion billion and crate networks of hubs where I have not $0.40 on this and helping bees survive from these extracts but not in Indonesia not an Indian. An African on in China not in Japan open source for most of the world I'm basically commercial I'm going to commercialize it so the Haves and the Have Nots and a lot of people want to help in a few different ways of doing this 10 other people they have a distributed Network their own social media Community where they end up we getting schools we won't open source the code for 3D printers so that's really important for school so what the codes on the open-source but it then if somebody want to make millions of these and sell them of course you know I wouldn't be happy without they have to work with me but individually we can Empower individuals with in schools to have they open source 3D printing codes just have to make it trendy movies in your house like lithium helping helping the bees if we just did that it would really make a big difference gross way to look at it but but my grantworks my grandson is a perfect example he was shuttering and fear of being coming near to this and my friend dr. Steve Sheppard entomologist taught me something about bees I didn't know these are moving so fast and we look like we're moving slow but if we move really slow think you're a statue and so the idea of ends of my grandson and I said look at this and you can see underneath that you can see the bees going in and out I said the move really slow and then I got fascinated watching the bees see you overcame is fear of bees he was excited that he's helping me survive now we've created something intergenerational e and saving the bees as a number wouldn't onebridge concept between conservatives and liberals everyone wants to save the bees that's number one and number one Bridge issue when I'm mending the fence speak crossword the political and social divide everybody wants to say the Beast solution and you know the scientific data out there is pretty disturbing you know 75% of flying insects and the past 27 years and report from Germany that just came out have disappeared now many of your listeners are out in the country in the country and number of the bug splatter used to have against your windshield you don't see that anymore the insects are dying because exposure to pesticides monoculture we have monoculture you have what's called pollination deserts when your loss of biodiversity lots of plants and and diversity the plants are pollinating at different times of the season when you do to a monoculture all the plants like almonds produce flowers all at once and then there was no pollen available so the immune system loss of habitat deforestation like phosphatase you know heavy metals pollution all those things are co-factors but the nail in the coffin is by far these viruses and so even logically empowering the support of the immune system of these then give zarbee's the opportunity of the ability to be able to survive longer do more pollination is there a specific source does a throughout the world that came from Asia and it's now a global pandemic all bees in the world around factor with these viruses because when they infected honey bee front sensor visit the flower Italy is viral particles in the flower and the flower and then a wild bumblebee comes I visit it becomes infected so there is a unfortunate work perfect co-factors and because Farmers receive is from wild beast Bryant we can't count them in your beehives and and the what happened to calling to collapse you got on Monday that bees are happy goat on Thursday they're all gone I miss that quick is not like this hundreds of dead bees around your beehive they're just gone they could be hundreds of pounds of honey and the bees gone so they go off somewhere these are called nurse beats and the nurse bees take care of the baby bees but when the colony census of none of pollen in food to support The Brood and the colony the nurse bees are prematurely recruited to go out and find pollen so they abandon the babies and then the varroa mites are on Vegas go on an uncontrolled and they start injecting viruses and so there are co-factors bacterial infections in summer there's a Cascade of opportunistic infections as a mean Immunology is decreased because these viruses so isn't there a contributing factor that had to do with cell phones as well I actually I'm really glad you brought that up this is a contributing factor I have not seen convincing evidence as a hypothesis that's not fully fleshed-out there's some people quite adamant and their belief in this but I'm driving by science and I can the The rhythms of the frequency of the height of cell phones is an argument this made it is not in the same cosine wave of the wavelengths that we experience in nature and so this is disruptive I understand that I'm still on the fence I like to see really strong data and scientific evidence of that but it's a hypothesis and needs to be tested that's what we're looking also at long range communication systems you know I think I told you this story if I didn't apologize but when we were on Fear Factor we had a beast on way to cover these people and bees and a local bee Colony flew in to check out what was going on and those bees and the bees that were brought their met in the sky and worked it out and The Beekeeper told us okay we have to shut down and everybody's got to back out of here so we had a shot everything in back out for like about an hour at least a half-hour but he's bees communicated with each other so they're flying a giant swarm of them flying the eye in the in the are trying to figure out why they would you guys here for what are you doing while you're in our neighborhood like moving in or just film the TV show at the end of work it out that is so unusual was really weird extraordinary I just don't understand how they worked it out there was no fight to the death there's no nothing they just sort of worked it out the other bees took off and the bees that were there came back to their hi there little colony treatment colonies and we are treated colonies well because 10 to 20% of the bees in the treated colonies went to the control colonies we actually diluted the differential because we had cross movement of control bees and beehives vs. treated bees and so when we actually I think another some of my local office thinks we actually have understated the datum but when you look at the p-value significance lesson .00 9.4 scientist has next ordinarily significant data set that is clearly showing the evidence that these extracts help the community of bees and help them be able to survive in and do a better job that's awesome and so crazy that it's just natural mushroom but it makes sense what you're saying that they built their beehives in these rotting trees knowing that these fungi were there I somehow or another being attracted to it the first five seconds. I got the first patent award my ego did swell and then 10 seconds later I said are you freaking kidding I we're Neanderthals have nuclear weapons how could I be the first one to discover that bees benefit from mycelium immunologically but there was no horse called prior art shows no evidence and I mean think of that we have the intelligence of nature underneath her feet and this is something we need to tap into and the fact that we can show an arthropod you know if you had HPV HIV and you went to a doctor 12 days after having one treatment of these extracts and your viruses drop 45001 NE physician would say wow you're doing really well and this would be able to see them now we've been trying to find the mode of action how are these viruses actually being reduced or providing essential nutrients that are important for the immune system to activate Gene sequences art that attack the viruses and give more host defense of immunity of protection of further infection translational medicine so but bees is an animal clinical study Visa been stated as being besides the second most well started animal in the world this is a animal clinical study past digestion password on p450 pathway which is your detoxification Pathways in our liver all animals uses out of animal clinical study and I think it's a Gateway for us to take this as credible evidence that natural products could be more useful and offer a broader bioshield of benefits than pure Pharmaceuticals that go after one molecule that one set of receptors are foods are this is we weren't concept by electronic communication with an ecosystem with weave evolve in this complex and so our immune systems are regulated through multiple stimuli and that's why I think these extracts because of their complexity they build upon the complexity of natural systems and help her immune system so you have hope that this is something that we could eventually see it being like a a peer-reviewed proven thing for human beings as well absolutely I do believe that's on the new event horizon there's a lot of researchers Downs see more more there's lots of clinical studies for Physicians is not know Brandon knows how many of anything that's a popular website called mushroom references. Com populates specifically for physician positions are just spoken Singularity University of Stanford Medical School in front of a thousand Physicians I try to make the bridge of The credibility of the science for Physicians who are just not educated yet cuz I don't have the resources or the time so, you can go that website it's got hundreds of references that then you can put in any symptom or species excetera and you'll be able to find a peer-reviewed references there's about 30 references princess on psilocybin right now which is an area of research that I'm particularly focused on</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> people I've talked to you exactly what you're talk to your your mentioning and they did do a heroic Journey you know for clinical studies Etc a lot of us don't need that but I really enjoy being on the ocean Bluff or high point and vibing in the mushrooms about half an hour before Sunset being with a loved one also could have an experienced person who's not tripping who is up the Watcher sitter a sitter the sitter is there thinking meditation practice in place folks give these people some Spa we just watching and then the people who are imbibing understand they have a watcher they have somebody who's anchored who can help them and then to have this the sun go down in and the stars come out in the colors and then miss Oceanic expansive experience is just as nothing short of spiritual that have a tendency towards schizophrenia and these people have sometimes they have psychedelic breaks but don't have psychedelic experiences and then they don't do well they go off, because I brought that up and that is a d selection of from the from the clinical studies of candidacy want to engage but my good friend Mark Hayden who runs Maps Canada had a very interesting story with a schizophrenic every position I know is on the same page as you including medic medical marijuana edible edible marijuana it seems to have a significant effect on people with a person who is a severe schizophrenic was that he still heard voices in his head but the voice is not were friendly they were affirming they weren't letting you know I'll go that'll somebody like you know you are a good person and so he still supportive play bringing on the schizophrenic experiences that did that there has been some evidence particularly about marijuana that high doses of marijuana for people that have Tendencies and if we don't know right what would causes someone to have schizophrenic break cuz they're there is a difference between pre and post right people of had deteriorating mental health that's that correlates with schizophrenia what would it would it cause them to be less schizophrenic or not exhibiting any the problems and then all the sudden having severe problems post psychedelic trip or post large dose edible marijuana and or even large do smoking it with some people that dab and then you smoke wax and then it's it happens to people that smoke too much pot there's certain people that have that tendency I would defer to clinicians who are extremely skilled in this area and many many patients I'm not a doctor but I concur with you I think that is real concern the difference between a Thompson in a drug can oftentimes be dose and at lower doses you can see things at the higher doses you you don't write so is that entire spectrum and is so complex and individuality so people are so you uniquely different I have a friend who's a doctor if he smokes a joint you can go to sleep I smoked a joint and I'm up at night I just I use it for going to sleep I'm the opposite I start writing I want to read I want to watch documentaries isn't it they do have a significant difference between the way your body responds sativas vs. indicas I would like to be educating this subject I've used both for a very long time I love Afghani Indica you have a beard I would. I love the smell how do you standardize them to the active constituent standardized the mall or a symphony of this speaks to the complexity of nature but I have a phrase and I like it don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good just because you can't understand it doesn't mean it necessarily does not have a valid outcome or you know can't be used and I think that what we need to do is correct large datasets and that's why I'm hoping microdose not me is going to give us an enormous amount of data than that clinicians can Harvest from and going we didn't anticipate This and like these metal studies about partner party when if your partner men had tripped on mushrooms they were less prone to Violent that was signal from the noise how many other signals from the noise of the big big metal files that we can we can pull out then we can get serious scientists really carefully controlled clinical studies to be able to see this and then and then how do you combine them and it's a whole new landscape that gets away from single landscape that gets away from single molecules and into the complexity of nature that we can build upon navigating to that place is going to be a challenge there's no doubt about it but I think we're smart enough now we have enough computer Technologies and diagnostic tools that we should begin on that Voyage today</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so well you know there is good evidence that lion's mane also compensation many of these of neurogenic benefits that's so sad all the time is like a lion's mane Elixir today important tell me if it's any good well it comes from China and is that bad and I will put that in smoothies all the time and that's my go-to and that's what exactly the research I put in coffee and coffee and Jamie can you pull up that benefits of lion's mane how much should I put in an open open yet France that we did the neurogenic test with found out that my sole income is far more active than mushrooms with bodies and so the lion's mane stimulates neurite outgrowth and basically extends the nerves from from growing a compare the Baseline 22% growth at 12% and then separately we stocked it with an analog of psilocybin and rather than think of being the Earth metal Earth metal additive of cumulative we found a Synergy so we think that lion's mane their resources increases myelin regeneration on the sheath of the nerves and it's also operates nerve to help you learn this is example showing at 14 basic 14.8% over Baseline then we have an analog that didn't do all that great 18 + 107 122. 136 statistically significant the outlier actually is even higher so the neuroscientist in France who did this study was extremely excited and we found it and the more we titrated it to Greater dilution the more active it becomes was that mean well and what we found was originally we were told us that it's called 3 micrograms per milligram or 3 micrograms a millionth of a ground but we went back to 2.03 100 times less the neurogenic benefits became greater now there's something called a p k conversion something only a small portion of your bloodstream but the good news is is that these things are so non-toxic and they're so potent now looking at the dosing regimen it appears so far we've done is clinically this is human cells in vitro but this laboratory is predictive of neurogenic compounds that these Punk the neurogenic benefits are so substantial that the pka conversion of ingesting them could be seen in the bloodstream as a fairly good Persian right so you princess you take vanillic acid vanilla about 2% will make it into your bloodstream so if you pick up one more gram of vanilla only 2% actually get to gets in your blood stream so that that's a p k conversion so what we're seeing is right now and save this is so strong lower lower dilutions we're getting more and more potency so I'm this is a test. It's like it's a delusion the possibility the more than we dilute the more potent it becomes so this was a neuroscientist in the France are going to study playing this stuff is so potent please deluded deluded deluded the so-and-so where that illegal it's an edible and choice mushroom thousand year history of use that we found is mycelium as far more potent than the mushrooms for really good reasons consulate compounds are Caldera Nations and these are actually discovered by kawaki shooting 1994 looking for an antibacterial agent and so when they when he was looking at the mycelium fighting bacteria he found that the mycelium Express this antibacterial society and derivative and he gave her the name Aaron a scene after hericium erinaceous just like penicillin and then another penicillium and so he'd stumbled on the fact is neurogenic properties and antibacterial properties through the ground to a hostile environment is only one cell wall thick the mycelium has an immune system is operational between 40 degrees Fahrenheit in 95 degrees Fahrenheit is 35° Celsius that's the window is growing in so it's immune system inoperative in that window when you do super hot water extracts you're in the extreme Zone that's not part of the logical lifespan mushroom decocting it you're taking out ingredients but you're not harnessing within the me logical window of temperatures that the mycelium has evolved to fight off pathogens and tell what we have now and is the mycelium is far more active in the fruit bodies this all do science but then mushroom reference.com dozens upon dozens of 25 more 25% more genes coding for proteins are special the mycelial state then it's a mushroom Stateline make sense because at the end of millions of cell divisions of months years even decades finally produced a mushroom that rocks in five days the mushroom doesn't need a good immune system is attracting Michael Voris animals Dear John just showed me some photographs of these going to show you he was in a campground and found deer in the morning picking up mushrooms out of the ground mole animals engage on prove your your colleagues here or has Jeff I'm sorry Jeff when we go to work in sex people animals because they're fragrant there protein are there nutritionally dense and they want to engage human the mycelium is navigating through a microbial a hostile environment and Report came out the literature holder 1000 species of bacteria in a single gram is more than 8 miles of a cubic inch is navigating through a hostile environment and setting up guildsomm microbiomes and collections of cooperating bacteria that can help them defend against pathogens look at that it up to eight miles of mycelium in a single inch of soil and it's only one cell wall that that's such a weird looking image so it's so hard to see what that is that's a mushroom that's melted back in ground psyllium that's just not the mushrooms generate mycelium and it goes underneath the ground every time you're walking on the ground you're walking up on miles upon miles of mycelium and it knows that you're there if these are sensitive these are not like externalize stomachs that are digested nutrients and external eyes lungs exhaling carbon dioxide inhaling oxygen but I believe these are extant neurological networks of nature when you say that pervasiveness of those towels and the climate change scientists are coming around to the 70% of the carbon biologically stored in mycelium in the ground the way to fight climate change Denali replanting trees which is great I love it but it's the mycelial network server building in the hummus that creates the soil decreased biodiversity that thing guarantees the health of the ecosystem does the mycelial network sign govern cuz they're so pervasive they set up because their antibacterial Properties or Pro bacterial properties another example of this is in the microbiome of soils and inside of humans stomachs turkey tail mushrooms and they placebo-controlled random a randomized clinical study with humans is a Prebiotic the microbiome that feeds of bifidobacterium lactis bacillus bactrim so it's really really interesting that the mycelium is feeding nutrients to the beneficial bacteria within the microbiome that then gives us health and so these are precursor nutrients that elevate the populations of beneficial bacteria so the two go hand-in-hand but what about edible mushrooms things like shiitake and those type of mushrooms is there any nutritional benefits of those things also metal studies that came out this year showing that the ingestion of of mushrooms with elderly people over the age of 60 there is a 50% decrease odds of Alzheimer's like symptoms with a population of people consuming free mushroom meals per week. They didn't specify the poor but the mushrooms are eating are oyster mushrooms hokkien shemeji I'm a maybe some other mushrooms but that's once medicine is it came out there was a study out of Japan from dr. Okawa the national cancer centre they found statistically significant reduction in cancers across-the-board like a hundred and sixty-two thousand people in the state and he was sent over the Nagano prefecture to look for the edible and delicious mushrooms also the empower the immune system against signal from the noise all cancer rates associated with a food the division now between you know foods and medicines is blurred and yet it speaks to Hippocrates in a dinosaur IDs standing that let food be thy medicine medicine to be like food so it's interesting because Physicians have been taught you noticed a monomolecular approached her medicine and now we're realizing that these foods are essential nutrients for the immune system that. it's so interesting that we're learning all this during our lifetime to do you think that they would all be established by now inflammatory response blood rushes to the wound you inflame you have all these these compounds that are being produced by the blood do to suppress an infection but you can over amp the immune system and having a plant a pro flammatory response that can cause lower oxidative stress damage and laterally and so the article that that's just come out with BMC biomed Central we have found that the mice only one across on rice and biopharmx the rice to then produce a unicameral logical response that upregulates was called interleukin-1 are a interleukin-10 these are anti-inflammatory cytokines and so the mycelium doesn't do that the mushrooms didn't do that but the mycelium is bio fermented the rice like 10 pages is transformed or like yogurt from milk because of lactobacillus acidophilus and that transformation then it makes it novel product we found the same thing that they the rice compared to Rice control has no anti-inflammatory properties the mycelium because of the extracellular metabolites changes the rice into a unique logical product that excites the expression of anti-inflammatory compounds while also exciting the immune response so properties the mycelium because of extracellular metabolites changes the rice into a unique gemological product that excites the expression of anti-inflammatory compounds while also exciting the pro immune response so it's a buffered response</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when people pick mushrooms and they go out and pick mushrooms the real issue seems to be that there's some mushrooms that are edible that look very close to mushrooms vs. similar to mushrooms that are very poisonous true to the uninitiated and the people who have not learned but once you learn to shantrell you will not miss take it nothing looks like a lion's mane mushroom mushroom is hard to mistake it so there are some look-alikes and with Amanita phalloides bring Angel and with a Paddy straw mushroom which is commonly cultivated collector in Asia many of the mushroom deaths in North America have come from this place but people's but people who come from Asia and because they're secretive in the language barrier in a culture of being wild collector's they then mistake the destroying Angel for iPad he's promising that's a real common mistake there other people who said they will just looked at Apple that's a really dangerous thing to say you have to know species individually and there's a lot of controversy as far as but while he was alive he said that it seems that it's genetically variable seasonally variable print perhaps even environmentally variable all those things are partially true times has a red mushroom with white dots wedding and I trip with my friend on on empty mascara on and and I looked at him and he was foaming at the mouth and I had all these bubbles coming out of his mouth what you look like Calamity Panther Arena arena is a kick-ass mushroom it has five times or more than also remove Somali volcanic acid almost no mas Grande so that the salivation effect of ending muscaria so I have had a very good friend and we are not friends anymore unfortunately but I was in charge of the herbarium at The Evergreen State College and I freeze dried Amanita pantherina they're called cops are brown in color and they have dots very good the panther cop perfectly legal mushroom an extraordinary powerful so I was up living up in Darrington Washington I just cabin I was a logger hippie for a few years and also my friend Dave came up and I had these fries fried mushrooms lighter than me so I thought well my should have two-thirds the omelet right cuz he's lighter than me and so we ate the mushrooms Run 10 and we're living in this cabin but across the creek was a scar Squire Creek Campground and it was the Winnebago people right back then in the 70s I hitchhike across country 13 x Winnebago never pick me up so they're always the enemy stop for entertainment let's go look at the Winnebago people so we was so close I don't know why we drove marcar but we drove the car out of my cabin we went down like a half a mile turn left into the Squire Creek Campground and we park the car and we wanted to go up to a beautiful view spot and so we walked through the Winnebago people and their families and everything else in and we got up onto a ridge and I mean but that we're waiting I was an hour no effect of dance a while maybe these aren't that potent and then right after we said that I looked at Dave and I said that stronger and stronger and stronger oh my God this is getting intense with our get the heck out of here you'll go home where it's safe cuz it's coming on so strong so we come down off this little this little toe and we had to come down to the Winnebago people and then my God and here were walking nothing about that. slow motion every step you're taking you know you feel like this Johnny be moving really slow and and then I came to winnebago's have no end there were hundreds of feet long is my lock the car that's all I had Mikey I look at Mikey and I look at the Lock I want missed pull the key back missed but they've goes you okay I'm fine because you want me to drive when I go no way dude there's no way I want you to drive over and over again and I get into the car I caught my camera and I'm in the car and I'm trying to get my key in that God I didn't get my key and I was not safe to drive and then Dave is going like oh my God or so freaking high right now I go outside with my camera camera text Mike Campbell did this over and over and over again repetitive motion syndrome kicked in and it's a very common symptom of amateur pantherina I dropped my car and dozens and dozens Sublime how did look at the end well it was shattered but you should look up and a whole bunch of people from the Winnebago family community had lined up holding their children in close proximity watching this repetitive motion well I'm just constantly picking my camera so they're watching you for entertainment where you went to watch them for a repetitive motion syndrome and I take one step dropped my camera my day if I brought my camera and I pick up my camera gun Naviance the Vikings were surrounded and outnumbered and there were going to be killed the next day and they ate a whole bunch of endodermis carry-on and a big big soup and Legend has it and it's not been confirmed but this is the legend this word commonly reiterated is that they drank a whole bunch ended muscaria soup and then they went and the next day even though they're massively out number to take off all their clothes in the attack the enemy naked the swords and that's where the word Berserk came from the Berserkers so I'm having this Berserker experience a repetitive motion syndrome and unblock my camera over and over and over again and I looked up and leave parents were holding their children or totally freaking out and I left the doors open in the car and I'm dropping my camera picking it up if my cabin and there's a combination lock on though I don't need a combination lock right now I can barely you know. I'm spending lock back and forth through my phone and then eventually the lock to spontaneously open and I know I fell on the ground I started convulsing and the cool thing about convulsing was it felt good every time I convulsed good this is the weird thing about it I needed to convulse because everytime I convulse I kind of got to reset my neurology and Baseline and then I would have been out of control and then I had this Cascade of prepositional phrase and just before I came to the object of my thought that was einsteinian inside-out have attention and then I will come to the course at the end of that sentence and then I have another 10 I saw death is a as a Perpetual series of Alternatives that never gave me the satisfaction of a conclusive fought and I was just last 12 hours so you recommend Soma for reason is the Soma mushroom it is somniferous that causes some debate as to what's on actually is this guy had to eating a whole bunch of scary on big biker dude and a covered with blood and he's up on a bridge and he was swinging his legs back and forth is above the rocks and I threw himself off the bridge that was only about six or eight feet but it's enough on the boulders down below smash himself on the rocks and then you climb back up on the bridge and he swung his feet from self off the bridge syndrome camera exiled on TV and then they saw a knife its causes temporary insanity causes temporary insanity are wonderful they're peaceful they're loving his empathic oh right by the Amanita mushrooms cause this strange strange sort of behavior that is really potentially dangerous</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> listen to the bring this up but it's growing on something else and that that seems to be part of nature write the sort of symbiotic relationship that some of these mushrooms have with a plan to me that the environment around them that's a really really good point because the mycelium will be found with Abby's when we grew the mycelium on Rice compared to on Birchwood there viruses 10 + 210 the mycelium will Groudon Burch reduce the viruses up to 1001 so that's a natural environment that speaks the fact that there appears to be something that's coding within the ecosystem that excites the mycelium to produce something that is more strongly result in an antiviral activity that's the case with cordyceps as well right cordyceps mushrooms grow on other things this is something that was a big subject of debate because because of cordyceps sinensis is a it's it's it's a mushroom that grows on a worm basically animorph this not that complicated is just two faces of the same coin there's a mushroom fruit body and then there is in perfect form that is a different looking organism but they're actually the same they did have two different Expressions when they all the scientific literature kept on coming over the different Animorphs and when they analyze the the mushrooms not until recently discovered that another fun a group of fungi are chasing the cordyceps sinensis has the fruit body develops other fungi are chasing right behind the other fungus so we have multiple fungi that are actually present in the cordyceps warm is not just one species is multiple species that are are co-occurring chasing each other in the inside the quarter mushroom as fruits so again it just speaks to the complexity of nature so what where should you get your cordyceps Orson for for health benefits of all mixed up now what is what true animal for these scientists using no there's other other ones that hurt her so tell us synopsis of now thought to be the true anamorphic cordyceps sinensis lingo means is there's a mushroom with a whole bunch of other fun jobs are associated with it and when they called her these other funds are they did clinical studies military does not have these issues and so I was your people to cordyceps militaris right now because of course substances that I'll feel course of stenosis issues are still complicated and now adversely thousands of research articles are on all now suspect because no one has a foggiest idea what animorph they were using so how many people are actually working on this data to thousands of researchers and I'm thankful that the Chinese Mycologist sort of ever the ones who finally sorted this out it was a lot of conflict academically there's a lot of big Egos and Academia to their own research and we're all like that and and the challenges went back and forth and fortunately a group of Chinese scientists finally were able to narrow down the argument to understand that everyone was actually doing good culture work they were actually expert Mycologist the right tissue taking it from the right cordyceps mushroom it's just that at that time that a different fungus that was not actually part of the inside of the mushroom that was a mixture of fungi that were racing at different Paces at the mushroom to use it for a performance benefit in the Olympics one of the reasons why on it we developed shroom Tech sport is cordyceps mushrooms peppermint which I love cordyceps for workouts for pre-workout is like wake gives you an extra gear it's really kind of crazy how effective it is especially in combination with B12 and other adaptogens it just has it's a great pre-workout supplement because it doesn't get you jittery at all it's not a stimulant but you have like a little more juice when you exercise and that's one of the things that those high altitude hurting population profound right I like benefits as well so the other the quarter stuff for for athletes has been tried and true and many of these are Animorphs and I mentioned have those properties do for athletes like what dose would you recommend like what you know I was just make sure it's my mycelial base and it's not fruit body-based that they clear evidence is showing the one find out whether something is mycelium mushroom mycelium on on Oliver labels so it and if you were going to take that like if you wanted to take shroom Tech sport if you wanted to make your own concoction you would recommend to grams and then and make sure you had no the chain of custody of where it came from cuz a lot of these companies buying a spot Market you gave me post offense first offense is this yours is your company will support you host events and there's there a website where someone can grab those out as well Muscat ratio as a gerakan just got out of a birch polypore called that the force between us and someone has my talking in it and these are the seven pieces behind but the the evidence for Physicians and people who want to look up peer-reviewed articles the single species have the most elaborated and convincing evidence when you start compounding these so what we're doing we have five or six full-time researcher several PhD in our staff we are again trying to disambiguous are they complexity of all these benefits by looking at once pieces out of time so we're doing this to methodically spending hundreds of thousands of dollars literally a year now I have a hundred and ten employees and I credit my company in order to do research I have no Partners so I can now dedicate the resources to be able to do novel read in order to do research I have no Partners so I can know dedicate the resources to be able to do novel research and we love going up against conventional wisdom because you have to challenge conventional wisdom to see if it's indeed meets the monster</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> crazy Rich respect imagining were we let's do a little ranking thing here we have three vices and I know exactly what you're going to be going with us but we have three things we want to prioritize dope alcohol okay what you say goes ranked week so right now with the way we have dealt with these is smoking is becoming the most taboo of those three cigarettes and alcohol is the one that we have to at least Innovations about right that it should be alcohol should be the most taboo marijuana should be actually not exactly backwards it should be alcohol the most taboo cigarettes the second most marijuana the third that's how I would completely upside down for some people like there's a terrible things are happening when you smoke cigarettes but every time cigarette or two before shows like I smoked or two I've never smoked two in a row but I smoked a cigarette before I've done shows like Dave Chappelle getting one of his cigarettes recently Tony Hinchcliffe give me a cigarette I'm not a cigarette smoker but there's something cool about the headrush that you get when you smoke a cigarette I hesitate to say that this is a person who's done a lot of drugs I've done a lot of smoke a lot of pot and I've done psychedelics and talk about them openly I have hesitation stop telling people that I've enjoyed a cigarette because because it's so they think it's so bad for you it's it's it's I think when I talk about doing mushrooms I think mushrooms are good for you I think it makes you freaked out I think it it illuminates parts of your Consciousness that I think a lot of people guard and protect and shield and I think sometimes doing something that breaks down those walls is good for you ultimately over all this little bit of an inch . but I think you learn something about the normal State of Consciousness I don't think you learned much when you smoke cigarettes I just think there's just a little bit of a Head Rush that you get out of it but I know so many people that are sick from cigarettes only people that can't quit them so many people have died from cancer mean I personally have known several people that have died from cancer from smoking cigarettes so I hesitate and saying it but I don't want to be dishonest I've had them I don't smoke cigarettes bought a pack of dutches cigar smoke cigars I like them sometimes I just think it's a terrible it's a terrible thing to get hooked on and I would say the same thing with alcohol I know people that have had real problems with alcohol that have been alcoholics and they have to go to meetings and you know there are 12 step programs and you know I would never offer them a drink but if you said hey let's do a shot right now let's celebrate with it is a wonderful have a glass of whiskey I can have a glass of whiskey and not drink again it doesn't bother me. I don't have that whatever that is some people do I hesitate hesitate and glorifying that two and four young people scared the s*** out of me if I see that probably drank for the first time when I was probably like I was in high school I think it's probably 14 or 15 first time I ever got drunk with my friend so you know we had a hold of some Jack Daniels something and maybe throw up Ronaldo drinking age friends you know listening to Classic Rock and getting drunk and Boston butt the it's it's something I occasionally enjoy enjoy alcohol I like having a drink of wine with a glass of wine with a meal I like having a drink with friends occasionally but I don't have a problem with it and I know people do and so I I feel weird talking about it knowing those people that do have a problem hot though the people that have a problem with pot it's rare and it's usually people that have some sort of a nun and I do believe they're there is an issue with people having some sort of an underlying schizophrenic issue that could come from especially high doses if they smoke a lot of pot in one night they can have a schizophrenic episode I've actually seen it particular from Edibles of seeing it but that's to me that's solutely the least happy when I think there's a lot of benefits to pot in pot makes you more sociable I think it makes you friendlier maybe some people get paranoid from it but I think that's what that really is is the marijuana is Illuminating how vulnerable you actually are and that we protect ourselves from this overwhelming existential angst that you get when you get high on pot and people say and we just somehow another make it to look how old you 5652 we made it I made it home safe somehow or another despite all the parent paying attention not looking at their phone and now it's like it's very Skies flying over the skies were very vulnerable all the time just diseases and not to mention you know number one people who make alcohol help get a free ride it's incredible to me. Like if I said to you that I was on the board of Philip Morris you would say that's pretty screwed up where is there snow in terms of the amount of social damage what alcahueta Anheuser-Busch has created has produced a hundred times the social damage than what Lamar's is produced tapped noticed except alcohol advertising and sponsorship but you go to a college football game and you know Bud Light will have will be an active sponsor of the event will have some huge relationship with the school this is crazy it's crazy this is causing so many problems love it because it's socially acceptable to worry about repercussion cuz we would never have Marlboro Marlboro a good example of how messy we are whether they would never have Marlboro Marlboro where is a very good example of how messy we are</div>

Order on the territory that community so there is also a Eastern was in Eastern and Eastern is a place where a by contrast is a story where there are straight was four types Eastern is where there is a Law &amp; Order institution to justice but they are I have been subverted by people from within so in Easton would be the Serpico is in eastern it's a crooked cop who is it the Bad Apple who has a no screwed up The Hollywood movies are the Northern is the case where Law &amp; Order exists and Law &amp; Order is morally righteous system works good show Law &amp; Order is a northern it's a functioning apparatus of Justice which reliably and actually produces the retina correct result in confronting criminality every single day when it's on TV the southern is where the the entire we all John Grisham novels are sudden they are where the entire apparatus is corrupt and where the reformer is not an Insider but an outsider so end in every John Grisham novel to stay jaundice must be clear from the same premise which is the system is rotten to the core and only this white knight who comes in from the outside can save us so in the western there is no system in the northern does system is fantastic in the in the Eastern the system is reformed from within but in the southern the system has to be reformed from without that's my complicated place all art about Law &amp; Order about the criminal world comes into one of these four categories and the so the Brits love the northern so what is you know all of the the famous British detective stories on some there's no there's never a case where there's a rotten cop who's selling out every is there a modern version of the western because Westerns all seemed to take place between the time of like 15 1618 I challenge you to find a police officer in a WeChat novel they're not reach her is a retired the hero is a retired army investigator anymore they just roaming around the country solving crimes on his own and you he'll confront some massive criminal conspiracy and he never calls the cops right that's the whole premise that's so Western you can't call the cops in the classic Western because it's okay not to be found we found during Montana on the border with Richard it's a it's a 21st century Western so he doesn't call the cops cuz he doesn't feel like it amazing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> don't know too much about the actual is there a difference between the way different alcohol affects is the does the wine alcohol actually affect you buy volume by by by the actual percentage of alcohol does it affect you differently than beer or differently than whiskey or different tequila is that some people say so if I drink tequila I get crazy like people always have the steward but is that true if you have you had a cert percentage of alcohol in the alcohol concentration is it all the same in the end because for me wine makes me warm and friendly and it makes me sleepy and it made me in it doesn't make me energetic whiskey makes me crazy like I think it's a crazy driving when people drink shots of Jack Daniels they just want to go through it makes want to do dumb things shots in particular makes me want to do dumb things makes people get crazy makes people loud that makes people Irish right yes yeah and I could be dark Irish if you looked at me and you will ya I'm William you know I am a reserved English and Jamaican Jamaicans not big drinkers in the same kind of people black students drink and get drunk markedly less than white kids real differences in drinking Behavior by race in the ad age Asian students drinking is like a culture more hits yeah I mean getting f***** up is celebrated in white culture will this you know in my book The I talked about all the strange things that have happened with drinking patterns on campus and I was struck induna chapter I was interested in that connection between drinking and drunkenness in sexual assault on campus they will tell you that you almost never see one of these cases where both parties aren't drunk which doesn't explain them entirely but it's a huge factor in making sense of what happens when you dig into that you see these things really weird patterns I was in college I did not know and I went to college in Canada population I did not know a single person the trunk and then now if you talk to a 20 year old college student in America they will name friends of theirs who get blackout drunk on a weekly basis what is the drinking age in Canada and what was it when you were in college when I was 18 I think that might be a big factor I've been talking to friends about this about Europe about how in Europe particularly in Italy and France you're allowed to drink wine at a very young age and the taboo aspect of a forbidden fruit all that goes away it's just it's a I don't think young kid should be drinking cuz I think it's terrible for brain development but I think there's a thing and keeping them from drinking or making it illegal where it becomes so taboo and so intoxicating that they can't wait until they can legally do it or they try to get ahold of it before it's legal and it has a certain excitement to it. it doesn't have in parts of Europe giving it up kind of soon as all kinds of the things that are new are way less. Way more hard liquor hard liquor when I was in school and 95% of what we drank was beer or tequila or vodka in our party's beer kegs keg parties do you got to be here you got to get to like I forgot what exact number that's had drinks or something Wills Point you going to blow like 1/8 or something I forgot with us some magic number where people that for everybody cuz some people they just get gerbil eyes there's some dudes still have a couple of drinks and they get shark eyes you know that those dark yet like expressionless eyes like a man he still here just wandering around like like like a person with doll eyes there's nothing in there Packers just at what point is your hippocampus shut down and you cease to be able to have the ability to make memories that's just that's a very narrow clinical explanation of so they may be a whole different set of manifestations of drunkenness that have to do with it alcohol's effect on other parts of your brain and pass a certain blood alcohol concentration hippocampus just goes offline essentially just pulled so nothing is coming in is being stored wow so you can continue to communicate I could be placard right now but does it vary with people does it the number of well so yeah 6 or something like that if you think of the if the the love the level legal over for drinking for driving is .08 I think it's roughly 2x that level and most people at that level will be at risk will have at least the beginnings of memory impairment so that feeling when you get really drunk at a party and you can only remember bits and pieces of what happened that night that's because you're your hippocampus was at your moment of pecan Haitian your hippocampus was starting to shut down and just wasn't taking any new new member it's really interesting to because some of our most interesting minds and some of the best communicators relied on alcohol heavily like and it made that like pigeons made it made him a more interesting Communicator when he was drunk and he would have a drink you know I mean right like you'd be on Bill Maher you could tell if it was lit and and and he was so Alec that's so articulate but that beautiful phrasing and so remember though that's his interesting point in a crucial point about blackout which is your hippocampus does necessarily control your your how articulate you are how fluid your speeches it's just about memory so Hitchens could have been the most articulate person in the world and just and but the next morning he would not have remembered a single thing you said on Bill Maher I'm assuming if he was how many stories in the literature about what people were discovering blackout in the 50s and they would do it be stories like they would some guy would come in would wake up in Las Vegas and he would say what am I doing in Las Vegas would see his clothes hanging in the closet wood reconstruct and is expected very story was told in the middle one of the big site the medical journals in the 50s the guy reconstrux he's a Salesman living in Lake Saint Louis who gets really really drunk and then is hippocampus shuts down and he continues to function so it goes gets his car drive to the airport by plane ticket goes to Vegas does his notice and then like two days later Vegas that is two days two days I could be black out right now and still communicate you wouldn't know it until I can't tell whether you have a headache got a party using someone's blackhat asking the same question over and over again and see if they respond like say why you asked me so I would say we did you say your recorder Irish and still have like a tiny memory has just asked me that the hippocampus doesn't shut down all at once so what did they shut down slowly so let's imagine we're both doing shots so after we're doing shots of tequila there's a point where things start to get hazy so you might remember that I asked you that question will you might not and then as we keep drinking in our blood alcohol levels get higher and higher at a certain point your hippocampus will completely like the off switch has been thrown so it goes from being sluggish and impaired to just being down like and what brings it back fall to the point where they can work again so you fall asleep and over the course of 8 hours of sleep you know your alcohol is processed by your liver blood alcohol Falls to be socially acceptable drug they give it to you for free in a place where you can gamble which is really sneaky that's why the weird laws how socially acceptable drug and then the Vegas thing where they give it to you for free in a place where you can gamble which is really sneaky that's one of the weird laws ever that a person could literally lose their house while they're blackout drunk</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I have this thought about how much culture shifted through the internet and how much cultural shift again in the even more astronomical way once we can read minds and I don't think we're far away from that I think we're a few decades away from some technology that allows people to establish intent in to see thoughts and I think they very that there's some sort of theoretical work they're doing on this right now and there's there's different models of they're trying to achieve I think that's going to eliminate a lot of the b******* of communication and I think it's going to happen really quickly just like Google server eliminates a lot of the b******* of people telling stories about something at some of those why what happened wait a minute what year and they can find out where you can where we can see intent and we can read minds I don't think we're far away from that this neural link thing but Eli much is very few lines very hush-hush about these different sort of electronic brain interfaces that they're trying to experiment with yeah I wouldn't wouldn't you worry be that if we read were able to read someone's thoughts intentions what we would in fact discover is even more maybe what's inside my head right now are 35 different thoughts and intentions Waring at with each other murder scenarios yes at this very moment God knows how many scenarios swirling around my head about what should I say next and why is my intention to try to make you laugh to impress you to piss you off to disagree with you to agree with you I mean it we can go on and on remind yes yes curious about I do my mind is such a mess and there's so much chaos going on there I want to know what's going on other people's I want to know how f*****-up am I or am I normal is it so standard is my fear people have said in the moment that turn out to be wrong and badly wrong and one of the things that I have learned as an adult is too deeply distressed those kinds of reactions and to wait and it'll happen in my case I'm still waiting takes a long time I'm the kind of person who sometimes a month will pass and I will think back on a situation and I'll think I'll my God totally misunderstood that chance to or whatever. Comment if someone made that I saw was stupid is in fact extremely thoughtful and insightful this will happen weeks months later whatever if you were able to read my mind in the moment you would judge me for my mistake and not give me an easy way to correct it and it was you would trap me in like what is this would have had a reaction to something you said in this conversation and then I'm driving back to LA tonight and I think I'll actually do that's really interesting and thought about the time I don't want you to short-circuit my learning process about you I want I want to give me the privacy of my my 6 hours of thinking about what you said and allow me give me that kind of time to come to a reasoned insightful conclusion about how I feel that's interesting but we're talking then about only one person having the tech cuz if you both have the technology and it wouldn't be any issue you wouldn't be a confusion as to why someone was saying something you'd be a much clearer path to understanding the thought process in there 10 behind it one person has it right then yeah I get it so I can read your mind but they're both people have it one of the things that would be fascinating about this is one at one of things about forbidden words is forbidden words carry with them intent they have automatic content right but you can say the exact same word and have different intent behind it if we could understand clearly what your intent is then taboo words would automatically become meaningless it wouldn't mean if it is not about sound you may song about forbidden sounds what it's about his thoughts and what you're trying to convey and what's happening to you as a human being who are you like what what what is your process for the way you communicate with your process for the way you're trying to develop these thoughts in your mind and express them to people well part of the problem with that is language right and part of the problem with making certain aspects of our language forbidden is you limit people's ability to call play communicate and express themselves in certain ways I think that alone just eliminating that alone eliminated in confusion and also highlighting you know you can highlight reel problems with people's thoughts in the way people communicate but also eliminate many problems so it's all he doesn't mean that like you could see what you mean literally see the thoughts let me let me get let me throw another complicating Factor it still leaves the question of cultural context of reference profoundly complicate our attempt to understand other people and so you're aware I have some kind of window into your thinking an intention I still need to know idea of the the cultural kind of rules of the road that you use to be different from mine fasting experiment which is done with Korean and American college students adults and what I do is I give you three circles paper circles and one is past when is present when its future and I say those are three concepts represent those three concepts with the circles so the American kid has present in the middle future over on the right at 3 Independence Circle the grandkid Futsal piles all three circles on top of each other now what does that mean I don't know what that means something interesting these three mode the way that we are experienced with a very different set of assumptions so maybe so I think of florists along time ago but if I'm Korean maybe the Civil War is his present in My Kind Of Consciousness as something that happened last week is that dude that's not what that means I'm not exactly sure I'm so guessing cuz I don't know that I haven't fully investigated the point is you know those rules cuz those rules are sorting out how people so this is only I'm not dissing this notion of that you're talking about I'm saying that it needs to have another layer as well or cultural cultural are alerts me to hell you're organizing experience</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you make the title of this book talking to strangers are you do you have a goal that you're trying to achieve you trying to illuminate certain aspect of communication be trying to highlight issues that people had with the stories like the Michael Brown story or bad at you no like palestrina book of the Larry Nassar case in Michigan State which ones I'll ask the guy over the doctor for the gymnastics oh yeah while he is abusing their kids and they don't see it the kids saying something weird happened in the parents are dismissing it so I wanted to that's a good example of a phenomenon that I wanted to try and explain which is how is that possible how come we think we know someone and be so completely wrong how can you take your kid to a doctor and think the doctor is in fact what he's doing is abusing your child in front of you right and that's a very similar kind of problem to Bernie Madoff people invested their life savings with this guy not not little old ladies in Dubuque sophisticated Savvy incredibly intelligent investors handed over millions of dollars to this guy who was not even the Madoff fraud was so outrageous 100% sociopath fraud yes and people over the course of 20 years wrote check after check after check after check to him thinking was this building investor did my favorite story in the middle of chapter is the greatest hedge fund in the world is Renaissance Technologies these are the guys out in Long Island who have had like 30% returns for 25 years they're like all PhD Arduino AIG and they found themselves and they're all Geniuses so they look a lot like that doesn't make any sense to me that's like what should we do we have 30 million dollar steak in a van. We don't understand what the guys doing and you would think logically they would sell their steak they don't cuz it's returning what is the best what I was going to stand like they can't even you know this is no Shine the truth which is this idea from a researcher call Tim Devine which is human beings were trusting engines we are evolved to give people the benefit of the doubt and once you understand that and why do we do that because it's the right move 99% of the time most people are being truthful and if you have is your strategy I'm going to believe what people say it makes you fantastic friend a wonderful person to work with it means that you can you know skate through the world with a minimum of fuss right because they are suspicious if we evolved because that makes your life easier but the best part of human people want to mate with you like if you want to talk about who passes on their genes nice people pass a child with a crazy suspicious paranoid person or a loving trusting person you choose the loving trusting person 100% of time so paranoid jeans they're different they may be smarter than the rest of us but they're not constructed differently their inclination is to believe people are like well I don't know I said he's a good investor s*** ton of money you cannot point to an unsophisticated investor on the list of people who lost the most money from every one of the most part and that's what happened well he when you realize what a sociopath you actually was is in the interviews after he's caught or he's demanding certain things and complaining about certain things he doesn't seem to have any remorse and he wants better treatment he wants better food he doesn't seem to have any remorse that he's you know literally Rob people their retirement ruined the last part of their lives or they thought they were going to have a considerable sum of money to sit back and just enjoy their grandchildren know now they're broke the other another poor now they have to figure out a way to get behind heat he doesn't give a shitt he doesn't infect what's weird is so many things weird about that one of them is we forget that he doesn't get caught he turns himself in because and his clients are losing so much money on their legit Investments that they go to man up and say can I have some of my money back from you I got to pay off all the stuff I've done that has gone sour so like in effect no one ever caught him he gets caught by a once-in-a you know one-in-a-million circumstance where he's the only one making any money for his clients to bamboozle most sophisticated people in the world to the tune of billions of dollars for 25 years and only gets caught because we had a once-in-a-lifetime financial meltdown isn't the rationalist Nevada that we should all be Bernie Madoff around and he ran a Ponzi scheme he spent a lot of it and how did his son's not catch on to this cuz they're not being so it's an open question of how much they do how much anyone else knew the older I get the more I believe in the powers of particularly within within the family denial is something now I don't find it hard to believe so your ability I've now heard so many stories of you know a parent is some kind of monster and family members just won't see it. Just can't bring themselves to go that so did they know something everyone knew there was something slightly fishy in what horseshit they thought that she was so there was some people thought that he actually had Investments but he was there was a suspicion for assembly was front-running that because he had a larger business managing the the deal flow in the NASDAQ that he would get Advanced word of where money was flowing and he would jump ahead of the queue buy stocks before the people did and profit off the massacro so it was a feeling that he had a dubious kind of a legitimate strategy that nonetheless legitimately made him a lot of money so he will like well as long as he can get away with it and I can profit off it I'm fine trade orders from scratch I think they took I can't remember the exact number I think they got get to Confederates I think he went down with him that's it I think that's what it was recorded somehow on a phone or something after who's in jail we was talking about trying to get me back from one of his biggest investors the guy had gotten like a billion dollars from him over the years you not giving you s*** and you know that then this is crazy conversation where he's basically telling this guy look you knew this was b******* and you were making money off this and now you know play Mister Mister Stewart plus to a m a a hypothetical scenario hope you have a friend whose incredible salesman and is gone around Europe into Sally irregular and raised a 20 million dollar fund 20 billion dollar fund and they're promising a 20% return a year on your investment right so we give him a million you getting $20,000 a year back from this thing you know it's all bulshit the rational thing for you to do is to take your on your million-dollar investment is to take the $200,000 that is made made in quotation marks every year out of the fund so you say most people know when you invest in stocks and only what you do is you check the box I want my I want any dividends ordings reinvested in the fund don't check the box take the real cash so if you're messing with this phony friend of yours for 20 years going to get $200,000 a year for 20 years that's four million dollars you will make 4 million clear of your out of your 1 million initial investment in in 20 years right that's smart if you know what's going on so that's what some people did Wiz winners of this whole thing with those people is not real that money is coming from other investors in feelings being made actually what happens with them like if a guy does make all these millions of dollars like that one guy he had to soap and give some of the back yes it would happen Tuesday and point remember the appointed after the Scandal breaks and made of is invested they bring in a kind of supervisor supervisor who has the power to clawback winnings from money took cash off the table so but not everyone had to call back in the question was how far back do we go so if you were investing if you were messing with me. 25 years ago and you took you know 10 million off the table between 1990 and 1993 due to give that up to like it gets complicated also how can you prove that he was doing the same activity back then conversation with somebody had recorded Madoff talking to this guy now and I'm lucky got to give that money back if you don't have any understanding of it it's like a foreign language and so you're hoping that all these jeans scampi duped all these people throwing their tickets up in the air and everybody that's really good buy-sell they'll know what's going on you don't know what's going on but hey there's a lot of things you know that they don't know and this is just how the world Works turns out no turns out the people that were involved in this crazy very difficult to understand thing didn't know it either like they barely can understand it and this guy was just stealing money in some weird way and if the stock market crash if we didn't have some sort of depression who knows how he might still be in operation today 2008 there's a very very strong possibility that it would still be going to keep surviving is to take enough money to cover withdrawals billion dollar hedge fund and that's imagine there's a billion and withdrawals coming out every year he's got to raise a billion if you're burning you already have 50 something hard to raise another and took me because he had people all around the world and was given the huge fees to raise money for him so that's the other way that the people who had I forgot what it was but you would be say you're you're you're Joe the Financial guy in Zurich you have a whole bunch of wealthy European clients don't even left Revy rev million you raise for Bernie Bernie would let you keep I forgot what it was a hundred grand at the next place that's real money that's got to be strange so what can be learned in terms of communication from The Bernie Madoff story well the Bernie Madoff story and the all the all of these was an investigation of human beings that you know we know how to figure out if someone tells you they are good at spotting Liars there's a 99% chance that they're lying people parade through this office right now the studio right now and every one of them made it statement in front of you and summer long is only tell the truth and I asked you Joe tell me who's lying is not accuracy rate your success rate would be 52 to 54% better than chance you might as well flip a coin if you don't and if that's not about you anyone in that chair watching these people parade in front of us is going to do a sled you did better than chance and the reason why is there are a small fraction of people who are such epically bad Liars in that chair watching these people parade in front of us is going to do a slight bit better than chance in a reason other than chance is there are a small fraction of people who are such epically bad Liars</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah the Power Trip aspect of it I mean you can avoid often said what would they do you know cuz they're certain at the certain areas where police officers to have quotas we have to write a certain amount of tickets will they do if no one broke the law for 6 months they're glorified Revenue collectors they're pulling people over trying to write huge tickets in at Billy's North Carolina where you're talking about that's got this creepy law that they recent I think they recently changed it where you're allowed to just confiscate people's money cuz if you see like I pull you over hey Malcolm why do you have $3,000 on you that you going to buy heroin or by illegal guns or whatever and then most of that money wound up going to the police department so they used it to like build a f****** gym for the cops or whatever means literally had an incentive to keep the money and is that North Carolina that they did that Carolina people are up in arms and Furious that you know their money has been stolen people on the way to buy a car for instance you know and that they get pulled over in a couple just take all the money this is what I talked a little bit about the Ferguson case in my book it later on tonight this is what Ferguson was ultimately about the focus in the Ferguson case was whether the officer in that case is Darren Wilson what he did and didn't do to Michael Brown but the real story when the Robert Jesse's investigated story is not being kind of dinos to it is it that's that the police department in Ferguson was being run as a revenue-generating arm of the city government and people in city government were directing the activities of law enforcement to maximize revenue and this is incredible stories of a story where there's a guy who's just been playing basketball and he's sitting in his car parked by the basketball court like Cooling cop roles in pulls up behind him and end up writing a tickets including diffuser the guy being a pedophile gets him for one of his he gets in putting a false name on his driver's license when his driver's license his real name was like Michael and his driver's license head Mike like that's the level of hate tickets right that was routine practicing a kid like Michael Brown in Ferguson is gets really angry at law enforcement because law enforcement was a completely discredited institution in that city as they had been basically praying they've been praying on the on the low-income community of that town so of course relationships between the population in the lower ab one of the reasons I want to read this book was that the kind of conversations we have around these things Frozen's great example 95% of the conversation by Ferguson which is about trying to break down what happened between the koppen Michael Brown and the issue when we finally look at it and systemic matter because it's not about that is about a system that I've been in place for years and years and years and years when which the the the American population of town had been preyed upon by the deep the African American population of town had been preyed upon by the police department that is the broader and you cannot come to an understanding of what happened with Michael Brown until you willing to engage that case on that much more broader systemic level</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the Sandra Bland case to fit in because down one that the girl was pulled over the cop was Taps sheet was failure to signal right and she started lighting cigarettes he told it told her to put the cigarette out and it all escalated from that she said she doesn't have to put the cigarette out and then he says he's going to light her up he's screaming at her he pulled her out of car he rests her and now is there controversy about whether or not she committed suicide in jail because it seemed that seemed unlikely that she was killed that you supposed to Yes it seemed likely that she was killed versus she committed suicide I didn't think that someone would commit suicide being in jail for 3 Days specially one of things that you highlighted in the book and you actually played in the audio version of it her little affirmations you know and choose to sound very positive and upbeat and calling everybody kings and queens and it was everything thanking God and being very thankful and being aware of of life and humility and it just graciousness and gratitude it didn't seem I mean obviously don't know then what kind of dark things can happen to a person when they're incarcerated for 3 days for a bulshit reason maybe that's the straw that broke the back but she did have you know she had a complicated emotional history she had previously I tried to commit suicide and she had she was emerging from a quite a difficult. In your life and went to Texas to start a new leaf and so there is an interpretation like I said only have strong feelings on this particular part of the story but there's an interpretation it says woman whose emerged from very difficult. Your life goes leave shoes shoes in Illinois driver's app across the country to start over and on the first day that she arrives in Texas to start over she gets pulled over by a cop mod she had thousands of dollars and outstanding tickets so she had a history of this b******* stuff with cops wear the same trap that many poor people to get into which is they get the police use people as an ATM right things when they can't find when they can't pay Define they get another fine and when you know you have that goes she was part of in that trap so she is trying to start over after difficult time and then she's in jail and she can't make bail and you know there's a scenario where you can see that she just began to despair don't they take away your shoelaces and do all town taxes are they doing things by the book in to kill someone get away with it requires a level of expertise and forethought that struck me was not present in that little town in Texas I mean a serious I'm not I don't do nothing I do not think indecision of people playing chess right I think they encountered it with this cop and he's not very good at his job and he gets way over his head and completely misread sir and he pulls rocket Republic deeply regrets incident and they're all embarrassing sitting around and hoping it'll just all go away I mean while she's all alone in a prison cell spiraling deeper and deeper into depression I mean it's I think it's almost more tragic that she came as soon as she committed suicide it's insane that you can keep someone in jail for 3 days for failure to Signal it seems like there should have been an initial review of the circumstances that led to her getting pulled out of the car in the first place and cops have been fired immediately this is your screaming at her because she lit a cigarette in her own car on campus property she rolls through a stop sign and then he notices that she's got out-of-state plates and she's young black woman and she driving Hyundai McDonough Mercedes-Benz any thinks I'm going to check this out Steven exit or something I bet it goes like she pulls over to get out of his way and he goes you didn't use your turning signal or signal he wanted to get her situation but it's all pretext you just once he think so maybe there's something weird with her so then we have this on tape is in this is one of them since I was captured he goes back to his car and he comes back to her and he later says in the deposition that when he goes back to his to his vehicle to check on her license and registration begins to develop suspicions that she's up to no good she's got drugs or guns and so she comes back and it commenced to have this increasingly heated conversation and she lights the cigarette because she's trying to calm herself down and this is my point in Yoruba people smoked all the time know that one of the principal functions of lighting cigarette was to calm your nerves and in her mind I think in her mind she's trying to signal to the cop let's deescalate this and I'm one of the ways I'm going to show you that I wanted to take a moment and light a cigarette and just take it down a notch and let's have a real conversation he doesn't understand the meaning of that gesture except when she's messing with me she's defying my authority by lighting cigarette she's going to blow smoke in my face or something you know nefarious or she's going to like take the light cigarette and put it out of my weird crazy fantasies ways in which he completely misunderstands her and one of them is it doesn't understand the meaning of lighting a cigarette in a moment of tension and that's still more evidence why you need if you're a cop or anyone dealing with a stranger you need to slow down and not jump to any conclusions because it would seem to me while I listen to it initially and then I was through it again and your audiobook there's a thing that happens with police officer I've never been a police officer but I was a security guard for a brief. Of time and I recognize it in myself and I recognized in a lot of people that I work with is that you start treating the other people like the other like us and them it was us discovered that great great Woods it's a performance center in Mansfield Massachusetts like this and we would catch lot of people smuggling booze and things like that and there was go to that you got and I was only there for one summer but there's an attitude of they were they were the bad people and you were the good guys it was us and them and we stuck together and they weren't us and cops get that a hundred times worse because there's guns involved and they can get shot at we've all seen videos of cops pulling people over and he says can I see your hands please and guy pulls out a gun and shoot them we've all seen those videos back in the mine of cops and I think that was just a guy who as you said 29 years olds young guy he's not that bright not good at communication and he is this attitude that he's a cop and that you have to listen to the cops cuz he's them and you or you and that that's like when he's telling her to put the cigarette out and she saying I don't have to do that and he's saying get out of your vehicle and she sang I don't have to do that and then he's screaming at her that's that's all right there so it seems like to me he wants compliance he wants her to listen what's remarkable about that tape which I must have seen fifty times and which has been viewed on YouTube you know even a couple million times it's over 10 minutes and it doesn't it unfolds over a minute-and-a-half what I remember years ago I wrote my second book blank and I have in that book a chapter about a very famous Infamous police shooting in New York case of Amadou Diallo remember remember that like 40 times by cops and one of the things I was interested in talking about in that case was how long does it take how long the whole terrible sequence to go down so from the moment the police development suspicions about Amadou Diallo to the moment Adamo gel is lying dead on his front porch how long how much time elapsed an answer is like 2 seconds Batman guy security expert right security expert security guard guarding someone to do is to inject time into the scenario instead of you don't want someone to unfold in a second-and-a-half where you have almost no time to react properly and what you want to do is to golden 5 Seconds making this up I can't remember exactly what your job is is to add seconds into the the encounter so that you have a chance to intelligently respond to what's going on about how good is really not to go for their weapons any situations because it's point is so say you're guarding the president your body map of the president you walk into a crowd somebody comes up to you like pose a gun wants to shoot the president appointed if you're the secret security guy and your first instinct in response to someone pulling a gun is to go for your own gun you've lost a second-and-a-half write your hands got to go down to your your whole focus is on getting to your own gun in the meantime alligators guns already out has already shot you've lost you need to be someone who forgets about your own gun and just focuses on the on the man in front of you right now protecting the president was all in the context of time is is really crucial variable in these kind of encounters and everything as a police officer you should be doing is slowing it down weight you know analyze what's happening that's what he doesn't do the cop in this instance Feats it up right he goes to Defcon like cigarette and within seconds he screaming at her parents shouldn't do that because he's trying to write a ticket and the way he's communicating with her when she lights a cigarette it's like she's inferior I hate you this is not someone who's scared he's not scared of the perpetrators not scared that there's a criminal in the car about to shoot him he's not scared of that all he he wants other total complete compliance and he's talking to her like like he's a drill sergeant but can't can't do those things be true also like he's sitting down with the investigating officer in the looking into the death of Sandra Bland and he's got I don't know how long it is to ours that he's walking them through what he was thinking that day and he makes the case that he was terrified that he was convinced he he said he goes back to his squad car comes up you realize why I pulled you over and is he okay cuz he doesn't seem right to him she gives him a license he goes back to his squad car and he says he's in the squad car and he sees her making what he calls forwarded movements like she's being all kind of Jumpy and I saw her moving around and make me happy if you're a cop you go driver side only if you think that you might be in danger right he doesn't feel good driver side you're exposing yourself to the road we can do that is it when your driver side you can see the it's very difficult if someone has a gun to shoot the police police officer was pulled them over at the police officer is on the driver side why do you have an angle if they're on the passenger side so why does he go if he thinks she's harmless leave him he constructs this ridiculous fantasy about how she's dangerous but I think that's what he was trying to do he's a paranoid cop and then why is he so insistent that she be compliant for the same reason because he's terrified do exactly what I say cuz I don't know what the what's going to happen you're right and she's I've interpretation are mutually exclusive it didn't sound like he was too scared at all it sounds like he was pissed that she wasn't listening to him I didn't think you sounded even remotely scared I'd I felt like he had I mean Super reading into it up right right I have no idea but from not my interpretation was he had decided that she wasn't listening to him and he was going to make her listen to him that's what I got out of it I didn't get any fear that version of it that he described just sounds like horseshit it sounds like what you would say after the fact that strengthen your case has a police officer on the force for I forgot 9-10 months and we have a record of every traffic stop you ever made and when you look at his list of traffic stops you you realize that what happened that day with Sandra Bland with no anomaly that he's one of those guys who pulls over everyone for bulshit reasons all day long so I think I forgotten in the hour before he pulled over Sandra Bland people over for people for other people equally ridiculous reasons keep that cop something else if you look at history as a cop almost never found anything else he had in nine months to go through them he has like once he found some marijuana and a kid and put away the light above their license plate was out. That's the level of stuff he was using he did this all day long everyday so he's like to him it's second nature yeah like who knows what's going on the rest of the cops in the forest in his division did it will I looked it I didn't look at the rest of the cops on his voice when I looked at work numbers to wherever there are several American states give us like North Carolina sample will give us precise complete statistics on the number of traffic stops done by their police officers and the reasons for those stops so when you look at that so I have to look at the North Carolina numbers for example in the North Carolina Highway Patrol the same thing 1% less than 1% in rates in some cases have been hit raping finding something on Pinterest one person who's got you know a bag of dope or something in the car you cannot conduct policing in in a civil society like that and expect to have decent relationships between law enforcement and the civilian population no question but doesn't that sort of support the he's full of s*** that he was really concerned that she had something he never encountered anything well or or this was the one fantasy and his head is so why is he keep doing it if I'm an open the trunk and it's going to be 15 lb of heroin and I'm going to be the biggest star who ever lived I think there's also a rush of just being able to get people to pull over this the the compliance thing which is another reason why he was so Furious it was she wasn't listening to him and she kept a cigarette lit what are the laws see I can't stop you from gauging the can't tell you to put out your cigarette there's no law that he could have said to the police officers in a traffic stop I would prefer if you put out the cigarette while we're talking or I'm allergic to smoke or whatever I mean use the million ways to do it nicely so basically doing the job like a jackass trained and instructed to do he's a he's the ideal cop and the problem is with the particular Philosophy of Law Enforcement has emerged over the last 10 years in this country which has incentivized and encouraged police officers to engage in these incredibly low-reward activities like pulling over a hundred people or to find one person's with salmon run strategy forces around the country they tell them to do this I have a whole section of book Reich go to Andy Taylor one of the most important police training manuals which is you know required reading for if somebody coming up in which they just walk you through this like it is your job to pull over lots and lots and lots and lots of people even if you only find something in a small percentage of cases being a proactive police officers all about right so they are trained at that phrase go beyond the ticket is a is a term of Art in police training like you got to be thinking you sure you pull them over for having a tail light that's out what your look you're thinking beyond that is there something else in the car that's problematic that's what you trying to find so there he was being a dutiful police officer and the answer is to re-examine our philosophies of law enforcement not to not I mean you can't dismiss this thing by saying really bad cop great but I don't know if he's any worse than you know he's just doing what he was trying to do that's the issue should be trying to do something different bride that is the issue is there this is standard practice treat citizens that are doing nothing wrong as if they're criminals and pull them over and give them extreme paranoia and freak him out and I saw in the back and hope these guys always have their alternators slogan on the side of the car the back of the car to my little Hometown in Southwestern Ontario sleepy no fun country that the slogan on the back of the police cars is people helping people do Canadian civilian with the same degree of fear or paranoia that the civilian has a handgun a big part of this regardless of how one feels about gun laws in this country the fact that there are lots of guns being makes a job of a police officer a lot harder in Canada you know he's like this genial person who was a really camera forgotten exactly with the floors connect to a Canadian looks to me it looks a little why do they have to block for the Oakland Raiders I mean it's like what do you think they should pay them something mild and like bright yellow something lovely something Elysian matters right right you know who makes all of his prisoners wear pink cops insanely low number I mean insanely low probably almost non-existent guys pullover women I don't think they're worried about being shot I really don't I think it's I think it's all after-the-fact trying to concoct some sort of Excuse excuse for still on the force motivation is not rational right and if you were a rational actor you would never engage in an activity where 99.9% of your police stops resulted in nothing for a reason which is that's what it's certain jurisdictions in this country resulted in nothing he is off in some weird kind of Fantasyland for a reason which is that's what it's certain jurisdictions in this country that's what law enforcement has come to look at look like that's that's problematic problem</div>

Who's the founder of this type of Technology right and he takes millions of songs and give them away and then that people can all these songs for free and the music industry like any other industry has a certain quota of business that does every year like every other industry tourmaster comes right and in the end he take all the songs with all these people who are waiting for the publishing check waiting for the economics to be created for music down is no publishing check all the numbers and now decrease because there's no physical cell of your music for us to accumulated value to send you a check but then at the end of the day after he does that he gets a billion dollars so that you took it what belongs to which they say there's a thousand Artist as well Value Inn Forest you know that sell records that you could say accumulate money right so we took the power of a thousand and put it in one man's hand okay so that's one of the first mistakes as an industry when you make and then his second mistake we make is that now there's Services going and they're illegal downloads and people won't pay a dollar for the record album even this a was $20 you won't pay that but you pay $340 for your headphones to your phone and you use it for music where to buy it what the best way to buy an AR-15 does a total unbalanced a lot of artists have to stop making music because there's no economic Wu-Tang Clan rapper you know it's 16 what is album you know I may just say every other woman will do the same so they get the guitar album made it may cost $2000000 a studio session a studio session is up to us are the cheapest level hundred bucks an hour you do it to do a 12-hour block out that's another grand a day just to get into the studio the world that takes it for free so now you can't recreate it again that you put on the tools about easier now and you could do a lot with the laptop and all that even a laptop is 2 G's bro even though the download just logic write with anybody use $200 man and so you need a brand now is merchandising and brand is merchandising and being entertained the idea of that brand what's the best way to say what's the best way to play Wu-Tang Clan what's the best way to support is it Apple music like what it what is the best what's the best way to accumulate music require music Amazon music has the second thing is also made the behind yes so why one point I try to prove a point by saying look I'm going to put a value on it so you know there's a value to it to me but they know the other point buy me put I put another album out called a better tomorrow would you like to go do what you want with it for the world support your artist is just by listening to the music I beautiful but so this is good though this is cuz I've always wanted to know this cuz I've always I've always been like what do I do do I do iTunes do I do Amazon like what where do you get the most money back from the system is found a way to balance its okay its okay now already girl but somebody has to have a platform for people to even come check for you yes one place you can tell me that's the best way to support Wu-Tang Clan blah blah blah just like this oh s*** they want audio rights or something so they can put on vinyl and then the value is the history the story like a motherfuker one of vinyl Wu-Tang because it's art just like what they're doing the one joint it's all right but like you said we talked earlier it's coming back yeah it's coming back at 9 to go to clubs or anything like that in a DJ but the act of collecting something and take it take home with you sometime CDs CDs is like technology is about to die why would I buy this city because it has a booklet member and that was the last thing and I don't what you did but I don't see people doing that but I think it's going to go back nobody's everybody's not going to 1200 in the house or whatever but some people especially if it's a genre or something is Uconnect what they can be like I want to buy that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you don't own your body and soul a lot of be surgeons get hold of these bodies to die stacked and they're digging them up from from graveyards that there were Body Snatchers they called themselves Resurrection men and they would go into the cemetery and they would dig up his bodies and they would oftentimes strip the body naked because it was it was illegal to steal possession from the corpse but not the body itself there was no concept of the body being sort of property so they would throw the clothes back into the grave and really clever in the way they did it they usually sent a woman in the daytime to do math grade is a mourner and she would kind of go through the graveyard and she would see where the fresh Graves were because of course you'd want the body to be as fresh as possible and then at night time they would go in there and they would pick up these bodies and they could take as many as twelve bodies in a night like hard labor and it was very lucrative because the only legal bodies to dissect in Britain in the early 19th century War bodies of executed criminals of people who murdered other people so so if you went to the like to say goodbye to your nana and drop some flowers on a grave and is just a big hole in the ground and everybody in the village goes is Graveyard until they can make the cemetery safer so yesterday on Twitter I put up a picture of something called the cemetery gone so they had these devices they would put at the foot of the grave and it had like a tripwire and speak it set up the gun to shoot to protect the body's but they also had Watchmen look at their Instagram for your Twitter feeds Twitter so that way so what what a body stature would typically do is just open the foot of the Grave you wouldn't dig up the whole grade in Smash open the lid and you have instruments to kind of dragged the body out well if the corpses Nails the bottom of the coffin you have a lot of trouble dragging a body out so people you know what they did all these cages over the over the graves to protect them so people the internet will say to protect against how to keep vampires from coming out of it had nothing to do with that or zombies it was to prevent body snatchers from getting ahold of those corpses but you know those bodies are very paranoid and thank God they were on some level right because think about how much we from these bodies bodies were needed to be dissected to teach medical students and one of the scenes in the book I talk about the Dead how to call the dead house and everybody had a different experience in that house is probably people listening who have been in a dissection room and you have a really vivid memory of that it's probably right and white and clinical these places the bodies would have been bloated and partly decomposed bodies with dangerous because you could cut yourself and you gloves and so you get examples of people cutting themselves and dying within 48 hours so going into Madison was dangerous and there's a story in this book about a guy who goes into the the dead house the first time and he freaks out and he sees all these like mice and rats and things like that eating the body we all become accustomed to horrible things at some point and he actually starts taking pieces of the corpse and throwing it to the poor little starving creatures that are have to as a medical student if you want to go on would have been a winter sport because the bodies wouldn't decomposes quickly You chords summer and they literally have seasons Winter Soldier winter jackets and doing it's going to close it probably cuz they had a fireplace at the end of the room as well take a really stuffy and smelly</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Ocean looks like a dull gray even the Ocean looks tired like right as opposed to like if you go to Mexico like I went to Cancun way back in the day and the first thing I noticed like how the f*** is the ocean that color but look how pretty it is it's like a bluish-green it's gorgeous thing that with Pebble Beach has the saying what you're horrible but but the water is so beautiful is crazy I grew up in that town which is next to the Charles River and that Charles River went all the way through Boston and the the Charles River was like disgusting man on QVC condoms floating in it you see I saw one pipe and it's bubbles were coming up to the surface or what the f*** is that a condom oh my God it's a sewer pipe and I realize someone just flushing their s*** and piss right into the goddamn River how did this happen and I was you know 14in am I is this I kind of I finding this like you don't have anybody likes checking to see if the shitpipe jumping right into the goddamn River so wasn't clean by any stretch of the imagination so to see that kind of clean pure like ocean water with bone fishing you know that is in the type of fishing that people do it so I think they mostly just catch and release him I don't think they even keep most of them but they go to Florida and the Bahamas once in the Bahamas and they only just like the special boats that are like these boats you can stand on and they're fly fishing for this fish that looks like a blondes in the Stone Age is weird cool fish called The Bonefish see the picture of it I don't know why we're talking about this that's how I am and they just casting out they see these fish coming towards them and they catch it it supposed to be like super super exciting you dual efficient I don't do a lot of fishing but I love fishing is fun but this is fun like I would assume I've haven't done this kind of fishing bone fishing but that's what people people love like seeing a fish coming and going a biting your lower like it's very exciting with scuba gear on into the garbage patch the middle of the Pacific Ocean I knew I knew that is supposed to be like horrific but what you do when you see it in a video you watching just go what the f*** is this this guy put scuba gear on a jumped into this I mean it was plastic you couldn't see anything with plastic everywhere you look to the left and the right was all plastic like this is huge like several States large yeah this s*** this is what humans are doing to the ocean this is this is what you see him jump in and it's almost did they show him jumping or is this a different video is it in Dives in in the Woody dives into is just like plastic soup it's f****** disgusting that it's crazy yeah I like this so this is are we having a podcast name is boy Onslaught and he created a device that he's using to try to pull the plastic out of the ocean and then maybe convert that plastic into know things that we can use and there I don't think it worked on the first attempt but they're they're relaunching it right didn't they had to do something to fix things. Either still in like sort of the Prototype stage but going to have these machines of this giant Nets move around to the ocean stop it from getting fish burger question I don't think it's any fish living in there I bet a lot of fish have eaten that stuff though guaranteed to get over a lot of fish with plastic in their stomach yeah man that's gross I mean what what kind of s*** gets in their system and then when you eat that fish what kind of shity you getting in your system like how many people were testing their fish you know I mean how many people are for the eat of salmon like hold on let me check for mercury or we see how much are snakes in this suit kind of heavy metal party with sets up BP bees that they're worried about that come from what is the stuff that where your brother comes from bottles you'll listen man even if it takes 10 years if they can figure out a way to get rid of all that plastic and we can figure out a way to not put that plastic in the ocean we can maybe what I really worry about almost as much as this may be even more is overfishing when you realize how many different ships are out there using giant Nets and just scooping everything they catch inside that net and then just serving it to us and we like who you want sushi ya Sushi sounds good you know what like so close sushi sounds good it's ocean genocide I mean it's f****** chaotic math 2 did they don't have real they are real control at the international waters people just Cuttin gnats and drop him to the bottom of the ocean and the catching things all the time does gnats all over the place out there he was just released their Nets the biggest litter but you're always you've been very conscious about like what you eat and sustainability a lot lately right well I think sustainability you think about that a lot I don't know if I'm not conscious of it I'm definitely guilty of not being sometimes I'm hungry Millions I Justified it I wish I was more Koch because I'm want it will put in my face and makes me all set I'm more conscious about what I eat then I am sustainability internship with the quality of what I eat more conscious about that I should be more cautious about sustainability but sometimes it feels like what is this what is showing me here is the name of this is like 40 million views on YouTube it's a net that's full of stuff do they caught a net do this is Owen net does a fishing boat ya ya look at that look how it works he just scooped up every f****** thing that's in that ocean it's really amazing that they would a horrific place to be if you're a fish Magic Fish we're like super smart and this is their demise insane net filled with living creatures that we're going to eat not bro it's just relax God you're getting so dramatic that it's a crazy bundle of these ocean creatures and how often does this happen a day is it all day I bet it is I bet this is all day I bet this is all day for years and years and years and years and I don't think they take time I think they keep going and if they're not there someone else is there to I think this is happening as long as they can make money selling fish and we're willing to buy fish kind of insane you think people ever feel bad about it until we both people feel bad maybe possible they're not monsters right they might develop two fish three fish and then you eat it like this is chaos man this is some crazy thing where you have to make filet o fish sandwiches because there's you know 320 million people and doesn't want junk food anytime they want it I mean I don't know if that went to fillet a fish or that's expensive fish I really have no idea I'm just talking s*** I don't listen to me but I also eat fish but it is kind of crazy I'm not opposed to eating fresh but I'm just saying the reality of what this is it's crazy this is a crazy scene and did not deny the crazy scene I'm still going to finish and I feel I feel awful about this it does lightly make me want sushi games like loud either way yeah tell no matter what for these organisms but they're delicious and they're really good for you going to be some left that's what's crazy the human governments need to get together and go hey we can't kill the whole ocean cuz that is possible if you keep going at the pace that it's going now you really stop and think about what the ocean must have been like when you hear about those Japanese tuna fisherman did you see Jude Dreams of Sushi everyone knows gentleman where the fish market and they were talking about what it used to be like he's Bee tuna everywhere so much tuna and now it's like a small amount and you check to see if it's good like you're watching it happening in real time if you go from that point with that guy was talking about it today and then go 50 years from now at the same Pace like will the very least they have to take into consideration the fact that they need to maybe develop some sort of an international program to breed these things like they've done that with Yellowtail that they have these like ocean sort of almost like a like corralled in the area and they're out in the ocean but they're only in this one trapped area and they're feeding them you know and occasionally they get out like to get those yellow tails in Hawaii there was a storm the storm recto closure and they got out another everywhere so all these Hamachi grade like sushi grade yellowtail are swimming around all over the place out of White Haven and they're breeding the getting bigger guys it's crazy but I was thinking when they were telling me that well so if that's what they did like maybe they could do that and just keep releasing them maybe we should be a program that all the people who buy sushi fund into that just takes a little piece of the sushi money and uses it to develop the all the people who buy sushi fund into that just takes a little piece of the sushi money and uses it to develop these programs to make sure that these f****** fish keep reading so you can have more Sushi I think people will pay extra for that and they would feel good</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> physical any documentation right and still meditation like there's a meditation when you just sit still because he feels that the physical exercise is not the proper way to Enlightenment like he thought that the who is to external by Jimmy complications by kygo and so he returned so he retreated to the mountain and he goes for internal Kung Fu but in the process of doing Antonio, fool such as Tai Chi ba qua like these techniques like this piece of Brocade make a note that have only drums to open up the back of your brain like if you do that makes sense if you cover your ears and you cover your ears like this like that well that's one of the bouquets and it is we've made these eight pieces of brocade by Brocade we speak into a man's mouth came with double edged sword the sword of course no sores that come out of your mouth your tongue is that sword double edged exactly so-so Wu-Tang itself right this guy leaves the temple goes to the mound and meditate and he's dealing with still meditation right but in all reality when you mix it together Wu-Tang and Shaolin you have the physical and the steel meditation and it takes both to actually find this level of enlightening you looking for so when bodhidharma came to Shallotte Indian monk who was more of a yoga student he comes the Shaolin and he's trying to teach them the Indian way but he realize that all the monks of too weak to sit there and they're still meditation and so he created something called the Lohan's right on the 18 low hands on these spoiled that he steps were made so that now they could do a physical movement to build their body up so now they can meditate longer because you have a strong mind got a strong body and what's the use of a strong body without a strong mind so that's the Dallas and so that's the Shaolin and Wu-Tang philosophy Wu-Tang Clan myself with this we met Wu-Tang Clan as the name of our crew we took the verse from the Bible about the SS water Jesus speaking right beside okay we go to use ours and I wish them and I spirituality music that in the Wu-Tang law they said the Wu-Tang martial art monk said about the best sword style by so we like what will the Wu-Tang we have the best source tile but we come from because that's the right and so we took the spiritual the meditate force of Wu-Tang and he put it together and we and I almost thought go off if what you say is true The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang let me put it together and we and I almost starts off if what you say is true The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what's always weird when you see somebody leaned into something and it's not really them and they become what people want of them you know like a great example and comedy was Kinison Kinison when he made it everyone he wanted to lay these gigantic lines of coke form apparently I can't f****** hard time and I can't not live into the thing because then then they'll stop trusting it used to be that used to be one part of his act his name is Andrew Andrew Silverstein real he would do is act and then the Dice Man was a character that he would do but people loved it so much when he would do that character that the character became his whole act and then he became the character where you see him in real life I like weight lifting gloves and I was walking around the Gold's Gym t-shirt he became that guy he's hilarious still but he's that guy now. About the backside of that when you say in what way was not of this era because I am anything interesting I think in that vein like you look at Howard Stern who I've met only a couple times but I had I found him to be like extremely extremely thoughtful guy like but I thought like I was nothing tricky about him at all he's really like down in his shoes he's interested he actually asked question I mean some people you meet music on my God that you're there talking in a mirror that you're you are a mirror and they're just looking at themselves while they speak to you they're waiting for you to get done talking to this talk but he but I think what I think is really interesting is like so Howard imagine imagine the pressure in the Baltimore area he was on DC radio DC101 I remember I remember that the shock of him literally and imagine you know the pole to deliver on what you've built which was obviously you know a huge audience that wanted to sing to me it's really interesting and impressive that Howard's kind of like I know and I don't know him but watching it to me this I did it besides you know I'm I'm going to be honest about where I'm at and in some measure I'm going to say there's things I've done I regret there's ways of treated certain people in the interest of the show that I'm kind of I'm kind of done with that I don't really want to be that guy and in some measure you know where I am now you know what I mean right, so he's so successful and so universally praised as being the most important figure in the history of radio there's no one who does like what I do podcasts and let him do a gigantic debt of gratitude to Howard Stern the fact that you know he was getting fined by the FCC mean I mean they were hundreds of thousands of dollars I kept getting fired from the way people do talk radio long as we've talked up to now is a function of him proving that there was a tolerance for long-form basically you know what I mean I mean it's like people knock on Netflix or do whatever I'm like I'm like anything that there's an amazing thing going on in the world right now which is people are people are re re proven work reconnecting with the fact that for all of what goes on on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and all this b******* the truth is people people like and have the appetite for and their brains enjoy longer form conversations and longer form stories more than than it was assumed they did you know what I mean and like popular culture feeds us a lot of like fast food and Xanax in like a speedball of of you can't handle anything you don't want anything more than then literally like a little bit of junk food what is Xanax cuz you just want to lay on your couch and watch someone else save the world that's I know that's all you want but that isn't that is not true and I think like you know you look at things like like from peaky blinders to Chernobyl to like the Ken Burns Civil War series like we're going through this thing where people are realizing like no that's not actually true people actually like you my child acts you know Shepherd who's got a great radio show people like listen to people have actual conversations listening and it's a new way of ingesting entertainment like you're getting it in your car you getting it in your ears when you're out at the gym yet while you're on the subway or bus or plane and it's you're getting the stimulating long-form conversations that maybe maybe people didn't even know they wanted to know read write and and and Stern definitely was like what we talked about before and after like I said there was talk radio but that but it kind of starts there I think I think you you started to be like I can listen this guy for a long time he broke through the membrane sounds he he broke through the membrane of talk radio and what he's doing now is well. Lisa man in his 60s who's extremely wealthy and he has some I'm sure regrets as you were talking about the things that he's done the past and said in the past and it's also like this is who he is now he's not going to pretend that he's just wants to bring strippers in and have them ride the city and every day and when people get upset that he's change well I hope you change to man I hope everybody I'm going to be where I am yes and and you got to deal with it that's positive I think it's definitely better than leaning into it being what people want you to be struggling with that and tortured by that most of the most of people who I think that mostly ends up badly yes yes learning and having these epiphanies in these realizations about yourself and where you fit into your own life and how you interact with people in your life you're not making adjustments and you're only doing it that way because you think that's what people expect of you will your your prisoner to your own first Incarnation you know the first thing that people saw and that was Kenneth has that kind of a prisoner to that forever yeah and acknowledged it yeah I know it's why it's why anybody who even act to anybody anybody who who who keeps doing interesting things through phases that is even more impressive</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think people don't realize that a lot of a lot of stress a lot of aggression aggression actually is like paired with stress usually you know what I mean you to eat it's hard to be aggressive super aggressive without a little bit of like adrenaline pumping and stress all these things in the truth is like there's so much of the training it if you're actually training stuff what you're training yourself to do is be calm. like totally counterintuitive because people think know you got to go in there like Rocky and you know what a win and it's like well in a fighting config in in a competition sure on some level but really really really great people kind of in any sport but it's even more counterintuitive infighting is is they if you need to cultivate calm and the ability to to to be clinical and think calmly control your breathing because like you get exhausted if you can't control your and and the truth is is that those are life skills that are actually very they they cultivate a very calm it helps you cultivate common life and the thing I always really liked about Aikido is that there aren't attacks in it it it it it was developed by a guy more how you Sheba who was a he was an all-around Fujitsu Master he was like in Jiu-Jitsu Kendo karate all these things and he he developed Aikido because he had joined the global pacifist movement he he he was like a one of the most respected like cross form Japanese martial artists and he became he joined the same movement for pacifism that Gandhi was apart of in like the twenties and he he believed that martial arts could contribute to civism if they refined and he and Aikido was a refinement of Kendo Jiu-Jitsu Judo and and he basically said I'm going to develop a few non-aggressive martial art that has all it has no attacks and there's a new K in it like for the the thing but it's only a defensive and it's like that that phrase we all here redirection of energy the conversion of negative energy into into neutral that's like the that's his that is his contribution he was like you can take you can take the most aggressive energy and you can neutralize and you can neutralize it very peacefully or you can neutralize it with a little more teeth and it depending on how aggressive the persons being but I love that I thought that was amazing because it was like I wasn't like looking to being fight but I love the idea that you had that you could have control and you could like neutralizing and I think I think there's something kind of amazing yoga with with meditation with all all things surfing I mean that's what surfing is like there's all this energy coming at you like and it's going to like put you into the rocks or rock you or flip you over hurt you and you but you you don't you don't let that happen you kind of you look at it you look in a million waves you figure out how to move yourself you get in there and you get the exact opposite of getting torch to get like the best thing ever right and I think things like that where you have to those are like then you know what I mean and I think she's like Jiu-Jitsu what really what you're saying is really ultimately like why he was great as he had he had he had like the deepest then of anybody in the whole thing cuz he was the calmest and he had like the micro micro micro micro understanding of forms but really like it's something deeper it's like he is it's like Neo in The Matrix he's like seeing it with more granularity and he had like the micro micro micro micro understanding of forms but really like it's something deeper it's like he it is it's like Neo in The Matrix he's like seeing it with more granularity</div>

Doing that but I'm glad I did it man did not reach him House of art has already been interested people so when people want to keep getting these pieces of you how can you give it to you like to talk about the quote right from the bottom of Gina that's crazy s*** yeah that's a fascinating book man there's all sorts of Illusions to like UFOs and s*** the bhagavad-gita talk about wow what the Mahabharata was in the longer version which is one of the longest longest is Indiana a silent that ancient civilization was measuring they called coppers every 35,000 years you know and it was saying you know Sugar Hill I'm too busy to do one more thing and I like rap but I don't like to do it but I would love it but I'm not going to how many of them tried you got two things must be millions and millions of the tried it but a small handful of guys well and all. 50 million blacks try this is so so if the ratio right anymore make sense does energy hip-hop hits of pure American Christian culture you know what Coco's brother you got Charlie Chase right so you got the Spanish Brothers there within our first hip-hop songs that we love you know LL Cool J Rock The Bells produced that Rick Rubin from a culture that whereas of course it's is a dominantly a black expression right dominated the culture but it took angles from every other part of New York Tim to make it exists and that means it took my Spanish brothers and their culture and took out white brothers and their culture to all foreman and then across from Wu-Tang chamber what the Asian culture so we should be proud and know that it's is that it you know that it is it's like an exclusive American Artful he bought two mixing more Styles together you know cheap condo is means the way of the intercepting fist or also the way of he could bind boxing with fencing with with with Wing Chun is that same but you do have to the soul of James Brown The Jazz of the loneliest Monk The Rock beat a Billy Squier I got a big beat or Honky Tonk Woman by Rolling Stones it was a break beast but you also got the Latin feeling of the Mambo Kings and songs like a pachy in the Mexican do you think Hip-hop is evolving and not just cuz is it evolving innocence of the creativity of it I think marblemount people have found a way to make money off of something that people may not agree with there's like hot but do you think Hip-hop is evolving yes and it always involves right so it's part of the evolution with seeing now is whereas we and modulation we've relied on music that was created before us because we went to we came into town with it took music programs out of school but I so you didn't learn how to play a guitar piano music equipment or your instrument became your turn to it became your drum machine eventually became our sampler and then we sampled a lot of songs a lot of breaks from old records that already existed right but this generation right they're not actually forced the sample they asked me could take their cheat board their drum machine that laptop and just create and on her phone to write historical reference to a James Brown this that's that's just if that kid who was he there fruity loops and threw some chords progressions together or whether he sat there on his GarageBand on his phone and and and hit the guitar program that comes with her or whatever the creativity of it is now having this form of originality right is evolution Loosely because when I think about the cold Crush brothers and the force MD's they did this anyway the beginning but hip-hop has become more melodic now than it did in the 90s in the early 2000s right so what I mean by that you know what happens now you know you know it always all Champion right has the reggae chant vibe to it when we was doing it the Snoop Lion was really successful and Snoop Lion thing didn't wasn't that successful but the one he won the out gospel out I think he was getting Awards and nominated and like and stayed on top of billboard for a while and now Kanye</div>

repeat it again cuz they said no he's too young you can't be doing that but thing is I wasn't the smartest in my class of the bunch in Nigeria Nigeria they had a test like in early workout something on one of the first week of school Wednesday times table and I need the song in my head what is like finish Miss in all the kids like to ride on Lyons I didn't know I do understand I just felt like

		<div class="paragraph"> last time you were here you would not have the interim nor the Undisputed now you got it all have a double interim champ I don't know but never came and within 3 days I was like I feel like I just defended a belt cuz technically I was a champ is wrong I was a chant Minnifield beat me here to go one of those rubies you put on this so I'm looking for my Ruby as well to get a ruby yeah like I said that you don't get you don't have to get a new belt anymore so what they do is they do send this off actually yeah dude I used to not like this belt now I like it better be like maybe two days after I won't complain about it and I looked at it and I when I first saw it was at the p i and I was like you know what the f*** with it yeah but you just like nostalgic purposes and just cuz you know I've been a fan I should have got one of those I came at the the end of it totally still walking around 1 then don't get attached to these things may I flex with them for a little bit you don't even my my last after after Atlanta my coach he was kind of worried cuz I was going to Nigeria going all these shows I got to like show it up Flex it but he's my coach so you didn't like then you don't think you're the champion from like I'm the champ but then there was a point Jim's lights can I put in this box with everything else and then he kind of posted about it cuz he saw like a the switch happened like it's game time now the same thing I'm doing my chores right now Victory to a walk around all this s*** but then even at the fight last week I go fomo cuz you know after the fight by out you and I see what's up people talking about me right around so I'm like me I got to get back to the gym so when I get back I don't even look at this thing that's interesting so you're aware that you could get to into the moment too wrapped up in the fact that you won the title and maybe slack off little or maybe take yourself too seriously I could buy me a lot of people this is a goal they like I want to become the UFC champion they get it done and then what happens after the next fight they lose it or they lose track of what really matters so some guys like Kobe for example he's walking around with the belt and what's going to happen you going to walk around with that Bill how you going to feel and I don't know how much Kobe wants people talking about this but I'm going to I'm going to spill it as much as I can't who wants an act man strong suit he wears that Maga hat he's got the old belt you know it's not a legit belt right but he did win the interim title NATO it from them for no reason to make any sense so this is something about him where people somehow another think maybe he's illegitimate maybe not real then he f**** rob you all around it was off the chart he's tough as nails get the fence he was right there slipping and ripping things you know everyone has holes in the game I have holes in my game but he was really impressive the way he was right there in his face and Robbie Lawler who will slip and then blast someone unconscious with one shot he's a volume guy and he's throwing 60% and 60% meltaway Champion men use a legit top of the food chain motherfuker and he was looking for those openings that would never there who's always looking for Kobe to slow down Kobe never slow down was waiting you was dating life is waiting waiting and he was just like buying us time by the time subtle thing to Step One to that's it I can see it when he would like bounce bounce or I'm ready to go you shift you disrupt the pattern okay reset reset about that tack you know he's going to bounce bounce bounce bounce blessed and not being a specialist and obviously you have a full game you does know where you get to where you are without a full game but you work you are an elite Striker thank you and with that that's an advantage you are a step ahead of everybody supplement before the Press before the fight the press conference when he was talking to a candle on Bullard and stuff like that and I was like what he's acting out of character before he put this meme upright and if people thought I was affected by the meeting but all the all that showed me was like you never talk s*** or poke fun at anyone you fight him and somehow suddenly you're poking fun at me that's showing your first card show you firsthand and a lot of things you did throughout the back back I was like your show me your hand your acting out of character said the same thing just do what got you to the dance don't try and talk s*** with a guy who knows how to talk so I know he no got to talk to his friend that s*** like that but not with me the internet kid looks different to make music games me other me Majesty but like yeah so I know when it cut when it came to the cage you know what you saw me when I walked up I Stomp the Yard Stomp the Yard now. I had to the cage and when he came in I could feel that he was and he took about a minute before you look me in the eyes I was looking at the whole time and you like a cat or even a chicken get when your chickens corner it like a rooster it's dangerous when you Corner any kind of be still at the attack you at any point so I can see him pacing back and forth like a caged animal in the whole time like he was a hunter he was a hunter and I was I was I was a hundred so I was watching him and I can feel it like not really about that and he's trying to hide himself and when I went in my stance like this is something I was doing during sparring like they're my my training camp so I was just triggering this this is my muscle memory in my head and I was just having fun disappoint I looked at him a kind of small like f*** you I got this and I just knew from that point then I was under the in the first round I thought I lost the first round without the knockdown just like I let him have it but then I watch the back I threw less strikes I landed more he threw more Streisand on the list all I was doing was just me and you can talk about this like that the first round after the fight let's see what he does just get all of the text draw making sure his and make him draw draw draw the tax out of him and I did that and after I watched it again I'll let ya without the North and I still have the round performance and the knockdown at the end of the first round was essentially the end of the fight before the second round he stood up and when Calvin rock me after I go rock my first time being rocked in the UFC in the second run I was it before the second was a tireless let's go to step it up he was looking at the screen Robert was looking at screen like what hit me or hit me and I was like hey hey that's in the past that's done focus on me right now anyway Undisputed champ I felt like just my title defense want to see Atlanta Atlanta was the one where they put my hand up and I felt like yes so hard yeah I think of the way the fight when the back and forth and then me that that fifth-round like I I found out who I was after that my bad after from the depths I'm willing to go so when I put my hand up and you know you'll beat up and all that kind of stuff just in case I never had a belt before I've never had it wrapped around my as I visualize it so when that happened boom I felt like yes and also I was looking to buy please George's don't screw me over don't follow me over on this man and I knew I had it but you know you never know exactly cuz I didn't kickboxing cuz I was undefeated for so long so it was always alright cool what's next to fight maybe 1:30 I was next do I have to like chill relax look at the tape look at what you've done and it's so cute and smell the roses for a little bit and then move on cuz once I have my first loss I took winning for granted cuz it was just a habit of those winning always winning always winning so now I feel like when you win when you do something amazing like I didn't Atlanta like I did in Melbourne it's chill smell the roses and then move forward and then move on cuz once I have my first loss I took winning for granted cuz it was just a habit all those winning always winning always winning so now I feel like when you win when you do something amazing like I didn't Atlanta like I did in Melbourne it's chill smell the roses and then move forward</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> okay I did that the last movie Chris Farley ever did was dirty work and after work right before he passed away he hosted Saturday life so Norwich balloon weekend update on North Korea come to the party after the show warmest welcome to somebody and I sat watching Chris Farley disappeared bathroom what's going on with Chris I go bad news bro because what I got you want to go bathroom with Andy Dick I said there's only two reasons a man goes into a bathroom with anything and neither one of them is good Ho Lee fuk I hope he's high I've never seen a man look more unhealthy I was there that's where I'm at Peter Jackson we actually at he sat next to me it is screaming and we became friends and and he had his movie brain-dead if you ever seen that Delight Hammer movies and Stuart Freeborn was there ever sit in this thing and there's a big kind of goofy kid walking around yelling and I thought he was just like a fan so I said come on over and sit down in the scene where they're torturing the cop it's funny people think I like gory gory stuff and you know it cuz I've done it and but real stuff in if it's really intensely done on a film like that was a man that he's going to let this guy I like this guy and fire on plane I said I can't I don't want to see this I left and so did Wes Craven I met this prostitute in Lake Tahoe she should come to my show and she was like you know in Nevada it's it's all legal and so she I go what's the weirdest client that you ever had and she goes well I don't know if you're ready for this but I met this guy and he would he lives in Colorado and he had been in in Nevada leichter said she said she's up for anything send a jet to take her to Colorado they go to Denver to some 5-star hotel come up to the suite presidential suite they come in she's like I've no idea what this is about and he goes now this is going to be weird but it's not going to hurt you Just Go With It of hamburger meat uncooked just hamburger me tips the guy leaves and he says what I want you to do is to meet I'm going to get naked and you're going to take handfuls of it and shove it up my ass hamburger meat and he just stood there and she kept stuffing it up stepping up no erection no sex no touching her and then back on the jet back to Nevada so he's a wealthy guy like if you said Would You Bet Your Life that there's a guy out there that sent a private jet to get a prostitute and take her to a nice restaurant and then paid her to stuff hamburger meat up his ass if you're wrong you die yeah I believe it and that's the funny thing is like I don't get the sense this guy is on a chat room talking to other guys to stuff ground beef up their asses this is his thing that his mind just goes to places and he can indulge it he can just go yeah I'll try that and the biggest problem is actually not even the fentanyl itself it's the fentanyl precursors and you know what those are chemicals that are used to make fentanyl and so that was sort of the main investigation in my book like almost like 80 pages of the book are dedicated to this one company they're called you on Chong the Chinese company that makes more fentanyl precursors than any company in the world you know they are they they're legit in and not only that they sell them to the Mexican cartels and totally sanction not only sanctioned by the Chinese government but they get tax breaks from the Chinese government they get subsidies they get their land subsidized their staff training things like that and I was sort of the most jaw-dropping Revelation that I had was that the Chinese government is not only failing to Crackdown but they're encouraging this industry encouraging the ideas look it's making a lot of money let's just keep making money yeah it's a lot of people ask me if they think this is a blatant conspiracy to to try to like inflict harm upon the US a subversive form of warfare and so I think it didn't start out that way I think that these these benefits were given so that China could increase its exports to grow its economy particularly when the chemical exports so that's why these tax credit stars are called value-added tax rebates and so what that means is any chemical that you use to any ingredients used to make a chemical 4X board you can write off the cost of those of those ingredients when you export it so basically it's like a 16% tax rebate and so they originally yeah just to try to like improve their economy improved their exports but what's crazy to me now is that last year in the middle of the trade War this was at the height of when you heard about the trade War everyday you know Trump was Raising tariffs and doing this and that right at the height of that China increase the tax rebate for fentanyl from 9% to 10% so it was almost like a seems like a thumb in the eye sufentanil it's I don't know it seems like a big talk to you New York state democratic party there's always been all kinds of issues so I bet I met with a whole bunch of really smart people about running for New York 17 which is the district that I live in like the day after I lost my gig at serious the woman had been representing that district for 33 years now since she was retiring and I was like well I got I got nothing going on and I've always thought about running for office and let me give you no seriously consider I reach out to a whole bunch of people from all different walks of life Congressman that were in office that have been out of office campaign coordinators talk to Chris Cuomo I thought the whole bunch of people but this one person told me that if you want if you want to win regardless of your party affiliation you have to there's a certain special interest group that you had to promise you wouldn't interfere with and make they got an envelope of cash and I'm like well I'm not doing that I will tell everybody and everywhere I go about that what is it I can't because I don't have a second source so I wouldn't say it but I'm trying to get one what does it rhyme with the special interest group maybe the private sector right but would be like what would be opposed to being with you interfering with the way that they run they're like what what group that we know would be opposed I could tell you it could be a religious group a private sector a union or accompany you know of corporate interest it could be any one of the value of the point is all of those types of organizations pressure that you have to I'm an honest guy can't I can't lie I've never said anything until microphone that I don't I don't believe and that's been both of my detriment and to my benefit I think I'm authentic so when I was talking about running for office my brothers like you I can't you can't you can't be dishonest to people how are you going to do that you'll have to sell out at least a little bit that was ever thing and then I realized I'm not sure that this District or either but I think I'm authentic so when we talked about running for office my brothers like you guys can't you can't why you can't be dishonest to people how are you going to do that you'll have to sell out at least a little bit that was ever thing and then I realized I'm not sure that this District or you know the country's ready for someone like me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the maze that you and you don't have to love other people can sustain like to our conversation I love that you can do it to never allowed to those rules were always like we're almost out of time who's going to run the Free World and you have to stop because there's a Palmolive commercial this Palmolive Eva thing for I'm such an old man pulling out f****** Palmolive reference Anderson here and you get to talk to him look at real human vs human being who cares about people and you have a different perspective on what these people are saying you or your idea of democratic socialism is not this wacky socialism occupied and it's not this thing where people think you just going to steal money from hardworking folks and give it to lazy people that's the worst-case you know what's in Arabic thoughtful person and I was talking to his cuz I told you I'm thinking very seriously now but also running for congress and I was talking to his Deputy Chief of Staff anybody Raven off great guy and I was I was telling those doing your show and he told me that after Bernie Sanders did your show he everybody was recognized and I'm like really like he reached a whole different demographic talking to you than he ever had before cuz he's mostly on those cable news shows mostly on terrestrial or radio but when you do these would even call this now is non-traditional alternative media might as well be mainstream but the point is when you have a long conversation with Bernie Sanders and he's not like up there is is annoying you heard a real conversation with you and like what is annoying to people and want to think it's annoying to people is that f****** rapid fire not give up all these cable news interviewers and network it like they always want to get some headline that's nothing you know about corporate Me U2 they want you so I've been in that belly of that Beast Joe for the last 15 years corporate political media and it's so manufactured tell you so many stories they call you up and they say you know how do you feel about anything you want to make sure that you're a completely the opposite of the other panelists that you have a really robust argument and it's like not everything is binary most things aren't there's a ton don't have to hate each other than that that's how they get ratings that's how they sell advertising I play most of the problems in our country on corporate media terrestrial radio just doing that format all day it works really well for conservatives not as well for liberals but it still works and they sell at and if a few people make a lot of money but the country suffers this idea that were so divided is such bull s*** I talk to people from all over the country travel all over play Psy understand the issues really intimately and I don't care what you think about anything there's something you have to offer me there's something you have to make my life to enrich me I don't care what you believe in abortion or guns or certain text because if you could teach me how to fix this engine I'm into it I'm online all that exercise better but you don't like our trade policies policies let's just talk about it and it's is what we should all be trying to do everyday we should do what what happened to you that made you think this way what is the experience what is your journey to me that's the fascinating s*** about human beings were one of things about something like cable talk shows or you know new shows or any of these political Arenas is that there's a lack of real interaction with the general public in terms of like real real conversations with people Yuri of a host is wearing makeup was got spot lights on them and a microphone in front of him and he's talking to his other people in those cameras pointed at them and no one really feels like this is this is not a nut or a but it's not a normal way of people talk now nobody talks like that rarely you see someone sit down and they like every now and then they have those shows were like it's a one-on-one like Trump will sit across from f****** what's his name was that dude's name which network it's a fox Handley them together. Dobbs is lost his mind he's just used to be on with North Korean situation State me to every night it doesn't matter you know he shall not be questioned kind of guy worship the president but what are you doing that's not even put but that's the what's got into this long drawn-out argument with Chris Cuomo why I like a lot but I was talking about you know this Samantha difference between TV and radio it's simple radio and you got a long for give a 20-minute to to our conversation and it's real and get a lot done on TV you can have a 5-minute conversation that you have on your show that I have on my show that's if they're way more ability be thoughtful and do on stage points they can't do that now you know he's doing so good for him that's what I was getting at is that this separation between the people and then the just unnatural environment that they're in no one can relate to it but they can relate to is to be able to talk to each other they can't relate to it Joe but they also think because their condition to that if it's on a network this person must be an authority must be intelligent but I'm here to tell everybody I was talking about credit default swaps in the financial industry associate's degree and came up in New York City comedy clubs like I really don't have any business talking about that but the thing is I could sound really smart for 3 and 1/2 minutes on anyting give me a minute five I can't go that deep on certain issues and I shouldn't be an authority on it but just because I'm on cable news with a a jacket and a shirt and I'm this guy people like okay well I believe this guy know it's not real exist in the same shorter than that yeah and then the whole also the interjection of commercials every 7 Minutes the things they're doing on debates the same thing they're doing on these other cable talk shows where they tryna encapsulate these things these very quick 5-minute sound bites and have you ever heard of Intelligence Squared debates yes my friend John Donovan is a moderator he should be moderate in the presidential debates he's the greatest guy they have these really well-informed panelists to have a motion and they do like 2 hours and they do like 2 hours and you can come in thinking so often one idea about the issue and you leave thinking something completely different because you have these very smart people debated with an excellent moderator doesn't let any b******* and you really learn a lot no commercial breaks</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> 3 people is too many people probably it's like if you want to get to know someone that's a one-on-one because even with three people your moments we have something to say and then someone interject something else and then you lose your point and then you don't express it and then the other person is talking and you don't know when to talk and then you find yourself being a little bit more assertive in the way you're talking to me and one person just oh yeah it's f****** chiming in and screaming out loud to talk over people and but they're also talking about because I had one foot in cable news for long-time still do I mean I still go on and then I had my long form radio show where I was talk to policy experts it was very like the type like right now and they're talking about the polls for the presidential race is anybody that's paying attention that is wasting their time it's a complete waste of time to talk about who's leading Paul a year away it's a year why you got a tablet attack you get up here like it for a game it's not a game okay but his game if you're watching basketball do not pay attention to the first minute of the game cuz it doesn't really matter what's really important is how many points are scored over the four quarters is there 4 quarters I think I might be to have called him but the point is it's this is a weird game going on the Kamala Harris is fun for people this is what it is I don't I know it's serious I know it's significant I know this grave consequences to picking the wrong leader but this is a game right but it's a b******* game cuz you said really are the reason why Kamala Harris or anybody else takes a step backwards it because one stupid moment and how we possibly taking there on the young one I hate that crashed him well given everything that's easily candidates have done and said yeah but honestly there's probably something else it's how he responded to that as well as like he showed a lack of humility understanding of what it was like yeah it sounds stupid and they don't seem to have an understanding of the idea of ego and what it means and how they should try to separate from it while using it like once you get into politics much less entertainment and you get really well-known if baby you start believing things about yourself that aren't even remotely true they're not a true. I'm completely turned off by I mean it's hard to think about like I was seriously considering running for congress cuz we're or alright it's hard right now because I learned some crazy s*** first of all the corruption levels of corruption but the New York state democratic party there's always been all kinds of issues so I bet I met with a whole bunch of really smart people about running for New York 17 which is the district that I live in like the day after I lost my diggit serious that woman had been representing that district for 33 years now since she was retiring and I was like well I got I got nothing going on and I've always thought about running for office and let me you know seriously consider it the whole bunch of people from all different walks of life Congressman that were in office that have been out-of-office campaign coordinators. To Chris Cuomo I thought the whole bunch of people but this one person told me that if you want if you want to win but regardless of your party affiliation you have to there's a certain special interest group that you had to promise you wouldn't interfere with and make sure they got an envelope of cash and I'm like well I'm not I will tell everybody and everywhere I go about that what is it I can't because I don't have a second source so I wouldn't say it but I'm trying to get one what does it rhyme with the special interest group maybe the private sector what will it be like when they're opposed to what it be that they're posted you interfering with you interfering with the way that they run their what what what group that we know would be opposed I could tell you it could be a religious group a private sector a union or accompany you know corporate interest it could be any one of the hell you to point out the point is that all of those types of organizations that you have to I'm an honest guy can't I can't lie I've never said anything until microphone that I don't I don't believe and that's been both of my detriment and to my benefit I think I'm authentic so when we talked about running for office my brothers like you guys can't you can't why you can't be dishonest people how are you going to do that you'll have to sell out at least a little bit that was everything and then I realized I'm not sure that this District or either of the countries ready for someone like me I'm a comic I said a billion things TV stand with microphone and on stage and we are in a humorless country right now number one I smoked pot like are they ready for for the are we there yet I don't think we're humans or disagree I think there's a lot of criticism going on but that's cuz there's a lot of money do you think overall but I mean for politicians for me to run for office and you see some stand-up that I did of him and then my phone is playing at out of contacts to I got five words for you grab them by p**** as the president I think he is an aberration I've do I don't think of anything else that can get away with that kind of stuff I think you probably right it's definitely an operation but Frank and one is the center of the comedian but he was a writer like there wasn't a ton and he got in trouble when there was a photo of him I'd say it's more than a photo there was actual so that's the point that photo was harmless but it looked bad just like any joke I said anything that I said out of context so I just feel like and then I thought that they could destroy me and any future earning potential that I could have I just the second episode of my podcast every Tim Ryan you know he is running for president because I was asking what is it take and it's for sure you got to run you haven't raised $1000000 from people and individuals you don't like you don't want to be affiliated with but you have to you got to make compromises that the whole system is so filled with corrupted with money and almost every District in every state regardless of the office and how do you how does a person I'm a fairly affluent guy I'm up whitestrake I whatever but I couldn't if I don't know how I can afford to apply for a job for a year and pay my mortgage so I want to do it if it looks feasible if I don't take care of my family my parents no pay my bills but it's you have to be an independently wealthy person which sucks because Wreck-It makes it much harder for regular people there's plenty of exceptions to run for your office now when you say that you had to give them an envelope and that you had to what did you have to do to Jeff to support them intermediaries you have to say basically you have to basically say I'm not going to interfere with your business we'll just look the other way to say that that's what I'm told that was what I was told by Chiron how are you told this so you told this like hey if you ever want to be Congressman you have to do this without in-app do but if but if you would want to win its you're far more likely to win if you if you please play it's not impossible but they'll try to destroy you if you don't really know if it's just me possibly true I need another source I try to act like a journalist and someone who's the intermediary like what kind of person is this and he managed campaigns in that District he knows everything about the politics of in the special intro in that District potentially be that he's holding you out absolutely would you I won't tell you because it wants he's saying that so that he's he's like sort of playing both sides and he wants but he might also want to maintain his relation possible so he says I've got insurance now in this guy I don't think he is affiliate with that group but it's possible and and so I try to put you don't have journalistic ethics before I would say something I'll tell you off the mic but I but I wouldn't but I wouldn't say without having a Second Source if that's what they responsible about so much of our media when Trump or anybody says fake news it's like listen it's not you can't if you have to have two sources you go to your editor with those two sources in you can print it you can't make them up if you make up a source you're you're you're like Mencia that's it you're done you can't that's like stealing a joke you can't make up a source you'll never work again it would be a second season to worse when you make up a joke I mean if you make up a source I mean at work when she is still working in the few in a few instances where someone did make up a source or even plagiarize that which of the two worst things you can do with drama say never work again when they don't work for a very long time ago Johann Hari on my show he was accused of plagiarism it took him a really long time to to win his Integrity back I didn't find that out until after you've been on the end of a second time and and that kind of thing to point is that kind of thing ruins you and so I wouldn't come here and do that even though I don't I wouldn't call myself a journalist but I would want because what you're saying cuz you're smart I'm very skeptical to a people and their source and what their interests are in a lot of people really want me to run for Congress for a lot of different reasons but mainly cuz they think I can tap my network of wealthy people and you know they make money love Trump hate Trump that is precisely what he was talking about drain the swamp now this is the swamp this sort of this sort of convoluted world of influence the swamp also money and all the other things that he didn't drain the actually brought in people that were he made the swamp swamp your way it's filled with malaria and crocodiles like like I always we don't even Define things unfortunately on the same Base Line on porcelain this country what words mean but I've always thought what that meant was governor corruption that the private sector is influencing government be cut in in the way that they obviously do at the system that we have is you have to get money from wealthy people and Wealthy interests and then you have to advocate for them whatever the interest is you have to or they won't give you more money and so that's what's beautiful about Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders they are not allowing any donations from any super Pacs from any wealthy individuals it's it's Grassroots and that'll she's doing as well super Pacs from any wealthy individuals it's it's Grassroots and that'll she's doing that as well committed to it but if Biden was doing it I don't think he remembers I totally agree with that by the way</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> everybody. Has as these I don't want to hear that I want to shut down speech I don't like the people that are really consistent but I like to think I am but only social media companies have the power to decide whether or not gets expressed when they're not a person gets to express themselves to an unlimited amount of people I said interesting if you tell them that based on your ideology with most people don't agree with your ideology they have said something that merits you take away their building Express themselves then I think you open up a real discussion like the Second Amendment discussion among the first amendment the what are we doing here what is this and what is free speech and is this a town hall and Jack Dorsey from Twitter believes Town Hall he thinks everyone should have the ability Express himself but that like everything else f****** complicated and who I used to be something at the ACLU wrote a book about speech in about how in Germany you're not allowed to fly the swastika and that's censorship on speech and that is not effective for any of the outcomes that isn't for you also make a lot of s*** p*** is that right German the German said I don't think I know any names but for whatever reason a lot of such a thing s*** p*** not a thing is I try to be very open-minded but I don't I don't understand I'm not going to be enough to understand why don't some people you allow people to do it right I would never allow people to think about of course yeah that's a weird one right my instant reaction is what went on what's that about I want that scrap how do you get to to that sounds very abusive and it sounds more like it's it's a tough Tin Top of the but now at the idea of censoring speech backfires it's just not healthy but I think people should be generally sensitive and not assholes at the same time it's also about someone saying something in print that you read on Twitter it's like you can standing back to you make that I give your own comment but you're you like f*** this is such a shity way to talk poison or interesting as you evolve on it just decided it's not like these arguments or not they make you a riled-up they're not healthy than not there they don't they're not about my daughter hold on I'm already set it out loud and I was like oh I'm the shittiest that's the shity thing that I could be doing I just think right now so was unmanageable when you get to a certain number of followers I just can't I have just there's no way you can and it's also people just like they're f****** in their cubicle they're just trying to get a rise out of people they're angry the shift their board you can't expect everybody to existing in the same vibration that you are up to it too late to say you're a pitiful person it doesn't it is fascinating that someone would write such a thing it is but not click on them and be like I want to steal is really is projecting and I'm worried about I wonder what happened to that guy over there but you look at their picture and then you decide everything about their life you ever look reason I can't run for Congress I think like I want to keep doing stand-up and I want to talk about things like you ever look at a guy with the guy running the car from yesterday LAX I thought about how much he jerks off for a little while I will sometimes look at my bike I bet that guy isn't good for him and whatever but that kind of annoyed brought that up I'll think about that now everything is brought up shooting in the mouth but the edges are watch the video once and Oliver experiences and when the first time I got deleted and what kind of she likes to go to follow when he shoots in her mouth and I'm like okay this is not pleasant I'm not enjoying this but honestly in this is like it's kind of a dumb thing to talk about right but here's why it's not even psychology person that was a baby don't like you then you know you've succeeded by the way to get a lot of money for it like Robert when was his name Robert Redford Indecent Proposal to be more slowly everyday as a clerk at Dunkin Donuts or one giant load on your chest that is like a really rough afternoon afternoon it's like an hour to shower up on me boys just became a millionaire guy just shooting you just your impending diarrhea I never told my dad this for how much money a million bucks what if he doesn't know I got that that's preposterous that's ridiculous you got a problem and then because not wouldn't do it he calls back and it goes he tells me who who names a guy in all the time you got it by fur coat and start balling either way what do you mean Purina for a million bucks that's free money don't get me wrong oh yeah well then whoever you want it exactly when your head take a big meeting meatball s*** exactly right in your f****** head to 3 million bucks got a bad memory of making out with Paul Sorvino</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and the justice system is obviously that's a really interesting things I found the constitutional laws a fascinating think of people studying this idea that we argue about the Second Amendment like let's let constitutional lawyers that thing discuss a lot of those things we should all understand that and be curious about it but I would our constitution is also silly like let's remake everything like let's have that conversation is so much better that we can do have a serious conversation with what kind of guns and bullets have not they can have more that they can't have like that's the conversation that's where we should be right now everything gets regulated everything there are trade-offs and Healthcare there are trade-offs and everything but Americans are so divided they want everything that they want that compromise is something that we don't do as Americans much less in in government that's just Preposterous the Democrats at the man Purity or or anybody that is doing that you don't agree with hold on that's not know of any relationships with people in your real life like that like my wife and I don't agree on a lot of stuff by love her is my door her those who talked about before they're on teams and you want your team to win so you state why it why you want anything about the thing is that even if you made guns illegal even if you said you can't have any bullets will you all go to jail if there's so many guns you're not getting them all it's not possible because the more guns and there are people which means there's more than 300 in what 30 million guns there are country alone that's absolutely the most important point in the discussion man but you don't really stop a behavior by someone might be a certain way and shoot people that's not going to necessarily change what you do is you do limit the access to a certain types of weapons rounds of ammunition right that's the number one president of lame like political but like there's no data on the video game argument that there's no doubt on that well the video game arguments interesting because I've had soldiers bring it up to me including Dakota Meyer yeah I heard that conversation will inhabit that mean I don't I don't think it necessarily makes sense that people would act out in a certain way that's horrific because of video game but if they were already inclined to violence to begin with maybe they already had a f****** short-circuit and then they desensitized to violence in movies and violence in video games does that have an impact on them I'm not the guy to answer that question whether or not has an impact on this variable it is variable that I think it's discussion I don't know if it truly is why I don't think it is because the higher rate in Japan and they don't have the gun violence we have that's a good point they were very different cultures all the way you don't have never actually guns that's true that they also have a lot of I get the I have nothing but respect for Community but I mean I don't know I don't think that there's much pasta conversation about access accessibility to guns that can fire many rounds that quickly killing that many people I don't think we have to get rid of those somehow but I agree how do you do it you have you heard that the most important 330 there's more guns in our people so what are you do so by the way I think you buy as many as you can back for sure you've been a whole bunch of taxpayer money just helped by the way there's a ton of people in a bind right now to have a life of like oh my God nothing to live for my insulin AK-47 to live another month you buy some guns back is a good expense your money and then melt them down and turn and to furniture for people so if you wanted to do that without changing the Second Amendment like you just have a a buyback where you just offer people the opportunity to make some money by giving their guns out why did the Second Amendment is been interpreted Wrong by the Supreme Court in my opinion it doesn't say the people should have until 2008 and say that nobody thought that the people should have personal right to guns till the helicase but I don't think you even need to talk about this I think just people just need to agree that these guns shouldn't be sold the ammunition to talk about the second amendment that means it's a big conversation anymore change the law because he knows that those gun laws in New York work really well by the way people always make the argument well they have those gun laws in Chicago Chicago Indiana doesn't have them nuns go across the border just fine that's the gun laws work they work will Chicago's also in the middle of a bitter drug war that's what you were talking about it like that drugs if there were legal you wouldn't have that sort of a drug war end so how do you think that the Supreme Court misinterpreted that that in the in the 2008 allocation everybody should just I would plug the work of Eric Siegel no regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed yeah those, as get argued by Constitution until 2008 that Americans had a right to have their own weapon that such a crazy statement when you read it it's so winter because you will we're going back in time trying to figure out how people in 1776 thought about guns and whether or not that applies to us because if it doesn't apply to us we have to think on 1789 if it doesn't apply to us we have to think well then who gets to decide like one of the reasons why side as a society on one of the reasons why we have for whatever reason when things get written written in stone or carved into a stoner written onto a document like the first amendment like the freedom of expression that is that we we have it so we all agree on it was what I want to change it free speech expression whenever we want to we want to hold onto that we want to keep sure I deserve a second amendment the right to have a gun close look at the commas and look at the word yet shall not be infringed upon what did they mean that he has fastening it is it is fast but I think that they didn't mean that job I think that it how could they they didn't the whole gun thing is a racket to make money that's what that is it's it's a way you sell fear like I mean home invasion is any family's worst fear but it doesn't happen very much nor does kidnapping Nordahl lot of these crimes at all helicopter Our Generation parents is helicopter parents terrified of everything not that's true that's not letting the kids go outside you're right come on you don't know anybody so we don't have to exist like everybody's going to kidnap your kid or everyone going to break in your home but I'm saying goes on the balance is that sometimes it's real that's why people want to be able to have guns because sometimes someone can break in your house and people have defended their house but and their property was done short but it's a is it a way he's in a realistic threat or is it something that the that the gun industry creating amazing ads and scares the s*** out of people comments crimes real somebody GunsAmerica is because there's so much money to be made off of them I think we can absolutely limit them and regulate them and have a thoughtful conversation most people or I don't know I hate that generalizations to something to that but is also something to the reason why we have somebody car people like we are killing ourselves while the cars the pollution is the table you can make them I think I would be fine if there by of a Chevy Volt since 2012 I've solar panels I'm trying to be the change you want to see in the world I found coming off as a complete hypocrite and all of it right mate and I do all kinds of things I think have a thoughtful conversation about guns and why they're each part of our culture and not another culture the way that other cultures and countries regulate their weapons that the problems that they have our problems about mental health but the problem with that conversation that people don't want to have is everything costs money that's why you have to pay taxes paying taxes the price of civilization but is up to with mental health you have to pay for people to help people from can't advocate in government Republican or Democrat for the this is what unfortunately Trump and Republicans is advocated let's get Mental Health Solutions to the violence let's do that Liberty behind that accept they cut the Obama Care program that funded mental health it's just you can't you have to spend the money providing mental health it is a problem it should be addressed but it's not the main issue is definitely the guns in the bulletin them will the main issue is the person is capable of shooting people with the guns the bullets now it's what I'm doing or inanimate objects without a person and not going to just shoot themselves the main problem is handled the main problem is someone willing to grab the gun and shoot people right we agreed we both agree there's problems with having now but don't you think the main problem is the person that actually shoots people think that in every other country in the world they don't have this problem cuz they don't have the gun that's my where I started and on the argument they might they might that might be the case that they don't have the guns but there are places that do have guns and they don't have a lot of mass shootings Canada's one of them right they do but they don't have AK-47 with unlimited rounds and I have the crazy to have more or less than guns are awesome I get it more or less limitations to what Firearms are allowed to have I believe they Canada I believe the Canada Canadian gun laws are far stronger or regulated just tried something some some really recently Trudeau announce something that was going to severely limit this is very recently really limit the type of firearms you can have including things that can have multiple rounds and Chambers and certain types of guns that use right now is hunting rifle since it was a big push back about that lets his readers always like the conversation about like like the the freedom like the 2nd Amendment to me is it just your interpretation it's so extreme it's really if you want to know the answer to healthcare's you should talk to Public Health experts they have those answers they have the research but what research in creating death by any measure accidental death certainly good for quite certain ammunition is destroying the inside of the the body and unsurvivable I think Public Health officials have argued certainly pediatricians all argue this idea that you can ask a parent if they have a gun in the house because the gun lobby is against that cuz they're building the conspiracy that the government is going to track your gun that's terrible your pediatrician has to ask you do you have a pool where you keep the poison where the guns is God forbid you. You're not responsible for had to get enough to know that that kid my taxes the gun that happens all the time there's a rule against that yeah Public Health officials and in doctors and Physicians are pretty much on the same case with this issue these guns and mental health I think I first and if there is I'm happy to be wrong about this or any dumb should I said what you're saying is that these Public Health officials would be able to make these guns less lethal by Banning certain types of ammunition cuz it's destroying people and checking see if the parents know if they have a gun or where the gun is or how it's treated how it's locked up like that they shouldn't mean to how do you feel like public officials Public Health officials have any impact on that but Public Health experts are you know their entire responsibility to keep people safe from Bryant sickness and death at all we killing each other with boats all-time about. Anybody a blunt but whatever it is I do understand the argument about ammunition but the point about that's why I brought it a public health experts will look at what is creating sickness or death car accidents what I'm saying to you is that I think it's disingenuous to say the public health officials have an answer to why we're having so much mass violence I don't think anybody has an answer I think we're terrified and I think we could say it's Nerf guns wouldn't be able to do it you're right I can say if we do these people weren't mentally handicapped or filled with a handicap melted mentally compromised filled with all kinds of demons all all kinds of different medications with their judge abuse in childhood there's a lot of factors or no one has any idea why someone who is abused and who's f*****-up is capable of making that leap we have some thought that's all we have some thoughts on it and we talked about it endlessly and yeah you're right if no one had a gun that there would be no issue with that you wouldn't be able to mass shoot people but would we still have f***** up people to lashing out trying to hurt people I thought you would always will but we have them is aligned month will help we have to think you should I think we should not only should we come workday's being mandatory I think we should help people I think they know they just an experiment Microsoft did in Japan in fact and they found that for our four-day Work Week rather increase productivity by 40% I think a lot of people I don't know maybe this is their culture May businesses with specific instance the type of people that would get a job at Microsoft but you know what what you're dealing with for most people is beating down shells that are tired by all that together 4-Hour Work week and any other type of benefits as civilized Nations around the world special in Scandinavia have studying that cultures really interesting what they do and and you realize that there's any number things that you can do to help people and how do you have to be able to fund those Solutions and people don't want to do it right people that pay more taxes but they also have a distrust in the way the government spends her money soap they don't trust the government to spend their money like if you work hard and you make x amount of dollars the government always at their argument but there's not a better way better way fine I give you that argument but there we have to come together as siding brake this is not where to spend my entire apartment on schools and so on</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> crazy because I remember hearing that as well like crack babies will think we're all worried about the 80s all my God wait till the year 2000 all these crack babies are 20 years old. Where are they now I'm definitely that's who I am yeah that's kind of Generation Nas Gangstar Gangstar course Biggie Tupac you know the classics you know I mean Big Daddy Kane I love EPMD I mean there's a couple errors in that I just lost it but that is Lyrica like Nas is my favorite event has his lyrics they're so intricate you know he's either way he words thing that you just go out back into the gun all the way through the entire story he starts at the end and then backs up the story. Some f****** Classics I think he's the best writer in all of hip hop music real Kool G Rap oh yeah I mean he's the original he's the best like some of the greats of all time people don't say Kool G Rap and listen to cock blocking that is one of the best so much of it Hill Street Blues like so intellectual so amazing wordplay gas but see when I came to La though everyone's like Tupac Tupac Tupac and I was like I don't get it man he's his flow is not that great you know I just don't get it but but the more I like listen to his lyrics the more I saw he was more than just a rapper he was like a cultural influence he was like a political leader to a lot of people and finally I'm like yes I get it he stood for something and now like I just don't hear biggie the same way you know cuz so many of his songs are about you no partying and crime and stuff in the bigger message of Tupac just really want me over and then well I don't think it's a competition but I know what you're saying I mean to Tupac definitely had a different Vision but biggie you also have to realize but he was like how old was he when he died Corner when he was like 16 17 years old rapping Dempsey that I think I have emojis at The Lumberjack stuff yet he's got a f****** I think you might even have a piece of paper in his hand or is like reading the wrap up while he's got it like in case he f**** up his forget it was so good even as a little kid there's a f****** kid mad that he was like as good as any rapper alive a plate for you after the podcast will play it and is his breath control in like that weight sometimes I feel like you got to be like that almost amazing singer or rapper will comedians to fat comedians like Patrice O'Neal wear the greatest of all time there was something about his Garth when he was on state highways like power and there was like this whole thing has Biggie yeah and just murdering it murdering it everybody around them everybody you know I saw this early Tupac videos and hurt early Tupac recordings and his original style influencer was actually Fresh Prince of Bel-Air background of the humpty hump dance Arsenio Hall I mean and when he was young which is really interesting in the interview I'm he was like he wasn't thugged-out at all like what is the son of two black panther do you know the politics what is that from solo debut wow yeah Digital Underground humpty hump when you write a song that's as profitable as it kind of like stops your needs to do too much else when you're that set they were so good they had great s*** when you write a song that's as profitable as the Humpty Dance I would imagine the kind of like stops your need to the do too much else when you're that set</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you stumble upon the story of fentanyl because where you at one point time can you write about rap music yeah I have a book about NWA and Tupac and I interviewed like Ice Cube dr. Dre Snoop Dogg all those people yeah but I was the LA weekly music editor and I started looking into this story about why people are always dying at Raves so like I don't know if you remember a few years back every time there was a rave there like one person died new people die and Outsiders from Ecstasy but I Knew by ecstasy was really not that dangerous of a drug you know MDMA pure MDMA very few people die from that so it's like what is going on here and I looked into it and turned out it was all adult rated it wasn't real XC wasn't real Molly it was a Dolce with all these new drugs and I kind of went down the rabbit hole and I found out that all these new drugs were made in China there all synthetic and are like hundreds of them and then it turns out that the most you know the worst of them was Fentanyl and that's how I got onto the topic and Fentanyl most people think of fentanyl they think of it as being a new thing but it's not really a new thing right was wasn't it it was invented in the 50s than morphine in hospitals work really good well it does but for things like yeah traditionally people have got a lot of mileage out of morphine but first things like open heart surgery do you want something that came on really fast and it lasted a long time and so he manipulated the chemical structure of morphine came up with fentanyl is a blockbuster drug you know and still is used in hospitals all the time it's used you know there's a fentanyl patch people with cancer back pain and then when you get like a colonoscopy they give you fentanyl before that and then women who have epidurals during childbirth that I believe is usually fentanyl so it's still an important Hospital drug and so how did it come to be that this drug for the 1950s short of re-emerges and they re-emerge during the rape scenes that we was it was actually before that it first start killing people little bit at the beginning of the 80s and nobody knew what it was it was from China then as well it was the kind of mystery, as these guys who there was this one guy in particular called George Marquardt and he was like a genius Maniac who read all the chemical literature he learned about fentanyl fentanyl he's like I should try to make this I bet it would be a hit with recreational users and so he started making it and it's dumped authorities because people who died they would have track marks and their arms like it was heroin they would have syringes but they tested them after his and there's no heroin their system and so they're like what is this and the only way they finally found out was that there was this scientist testing racing horses and apparently fentanyl was being used to dope horses so they would withstand more pain and would go longer and Chester and train harder yeah and so so this guy made the connection he's like all this is fentanyl this is this new thing and he actually predicted what was going to happen he's like we are in trouble now because not only is there fentanyl you can make a new if you ban fentanyl you can adjust the molecule make another type of Fentanyl and a band that can make another one ad infinitum basically the thing with horses would be that they would be in Ainsley wouldn't run is hard so they would force them to run harder by dulling the pain I guess so yeah I don't know all the details of it but you know it's performance-enhancing based counterintuitive you think they like an opiate we like make them sleepy right well I don't know how the internet comes along and through the internet people started scouring the medical literature and sign literature in chemical literature and then they find fentanyl exactly yeah because back in the old days you do you know scientist would publish a paper they're trying to find a new drug that they can Pat and say the drug is no hit no one wants to buy it it goes on some dusty University shells never has heard from again but in the internet age all these papers start going online and so these Rogue chemist that I reference until my book they start finding particular scientists who work on the type of drugs they're interested in and then they start going through all their papers and they pick out drugs that they think we work recreationally and so when fentanyl first came out it was totally legal people you could walk around with a giant bag of it they can do anything and so it's set in motion the start of cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and Drug cameras which really still for although mostly in China now have you ever experienced any opiates personally I've taken yeah like Tramadol in like Tylenol 3 and stuff like that I don't know 3 is opiates I think it's codeine which is right and I don't know I don't know what I mean didn't do what we've been over this have we didn't we try to figure this out I remember I took NyQuil in the 90s in the late nineties house sex like the last time I ever Target and it was wonderful how's line is that going this is amazing I don't give a s*** up I was just lying in bed well that's like the irony of the opioids it can produce the greatest pleasure and the greatest pain you know I think Sam Quinones said that like how can one molecule B give you the greatest pleasure imaginal and the worst pain imaginable yeah Lenny Bruce had some crazy quote about it something about getting a hug by God I forgot what it was but I've never had experience with Heroin but I knew I've known people that were addicts quite a few and couple of them the died and one of them that I knew there was this guy who was a pool Hustler back of my pool playing days in New York and his nickname is waterdog forget his real name if they was Bill but another was Buffalo Bills as other nickname first so like they would play games like $10,000 he's huge games and all these guys would come from the tri-state area they would come around to watch these matches in bed on the side and water dog would go to the bathroom and everybody knew what was going on he would go and shoot up and then would come and he would sit on a chair like this just sit there like half an hour to sit there while then when the half hours over who just sleep then we couldn't miss and he was playing this guy this dude that I knew named George was also a big-time Gambler and he was just screaming and yelling that this m*********** when he's on this Duffy can't mess he had no nerves like nothing bothered him you could scream his face would look at you like an alien like you didn't didn't bother him at all act like an insect would look at you and he had this inquiry all ability to play like at the very best while he was f***** up on heroin and I remember thinking what a bizarre drug and think about all the amazing artists claim go down the line all these different folks in that mugshot people prefer heroin or fentanyl like I've heard it described as more Soulful people say but the thing is you can't even get heroin in most parts of America like Pure Heroine a Morthal cut with fentanyl turn on the street like nice neighborhoods you'll see poppies all the time you just don't even know you're looking at him and that's actually heroin like you could get your own from those poppies yeah it's like if they grow organically and you're not doing it on purpose it's no big deal but if you start cultivating it that's when it becomes just got a place to live because I can't imagine there are a lot of trains police if know what to look for as I feel like if you're going to grow some Mezcal mescaline cacti or whatever your ass to move going to be alright people that party I know people that take pills and it seems like fentanyl is things are getting cut with fentanyl a lot it's not it's not an uncommon thing for all sorts of different drugs with how many different drugs are cut with fentanyl street drug that it is like an awful time to be a young person on the party scene they know they made it sound like every drug could kill you right now unfortunately that's like almost reality that basically any pill or any powder if you didn't get your pill from CVS you know your pain pill or from a pharmacy that's legit it could be cut with fentanyl and that's how Prince died that's how Tom Petty and the rapper Mac Miller all died is that they were thought they were taking legitimate pain pills happen that is really what happened to his from the the black market yeah well the guy who supplied Prince has been he refuses to release a exactly where he got it but he still alive the guy who got in for Prince yeah where is he I don't know I think in Minneapolis or so well the doctor is also or something I think the doctor might have been involved somehow he got these pills but you know Prince was like doing the splits on stage at age 58 or whatever and he was definitely a guy who walked around with a lot of pain he was Jehovah's Witness he was not a recreational drug user as we think about it you know he was he wanted pain and I'm sure for years his Handler whatever was buying them off the darknet or whatever and they were fine for years but then a drug dealer trying to save some money increase profits cut it with fentanyl that's that's hard. And I heard Tom Petty actually suffered an injury or hurt himself at one of his concerts and he just literally walked outside and asked like the first sketchy guy he saw if you had any pain pills and that's what killed him Jesus Christ at one of his concerts and he just literally walked outside and asked like the first sketchy guy he saw if he had any pain pills and that's what killed him Jesus Christ</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> well there are a lot of people that are growing marijuana that are using pesticides and chemicals that are dangerous and there was one was the company that got caught recently Jamie they they tested their stuff kushy punch dating people that caught too much fish thing and he thought hey what a great job disability I'm going to get in and get a job in The Great Outdoors I love the outdoors and you know I got to do some good for the Wildlife Well turns out along the way they started stumbling upon these public land Mexican cartel grow operations where they would grow these marijuana plants just giant plots of them and it would use these extremely toxic oh yeah and also they would use poison to keep animals out and they had Vasa - it laying around and some of the marijuana was actually infested with this s*** yeah my friend Amanda Chicago Lewis are marketed as like all natural but they find synthetic cannabinoids in them and basically you know synthetic cannabinoids like K2 and spice are what they're known as sometimes and those are the people called synthetic marijuana but the big difference is that THC is known as like a partial Agonist so it will like these receptors it will it will activate them to an extent you're chilled it's relaxed but the cannabinoids they also interact with the cannabinoid receptors same as THC but they're full Agonist and so they make you basically like go crazy and your heart starts beating fast you start people overdose and die on these these cannabinoids and they these are all made in China is the whole thing I like Rotom on the internet I made a fake email address and I said I'm a drug dealer I'd like to visit your lab may I do that when I come to China they said yeah yeah they said yeah come by and so so I went to Shanghai and I met this guy at the train station and he owns his own lab and he asked me if I was a journalist actually like pretty straightaways like he had like you live there with his wife and kid and brings a stranger to his home meets a guy says he's a drug dealer at the train station says hey they make legitimate chemicals and recreational chemicals and they specialize in drugs that are legal in China but banned in the west so bad in the US illegal in China we have this thing called the federal analog act and so that band all these drugs even before they're invented so anything that's similar to marijuana structurally or an affecting that's similar to opioids it just automatically band automatically schedule but in China they have to do it one by one by one by one and so fentanyl itself was scheduled in China was banned in China decades ago but these chemists pet like this when I met specialize in this window when something is banned in the US but it's still legal in China but it's become popularized on the internet so there's all these websites is web forums where these like drugnerds basically or like you can't get fentanyl but you can get this thing it's kind of like Fentanyl and hilarious they specialize in these new usually psychedelics they tend to prefer that have never been tested on human subjects but this guy was entirely specialized in Fentanyl analogues and synthetic cannabinoids and so he took out fake list on his website of all the legitimate like Cialis and the old legitimate Pharmaceuticals things like that but his apartment he showed me the real Liz and cuz you know it was cannabinoid Spinelli was like fake Valium like different types of Xanax and he showed me the prices and I was like all right looks good, I couldn't go see your lab and so finally he decided he trusted me he called up his driver on the phone and the driver showed up and he was kind of those big like muscular do to didn't speak any English and I was a little worried I was like oh this is the dude is going to break tcaps if when he finds out I'm a journalist you know but I just got in the car and we drove like 30 minutes to the outskirts of Shanghai and we got to the lab and it just looks like a regular Office Park like a Suburban Office Park there was a Fountain Inn in front of the building there was like you know use the key cards to get in the parking lot and then it looks like kind of a new construction building it smelled like cement we went inside we went up to the lab all the windows were open is the middle of the winter and it is kind of a strong chemical smell but it looked just like Breaking Bad like you know it's like industrial-sized glassware you know beakers Bunsen burners all that stuff from high school chemistry and he would points he points at like basically I had my recorder you know I my phone and I had it in my jacket pocket just on record and so he told me I couldn't take pictures and so to take notes I would just say stuff allowed I be like oh that's Orange has a light orange mixture that's being mixed up by mechanical arm and you say it's benzo fentanyl a very interesting and so but that the language very was such that he didn't think I was being too much of a weirdo vannoy's would it were crazy there was like a table like this like almost exactly the size that was piled up with the cannabinoids that were there for drying and it was their Mounds like this High just sitting right out in the open what they look like like Drive sage and stuff like that you know you can smoke that stuff out of a pipe or even rolled into a joint but it if you look closely though it's very clearly not pot until they're drying the stuff that's what I think that you know they also had like drying machines that look like manager didn't like it when I use this turned out you know when you go into Subway and there's the bread baking machines right there yeah it looked exactly like that why did he not like that term but but they had those and then they had like big buckets of one pound bags of these the cannabinoids in these fentanyl analogues just ready for shipping he said they were sending them to Russia to Belgium to the Netherlands and then I think a lot of times repackage there and so I don't know if you knew that the cannabinoids like used to be sold legally and head shops like even years ago Pop Rocks bracket spice and laugh out loud and stuff and so I think in Europe that's where they do that they put it in his colorful packaging and then they ship it to the US and but yeah he was saying that like he kept like really close track of the law and all these countries especially China like they're scheduling this next week so we're going to take all this and throw it away and I thought at first he was like pie just putting me out but I think they actually do that like these guys are businessmen first they want to make money and going to follow the law it just doesn't you know not conducive this is where bath salt came from yeah it's really popular in the Middle East it's like a it's a stimulant and get to really be Trident know I never have yeah but I grew up in Minnesota though and there's a big Somali population and so there's a big controversy in Minnesota whether or not to ban cat leaves from being sold in regular store is it legal I think it is I think it's not legal in the US and so the synthetic cathinones are those synthetic version of that like made in the lab but they're there any others tons of different kinds you don't know how strong it is and the bath salts they of course it has nothing to do with like salts for your bath you know this is a misnomer and they also wrote called them like incense sometimes plant food and on the back of all of them it would say not intended for human consumption so that was like the way they got around they thought they could get around the federal analog act because part of the law says that something is automatically illegal if it's intended for human consumption cannibal I think that yeah yeah and he was just crazy right I think he may have like smoke some weed but yeah I don't think he had anything else in his system it was just high on life there's all these people is going crazy that killed like I think maybe a hundred people in Florida during the time and the problem is you know like the prohibition on drugs causes people to do really stupid things right so you have this cathinone like Flocka and as bad as that was once they banned Flocka has started manipulating the chemical structure so they change one little thing they had like a chlorine group for example like a chlorine like molecule you know it has nothing to do with the drug but they just added on there to make it so it becomes legal but then it becomes more difficult for your body to like digest it so becomes worse for you and eye becomes worse and then they ban that and then they make something new that's even worse for you and it's just like down the line and pennies Chinese so that's where all these new drugs have in common make my book is about their called NPS novel psychoactive substances know fentanyl is the most famous and the most dangerous but these include basically like synthetic new versions of every drug so there is no marijuana the new Dan PS version is the synthetic cannabinoids heroin and PS version is fentanyl so you take LSD it's like right now thought they were a bird or whatever and jumped off a roof but no one has ever overdosed on the drug itself but but once they started Banning once they start really cracking down on LSD these Chinese, start manufacturing this new type of psychedelic that was sold as acid and so if you went on the darkweb this was like in like 10 years ago or so years ago you would search for acid and it you would think buying LSD but you're buying this new psychedelic I could kill you and did kill you these drugs are called and bombs like the worst name of all time and bomb drugs and they started killing people in like the suburbs in Dallas so these kids all. They just want to date they did the research he's really smart kids we said olsd is never kill anyone let's get that this new thing to kill them and so it wasn't really LSD it was just</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and you're right about the racism in terms of like the attitude about the crack vs cocaine and that could clearly be demonstrated by sentencing yeah people were sentenced the mandatory minimums for crack crack use yeah I was so much higher when people got caught with crack or selling crack mean they went to jail for a long f****** time where his people got caught with cocaine they didn't go to jail for as long and then the treatment do the the the sentence is much more and dr. Carl Hart you know yeah yeah he's Gray's Greatest while I'm heading on here and he was explaining cyclic there is no difference like it is cocaine made this is cocaine if you want to break it down to the drug effect on the body they have the same thing and one of them sends you away for a long time one of them does the welfare my book about West Coast hip-hop. Original gangsters I interviewed a Freeway Ricky Rogers Regional director of the real Rick Ross exactly and he sort of the innovation of their era was was called redi-rock and so before people would people preferred to smoke cocaine even before crack was invented is regularly called ruthless but they were going to call it Rock House Records you know fruit for that reason and so he was using crack dealer before I got in the music industry the Rick Ross story is the real Rick Ross directions say was making millions and millions of dollars did not have any idea that he was involved in that whole all of them knowing consciousness credible they were using the cocaine money to fund the war without this story is incredible because they send him away on the three strikes rule for life and then while he was in jail he learned how to read and how to understand the law and he started like literally taught himself to be a lawyer and then realize like know the way they use the law was incorrect and unlawful they they 3 Strikes means you get arrested for larceny you get out you get arrested for larceny so they gave him two charges at the same time and then put them in for three strikes and he was able to successfully proved that that was wrong that's why he's out right now wow he's one of the things he taught me that like maybe smoke crack while his son was in utero never had any problems and he's like a look around you do your research could crack babies are not real thing that's crazy because I remember hearing that as well like crack babies with a thing we're all worried about the eighties oh my God wait till the year $2,000 crack babies are 20 years old maybe I shouldn't have it that you did though cuz you understand real rap music</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the crazy thing is that this probably could be fixed with legalizing all drugs but nobody wants to legalize all drugs it's such a catch-22 because like if you had heroin available at the corner store you would have no need to buy Fentanyl and if it was like at a reasonable price but they couldn't undercut you like hey heroines 5xl Sonia fellow $4 it's a terrible thing to even say I don't want people to be able to just go by Meth yeah well the way to think about it I think it's like station a lot of times is like a better alternative in my opinion in my you know my research then legalization right so like the presidential candidate Andrew Yang talks about decriminalizing Oprah opioids people get arrested for using fentanyl they go to jail and then nativism rate is like through the roof people like get out and they start using again they don't get the treatment they need you know and so do. You know like people don't realize that fentanyl is killing more people than any drug in American history ever on an annual basis more than heroin more than pills more than math more than crack and so things just get worse and worse every year people aren't talking about how is decriminalization going to stop that because decriminalization will just make fentanyl more available the point of legalizing all drugs and again this is a very very messy subject and I'm not a proponent of legalizing all drugs I'm sort of agnostic on and I'm like I don't know I don't know what the f*** is it what it what is the answer but if you legalize them and you can buy them from reputable sources you would know that you're actually buying cocaine you're not I'm buying some fake Chinese spice Jam thing whatever the f*** they call it you're buying actual cocaine and you look we know if you buy whiskey right thing on the label tells you what proof it is you know that if you have you know three drinks are going to be f***** up and we can regulate that we can sort of adjust like I had two already I'm good you know if you don't know what's in it you don't know what the doses so you don't know what you're okay with and what you're not okay with one of the good things about alcohol if you get a beer that's a beer you know what that is but you know how much alcohol is in there yeah well in some countries in Europe they actually give free heroin and neither addicted users and so that you know it's not the heroin that kills people at all it's the dirty needles it's the criminal lifestyle used to like pay for the money to buy prostitution things like that and so I went and visited these play supervised injection facilities if you heard about these yes where they have them while they they don't have any in this country is it windy in Philadelphia and there's a court case in its favor recently the former Governor Ed Rendell is like spearheading that but I went to one in Barcelona and so these are places where drug use is totally legal inside the facility they've clean needles are doctors and nurses supervisor and and they even like so they have like this the smoking room where you can go and do do anything you want they have crack pipes like that the government provides are like government-funded and created crack pipe saddle hand out to people and they've never had an overdose death in one of these places they they have their connected to treatment centers that give out methadone Suboxone all these treatment drugs brings people into the system so that they are accounted for and these have been like super successful but in the u.s. is like Federal crackdowns on them again it's I think there's an issue politically right cuz nobody wants to be the one that says hey we're going to open a place where people can come and shoot up and help him you know we what we need is detox in it so we need his treatment we don't need place where you can go and shoot heroin you know but like many things in life this whole heroin thing fentanyl thing all these different it's very messy yeah well so even if you're not going to go that far there are simple steps we can take to help stop the opioid crisis and one thing I'm a big advocate for is called fentanyl testing strips and so that's the weird thing about fentanyl is it's not a demand-driven drug like every other drug got there cuz people want it if you want okay if you want hearing people don't want fentanyl sneaking it into other things exactly and so Studies have shown that if users know fentanyl is in there cocaine or their method their hair when are there pills they will be much less likely to use it and overdosed from it and so fentanyl testing strips there they look kind of like pregnancy tests they're really cheap just these paper strips you mix up your solution of whatever you think you have heroin can you dip the strip in there and if there is two stripes that means that you have Fentanyl and if there's one it means you don't or else the other way around and so it's it's simple it's immediate but but again us laws are so insane that these are actually banned in certain States like Pennsylvania so that could be done to help people understand you spent it on the drugs actually banned in certain States like Pennsylvania so that could be done to help people understand there's fencing on the drugs that they're looking for they looking for cocaine to looking for heroin turns out this pencil in there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what are the steps you think can be taken to sort of alleviate or at least somewhat mitigate this awful crisis and you know what that is like the miracle opioid overdose reversal drug in nasal spray usually and so if someone has overdosed on opioids fentanyl heroin pills whatever you know get these sprays it will bring them back to life literally and so you know that it's available man I'm not smart enough to know that I do not know the other chemical find out where I can see if we can find out how Narcan Works how does Narcan work that's amazing that they figured out something that can I'm glad he does dramatic scene was fuckingawesome I mean if you can shove a f****** needle in the middle of your heart pump that stuff in like pothole and she pops up to life the needle out of a chest in real life it would have been a nasal spray these are the people who are encountering opioid overdose victims you didn't counting them in the library or library to do drugs or firefighters EMTs react to people that are overdosing right isn't it the case that some fentanyl overdoses that the people actually have it on their skin so these people that are helping them with their police officers or first there is a you know amount of fentanyl someone sneezed and it was in the air you could get it by breathing in but by just touching it now oh well that's good to know knock on reversing an overdose it says markon has a strong Affinity to the opiate receptors stronger Affinity to the opiate receptors than opiates like heroin or Percocet so it knocks the opioids off The receptors for a short time this allows a person to breathe again ever versus the overdose holyshit man that person needs a Nobel Prize ever I need the exact opposite of the guy who sold the drugs to Prince yeah yeah zactly love and respect yeah that's an amazing Discovery so that's good to know because we've actually I think probably repeated that drugs or gloves when handling people of drug overdoses have you ever heard of carfentanil what is that it's a hundred times stronger than Fentanyl and have for a lot recently uses like an elephant tranquilizer events in one of the Jurassic Park movies that's what they used to I tranquilize the dinosaurs she probably listen to this man hey bro his crazy her french fries and stuff but he had he was addicted to meth and one point he had a lot of sort of depression self-esteem issues but then he tried to opioids and he was said it was like an antidepressant it became hooked and so he started selling fentanyl on the dark web because he didn't want kids that live in poverty he didn't want to his his drug addiction interfere and so not only that but he he claims that he's helping addicted users more affordably maintain their habit so he is as big like f*** you know Purdue Pharma anti-government anti big Pharma mentality so he blames like Purdue Pharma made Oxycontin pills and got. the whole opioid epidemic began so it was first it was the pills then people switch to heroin and now it's fentanyl is in all the heroin and so this guy says that because he makes a nasal spray too and he says that people can buy his fentanyl nasal spray on the dark web for like 60 bucks take one spray is equivalent to one Oxycontin pill and that's enough to maintain their addiction and so he says you know instead of paying money to the big pharmaceutical companies people buy this it's much cheaper and so we had a whole moral justification of of how he did as reason ethical drug Pusher that's the problem is that this stuff is so potent and and to make it into a nasal spray you have to use this whole thing is called volumetric dosing with the water and you got to get the exact right portions and he's not a trained pharmacist you know the total buying he's a middleman you got to justify yeah I get it but so many people who sell drugs and so many people who are involved in drugs they're always the eighth the people have f*****-up lives like to paint the best version of what they're doing that sounds like yeah probably died because of what you sold them I mean that's just it's one of those things where it's so deadly the people have f*****-up lives like to paint the best version of what they're doing yeah that's what that sounds like yeah you're selling fentanyl someone's probably died because of what you sold them I mean it's just it's one of those things where it's so deadly</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> thing is that the opioid epidemic was so often started by people who are prescribed drugs from their doctors and so that's another thing there's a sea-change happening right now is that there's all these new regulations about what doctors are allowed to prescribe they're trying to discourage them from taking opiate from prescribing opioids and that's a positive shift I think for people who are new patients right like if you get a root canal you don't need some crazy strong opioid you know what you know is like to recover from a dental procedure whatever but the problem is that now they're starting to take away people's opioids when they've been on them for a long-term like I talk to this woman from Colorado and she had a disease I can't remember rheumatoid arthritis or something she been taking opioids for four years and years and years and now all the sudden the doctor was like I can't give you these anymore you have to take these classes about alternatives to opioids you know and they talked about acupuncture and yoga and stuff like that now that's great but she felt like this degraded you know and and and Studies have shown that people if they get their opioid pills taken away they're going to turn to Street heroin as a result and so the whole the whole thing is it's insanely complicated there's three waves right the first wave is the pills so we're still facing the repercussions from the first one and that's what all these lawsuits that you hear about in the news are all about and the another scary thing is that up until now people hadn't been asking for fentanyl by name like we said it's just putting other drugs but now in places like San Francisco even St Louis starting to acquire a reputation as a street drug because long time hair has a street drug because longtime heroin addicts don't I don't get high anymore you know what I mean they take heroin and it just gets rid of their withdrawal symptoms and so fentanyl will get them high again and so people are starting to seek it out</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you know the War on Drugs stuff it it's it's increasingly going to be turned towards China you know what in fact Trump has been meeting with the Chinese president and all the trade War stuff increasing the tariffs this is now tied into Fentanyl and so supposedly in a couple days this might be out by then but there's this announcement of a new partnership China says they're finally going to crack down on these drug labs and we'll see happened but the point is like we can do everything we want to try to you know we can go to war with China over this issue but you know what is our past record in this realm like the DEA helped kill Pablo Escobar right but since then there's more cocaine coming out of Columbia then there ever was before you know nowadays El Chapo is arrested tried that's doing nothing to stop the drugs the cartels drugs coming to the u.s. and and and there's every indication that if we do get China to stop this insane like 90% or more of the illicit fentanyl comes from China that if we do get them to crack down on it the industry is going to go to India and India is already starting to see these huge bus like there's these Mexican cartel members getting busted India are buying fentanyl in India is like China and India have the the two biggest chemical Industries when it comes to generics kind of low lower-level chemicals and pharmaceuticals the U.S has the most profitable pharmaceutical industry cuz we make like the brand name drugs things like that but when you're talking about generics and stuff like vitamin C acetaminophen which is the drug these are all made in China Place like India and so they have this huge kind of Brain Trust Camas no people go to university they they were not be cameras and then a certain amount of them get into the illicit industry right so Mexico doesn't have that Mexico doesn't have its own chemical industry and a bunch of scientists who can make fentanyl who can make these new drugs so so Cindy I so susceptible to it and and the biggest problem is actually not even the fentanyl itself it's the fentanyl precursors and you know those are almost like they're called you on Chong the Chinese company that makes norfentanyl precursors than any company in the world you know they are they they're legit in and not only that they sell them to the Mexican cartels and they're totally sanctioned not only sanctioned by the Chinese government but they get tax breaks from the Chinese government they get subsidies they get their land subsidize their staff training things like that and I was sort of the most jaw-dropping Revelation that I have was that the Chinese government is not only failing to Crackdown but they're encouraging this industry they're encouraging industry that's insane so it's just the ideas luck it's making a lot of money let's just keep making money yeah it's a lot of people ask me if they think this is a blatant conspiracy to to try to like inflict harm upon the US a subversive form of warfare and I think it didn't start out that way I think that these these benefits were given so that China could increase its exports could grow its economy particularly when it comes to chemical exports so that's why these tax credit stars are called value-added tax rebates and so what that means is any chemical that you use to any ingredients used to make a chemical for you can write off the cost of those of those ingredients when you export it so basically it's like a 16% tax rebate and so they originally did that just to try to like improve their economy improved their exports but what's crazy to me now is that last year in the middle of the trade War this was at the height of when you heard about the trade War everyday you know Trump was Raising tariffs and doing this and that right at the high today is the height of that China increase the tax rebate for fentanyl from 9% to 10% so it was almost like a seems like a thumb in the eye and like for fentanyl it's I don't know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you have to the Republicans they have to stick together they especially in this time where you know look what I'm not a republican but if I was I would be extremely concerned about censorship in social media which is a real thing censorship a republican ideas and conservative ideas is absolutely a real thing and is it's it's not just real to accept it as being the right thing to do by certain organization mean they've been caught on camera and hit Tamara talking about the ways that you can silence conservative voices you know this is not like when you look at social media platforms they're essentially the best way to get ideas out there right it's even better than Broadcast News because if you put something on Fox or CBS or whatever how many people are really going to watch it is it a thousand a million men how many people watch it but if you have a clip that goes viral clip on YouTube or Twitter where a Facebook wherever whoever that could get more than he's ever going to watch you on television television like late night television accepted that what they're looking for these clips these moments these clips that almost acts as advertisements for the show James Corden I mean I don't know how many people watch a few hundred thousand two most right it's nothing in comparison to a lot of the like like that what's that guy's name that's the famous makeup kid that he's gay fellow James Charles videos on makeup get way more f****** views and anything that happens on Fox News and that's a fact okay social media is way more potent than anything else when it comes to getting a message out and for sure conservatives are being discriminated against on social media by social media platforms with weird about it is that when you think about social media and coming out of Silicon Valley which is famously left wing the election was really swung by the internet in Trump's favor you know whether or not you want to call them Bots that were set up by Russia or whether or not it was just they were well-organized campaign they just they were really smart and very sharp about videos that they put out state have a thing that really put out a lot of memes that they encourage people to make memes about yes they're all over Democrats are so far behind the Republicans when it comes to using using it but you're right I mean if you if you ban certain people from Twitter and from YouTube That's censorship yes it is and banning them from those platforms if your Shadow Banning them making it very difficult for people to find which is real the real thing that you do that you know the the way your poet like if you have a post on social media it doesn't just go up in chronological order anymore now it's affected by an algorithm so I might see your post or I might not see your post in my feet it's dependent upon what I like and what I want and what I see when I go to search I'll give you look at my search feed you know you see you see people beating the f*** out of each other and girls doing Watts looks like my search it's all like like it's it's the most cartoonish version of me POC it's all like big bull elk screaming and dudes getting head kicked in a muscle car doing a burnout look at my Instagram and that's all affected entirely by this algorithm it figures out what I like and then also recommends things to me like in terms of like there's a lot of sponsored things on Instagram as I could have to Google it and it's because it's targeting me it's found me that knows that I search for certain things I look at certain things these are the sites I follow these are the things that I interact with so what's selling something and it does the same with you it doesn't seem to Jamie just seems everybody so they can insert and social media platforms use that algorithm to discriminate so they can decide hey this f****** guy keeps open on and on about Hillary Clinton's war crimes and all this we don't need this guy around okay we don't need this guy and all of his f****** right-wing b******* and always make America great again bullshits will shadowban them and so they can shove you into this category where it's very difficult to find your find your page and it's very difficult for your s*** to show up in a lot of people seeing their views drop drastically their interactions drop drastically his people aren't seeing this s*** anymore Andrew Santino had that happened to him no s*** talk to someone talk to someone on the phone that told him he was shadowbanned and he's like what does that mean they're like well it was it's because of a post that you may as well what post is it they wouldn't tell him what both of us what kind of post would have been is he political can guy has a bunch of ridiculous s*** weird fella I think is his handle on Twitter and he used to used to say stupid s*** was Goofy whatever he's you know I would interact with a little bit and then he emailed me at my site to say that he got banned from Twitter remember what member on Halloween when a kid showed up at the White House and Trump and Melania were standing there and Trump put candy on top of the kids head Debbie canning it to him it was like a really ridiculous like this guy can't even just put candy in the kid's bag so it was like it's something that became a meme and this guy just wrote I wish the kid had kicked him in The Shins thrown off Twitter or saying that was woman in Megan Murphy she's with trans exclusionary radical feminist and she is one of those radical feminists don't believe that a trans person to woman and she was arguing that these people don't have they should have a voice in women's issues like you're not a woman and so this is her opinion and some people think that that opinion is transphobic some people think she should be allowed to have that opinion while I'm Twitter she wrote A man is never a Woman They told her just take down that tweet so you know what she did she made screenshot of it took down that tweet and then she posted a picture to screenshot and then they banned for life for Life OJ Simpson double homicide armed kidnapping a man is never a woman which biological is correct do you know what else you're banned for 12 to get banned for life deadnaming you know deadnaming is that if you call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce political ideology world this is taxpayer money to pay for prisoners some f****** mass murderer besides his woman now they get this transitioner surgery transition surgery reassignment surgery whatever you want to call it but I wish it was a f****** pill you can take I wish it was a place we can go where they Zapped you like the place where they turned Bruce Banner in the Hulk that turns you into a woman legit 100% bona-fide XY or double X chromosome woman is changing someone but not really you know you're still your chromosomes and your your your biological makeup and then forcing people to comply so just think of compliance like you're supposed to not bring up the fact that this person used to be a man of your name is Greg but like my friend Aubrey okay perfect example his name is to be Chris but he tripped balls one day and decide you want to change his name to change his name we all just called him Aubrey now I don't call Chris anymore for years has Chris for years and then it became off changes name to change his name we all just call them off right now I don't call Chris anymore he was Chris for years I knew was Chris for years and then it became Aubrey oh my God man you want to be Aubrey I

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know there's a there's a giant there's a giant issue in this country that is like like skirted it's like when it gets addressed but then it gets it gets ignored and the end that is what do they do with all the communities that have been forever affected by slavery like what about all those all those when when people talk about reparations it gets dismissed like it's not you I didn't do anything it's not you it doesn't have to do with you you didn't do anything you never owned a slave I never owned a slave we didn't have anything to do with it but there's no denying that there's parts of this country that are forever affected by slavery and then afterwards by racist laws those red line laws hair reconstruction and Jim Crow funny I don't know if that works like if I thought that by me paying more in taxes and them giving reparations we could ease the tension racial tension this country I would be like okay that's all you have to do but it's not all you have to do right because you still can have these communities that are forever affected until something has been done to correct them like I'm not in favor of giving people who were never slaves money as reparations but I am in favor of communities money and figure out a way to rebuild them figure out a way to math and Save Burbank schools Community programs that are involved in gangs and drugs and all that stuff like a thousand times but it Bears repeating the best way to have a great country is if we're a team or if we're country were supposed to be a team right we're Community a giant community of 320 million people what's the best way to make it stronger best losers That's the Best Buy what's the likelihood of you becoming a loser if you're in an impoverished drug riddled crime just ravaged area but they're highly is highly likely do you not going to succeed in that area unless you are some person of unbelievable character and unbelievable wheel in Ford to new your raised by people who did a phenomenal job essentially in a war zone right if you live in the south Chicago music to the murder rate in South Side Chicago and compare it to the murder rate in war zones they're pretty f****** similar right so sensitive these people are being asked to do their best and and come out of this war zone and pull themselves up by their bootstraps where is other people around them or not in a war zone if we're Community we supposed to look at that and go hey impoverished areas that should be addressed well it has to be looked at it is our problem Yeasayer problem you know we are all living with the ramifications of inequality you know it's affecting us on a daily basis whether it's crime or whether it's in our gross national product would be much higher if more people were educated and more people are proud of their work and and so there's there has to be there has to be Pride lest lest losers more prime or identifying with progress and I think if you if you if you live in a certain culture in this country there there isn't a pride in succeeding because you haven't seen it right more opportunity in this includes poor white cultures like I have a friend who's from Kentucky and he tells me about these f****** people that live in these coal mining communities with a coal mine community the coals gone and the community shut down people are hooked on pills and he's like you have never seen poverty like this seen it every one of the community's on pills everyone is surviving on like below minimum wage at everyone's a criminal like it's just everyone's porch is horrific wild and wonderful Whites of West Virginia now and they're all on pills there alternate tricks shooting and robbing people shooting people and slick as everyone has a f****** store that's like you like Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone exist exist and it's so hard to get out it's so hard to break free like we as a community as a giant 320 million person community should be concentrating on fixing those spots at least as much as fixing problems in other parts of the world I understand the logic behind going to these other parts of the world are f***** up and trying to solve these problems before they affect us before they come back. That's the logic I get it but internally inside of our country we're not doing the same thing we're allowing people to become violent criminals by never giving them a chance but never giving them an outcome or Never Never Giving Them possibilities other than what they see around them not giving out any opportunity and we treated as if they're supposed to be we're all supposed to be even while supposed to be on his even game some people got one shity card and some people got like five Aces yeah there's this documentary they made about public school in Chicago I forget what to Oak Park I think it was in it was called America is me and was like this 10 part series and it showed the experiences of the white kids versus the black it's cuz it was an integrated School but you were seeing that the black kids with lagging grade-wise graduation rates and they just went in depth and you saw that a lot of the black kids were dealing with single parents they were dealing with being f****** evicted some of them being homeless or just not having the resources like you know the white kids are getting SAT prep classes and you know they're getting extra help because they've got a parent is not working that can pick them up from school and drive them to a tutor and there's just all these things that you seen one side of giving fostering side is struggling and it's the same f****** school so it's not it's not as simple as just put good schools in the community but there's got to be mentorship programs and just got to be the outreach program to get kids in there at a young age so the parents can work and there's good nutrition that they say that the studies that show preschool the difference is long term of how people come out of there with those extra two years is astronomical Mason super prep them for an early but the thing is like this is where a concept like Democratic socialism actually make sense it's like people think of democratic Socialism or anything will you say the word socialism they call you're going to take money and give it to lazy people this is the that's the worst-case scenario right but man we're Community if we're if we are a community of human beings would you've got to we've got to help the people that aren't doing good it's got to be a reason why they're not doing good it's not that they're inferior there's date they have inferior choices they have inferior opportunities they have an inferior situation and it's so hard to get the mass of people behind giving their money to some sort of some sort of a program that does take steps to fix it just don't hear it but you know they had two jobs for FDR and the New Deal start people want to work people don't want to get a welfare child they want to feel good about themselves and they and you want to be busy all day you know it was sometimes I'm not I don't work for a month you know I'm between writing jobs maybe I take some time off from Stanton I don't feel good about myself terrible imagine that generation after generation was a choice if you want to go on the road anytime the funny thing is like the factory jobs you look back on them when you go those are like really shity jobs you know how I grew up in a factory town and it was like people were not enjoying it people were getting f****** drunk and high and just getting through and now we're looking for harkening back to like that it was sexing golden age of great work like a no-show they were union jobs which is great but let's shoot higher you know let's go there's like some people some people don't have aspirations so if you took someone who's already gone through the school system and you know like we're going to get jobs for people that's not good enough but you got to fix the people that are f***** up yeah you can't say like like an 18 year old person is not a finished product write a 25 year old person came from a f*****-up neighborhood and is got all sorts of mental problems and probably PTSD the finished product you can't say we got a job for you because they're f***** in the head you know they've had a deal with their friend getting shot him deal with her mom being on crack I getting him a job is not not enough I don't know what the answer is like obviously we're just two white guys talking s*** we don't have to worry about this is not our concern but if you wanted to if you wanted to fix if you are personally save Greg Fitzsimmons became president how do you fix that how do you how do you even make steps to fix that cuz I haven't heard anyone come up with a plan maybe there is one that I haven't heard but a plan where it makes sense with his all long-term proposition to try to take these communities that are just habitually engulfed in crime and violence just consistently like throughout the sixties in the seventies and and fix it and turn it around like at least try what is it got the gap between the rich and the poor is growing cats it's gotten just got out of hand do you know that the amount the top 1% have 50% of the money or something like that and it's just and everything is set up structurally for that to continue to divide more and more right but it are they playing a game right they're playing a game called capitalism and that game is there dominating that game and once they get the money then they keep the money and they pass that money down their kids and they keep the money how do you change that maybe we could all play that game right like we could all best in stock market we can all just really focus entirely on making money or should we not be able to how do you stop the 1% like these bankers and investment people how do you stop that and how do you stop that your way where it doesn't seem like you're you know you're changing the rules of the game because some people just psycho good at it and completely dedicated to only making money wanted there to be a very large estate tax they wanted to avoid would happen in Europe which is these building up of these families that are handing down wealth into these kids you know so I think we need to go back to right now it's like 35% or something like that and wealth over 10 million dollars if you're a couple they need to go back to really taking that money back because the noon what was it though how that man got spent right now would be the problem if it just went to a bunch of like if you just went to a bunch of government programs that don't seem to make sense and they're like poorly structures that money gets wasted that would make me sick to be job training programs that has to be helping small businesses grow with you no low-cost loans but you know they think about these kids what are you ever going to contribute to society as opposed to if you were set up with you went to a private high school you went to a great University you went to a graduate school all of it was paid for you had nannies you were given tutors you should be able to go out and make a good living now you don't need that billion dollars and you will feel so much better if you make your own money so that should be enough money left you know I'm not I'm not saying take away or when they die but I'm saying that there's a grotesque that needs to be pulled back that's one way of of at least putting a chip like chip away at it that's one way right that money yeah what's another way whatsoever unless you want like cops or police to occupy these are really how would you ever stop like at this point in time how would you stop places from being crime-ridden but have to be like a multi-step program where you would slowly but surely implemented and try to slowly but surely chip away at all these problems yeah it's not something you going to fix overnight cuz it didn't happen overnight you know right right now there has to be great leadership and there has to be a man that you got eight years your your president your got four and if you walk you get eight now I mean local leadership if it's that way like you're going to be you're dealing with communities that don't have as much money already yeah you know I'm because just by virtue of the fact the crime-ridden and that this is in poverty-stricken these are communities that are ready to have any money if it's that way like you're going to be you're dealing with communities that don't have as much money already yeah you know I'm because just by virtue of the fact the crime-ridden and that this is in poverty-stricken these are communities that are ready to have any money</div>

However you know and I mean having if you've never done stop motion to appreciate it omigod what year was this I'm not sure exactly is great Bernard Herrmann music having to sort of respond to all this these skeletons that are popping out of the ground with shields and swords which aren't there which is which appreciate your lashes are gone you know how Ray saw the impact he had time you I went to his 90th birthday celebration in in in England where the British Film Academy did this great tribute to Ray and everybody showed up I mean Peter Jackson came in with people who didn't show up and sent video Stevens all talking about how much Ray's films and raise work influence demand it was really great you know I'm and I did so nice that he was able to be appreciated like that in his lifetime and and now I'm actually I'm in the findings I getting that now with this with my book is come out and people are just I love you so much in the stuff you done it's just you know it's nice to know that but my book is come out people are just going home and I love you so much in this after you done it's just so you know it's nice to know that you served a purpose</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now when you did the Wolfman was there a push to do some sort of CGI version of that was it did you have to like I ate or discussion about how to do it I expected that he would do it CGI because everything at that time was basically CGI and I had a friend that got a copy of the script and I read it in a red like a CGI thing and I was actually filming at Universal you're feeling some of that Norbit stuff at Universal and I went to a a producer there that I knew who's the visual effects producer as well and I asked him if he knew anything about the Wolfman you know because I said I'm in love to do this you know that's one of the phones that made me do what I do you know him and this is going to be CG equals no actually they were talking about it I thought we were going to do transformation we actually built stuff for transformation it was a weird film in so many ways it seemed like Benicio was great to work with he wanted he wanted to be the Wolfman you know he's a monster real monster kid to you know Anthony Hopkins was great you know what I did with my friends Dave lol see but I think we're the only people that wanted to be working a movie called The Wolfman really yeah and they would do things the production manager called me into the office once and said what are you buying all this hair what is it hair for it was seriously has hair a big behind his desk in a big size of Wolfman and I wouldn't cover it up a man I'm going to make him a wolf man and I need to care for that why do you need hair cuz most have fur what the f*** I can't believe we're having this conversation do you need all of that let you do whatever you do all the time night and when everybody was gone we had the best time we know where we're going to welcome a movie you know when we first filmed the sequence in the Gypsy Camp what is always Gypsies and fog and and stuff is like the old movies but like a new version of the old movies here with the fog and the Gypsy camp and all that jazz it was really similar to the original Lon Chaney Hammer film feel to a 2L Anthony Hopkins makeup was it was a little more Chris the world with Christopher Oliver Reed and that's the reason she and he would quiz me on stuff you know theater American werewolf we had a naked man who changed into a four-legged Hound from hell we have Benicio del Toro and Benicio del Toro with some hair on his face the changes aren't the same weekends we weren't even invited to the set when they did the transformation even though we had stuff they didn't want you to go to didn't want me there why is that I don't know they didn't want your input you know I guess even though it's a lot of what's in there is based on some antibiotics that I didn't but it was a really weird deal I mean Nova Tsum that in my eyes you're Hollywood royalty like you were the guy who made American Werewolf in London you're the guy who made so many of these in Incredible movies with makeup and special-effects I would think they'd be pumped that you were there I thought that too is my hobby and I made a decent living at it and I got awards for it I got free food and things you know and it is magic I mean you wrong you is like time travel like working on this movie when London and in areas that haven't changed since it is 18 and you have all these people in. Costumes really like your time-travel you knowing you get to work with some really amazing people yeah see this is all TDM really well done visual effects Supervisor was a really great guy and he was really upset that we weren't able to do this stuff as well but they said that I think they did a terrific job and I like CG to a degree I mean I I I like the fact that it's another technique that we can use to do things that we can't do in the real world with rubber things when we can do it before American werewolf I would have to try to beg people to let me do something I mean it was like can I put a mustache shirt and a scar on this guy you know after American werewolf I would get scripts with stuffing and I had no idea how the hell is going to do in like crazy crazy stuff but they they would say to me what is a delight interviews after American World what is the material that changed work that we haven't seen before and I said I got adequate time inadequate money and it was the first time I had that and after that I like my dick Gremlins 2 I had a Year's prep but the problem is I need answers a year before we start filming because I need to make this stuff and Museum directors on another movie then it doesn't want the eventually after I hand them to make me shut up comes in post the film's already made you kind of cut it together they start making the stuff but this is obviously makeup that is you so we'll see Jeter no transformation Chili's in a different day Wilding Quasar stunt album some shots of close-ups this is Spencer the stunt double what was weird about it it's like he's running but he's got kind of like dog legs I can try to get that illusion of like dog like it's so funny because I walk like that is a kid that all the time you know it would do things in Soca Dave LC but we tried to get the guy Dave LC but we tried to get that stunt guys aren't even Benicio to do it they couldn't do it but couldn't walk on their toes on the balls of the feet like that with her heels outfit or not I don't know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> first gig was the first first professional gig that you got where it was like holy s*** I'm getting paid to do makeup well I'm the first time ever got paid actually I make up for a stage actor who wanted to be old and charged him $75 and has more money than I ever gotten from anything before it's like I just came up with a number in your head anyways I did these pieces for him and he lived off that Pasadena Freeway at 1 and has a weird right-angled off-ramps you knowing my dad drove me there cuz I couldn't I didn't drive in the timing and he actually had a makeup kit and had some hair pieces in a bunch of stuff and he said you know I will trade you this instead of give you the $75 I'll give you this make of casein yeah that's pretty cool you know what my dad wanted to teach me in responsibilities and stuff in this was around the time I I think I was like 16 and was going to try to drive and you go to my insurance is going to go up and what you have to do is you have to get that money and you have to give me the money two for the rate of the insurance is going up that's cool they supported me and my crazy decision to make monsters for a living well they must have been so happy when it paid off though yeah I was glad that they live long enough to see that and I got to bring my parents to the Oscars a few times those people but you know my dad basically never grew up and I knew I never was going to you know I'm always your dad would you do for a living but he was always he was very creative and it was kind of held down in his lifetime I benefited from that he supported the creativity and when I was a sophomore in high school he decided he wanted to try to make a living as an artist and we lived on my mom's bank teller salary for a number of years he hardly made any money at all, but he was happy you knowing and he said because I mean like I said he supported my creativity he said he was also a fan of monster movies you know dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde when I came out you know and told me all about it that was a movie that they didn't have on TV that I really wanted to see what he said when he saw it in the theater run either and when I was in the seventh grade I think it was I decided to get on the student council for the main reasons is my plan was suggested that we could raise money for the school by having showing movies after school we can rent 16 Miller movie what was the first film that you did special effects for first film was a film called the Octo man and it's kind of a cult classic because it's such a crappy movie was shot in 10 days at it Olive Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park is later right yeah something like that you are the crazy guy in King Kong and then I'll design oh my goodness and like I think $1,000 to make the suit and out so I after school and I got my friend the very first job I ever had delivering plumbing supplies he went to the wrong building in the building you went into is called clokey Productions and they made Gumby and Davey and Goliath stop motion animation which I did stop motions well big Ray harryhausen fan you know and for some reason I grew up in Covina which is East rent and he died I was on my quarterly allowance when I found a place I could buy rubber it was like $89 work order rubber and you know it took me a lot of weeks in a lot of mowing lawns in a lot of stuff to save up that money and I need it I need a job so I did have a car we only have one car in the family or not you I went to any place I could walk to supermarkets you know Busboys all the stuff nobody wanted me and my dad I remember this place ended stop motion and you'd stop motion me or maybe so I went there with my box of stuff and it was summer vacation between my Junior and Senior year high school and they said start tomorrow got paid minimum wage but that place was like a magnet for any weird kid and we became fast friends and red famous monster is he was a real Sin fan and Doug when I did this this Aquaman film Doug had a out a little workshop and we did it in his workshop and we did it together but yeah and looking around and there's nobody there what the hell if you know so this is before cell phones so we have to go we went back down there down Bronson Canyon to call the production office and it was like oh yeah we pushed one day we just forgot to tell you you forgot to tell the people who are making the Octoman the title character of the movie that you weren't filming and it was also I mean that the perfect introduction to the movie industry though it was in and I've learned that you can't believe anything to tell you you know I mean it was designed by somebody else and I got the job handed down through people I met at cluggy's it was going to be so they decided it was too expensive they're going to make a suit in the first thing to do is a little my cat and not a little I could do 8:10 on a man in a speed kind of like turn into tentacles in a kind of split off and then to a back technical but I said I think they look like elf shoes and it was not a good for a way for me to join the two things together and decide kid don't worry about it there's only going to be one shot of the abdomen in the movie Rudy actually see it the rest of the time is going to be Shadow or clamps you know but we'll have a money shot where you can make sure looks great CNN and you know it was it was a real introduction. I thought it was going to be like working on 8 millimeter millimeter movies like I did as a kid you know it just jumps in and work for making movie let's do it right and Doug had long hair if you can believe this Octoman was written by the guy that was the writer of Christian Black Lagoon and he also wrote it came from outer space so it was basically those two scripts combined with Eva with ecology thrown in and he was like instead of across the Laguna can't get out you know here it was a lot across the street and they're driving it with the Winnebago in they can't get out until they get out to try to get the log out in the open the Winnebago door in the documents in there and he knocks a guy down and then they supposed supposed to pick up a log and throat doctor man and I applaud that we're going to use him and we're going to rehearse this right you know we don't have time when he supposed to bend over and pick up the pier Angeli who's the female lead who killed herself after this moving around or no look more like he's holding her so anyways they start filming without rehearsing Octoman opens the door knocks a guy down he goes walking over and he's virtually blind is looking at a two little holes out this far away is it wasn't real claustrophobic suit the poor guy read Morgan and play the Aquaman was great to deal with but it was very hard suit to wear those to pick up here and really nobody says concert picks her up so walking around the guy who knocked on the ground is laying on ground Spread Eagle jeans up stepping right on his nuts fell on his hand and everybody screaming was tearing pages of the script I think it's in public domain now I think it's on YouTube on Blu-ray out of it I might have to fire up a joint if you watch that one now when you went when you look back on that you mean it's got to be kind of memory as well because that was where it started but you also got a chance to get going I got your way we came up with a way to do this because we couldn't get the foam rubber suit and former breast be baked in the oven we didn't have a bake-oven we didn't have the means we came up with a clever solution and it's what I had to do so many times in the film to do things that people have done before on a budget in the schedule and try to figure out that's part of the fun yeah big fan of you. So one of the first things I had to do there's a scene where the Ottomans tentacles was creep through this Cave opening and they basically wadded-up some tar paper and I stood behind the tar paper and Bronson caves and stuck my hand in his Technical and it did this and when curling walk by I said super dynamation which is what is technically called for a few films tar paper and I stood behind the tar paper and Bronson caves and stuck my hand in the tentacle and it did this and when curling walk by I said super dynamation which is the Harry Hansen's technically called for a few films and</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and it happened on Thriller to you know you died because of American werewolf when Michael came to John Landis to do Thriller you know he'd like America or anyone to do he wanted to be a short film you do any closer music video and John contacted me in and said you know how Michael Jackson wants to do this tomorrow flight music video you known for the song Thriller which I hadn't heard and it was like you know Michael Jackson and so you would listen to it and get some ideas and this was when we had the Walkman that they had another one that I would like like resource date ideas when I was listening to you know and a couple of days so they hired him like 3 days before we found anyone I can't that doesn't give me time to take life masks and do all the stuff that I would do and you saw me to be really cool you know so I said how about if the first zombies UCR like me and my crew because we already have like masks we can start those today and we can spend the time and making some coolant so I'm in Thriller coming out of her crib like this she is at 1 and all my crew basically the first guys that come out of ground and break their windows but the dancers I said I'll figure out a way we can do that cuz I had a number of Life masks the different people and small medium large males Mommy and large female and resulted we kept pieces we called like bandmaster every kind of like this around this area and we made these big teeth that we could pop in their mouth and put some denture lining material and fit them so the dancer makeups were not as good as the more featured make Michael in the upper left-hand Corner that one Jamie with eyes like it that like that was excellent and again we kept it that way then what happened is a dime Beez after that everybody was just doing pieces like this I only did like that because of limitations I hadn't but I mean very little money for me it turned they spent the money at a light cameras in the last time when you're filming but it it I was working day and night every day of the week to get the stuff done and John didn't surprise me with the making of Thriller on the day that Michael was coming up for us to take his life Masten make a cast of his face he was others that could be a camera crew here it always looks horrifying to see if somebody Hannah like mistaken and I go I don't need a Michaels really shy I don't need we don't need this I don't I don't I don't want this to go shopping there's a time where music videos were a new thing and then Thriller changed What music video is it it it was so huge it was a world premiere event that was on MTV and it's so hard for kids today to understand what that means but we were all like gathered around the TV waiting for the Michael Jackson Thriller World premiere and it it premiered and it changed what a music video is then all the sudden it became this film and it was really cool cuz like Michael Jackson was a sweet guy and it's on a date with this beautiful girl and and the next thing you know he's a f****** werecat or whatever he was so I then became more fantasy I gave it longer hair in like white strings do you find his transformation to the cat cuz it was reminiscent and somewhat of an American werewolf but cool and unique in its own way originally it was going to be my my crew were going to be the guys that do the makeups and they were all non-union and it at the last minute became a union production so I had to hire Union makeup artist and there were many up to do the dancers and many of them were people I didn't know and there weren't a lot of people that we're good at this stuff and then you did a similar thing with the ears and the he had the whiskers meaning of Michael and his comment and we were filming and Vernon downtown Los Angeles in next to the Farmer John meat packing place and it just loaded the animals and it has weird smell in the air and then happening when you know for the first time they're going to win it with it being filmed and how many times did they shoot it not that many nothing but their way I think it was six cameras on it when we were doing production Michael did any of the Motown special that was on television where do you moonwalk for the first time and I didn't see it I was busy working and one of my crew who went home at night and every quarter is it anyways you're not going to believe this is the same kid that was in her makeup chair the other day cuz Michael is very shy as well really Meek and quiet in person and he's so Dynamic on stage you know I'm and it was like two different people I mean one likely perform he's incredible is the biggest understatement in the history of the world but this whole scene with him when he becomes a zombie was so bizarre to the dancing was so strange I know it was cool though but this whole scene with him when he becomes a zombie was so bizarre to the dancing was so strange I know it was cool to see it live for the first time</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's such an interesting time capsule when you look at these films me look at something like like Nosferatu from 1922 and then you look at what we're doing today with CGI in a lot of ways I mean I'm not a fan of CGI I'm not a fan of it in terms of like four monsters month just seems everything seems fake there's the suspension of disbelief is higher then if I'm like what you did with American Werewolf in London what one of one or more brilliant things about it was a special effects and fantastic but DVDs really quick scenes it was like you saw it for a second it was burned into your eyes and then and then it vanished yet was it what you said to me is that I'm never going to really show the warwolf for more than a couple seconds Wendy's the directory nobody can help him he'll make it and I did I mean the first culture was what the final thing became same with everything in it did not see demons all that stuff you don't cut to the Wolfman 2010 won between maybe this poor should be over here and that kind of stuff just as so salsa the cover of my my book is the sculpture from of that one or not to Demons from American werewolf and number people said this is like one of the greatest designs ever in on this kind of stuff and it's people were production designers and stuff and it was it Spirit maker without interference and that's what I thought the industry would be in it seems like it's the same with everything everybody wants to put their greasy little fingerprints on it and and say that's the reason why his nose is like that was me I told Rick Baker you don't know what you're doing to make the nose wider what are you do this while they're disturbing your artistic Vision that was just said so that means when someone contributes money and they're the ones who get to decide whether things get made or not you know just they think they're artistic as well and becomes a disaster and it's a thing you do I mean when you see a movie or TV show who came from Rodger Corman School of filmmaking you know so you really checks every penny and but he was a guy could go to and you know what he would look at everything and goes why is it why is this why you buying this and explain it to him and Hugo okay that makes sense and there'd be a person you could talk to you when you can get an answer from it now there's like I said 47 producers and nobody will commit to anything I I did make it because I loved it and I was I feel so fortunate that my hobby became my profession and I said well I got awards for it and stuff and for something I would do for free you know but it's got to the point where I was just becoming a bitter old man because of all this and I just know I have to retire and I want to make things for myself while I still can you know almost 69 years old and having trouble with joints working on some movie for some producer that but didn't know he was talking about him and I screwed up my work is that you did where you like okay that was a good one but you know it's funny once you do something and you look at it you see all the things wrong with it and I always say I wish I could see him before I make this stuff because isn't in something that you like through together is all of sudden the most important thing I mean I I mean American werewolf was probably the one color I mean that's one that really put me on the map I mean let people say King Kong Lives but American werewolf play the Grateful and grateful I mean in my second toe match lock which was John Landis his first film was 20 and he was 21 and I had again I had had six weeks and I think I had $2,000 again to make John play the slots Toronto Centre of Racine everything frog yes he couldn't believe he was making a joke a joke version you know and he wanted to play the tape main character and it's like well okay you're but you're going to be the director to so you know whether or not all made up it was shot three weeks and John are going on two hours sleep a night you know he make him up we were out in Agoura used to be in Oakwood School where John went for a while and think it was thrown out of and we lived and worked in this like screen in patio that was left over this dilapidated building was making of John on a Barstool and eventually he was like falling asleep they filming and you know our removing the makeup with getting the car drive to MGM look at their previous day's dailies drive back sleep for 2 hours get up start again it was during the Heatwave in a garage in the first stage on the suit on all day and I was like, this is falling out in handfuls and it's actually kind of a cool makeup in in in in a kind of a fun character you know and John had already written American werewolf and he said my next films going to be American world would sit in a chair like and I want to be able to move and I want to show the pain and you how would you do that and then call me I have no idea but I would love to but we both love those transformation pulled that transformation scene. The initial transformation scene is so f****** awesome cuz that I never seen it in the theater what year was this 1981 I wanted to be a makeup artist when he pulls all his clothes off and he's burning up and then he looks at his hand his hand start stretching out like that was incredible just such a different werewolf to everything about it was different the second one Brian that's another one there it's got syringes in it that we now he's wearing an appliance and it matches that and we story buddy the whole sequence in as you saw the David. He's closes every Harry and I said for me to glue a little bit of hair on and it would do him a little hairy or in a little hairier it's better for us to work in Reverse let me do them in the areas first and I'll pull hair off and trim it join was reverse flash character Rubber and then pull it through and waiver verse printed it so look what I Don't Like the Wolf has a big Mane of hair so he's got this big hairy neck that I don't like you and it's that's David doesn't have lenses in his eyes are red from that was at end of makeup everything cuz I mean I I was 30 when I did this I was at a time when there weren't people that did this kind of work just a few in Hollywood you know it like John Chambers any Planet of the Apes but for me to find a crew I hired kids that sent me fan mail it still looks pretty decent fuckingawesome not just pretty decent I mean there's a reason why I have the American werewolf the Pat McGee version of it sitting there in the front but now I have to call Pat Tillman legs are off you know I thought you could do something like that have like Puppeteer legs in the back so if the reality is if you really see that the whole War there's feet sticking out of an ass he's got. upgrade seen God that was a great singer werewolf comes bursting out of the bed that script I think was the only script that I've worked on my entire career that the only difference was when John wrote the script originally that Aerosmith Cinema so you change it to other than that it's the second the script is basically Verbatim what he wrote is a 20 year old and is using music and everything was groundbreaking it's time people didn't do like the way he did Young and his friend that kept returning Jack more or more and more rotten every time like that was a genius ideas where I like that Jack had explained to him like a man you got to tell yourself you're a werewolf we going to kill a bunch of people like that so everything about it was so unique play flip the whole idea of what a werewolf movie was on its head in in and it worked you know an in Griffin who who played Jack when I first met him up in that makeup he was putting the stuff on nobody's going to look at me you know what it's like did you read the script ya didn't say your throat is torn out yeah but I would look like this England RB scouting locations and so I said you know you got to talk to Griffin he's kind of upset about what he looks like you know that but you know I took that opportunity being a sensitive guy that I am to tell him that the third part of his transformation was it was actually going to be a puppet and wasn't really going to beat him because he was supposed to become basically talking skeleton and the makeup process is an additive process in and you know what he would have to be a huge call to the right you know and he wasn't too happy about that either but I said but I want you to operate the mouth because you're doing a lips sink in or you're doing the voice and so he operated Apothic but he scenes of the werewolf with ripping people apart but then some of it is hilarious will that whole sequence in the portal theater without the graphic horror of the the werewolf tearing people apart I'm so fortunate to me that that John came into my life and this this happen again because of Don Post Studios and I talked about right they made Halloween masks John was a male boy at Fox for a while and he knew John Chambers he would deliver mail to the edge on Chambers I think you just basically didn't want to do they would only sell you in a 55-gallon drum which I couldn't afford you no like polyurethane polyurethane foam which is a two-part on the phones up chemical reactions gas when it forms which nobody told me robot to Covina and again I still pretty shy that point in my bedroom at that point was I had I slept on a convertible sofa cuz I got enough money to buy one so I can fold it up and have some more floorspace to work but my masks in my bed were tables everywhere you knowing and John is very loud and nnnn hyperactive and Andi Mack coming in he was flipping out is really scaring me a map and I mean I did Coming to America Eddie Murphy was because of my wife Sylvia I met my wife on Hollywood Boulevard in front of Frederick's of Hollywood in the middle of night and it turned out I tighten a change it to a dope dealer has clean a dope dealer in Sylvia was the hairstylist on the film and John came in and says I want you to be in the movie I want you to play the part you were born to play a hooker because I want my wife was a hooker in the background do you know if there's a picture of us been a great life in 19 Iowa John a lot well you and John made magic you really did mean that that movie was so good you and as we said one of things about that film has its it was so strategic and its use of the werewolf now that you do really eat when you got a chance to see it like one of my favorite scenes was when the guy the businessman is in the subway he's running away from the werewolf and you know it's chasing but you don't see it they don't see it until he's stumbling on the escalator and then you see it at the bottom Twitter Miss versus walking into the frame and you like f*** yeah and they cut right before he speaks normally you would when you do something for the butt I think it's the best expression you know I thought it was only going to be on for a second I wanted to be scary looking so I sculpted in a scary expression on it which I normally wouldn't do I just saw you there was no way that wasn't</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Avengers forever man I was a huge Star Wars fan when I was a kid and you inspired me when I was young I really wanted to be a makeup artist I wanted to do special effects and that kind of stuff that you do if I had no idea yeah man I think it was probably Star Wars that kicked it off for me cuz I like many kids a lot of people today you know we're so removed with first VHS and then DVDs and laserdiscs and now streaming it's so easy to watch movies but when Star Wars came out we would go over and over and over again it was like a little contest between a lot of kids that I went to school with an I think I saw it 13 times while it was out in the movie theater but I became fascinated I've always been fascinated with comic books always wanted to be a comic book illustrator and I always love like like of those fantasy novels like creepy and Eerie in those those graphic novels but I really became fascinated with special effects and we make up after your work well it yeah it's kind of something for me I mean you know why I grew up in I was born in 1950 and I grew up in front of a TV but I was a little black and white when you knowing and there was always the Master movies on Saturdays or Sundays in the age of stuff just hit a chord with me and I just don't have to do this you know when did you what was the first thing that you did first first ever makeup bad Harley soften and but they wanted children and end up but I was very shy I stayed in my bedroom I couldn't talk to an adult and stuff like the very first thing that I got interested in makeup and I got some just white greasepaint and black grease paint and smeared it on my face and just with the layer of Grease paint on my face when I was looking in the mirror wasn't Little Ricky baker anymore and I could do things that I couldn't do without this s*** smeared on my face and it it helped me overcome my shyness but I mean it it started with that but I mean I wanted to do something more you know so I ended up making I made my first mask I think when it was 13 and it was a curse of Frankenstein Frankenstein and I did that one mainly because I thought I could copy that way I can make it look close enough cuz it's it's call the film industry Works in in Port Phillip leaky who did that make up had like a week to prep for you knowing and no money so I did I forget some of the faults with it when you stop and think about the earliest versions of makeup and movie special effects. Makeup in movies you know you go back to like Nosferatu is probably one of the very earliest right I mean they really didn't have anything to go with it wasn't anything to copy the kind of had to make it up yeah and I mean who is such a great film and Bill to this day and the look you know I mean it shouldn't work by all right now it's like a big hook nose you know but it works great and she had nothing you know I mean now we can add so much stuff and I find that happen so much now liquid that face off show and stuff people it's more like about how much can you pile on someone's face you know but sometimes the most effective makeups are just a little bit of things that you do and a lot of the humanities Opera yeah he's another one who said there was not much to frame to go on and it wasn't he was kind of like a Pioneer and like I said plastic piece to use it to close up boxers wounds and stuff crazy stop and think about that you don't film itself it only been cold then you have not very video of it the whole thing about the way he moved like everything was so creepy and interesting film his fingers later I mean in in like the John Barrymore dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde the brilliant so what did they do for his ears you know what I'm not sure what they're made out of same with the bald head I mean I know rubber existed and I mean you can kinda Sammy's got I think it's probably just like a slip bobber which is like telling Master made out of rate and I also think it's because Max Reckless great if you didn't if nothing like this existed and it was dark out and you saw a guy like that in your house you would freak out and I also think it's because Max Reckless great if you didn't if nothing like this existed and it was dark out and you saw a guy like that in your house you would freak out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> was that was not the case with the Cantina scene in Star Wars cuz the Star Wars scene there's that's that's a crazy scene because you got so many characters in that scene and today when you go back and look at it like it's pretty cheap George wanted to embellish on it didn't like a lot of the stuff that he did so at ilm which was in Van Nuys then industrial like magic when I first started the guys were doing the visual effects for for that for Star Wars my friends that I met at Chloe's didn't hear any kid Ralston we're shooting a special effects and George came in said do you know anybody that can make a mask cuz I knew I want to add some asks to the to The Cantina st. Louis do so he called me in as I went over Georgia flatbed editor showed me the sequence as it existed and I was flipping out and see what a cool idea to have this bar for alien Juno &amp; Co on us to do what you do on that has talking like this kind of like a alien throw in there that there's a devil guy that one. Made up Fighters before Star Wars you know there's a werewolf guy in enough yeah that was such a great team too though these are storyboards thinks it's great that was never there and when you see the movie you think it's there and I've uses so many times where I say can we shoot this like in post-production that's the devil guy in these guys were the guys open when the guys a different people in two different time and I sent an email I when I say to people let's can we shoot this impose then cuz what happens to your most directors don't like dealing with this this yet you know and I'll put it off to the last shot of the day and then it's like what you got 45 minutes in a shot country months later did you know that no music playing through these are some of our aliens people I did not make that one that was on Stewart's people think of it finally you know the end is more that it's a great idea than thick work is great it was a great conglomeration of cool characters all in one bar and you know where the time goes completely unique and new things but after that every movie every Space movie had a Cantina Sandy and you know at the time it was a completely unique and new things hell yeah but after that every movie every Space movie had a Cantina scene you know and it's like a miracle out to every transformation that was basically the same</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what's up Joe Rogan I'm alive I've been following this whole everybody's been following you yeah and what cocaine does to you so I feel good I feel good I mean it's I got nine months clean two days ago was like what do they say you have to get over before you stay clean a halfway house the last eight months and it was some of the craziest motherfukers you've ever met in your life and they don't have stories but once they know my story cuz I had some success in life basically as a full-blown junkie they're fascinated by it but and the first time I got high was 1979 I wish I hit a homerun in Little League I'll never forget this and I my buddies older brother we supposed to get sick Jack I don't know what happened to him but he he had to be a joint and I took a puff of weed and from 11 years old I knew I loved it so much I just love being I love the feeling but I was f***** up and my old man was a lunatic he was not a drug addict or an alcoholic but he was a criminal was a low-level criminal he gave me these streets into work and got like the 10th grade in high school and he was like my favorite human being a little time he was like my older brother but I saw him do a lot of bad s*** Tyson fight all the time he was a boxer when he was young and it just the real street smart guy and his life was chaos and I love the chaos I was addicted to risk that's why I'm a gambler to so when cocaine came into my life a few years later I was 16 the first time I did a line of blow and that was really fun because now you're up all the time and and that started basically a 35-year drug run That's it man to like 9 months ago I mean that's the thing I don't feel pressure on myself it's one that one-day-at-a-time stuff that sounds so cliche but I can't guarantee got everything like that but I'm a little more spiritual I would say and everybody else 4Kids man are looking at a lot of jail time prison time delivered under a f****** Bridge some of these kids and they got nothing that's why you know the careers that me and you have a congratulations on your but you know fashion anywhere I'm never going to get high again the one thing to say you're never going to do anything again for me at 52 years old I love it you got to say I love I love being high I love the chaos I love the lifestyle you get a ticket to the lifestyle to live like you don't live like everybody else you know and I had a means of making money legally and you know these kids out of Rob does it take to get all the s*** and and so that was enabling to we live in an enabler world but to say you're never going to get high again this so much pressure to say I don't know and just work on the next day and for me it's like I take it minute by minute literally like we're here on the Lower East Side back in the 80s and get mescaline hits back in the day there's triggers all over the place so I just say if I can get this one more just get one more block without f****** up that turns into a day and in time you know so it's it's harder to say for yourself I'll never get high again there's triggers all over the place so I just say if I can get this one more just get one more block without f****** up that turns into a day and in time you know so it's it's harder to say for yourself I'll never get high again</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you talk about the method thing with getting clean the 12-step program which a lot of people obviously if you're not in it you know what the legendary iconic program aana to the 12-step You by you helping other people it helps you and I'll wait cuz that's what you're talkin about productive way to use your time is a guy dying and his family needs us I don't even know the guy you're going to try to help them so by the end of helping him for 5 hours you maybe save him but you're also saving you begin at the beginning and they realized if I talk to each other they can stop they healthy Hospital in the mid-thirties and they would say to the people to hospital is there anybody in the drunk Ward like a hopeless alcoholic state or Twisted we found a cure for alcoholism we think we found a cure for alcoholism can we talk to your husband and she goes you know what that sounds like a total fantasy to me you could try we've tried everything I don't know how you met Acura and they said no no you understand he's going to kill us like by talking to him we're going to get better like he's going to kill rust and hopefully along the way he gets it wow it's like you're using your time for something insanely productive like you're a generous guy you like helping people you're a good friend you know it's a little bit of a rush because it helps you if you are you going to help you but I get a rush like that helps me you spend all this time working on them you've stayed playing you know it also doesn't radiates they'll do the same thing they realize and somebody help them and that it helped you to help them and they'll do it to someone else and I'll feel it as well and then also spreads the culture of being generous again that's very insightful because that's what it is is the dominant culture being generous is very important being friendly I think now we're in the internet are like the internet era is Terrorism much more generous era because it actually helps everybody to have all these shows and no one's competing against each other in a sense because you know we right to be like there was one host the Tonight Show everybody everybody to get that f****** job and it was those late-night War the movie with the Lettermen the comics and everybody was just f****** fighting in the trenches with 9 with character that's your attitude which is great you live that lifestyle like I was saying is important like if you were hosting the Tonight Show Jimmy but to have me out of mainstream show talkin like this there's consequences yes they can't do it that they would fight you to have me on your situation where me and you were two guys we've known each other a long time who respect each other's work and his people and I'm a guy I'm trying to get back on my feet and you your company or can you let me do this</div>

Solve the wake us up but so that's one thing 30 years of drug use but this was a crazy story so there was the stripper I used to go on the road with and she would meet me at city's you got you from Boston so we're at a hotel in St Louis about about 5 years ago now four years ago and we're snorting oxycodone so to support the pills you got a crush them up somewhere in this hotel room that night at a big deer and I take a shower about five pills and starts Prussia we have room service the room service had a salt shaker that was glass so she couldn't Crush one of the pills she takes she takes the salt shaker and starts hitting the pill with it and the salt shaker breaks glass breaks in the powder she cuts out like four lines she gets pulled onto the desk to go I bought a gift so she goes down to get the gift I come out of the bathroom I see the lines and I take I take a pain that I cut down and I snort when the lines and has glass in it I snorted glass and oxycodone he was he had a bad plan but that way to try to get money out of me and the bookie bleeder I went to the hospital I have to cancel the show and I want to strangle a girl and that's what it caved in that started the process if you watch the show crashing at 3 Seasons you could see my nose morphing into what it is now like from over things really knows the like what it is now and part of me doesn't want to get it fixed because every time I look in the mirror I go did this is this is what happened to me a reminder maybe tonight f****** again maybe it tells kids that so it's just such a dangerous thing to get it fixed and then to be in that kind of intense pain and then have the temptation to take a pill used and I got out and I was like I didn't use it when I had knee surgery either I'd I'd like them how you feel at euphoria that morphine drip not even close get out of there this way they claim it's a disease I'm smart enough to realize that too but I do it anyway I never got into the drugs at a young age yeah I sold mine I took Percocets I think it was Percocets when I had my first knee operation after the morphine drip I got out to give me Percocets I took it one day and it was it made me so stupid okay remember sitting on my couch. I'm so dumb right now right I was on the liver list and then my liver came back out whole I guess they talked about on the transplant list that they would think they were about to put me on the list the doctor said to my family said he's going to need a liver dishes like this is 5 years ago what are you do for like 4 days when I didn't cut it out but yeah they had it they had to go in they do a search with a knock you out I got to go up and they clean that I had surgery again a couple years ago to do it and he was like I don't know because I never said I could Itachi never saw or snow does incredible congratulations what it feels like when you get out of the hospital right whether or not that would disrupt your progress enough the point we used to live right back I'm right into this but the doctor advice was was was cool about you said you need more clean time be at least a year or even try well good for him for thinking that way instead of just but I can breathe Horizon like what I never look like David Beckham ever look like they're going to give you some material</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how long did this let me know how long did you sit on the story how long did you know about this in the hot what was the process of having this with a building your mind to point where you wanted to write a directive produce It cast it honestly I read the book exactly 20 years ago I read it in the fall of 99 when I was went Fight Club came out that's right around the time as I read this novel motherless Brooklyn but but the novels about the tragic Detective who's trying to solve the murder of his only friend basically but it takes place in the 90s it's not about any of that stuff about New York in the 50s or anything it's just the characters just amazing though like amazing so when I read it the hook was the character I was like I was like what a great character it's so it's such a wild he's like I just as hot mess of of he's smart but he's totally messed up he's he's funny but also really pretty painful and lonely and it was at everything and I was like that's I could get so into trying to figure that out for reasons that are a little hard to explain the tone of the book feels like a 50s detective novel but it's set in the modern world and I was afraid in a movie that would feel a little bit like The Blues Brothers like guys in fedoras Butta Priuses maybe this would just be cooler if we set it in the fifties and I talked to the author about that and he was super into those movies and so he said okay so then then but then the middle. Was the. Of mashing that up with the with these sort of Stories the New York Chinatown kind of of it the the deep dark history of what really went on a New York and that took a long time and then I had it ready in two 12 I was really ready to go and I just couldn't get it to. Couldn't get Bruce was that he was in and that was kind of I couldn't get everyone I wanted together at the same time and I couldn't get them the amount of money I needed or that I thought I wanted and I couldn't get a studio to the back yet because honestly you know number one like I'm not like you know I'm not like a green light anything he does kind of an actor that yeah I think that's a death of a different sort of thing but also I was out there saying it's sort of like Rain Man meets LA Confidential in people's eyes just kind of cross they're like they're like bring it the next one like they're like we don't get it we don't get it if we don't get yet it's like getting I love Radiohead and I like jazz and I wanted to like I got Thom Yorke to write a song for the film but I got Wynton Marsalis to do all the Jazz and stuff and people were also they were like this is these things are not going to go well together you know and then they went to get like a lot of people have said to me which is not a lot of people send me the best music in a film that they've heard in many many years flea flea played trumpet and and bass on Thom Yorke back in the film and and Fleet you know fleas like a really good trumpet player and his dad was a jazz musician and I didn't know that Fleet came out of the movie like crying he was like that's honestly my favorite music that I've ever heard in awhile and I think an end but you can't you can't tell people that you I thought that would work I thought this mashup would work cuz I knew Tom and I knew he loves Charles Mingus and and I knew when was capable of doing he's really interested in dissonant weird edgier kind of modernist music as well and I was like this is going to work and it and it did its it's really the music's amazing in the film it it's like its own like the record the records out now and people are flipping out about that just the music in the movie hasn't even come out yet such a crazy combination of factors and details that you smashed all together and they got a feel for a guy to be a tremendous relief and also feel amazing that it's you did it I did I do feel that I feel like it would have haunted me about it at times like you know I've done a few okay things like I've done some stuff that was weird and that people didn't understand and it's it's come together pretty great you know what I mean and add a user to go God I never I never expect anybody to give me money to make something like that that's just risky like I would never put money into making movies never like it's too risky you know and I get it so I'm not like I deserve this like but it was more like sometimes I was just like am I going to be able to figure this out or not am I getting it done and having it quit on it and in some ways feeling not actually knowing that it's better that I made it now I know more I was more if I'd tried to do it 20 years ago I couldn't find another jobs to do some of the things I like working with Spike Lee and Alejandro and you're ready when people like that really like it up to my sense of how to do I learned a lot about how to do a big thing with out all the in the world now this is released Nationwide worldwide like when it's released on this Friday right you just brought it comes out like you can either see Terminator like not 9.11 or or ours there's like not and I I like certify on Joe Rogan Experience like there's not a grown-up human being who will not be stoked about this film like I can say that people who are seeing it are are very very very very into it and very bought in because it is one of those like it's a it's a big meal but it's a really like it's a really rich good meal and it has amazing amazing performances Alec Baldwin has ever been better in a movie honestly and I think Willem dafoe's amazing Michael K Williams is amazing and the music is great and and it's a it's a cool story and I think I think it's kind of one of those things that it's worth going to the theater to see but I I guarantee you it's more worth your time then another Terminator movie it's a cool story and I think um I think it's kind of one of those things that it's worth going to the theater to see but I I guarantee you it's more worth your time then another Terminator like it sounds like it to me I'm really excited about it and I will see it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> as someone who doesn't make movies I always wonder like what happened between like say Steve McQueen's LeMans did you ever see that movie or even remember how there's no dialogue at all would like the longest time and I remember I watched it recently within the last couple years and one of the thoughts was I don't even know if they could do this today if anybody would allow them to make a movie where no one talks for a long time they just sort of setting the stage of what it means to be a race car driving with the atmosphere races it's just the idea that you were saying earlier about having this short attention span theater this this these movies that are designed for what they believe is a populist people that don't have the interest in something that's more unique or something that requires thought something to drag you win and that was much more common in the past like why was it more common in in that area Queen and all those other movies that they did like that and what has happened and what these rare examples like when I got does breakthrough with something like do the right thing or a few other examples why doesn't that stimulate that the appetite for more well did that hard to do on one level on one level yeah it's it's it's it's easy to recognize when they're great but it's still not eat it still. to make them great I still were talking about people who are some of our greatest artists or directors you know what I mean they and lots of people they try on some level they try on some level but they just not everybody is Spike Lee mean not everybody is Francis Coppola or you know I'd say it's like people people sometimes people make actually are slow you know what I mean like you don't even you're like that it's like it's like in spinal tap when they're like it's a it's a fine line between stupid and clap you know it's a fine line between clever and stupid you know what I mean it's like it's if I think people try but I think there's some people who really do think Jaws had a big effect on movies be it was theirs like the first true Blockbuster right and I'm wrong what happens more often than not is adult people get the jobs at the big companies that make the decisions about what to make right and a certain point they sort of age out they start to age out and they don't actually have any idea what what the vibe is they don't know what to make for the coming wave of younger people and so these little windows open up now and then we're in that are they needed there was they needed new people they needed like you know George Lucas make an American Graffiti nobody thought that nobody you know they they open up if they we don't know what to do do something different and a couple of new voices like come in and they make things that are are really different you know but the idea that that was only then like do the whole book right now about 1999 you know there's a book that came out about how 1999 was one of those years where because of the Studio's I kind of lost their sense of exactly what to do and Miramax was making a s*** ton of money planet or driven movies made for low cost in the Studio's all went and set up little mini Miramax is right and the result was that like in that year you had like Meg you know Paul Thomas Anderson Wes Anderson Alexander Payne Spike Jones David o'russell Fincher the wachowskis like an unbelievable array of directors made really really memorable films in that year and I think it was because it was like another one of those moments like we tweet we don't know what we don't know what to do we're just going to have to like close our eyes and go you kids you kids figure it out you know what I mean when you have so many moving pieces and so many people involved that have a say in the decision-making process it's got to be insanely difficult to get something out that's pure yes that's that's true. Francis Coppola said that the best thing about making films is that their collaborative in the worst thing about making films has that their collaboration the last it's the last moral totalitarian job in the world like being a director the best thing about making films is that their collaborative in the worst thing about making films has that they're collaborative he also said it's the last it's the last moral totalitarian job in the world like being a director or so.

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I also think there's a funny thing which is there's this history of famous actors right so when I do think it is where it begins with Brando cuz Brando had such an enormous effect on the psychology of men in in America he really really like and if you look at what I would call like that great generation of American actors the the Dustin Hoffman Robert De Niro Robert Duvall Gene Hackman Al Pacino Morgan Freeman Meryl Streep that's all like the post Brando Generation all of those people literally all of them wanted to come actors because of my own brand up and and he he's so rewrote the idea of what it was what it could be that you had got a whole it was like what Bob Dylan did in in the culture was I get rewrote like it just rewrote the game all he did was absolutely all who come and they have they have like a kind of us a permanent that there a permanent before and after in in a certain kind of field you know what I mean guitar and yeah yeah yes I would say so I would say so in rock guitar yet it is interesting when you go back and look at rocks in that era does that famous story of I think of I don't remember if it's like Pete Townsend making Eric Clapton come with him to your Hendrickson can crying yes you know about it but you keep but you also can't discount laklak Clapton in and you know there's those famous photos of the wall Clapton is God like like there's it's it's hard to like you can't really underweight what Clapton did took guitar and guitar you know in that era to write know he was phenomenal a new dimension for the membrane of existence into this new sound and there's guys that are like their there's people that have a distinct set liked you a Gary Clark jr. fan know I can't Gary Clark jr. blues guitarist he has a sound that's almost instantaneously recognizable is Gary Clark jr. you hear me oh my God everyone was just like they just walk away Jesus Christ well phenomenal I feel that way by Willie Nelson I think Willie Nelson is legitimately in and country music like there's before and after Willie Nelson like an end you can say that he know that Hank Williams Junior whatever that he but Willie Willie Nelson to me is the hinge around which it goes from being something that had you know then it had a Nashville kind of Grand old Opry kind of Polish to it and he basically took it he Rico in Elvis like American Roots thing at end put jazz in it that's what's so crazy is anyone that plays music knows like Willie Nelson is essentially a jazz guitar player like and and he's you know red headed stranger is that to me that's a before-and-after kind of a thing to like there's that out the whole Outlaw thing and I think there's a whole lot of it it's almost like after that there's two camps they're still going to the you know the Steve Earle Copperhead Road thing as more pups thing but then there's like Steve real Roots Steve Earle you know what I mean it's like he almost like straddled it but but my point by Brando was just at like he he he changed the he changed the idea of the type of person that male actors wanted to be they want and suddenly it was like he wanted to have like a patina or a reputation as a visceral they wanted to be visceral not polish they wanted to be muscular they wanted to be masculine they wanted to be you know of intense like that those were not the kind of words that people when you think I can like Jimmy Stewart Cary Grant like that that is not what that is not what movie stars were aspiring to they were aspiring to polish a kind of a Polish before Brando and I was an author Brandon to his performances where you go all this is more like real life than a fit like on the waterfront I could have been a contender thing you like when he's doing that you like this is how someone would actually behave if they felt like their life has been a disaster and it could have been avoided what you just hit on something know that and drives me nuts when people talk about their like the like the Stanley Kowalski the Bruno masculinity Etc that sing about Brando isn't he is beautiful he's in he's kind of just enormous Roman looking guy but it's where he kills where he really kills his this kind of broken sensitivity had and and I could have been a contender is not a tough guy speed it's the opposite and it's a broken tough guy it's a guy practically crying saying like you were my future my brother and you should have looked out for me I needed you looking out for me and my life is my life's going down the toilet because of that in that moment you didn't look out for me it is like tearful it's not even the best moment of Stanley Kowalski streetcar is is really it's like when he falls on his knees in front of his wife and cries you know what I mean it's like that's what he will he was way better in in a lot of ways to me it's the fact that he was actually kind of in touch with his emotional life it's not that he was running so Macho at all it said he looked that way but he was but he actually had this like Poetic sensitivity and it was it resonated real like it felt real if you watch actors before him there was a certain undeniable thing element to what they were doing that was like all this guy's acting where is he was he seemed like a guy who is really living the scene yeah yeah and some of it it sometimes I need sound instrument of person but he has this crazy he's he looks the way he looks but he's got this marble mouth he does he not articulate he doesn't come off as like he does a machinist to the way he speaks in a kind of a yeah it it doesn't have style you know that the guys before that it was you felt their hurt you felt that they were working on their style and and he seemed to be sort of like scratching his ribs and and mumbling him and you know in a T-shirt and he just was present in the moment organic fat guy and he just just giving into all of his vices and he was just this guy he was a beautiful man he just didn't seem to give a f*** about that at all yeah I think he said something to me one time about how how much he was enjoying his life when he was like 23 and and he's like I hit you know you know what he was doing the play streetcar that made him famous he was telling me like he would get with his pal Diego and go up to Harlem go to clubs and hit on girl send all these things and I said you weren't aware of what was going on you know and he goes well there was I was aware of a certain amount of noise rising and then one day I woke up and I was sitting on a pile of candy that's what I'm not even joking to me it's like what you said it was like after that there is like there was no boundaries he was like the gate he was getting ever everything was he could he wasn't going to be able to resist he wasn't disciplined he wasn't a super disciplined person he was very poetic person and I don't think he was disciplined than I think that a lot of what happened he had like something like 17 children and and he got you know he had appetites and he had these things and I think that I do think that he you know struggling struggled to to deal with all the things that came with being that famous Uno and being that famous when there wasn't really a lot of examples of how to do it right or wrong before you yeah for the Elvis thing how to deal with all the things that came with being that famous Uno and being that famous when there wasn't really a lot of examples of how to do it right or wrong before you yeah for the Elvis thing</div>

You know I don't know what it means what you think it means he was just constantly going buzz off man I'm not picking it apart for you I'm not going to pick it apart for you I'm not going to like buy into this stuff you're putting at me and how did he eat he was 20 20 21 years old like calling all over them to call him great when their daddy nobody nobody has that kind of like sensibility to go everything you're bringing it me is going to be bad for me and if you watch those interviews with him when he's at age it's pretty astonishing because to your point like you're like a thoughtful act whatever I look at him and I'm like nobody has that discipline at that age is amazing how uniquely qualified he was 4 position at that point timing it very strange tumultuous time in history as well and not only that right at the moment that that like Johnny Baez brings them out on the stage at the Newport Folk Festival and basically goes this is the prince this is I anoint to he's the one he's Neo he's the he is the one and the next year he doesn't even take one year to go to go let me just let me just lean into your love Theory comes with an electric guitar and plugs it in at the Newport Folk Festival and people start screaming in agony like going what are you doing like your Bob Dylan you're the king of folk you can't plug in a guitar and people are like running to try to cut his cords with an ax in this thing like that's how much of a betrayal and he's like there's people yelling Trader at him and he's going I don't believe you you know I think you're a liar like any any turning around Robbie Robertson and go and play it Loud I mean the guy is so punk rock so totally Punk Rocky he was as punk rock has anybody ever I think he probably had to be just to resist what they were trying to box him into yeah and bite but there's never been anybody who was more like do you like what I'm doing I'm gone I'm over here like enjoy your going to not like it because you like what I just did now where I'm going you're going to be discombobulated and upset and eventually you're going to catch up and then when you catch up I'm going to move on to something else like it's it's really it really is amazing is amazing how many people do you know in any of the things we all do who get a taste of the thing and don't like lean into it for awhile right like who don't kind of go well this feels good you know maybe I'll just hang out right here and</div>

That was pretty light one this one is more on this take place in the 50s in New York and it's kind of got a Chinatown LA Confidential kind of Noir been to it it's a it's a mystery and murder mystery of kind of that leads into some of the stuff that happened in New York in the 50s that is hard to believe because New York was New York was run by it was run by basically a Darth Vader like figure who never elected to public office and people thought he was the parks Commissioner of New York but he was from 1930 to 1968 he had uncontested authoritarian power over New York City in New York state and he made every significant decision about the way that the modern infrastructure of New York was built where the roads went where the bridges were built what was torn down where the projects were billed he and he was very racist and he baked like really discriminatory things that almost sound like conspiracy theories are so wild and intense into the agency that he was responsible for the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn and going to La and nobody knows this like that you think of meeting New York is the great that's like the great egalitarians Melting Pot City where democracy works except that it was run by a total autocrat from basically about 1932 about 9 how is that even possible and how how come no one knows about this how did you find out it will people do there's there's there's heat like in one of the big Burns Brothers documentaries about New York there's a hole literally almost a whole episode on him there's a great book about him. It won the Pulitzer Prize and there's his name was Robert Moses and he has Robert Moses State Beach in New York and but literally people think he was the parks commissioner but he was and he was like Anakin Skywalker he was like a Jedi Knight he was a big liberal Progressive believer in Progressive change and government reform and in his early years he got crushed by Tammany Hall and and the power Brokers and he went he went dark went completely yeah that's not the most imposing picture of him after that cuz there's a scene in our movie where Alec Baldwin is literally look like that yeah that Alec Baldwin plays a character whose based on and him inspired by him I should say it's not at all in my phone that's not the true story but yeah there you go and but I think this idea I was really interested in this idea you don't know what the hell is going on in that movie like until the until 20 minutes before the end you have absolutely no idea really what's going on in that movie but it's just sexy it's like the music is amazing the photography incredible the actors are like adult and real and he's he's Nicholson write the hook is like Nicholson is so cool you really will kind of follow him you'll watch the way he deals with anything and just you're just laughing and enjoying it right but Underneath It All when you're done you go did that is that true to the LA is La basically built on Stolen water is that like the like LA's original sin is that people made fortunes the valley was just farms and they stole the water from up north in you know rig the game and maybe gigantic fortunes by irrigating San Fernando Valley and you you come away with like you play with an awareness that like the California stories not exactly what it's cracked up to be right it's there's some big crimes underneath it and and the people who end and that in that movie it's like people ripped everybody off they fake droughts they they created for themselves and a type of people who did that also rape their daughters literally that's like what that movie is about it's pretty bleak it's like you can't make a difference you cannot anything like any of you try the person you're trying to help is going to end up with a bullet through her I dead on the steering wheel like it's it's a really dark movie and people forget that cuz he's gone Nicholson Faye Dunaway it's like that's a really really Bleak movie but I love I love the idea that that you can do things we're like the the pleasure of it is like the pleasure of movies it's grown-up is kind of what we've been talking about it's like like if you said the most people as usual Chinatown the most critics today that go long boring whatever it's like you want to say f*** off like f*** off like what what is it that you why are you why are you assuming people can't handle grown-up you know what I mean and I think that that I really dig those things where you go through the movie starts you look at it and you go this looks really good this looks really grown up this is big the actors are like like adult and authoritative the dialogues great the music is great it's hypnotic and your brain just goes I don't know what's going on I don't care I'm bought in and then and if there's is a character in it that you can hook into you float you float through those movies you just kind of go where's this going what's going on I don't know man that she's great he's great wow all juicy and great and by the end you get somewhere and you got to go that actually was about big things that those things really happen you know that's I really dig those movies I did Chinatown LA Confidential I think the Godfather works that way the Godfathers about immigrants you know it's about immigrants normalizing in America that's a long movie you just settle in for that couldn't be better I couldn't be happier to be watching this scene after scene after scene and I wanted to make I've wanted to try I wanted to try to make one of those you know myself like I wanted to try to to make one of those cuz I don't like they don't make those anymore but I think you know they were always hard not like they were easy once and now they're hard they're all they're always hard but I would look at people like One baby he may dreads you know which is great movies from that era even like Spike Lee doing do the right thing I don't know if you remember when that movie hit sure it was massive a huge deal to me I was like 18 or 19 the game like this kid who the hell is that he wrote it and directed he acted in it he got Public Enemy to do the music it's like oh my God huge swing and connected on like every level and it didn't even give you some BS kind of like don't worry it's going to be okay in the end it was like Martin Luther King says violence is not the way Malcolm X says sometimes it's the only rational response what do you think you know what I mean it was so ballsy it was so ballsy that movie and I think like after while it's more like I just started feeling like well you know I don't really need to gig I might as well I've worked with a lot of great people I've worked with some pretty great directors including Spike and I was kind of like the New York long time and I just thought it was really weird no one knew that story and I was like I'm going to try to make one about this you know</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what is truyou it's it's a very young cuz like I made this movie I had like I had a fraction of like the budget of the Irishman right I'm just at which I'm naming only cuz it was a period piece Dino mines in the 50s down and I had like like less days to do it then I had on my first movie that I directed 130 day suit and and 46 days is less than most movies I've made and this was a big 1950s like. Film with a huge like French Connection style chart car chase in the opening running through Harlem across the bridge down in the Queen's you know we weren't like making a little kitchen sink drama and to figure that out that is like you can be like on the division we're going to do this but there's a kind of Madness and saying this is what I want to do I want to recreate the old Penn Station that doesn't exist anymore right which we have in the film like my character goes into the old Penn Station that was torn down in 1963 or whatever and and you only pull that off with the most Kick-Ass Justice League of collaborators imaginable like they make you look like you're a Visionary or know what you're doing because you these people with crazy talents of their own and I don't mean just cast although I had that too in this I mean like some of the very very very best people bring their their talent to like making that work and and so that's like when you say like your job is is more to say I have really talented people I've got to get their frequency wave in line with mine if I can get their frequency wave in lines mind and it can be my my idea my vision my weird ideas can be in there but it's with is executed with the help of people who believe in it and buy into it you know that's that the key is like your your your marshaling people to get to it in sync with you and and you know I have a sick cat it's like Bruce Willis Alec Baldwin Willem Dafoe Bobby Cannavale Michael K Williams it was like Omar on The Wire this great actress gugu mbatha-raw and Leslie Mann and you know on and on and on and I got and all these people did this as a favor to me because I didn't have any money to do it starting with Bruce Bruce was like you know he said to me a long time ago out if you have something good I want to be in it I really want to do the kind of stuff you're doing and I really mean it. I'll do anything you want to do and help you get it done as like he's not going to remember that you know he's going to be like a shirt but I'm doing die hard like for the rest of the year and he didn't he was like where do you need me I told you I'm in let's get it done and basically Bruce Alec will and people like that I practically call them cough and answers on my phone cuz they only got it done because they deferred everything you know and I think that's really cool that's amazing yeah when you write something like this car chasing through Harlem mean I would imagine the logistics of pulling something like that got to be insane cuz if he has nuts how does it when you wrote it and you brought it to the people that are the stunt people the people that coordinate these Chase scenes with a like off f*** people yes you know doing the things is not hard getting permission to do them in Manhattan is is tricky and there are people who look at you like you're dreaming now you're not and what you do is you go out and Scout and you start you say look this is due this year and this year in this isn't hard to stand how we only need this one block cleared I think then you like find that place where you're like I want him to do a huge screeching turn on the Frederick Douglass Boulevard because it has a 9 block stretch where there's very few buildings that don't look like they're in the 50s right leading up to a bridge that you wanted to go over the bridge and then you get with like the guy the NYPD and you beg like you just beg you go look we're going to be like The Dirty Dozen we're going to have everything is going to be so well-planned and ready to go will be able to will say just shut it down and then 20 minutes will be done you know what I mean like you you start to get this this turn the car around the corner and headed up the Avenue with 80 cars 50s clothes and legitimate 1950s Carswell so those things handle like they're horrible their boats with wheels on do any car that's actually got to be doing anything like going fast or making a big turn you have to have four of the same model that you painted identically because they're going to break like they will break your push one hard it will break and then you have to like bring the other one in while I know what I mean so you you you and you you basically can't don't go fast you know they don't have pick up front so you're you're figuring out like what are the moves we can make that make it feel like this thing is really bombing and and and how do we cross cut around the fact that it takes three blocks for it to accelerate I mean like literally to go from you know 10 miles an hour to 40 you need like literally like 3 or 4 blocks so you have to like get it up to speed for the section that you wanted going fast and it's it's it's I'm not another. Movie I'm doing a book the next movie I'm doing is going to have Tesla p100d that go like 0 to 60 + 2.4 now when you when you write this out how much time is involved in preparation of writing this and then doing all the scouting and then trying to implement this whole to me couple years to write it because I haven't even said in that he got to know yourself I'm not Bogart I'm not like Jack Nicholson the magic they bring is the magic they bringing the character I put it the middle of this has the detective detective that I play has Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive Disorder so he eat he can't like when he when he needs a blond at the bar he's like the opposite of Bogart he he tried to light a match and can't stop blowing it out because it doesn't sound right to him so it's he's kind of a train wreck like he's the opposite of a cool detective and in fact Bruce Willis plays the cool detective who he works for so like Bruce Willis is Nicholson but when something bad happens to him and my guy has to like step out of the assistant role you know he's just like his operative because he has a great memory he has like a photographic memory and some really weird abilities like because his brain is is chaotic and crazy he has certain little gif did Bruce Willis like relies on him for and believes in him but when but when he has the sort of figure out what happened to his boss and solve this mystery like he kind of has to come out on his own out of his comfort zone and kind of become a detective and and it didn't and it's like you know he's taking and twitching and shouting and doing things that make it very difficult for him to move in the world so that's kind of like I had that part of it grafting it into this story of of what happened in New York in the 50s and it took me a long time to write it and get it right but once I had it right you know we probably prep the movie for like nine months we we we were we were actively like scouting New York you know ends and imagining like where can we do this and how can we do this but I live in New York so I left it I like get on my motorcycle and go up to Harlem in Washington Heights in and literally like cruise around just cruise around I know the area really well anyway but sometimes you just have to like just and that's where a bike in New York is really great like cuz you can just order float around float around float around mentally mapping like where you can do a thing and and it was it was pretty fun but sometimes you just have to like just enough for a bike in New York is really great like cuz you can just order float around float around float around mentally mapping like where you can do a thing and and it was it was pretty fun</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's why is it hard as an actor to if you if you get an iconic role and then you are sort of always remembered for being that guy in that thing like a how how much of a is it is it a hard transition to go from an iconic role to going to next row with people still want to talk about the the big movie that you were in just a year or two ago I think I tend to take a bit of time between things and also I don't know which one I you don't like the first thing I did what kind of popped off pretty hot and then and then everyone's like sending me like you do psycho psychotic musical with Woody Allen you know what I mean and I wear a plaid jacket and you would dance number in Harry Winston's like yeah or lawyer lawyer in the Larry Flynt phone right which that I got this distinct Vibe hey the next John Grisham movie is the way you were talking and Courtney when is John Grisham thing is the young lawyer whatever and I'm and I remember I met Francis Coppola was going to direct The Rainmaker Grisham thing and I was up for it I didn't get it Matt Damon got it I didn't do some balls a thing like say that's not for me I was like I was like Francis Coppola died like I want this and thinking to myself a little bit like square but it's like Francis Coppola you know what I mean and it's like an end he when I was talking to him about it he was like what you know what it what are you intrude what are you working on were you interested in and I was telling him about my friend David who would written American she acts and that we were working on the outcome of telling him what we were trying to do with it and how he wanted to make it as this kind of like gorillas you know singing and he was like you should do that you should do that immediately and I was like don't cancel don't don't you know I still want to do this with you he's like no no I think you should do like the way you're talking about that and he said if you do that now they'll never do never know what to do with you but they'll never they'll never be able to put you in a box because that's just you know if you pull that off and I kind of was like I did have an agent at the time really old school really funny and he was kind of like he'd understand that he was like he was like find something big let's find something big big director big film big franchise whatever and I I remember thinking like 9 I think I'm going to do this and and we knock that off and the funny things you say was that become a trap that wasn't a trap that was like a Liberation it's almost like doing that part it was like a permit in Hand Grenade on it was like it was like well but we never know what to expect now right so it's a becomes like Liberation on his at a certain point cuz like I weigh 150 you know like I'm not being so like once you do something like that it's sort of like disguise disguise you know like I'm not being so like once you do something like that it's sort of like just got this guy's going to do with him you know what I mean and then it just sort of like you get to decide for yourself anyway</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how did that seem come to play where you were with Hixon Gracie cuz I cuz I was I studied Aikido when I was in college I was studying Aikido and then when I was studying Aikido hoist Gracie one I became aware that you're right you're right cuz I was in New York I was studying Aikido in New York and and hoist Gracie one that first UFC and like I said I'm on 60 tall but I literally if I'm in shape I waved like 155 right and voice when he won that was 170 like 60 and under 180 right and it melted everybody's mind everybody's mind and I so I became interested in them and and what they were doing honestly do you do you know that you know in the story in there in that families whole crazy story about being you know they were Scottish the grandfather was Scottish Rite and he was like a consular he was a Customs he was a customs official in Brazil and because he had a good relationship with the Japanese console and helped was with very generous in helping Japanese people get their papers to come through in in the Japanese console I think the story is who's who new Aikido and Jiu-Jitsu offered to like teaches Sons Helios the oldest son I think I think horian was the oldest son he's the one who created The Ultimate Fighting Championship at Hicks in the reason why I was so significant that you had him is that was the champion of the family like undeniably Undisputed everyone everyone throughout Jiu-Jitsu this is very very rare that one figure is universally recognized as being the superior product of Jiu Jitsu and that was Hixson yes heard that breakdown of it and I thought I thought apart story I think Hicks and told me when we were in Rio I think what he said to me was that the reason Gracie Jiu-Jitsu became its particular derivation and its particular kind of thing that allowed hoist to do so well with because their father was smaller than his brothers and they were all bigger and because he was smaller he adapted you know he adapted the styled of work for a smaller person against the bigger person obviously and then that kind of like reached its its Pinnacle with voice winning that it was wait a minute a guy his size just literally one in all four Mall size tournament like how is that possible you know what I mean and it was like it was like Jaw hits floor and to me what was really was I was really little all the way until literally the end of high school I was very small I grew a lot in my life when I was 17 but I was really interested in Japan and I was interested in martial arts and you know James clavell Shogun like you know and I'm and I would take my I took like a karate class and it scared me I thought it was people if they were bigger and faster it was just scary if you were little it was like I can it doesn't matter if I can do these combos or whatever in truth I'm terrified of anybody bigger than me and I don't feel that this is teaching me anything that I would have the confidence to to use to defend myself right that's how I felt as a kid and when I when I bum do Aikido I it completely changed my mind the guy there was an incredible teacher in New Haven when I was in college and he was small he was like what you know maybe smaller than his grace or whatever and the guy was unbelievably like potent by Just One of most potent teachers in anything I ever had I was riveted by this guy and and and it kind of started to make me believe that grab grappling and locking which there's a lot of did a lot of Jiu Jitsu and Aikido and I was sort of like I was asking it I started feeling like this this this makes me feel like I like kicking someone's ass at all it's just more like I feel more empowered I feel I feel able to handle an authentic situation which is it mentally empowering more than like I want to get into scraps in a way like well there's a secret to a much smaller person being able to lever a much bigger person and then that thing happened with the Gracie's and it was sort of like the whole thing cracked open it was like this it was like proof anyway you know and and if you were interested in that stuff it was an incredible moment but because of my interest in that for years went through headset Rio Rio and I've been working on this group of that movie and stuff and I was like I was really interested in this idea that bad is is desperate for control right that he desperately desperately needs to control his heart rate his breathing that it's a massive liability in his mind if he can't control his emotions and his adrenaline and I was like well who in the world at 9 in the videos and pics I never met him or any of them but I'd seen the videos of him doing the amazing stuff with his stomach like who's that I was like Philistines you're all Philistines is like and I would like find me Hixon Gracie and ask him if he'll do a scene with me in the movie being the guy who's training Banner to like calm himself and he was there and he did he did it with us and it was like I was like and there it is right here yeah yeah when I saw this in the movie I was like all f*** yeah like what a smart move yet and I was like I don't like ya SE I got I forgot this holy crap I haven't looked at this in a long time he's Lookout charismatic I mean the guy the guy could have been like Charles Bronson the movie star did you ever see choke the documentary one of the greatest documentaries in history in which is around 94 what is right after his brother had won the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the story was that if his brother lost Hickson was going in like the idea was level bringing hoist because it's more impressive he's a smaller man he's not physically imposing was Hixson in that video there he was older when he was young he was you know very fit and it was big into yoga and physical fitness and he have the strongest body of all the Graces and he looked very formidable where is Hoist looked unassuming and it was more of an advert did you get your voice could beat everybody and always wind up doing but if at any reason right they needed to bring in the big guy is going to be hex an invoice so we talked about it like X and could tap and left and right and everybody was like that doesn't even make sense is the Ultimate Fighting Champion he's the guy they would roll with Hickson and he would just dismantle everybody people that thought they understood you it's so that there's so many levels and layers to Jiu-Jitsu that even though it looks like what is the difference is guys doing in our bar you're doing in our bar their specifics in the intricate aspects of the positions at Hixson understood that they just didn't understand and then on top of that he had much greater control of his body because of his yoga background mean he he became obsessed with yoga and breathing and breathing and something called gymnastic natural which was like a style of movement that way sort of like Vinyasa yoga with all these like overflowing postures but also with a bunch of like almost like animal movements to it too and it was a very physically demanding thing and he became outstanding at that as well from the outside and it's a spiritual Pursuit because the person that can overcome all the obstacles you have to have but it's an intellectual Pursuit and it's a spiritual Pursuit because to be the person that can overcome all the obstacles you have to have incredible control of your emotions and your thought process is in your understanding of who you are and that I think is one of things that separated Hixson from everybody I used to</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this expands as fight for the Forgotten expands and you do more work in the Congo do you anticipate moving to other parts of the world and also we already in Uganda right we started that last year but we really kick-started it April with this big kind of celebration on the new land 5 Acres because it Dustin's donation we're going to take that up to 30 more Acres of 35 acres in Uganda we want to get that 200 we want to get it even more than that there's a that with fight for the Forgotten we could potentially start up a social Enterprise or what are those called be corpse or something like that where is a social entrepreneurship gig where we start up maybe a coffee Farm maybe a honey farm in these mountainous regions and the pygmies have a sustainable job they can't they love coffee and honey those are two things that they love coffee and coffee and honey but janji is a pigman grandfather and Elder in Mob of Kulu Village bajanji he's actually in the in the book a picture with my wife leaning over and she's squatting down she still as tall as he is and she's in a full Squat and she hid it was really little guy but this one time I saw him his grandkids are just raided of a Honeoye for beehive and they just had honey all over their hands their arms start a fire at the bottom and then they throw a Vine around it and then you just walk up it with your feet and you're holding on to the vine and it's crazy you take Xanax up there and then just start hacking into the tree with Africanized colony which are killer bees oh my God and no one else everyone else is freaked out by it how many hundreds hundreds but it's worth it to start that fire underneath that helps keep them off then if two people climb up it the soul person's job on the back is to have these leaves from a twig and they just are hitting the bees off of the guy rating the hive do you remember when everybody was worried that Africanized Killer Bees were going to come over here and kill us all yes a big fear with a 20 years ago all the killer bees have been spotted in New Mexico pretty much the same exact thing. Have you guys seen that there's certain type of honey that has some sort of psychedelic effect and it's a very popular honey I want to say Nepal but somewhere is it Nepal and that these guys they climb up to get the s*** it's like on the side of cliffs and Lexie TV everything else and yeah see these guys use these ropes to climb up to get the Rope looks sketchy as fuk that looks like some homemade s*** right there and so they this honey hunting work is very is the craziest thing I've seen people do but these guys this is a different kind of honey for some reason this honey make you trip balls the device documentary The Nepalese honey that makes people hallucinate so they had something into it no no no no no it has to do with whatever these plants these guys are getting a polymer yeah so they're making a psychedelic honey just naturally yes so you can put it in your tea and meet Jesus at seems dangerous and maybe maybe it's like a mild microdosing type out that's true yes so like that that's what they just grab it and eat it Honeycombs to welder Hunter yeah so these kids I think there's a video on my YouTube James you can find any of these kids climbing these trees and you just Justin Wren fight for the Forgotten is the YouTube channel and there's a skid that I put a GoPro on his head because he was just climbing trees like crazy until the canopy of the rainforest he's like 9 years old all my God x 200 feet in the air and heat down at us it's a 12-minute video or something we could fast-forward has any kind of safety harness or no he's literally just shimmying up at he doesn't have a fine with his arms and his thighs 9 he's just my daughter's tonight just so I can barely see him in the tree still because he's like over two hundred feet tall and is he getting up there really practice for to do things he had his bow and arrow up there so we could shoot nest in shoot birds out of nest and the trees from 200 feet up to a few. But he's shooting to other trees oh my God and then they that's how they collect honey we got them this is a little guy this is him going from a little tree to getting over to a huge tree next to it but that's sympathy and I live there for three months I think in this Village and he's seriously just scaling the tree as a 12-minute video it's while if we can ask him breathing why this guy is not even and he just keeps going until he gets and what you get is to the big part of the tree I should go back up a little bit more cuz he starts just zooming down he is so the top and looks down at us and whenever you see us I think this is what it is Maybe whenever he looks down look at that Ohio and that's not even when he's at the very top and he's just using his hands and feet he literally has no rope no Vine that goes like you should be under him to catch him yeah and that's not even when he's at the very top you just using his hands and feet he literally has no rope no Vine that goes like you should be under him to catch him yeah</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> have you caught everything that you can catch over there Dengue Fever malaria so just do and this is a parasitic can see us as well I think it's in the fluke family or worm hopefully everything else besides that this toxicity stuff Cipro or mefloquine back if you change your diet as well yeah mostly I eat meat but I hopefully vegetables like more of that like the small portion is meet nobody chicken or fish or something lean a lot of nuts and a lot of thick leafy green vegetables have you found that that's how that helped me a lot tell me alive juice with a Vitamix we're really starting to expand our mission and vision here Stateside to bully prevention because Joe it's nuts right now the second leading cause of death I'm so Butch is Raiden's grandfather and he is an old bull rider and Raiden lives with with bush and Claudia's grandparents right now and they found him within his forearm he wrote I want to kill myself in Sharpie and he's 12 12 bunch of the first time rating wanted to kill himself that he knew of one of those whenever raid was 9 years old with 9 years old and very suicidal and Butch said that that just makes his heart when they fall out of his chest and I'm his grandfather how does my 12 year old grandson not have enough to live for and the leading second leading cause of death among kids from 10 to 14 is suicide if you're between the ages of 10 to 14 what's the second reason and bullying is the cause of most that most of its crumbling cuz bullying is linked to the the increase in depression addiction isolation do they think that the people who do it is it because they were bullied at one point time were abused physically so they do think that in the easy way to remember that is hurt people hurt people hurt people hurt people are that's an addict or bully around but here's a statistics from the CDC Sony the CDC found out that I had dengue fever I'm in also the CDC to the study on bullying and the number three at risk of suicide is the bully the person that acts out by being a bully number to surprisingly the victim there the second highest risk so anything who's who's number one or number one is actually the one that does both they are bullied and in the act out by being a bully so they're getting it on both ends no parents and fans at all storm of negativity awfulness this is huge worm you do for a bully Awareness right like how can you how can you prevent it or how can we mitigate it I think it's by promoting a culture of cultivating a culture of kindness and I know that can sound a little wimpy now I don't think so at all and if you look at Rafael Lovato Jr he was bullied because he look like everybody else was there most Fighters I find were bullied and not being the bully in so I think to cultivate of culture kindness is actually the school in Oklahoma it's pretty awesome they're called Edmond Santa Fe they selected us between a 44 applicants so we were up against like boys and girls club and Make-a-Wish she's phenomenal organizations Special Olympics and some really really great Charities and non-profits out there last year at the school so foster home and they raised in a week this High School race $234,000 a high school in the philanthropy week cuz he wanted help these kids get a new like main Center among the foster homes so this year they selected us because they want to get are bully prevention program into public and private school what is the prevention program like what are so it's mostly character development with bully prevention inside of it so it's a 12 week program and it's 12 weekly lessons so we have it online it's digital it's on our website fight for the Forgotten. Org and if you click Heroes and waving you'll find that's a freaking what's called a Teddy Rose in Waiting what that is is there's a digital curriculum where I teach the teacher and struck the instructor how to instruct the lesson that week but then there's a video for the parents and for the students that's the weekly hero Challenge and so they get a weekly lesson or Matt chat discussion let me get a weekly challenge which the challenge will be something like recognize when you're being a bystander or my favorite is probably go out your mission this week is that your hero challenges go out and complete the secret random act of kindness so the rules are you have to be safe you have to be smart we have to be completely Anonymous and you have to go out and make someone feel great and so journal or report back to us you know what did you do how that make them feel how that make you feel how can you build onto this for next week and you go out and complete these missions because I think first you have to educate the kids that they are part of the solution and part of the problem that they just have to pick where they where they're going to be because in bowling if you stand by and you watch if you laugh giggle like in that video there's 12 12 kids in the bathroom for 5 or filming it you filming it is encouraging it you standing by and not doing it you're actually not an innocent bystander you're a silent supporter because you're standing there and you're not doing anything directly trying to pass laws about kids in schools filming other kids getting beat up and making them somehow a part of it and accomplish encourager and then if you stand by and watch you are an accomplice you're not doing anything if you didn't choose it it shows you what happened now you're a video that we're doing things to read until peace out there miners so I can't really talk about what happened but I'm the school is taking appropriate or at least in their eyes appropriate and Swift action on the parents are thankful to the school and the school district for them taking this serious I know that the family has felt this has been going on since he was nine at least and now its 12 to 3 years and they say the only reason now something's being done is cuz it was filmed because it's on video and it went viral but there's been some fun stuff we will pull up some was raining pictures and the other one recently with Dillon danis Dillon danis got Jiu Jitsu lessons yet for jiu jitsu lessons for this young boy I was also beat up in the bathroom and the family as well as if you know I'm talking about you and Dylan posted this video to and it got over 10 million views which was awesome in Raphael now is actually going to scholarship Raiden and his brother Brock with Jitsu lessons so that's amazing so they're going to start doing martial arts training after Ravens done with his hyperbarics in his concussion is settled down he's going to come into the mats and be part of the kids program the little Warriors for a Raphael School which is the best youth program in the state that's awesome that's awesome Stairway to pull up some of those pictures of of Raiden and this is kind of cool imma give you this because Raphael really likes this and it's some Tenth Planet guys there's Raiden after after 8 Patrick press conference on the news wanted to like post pictures of them or they want to get exclusives and so his parents are being chased All Around Town people were literally posting their home address online doxxing them but doxxing the bullies mainly saying here's a 12 year old girls address and go go find her can go through a couple more of those pictures there's some pretty cool ones we're eating Chick-fil-A is a chicken in full but there is that a football game the Edmond Santa Fe they've surrounded him with a lot of love and then it's been cool like Emily my wife aside out here here's if we not volume on this is pretty cool I am introducing Raiden to what what time is it so we got him some carrots and hummus chips are for me that you packed us into all right my man try carrots and hummus</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think I think one only moment that I even kind of forgot about till going through this with the doctor Raymond was I was in the locker room and this little guy named Raiden that I've been hanging out with a lot he was just beat up in the bathroom I saw that video the video that was on lines a horrible video these kids beating him up but then I saw him with you yeah yeah so that's been fun what are you doing with that it's it's great fashion Vincentown but I haven't seen it a you and Dakota talked about this and you and Laird about the diffusion of responsibility that with your house and people can just stand around and watch that's happened to Raiden in the in the urinal actually not this video but the next one iPhone support of one and in this one right here is just him at the urinal going to the bathroom and kids and I don't want to watch this just real quick after that there's so that's him at the urinal there's eight to ten kids in the bathroom that should think up to 12 for 5 or just fill minute and he's got special needs his born with Autism deafness right here so he's got a hearing aid he's diabetic and I got diabetes in his family he's been relentlessly bully since he was 9 years old is him at this with a bathroom was on Thursday this is on Friday after school three kids jumping on hitting them from all sides for no reason no reason he's a big teddy bear and he just his mom said since her picking him up at school and kindergarten first grade second grade kids or just walked up and hit him in the stomach or punch you in the arm lately I just knew about 5 feel forgotten and we're in the same town and so a dad reached out to Jim Stewart you've met Jimmy's our director and Jim hit me up right away and said hey is this a kid that we could we could rally around that you could you do we want to do all this we have a curriculum for Bully prevention and I think character development is Bully prevention so counterintuitive but it really is cuz a lot of people being bullies it comes from a lack of confidence and confident people are generally pretty kind yeah confident accomplish people and you know yourself so you don't have these need this need to improve group and you don't have that everybody kind of boots everybody outfits a real family sort of camaraderie that feeling a real environment almost every gym ever been to every Jiu-Jitsu gym that's good they have this family environment to it and it just makes you feel like you belong somewhere and you get used to being kind of people nice people I'm even even if someone catches you with a technique I'll show you I'll show you this is you know you left your arm here when you were transitioning and that if you do that if you get stuck in this is why I can catch it in Humble heart with martial arts if you hurt your training partner you lose right the person that's helping you get better yes you help them get better than make you better and it's a give-and-take we're actually the more you give the more you get in return because you're making them look at her training partner a better person and I think martial arts take it to another level I've done numerous Sports my parents are grew up without being the professional or official photographers of like the Dallas Cowboys in the Texas Rangers in the Dallas Mavericks since I grew up around professional athletes but what's so different I think about martial artist and why people love him and met one cuz of sport so pure it's like a chess match and it's an incredible sport but the athletes they truly are more approachable and I think that they're more giving and compassionate and more community-minded and driven at that other athletes aren't but just a martial artist are so more because they've had it drilled into him from having mentors and other black belts are on this life one journey of even service to others that's part of the black belt journey and self-respect and disciplining other athletes aren't but just a martial artist are so more because they've had it drilled into him from having mentors and other black belts that are honest lifelong journey of even service to others that's part of the black belt journey and self-respect and disciplining</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> but your parasites oh yeah so what's going on well as you're still more testing but they did find some called schistosomiasis in me social stove is from the tropical rainforest of Africa I think that's the only place that exists but it comes from nice nails and so because I probably bathed not cuz I probably I have bathed in the rivers there been in the rivers going across to get a hundred mouth know they can get into your skin and I was really cheat for a couple weeks there what that was with some of the like parasites I guess would you call it there they're like egg sacs or something that got on me yeah got inside of my stomach my liver allergies on could be potentially even in my brain in your brain potentially so they don't know yet it will be what's today I did my final exams and I did three full days with his doctor dr. Daniel Amen he would be phenomenal for the show by the way he's in 22 TED Talks millions of years and I've had stomach ulcer another come inside it's a little red but there's no ulcer whatsoever and so I have sister I've had an intestinal bacteria that really bad cold shigella I've had malaria three times I've had Dengue fever so Dengue was in me for at least a month to CDC founded me they just had this parasite and you have for a long time how many months at least six since April and have you been well trained at all during the ups and down so I was at the police and fire training center Oklahoma City or just helping them some really great guys there and open them in the fire chief ended up putting me in the cold shower for like 20 minutes cuz I got so with this I got like ghostly white and I started dry heaving and I was a shaky all over as well from your parents aren't ya the up-and-down I'll start I'll start getting in shape I'll start losing weight I'll start start feeling good and I just crash I've had shingles 5 times Joe what the f*** five times and hyperbarics hyperbaric oxygen therapy I've got a prescription for that and that's been helping more than anything right now I'm trying to have that morning routine protect my sleep eat right my wife helps me meal prep I have juices all through the day of a superfood coffee I'm doing all the stuff I can I was on 28 pills a day or for 5 weeks in a row is that whole parasite cleanse because I'm going to sew remote Joe in the forest I think I could have picked up something crazy so they did just did a line Lyme's disease test on me I just was on Monday so Lyme disease they did a cheek swab from like genetics they did here so they cut off like six different spots of hair flowing locks so they cut that my wife was teasing me cuz I was like crying about it blood urine stool samples needed two different kinds of brain scans on me so they literally injected something that was very minorly radioactive light up all the different spot to my brain activity so it where there's too much blood flow or there's not enough and literally so one of the things I found on this camera Terry new but taking test not just up early CTE or mild traumatic brain injury and TBI before autopsy know these brain scans they can also test for like PTSD and so there's a there's a diamond in the middle of your brain and your lease without a little bit of activity they're just very very small but if you have this what they call the ring of fire this diamond of red and white being lit up on the brain scans that literally shows that you have PTSD so Dakota Meyer in here to Dakota incredible podcast meant to text you after he's an amazing guy and people haven't heard that one go back and watch it it's one of my favorites that you fat Dakota's legitimate hero but want to think that he was saying was that they injected him and this would do more with the blocker was called that blockers kg or whatever the blocker was described it and said it completely stopped his PTSD cured all of his anxiety remember to my wife she's in Psychology right now shouldn't be a counselor and I sent that to her because they're talking about PTSD and the teacher said oh yeah that's been around for awhile to and that's what the total eclipse love that miracle cure they give you a shot boom your problems go away absolutely State last year at 6 months a year do you have to have other traumatic stuff going to do anything wrong yeah I just want to feel great and he's got a book about PTSD and basically he was saying that yeah that shot really really work and people been doing it for years and with veterans that's one of the quickest do they think that you have some PTSD yeah so he was saying this which Dakota said you just keep that up where or triggered that my memory where are the most common PTSD is car wrecks and that's what you do to avoid right you have to go back and be in public transportation getting your own car do you have them from car accident car accidents from some tough stuff in the rainforest whether it's Uganda or come and go we've had to flee from a village whenever Rebel group came into the next to us and Lee killed six or eight people and we're flying across the river and he's like little pygmy Dugout canoes which are big enough really for me and we're trying to flee across the river before the sun's even up there like crocodiles and hippos in the water and then in a couple of the really terrible things I mean I've held kids that have died and buried them and Doug their graves and that's happened numerous times we had machine guns pointed at us don't get in that story too much but I talked about that one of those stories before you and someone someone I love was a bunch of people that love her with me and said I was really tough as we are unarmed and we're being threatened and so that was tough man in some like childhood stuff I think kinds of abuse has only eating that stuff like that smelling to some public shaming and I don't want to lose track of what I was asking you about your health okay so what what are they doing and what can they do about what what you have so when you said you might have some crazy s*** meaning you might have a parasite that don't even know yet yes so that it might be in that's why I'm diagnosed or and blood urine blood stool hair and cheek swab sample so it's possible that you have something that like a few human beings I've ever had because you did that they haven't eaten already jungle how long does it take you to get to where you go depends on where where we go from Oklahoma City to Norman Chicago or Dulles or JFK Atlanta and then we go to Amsterdam or London or is it Qatar Qatar things guitar guitar okay and then we'll fly either from there to Nairobi Kenya Rwanda and from there you connect to Kampala Uganda and then from there you get a private like missions or humanitarian plane that's just you and the pilot and so you take that plane from there to from Uganda to Congo and then you land you do customs and then get back in the plane and you go and you land on a Runway that normally they have just cleared with machetes so if you're flying from let's just say Oklahoma City to JFK JFK to London to planes SO2 to London London to Kenya Kenya Kenya to Uganda for 5 and then you get the plane again to go out to the rain so six points Six Flags at least five points how many days or 3 days and then 30 hours or something of travel and then after that you get in a car and it could be 6 hours so where you land used to be in the rainforest but you drive six hours now to get to the rainforest I'll come because it's deforestation so bad deforestation in the last 25 years they've cut down about the size of Texas it's pretty wild we've helped replant 4000 trees but that's not even scratching the surface it's a lot of Chinese UK and outs where's that come in and explain the rainforest there's a lot of mahogany in the area have any there to do this I have to pay some sort of bribe or tax they call him that they called that v80 then from there. Drive at 6 hours sometimes it's taken 25 hours one time and another time it took 47 same Drive 40 out of the way that we're stuck in the mud so it's really silty there you don't call a Congo roads roads never been on tarmac in Congo actually that's why I have been in on cement and Goma but outside of your mother concrete roads anywhere turn back roads so I've seen an 18-wheeler or Lori 3/4 of the way sunk to where is up to their window on the driver side window up to silt and now they get it out I don't know that one. I'm just kind of in the graveyard that was like done no one's getting that thing out really mountains and you look down to the side and you'll see for 812 vehicles that have flipped amateur some Vice videos of the craziest roads in the world with a lot of men Congo don't they were want to cuz there's so many Hills it's the land of a thousand hills and so there's so many sharp turns when they take those turns at 40 50 60 has been so they'll literally just fly off the mountain and so you catch this parasite you've gone through all these tetanus has been I mean that we've been talking about in the podcast for several months now headed for me hearing that you're still dealing with it is really disturbing what what can they do about that ain't getting off that cleanse I mean I was on 28 pills for 4 weeks maybe 5 weeks and some of it were like antibiotics but I have to stay away from certain antibiotics here's a thing a couple of things that I know I have PTSD because of my brain scans and then they see in my brain toxicity and so the toxicity of my brain which kind of formula divots but not really divots not really changing the biology or makeup of my brain but it's just activity of my brain isn't fully developed right there where it's being toxins are there that are either from mefloquine or from Cipro have you heard of Cipro what is Massa team was the first one mefloquine what is that stuff at the malaria drug for any reason that used to be the drug of choice for a military now. thousands of our military veterans if you look up mefloquine toxicity military times they've done to articles 1 just a month or two ago I went the first one show that tens of thousands of our military veterans have wrongly been diagnosed with PTSD and it's been because of this mefloquine so they never saw War the mefloquine toxicity of the brain it's like this poison for your brain and if you've taken it for like 6 months you can have it it starts giving you bad nightmares you can have different kinds of mood swings and different stuff Health joint aches fatigue all sorts of different things but basically what mefloquine toxicity of the brain does will tens of thousands have been wrongly diagnosed with it when they take it for once once a week so you take the pill once a week and that was why it was our drug of choice instead of it being every day or two times a day you take it once a week well when I had malaria the three times I was allergic to the normal medication quinine and artefan and some other drugs like doxycycline and malarone I wasn't responding to those well I was vomiting I was I was allergic to him so mefloquine my body digested the best rides took it the best so the three times I've had malaria they give me to in the morning to midday and 2 at night and so I'm taking six and a day for five to seven days and these other guys that were getting mefloquine toxicity or taking it one week for six months so I had 3242 in a week's time I'd six months in a week's time and I did that three different times why they giving you so much it was what my body was responding to against malaria the first time I lost 33 pounds in 5 days and so is Mommy red and green blood and bile I lost most of my hearing my peripheral vision started disappearing I had some called Blackwater fever where my urine was literally as dark as that that black clock I didn't I probably should have a freak me out 5 days I didn't urinate and when I finally did if he Google Blackwater fever one and four one and two people that get it they die or how many 5 days 5 days I couldn't be oh my God they were trying to get IVs in me my things are collapsing so that was that's pretty brutal but yeah man so I'm getting my health better there cuz I do want to fight again, how can you if you have this enough in your brain journaling my road to recovery if they don't know what this parasite is how are they treating it like one of these they're testing me for all these kind of parasites amoebas bacterias does Ethan, go well I've I've been camping out here and I've gotten like a bit by 5 or 10 but yeah there's these Wicked kind of ticks my record is pulling five roaches out of my beard in fortnite price so there's tons of bugs there Oklahoma have that Rocky Mountain King selric not nothing or the lower the one that gives you energy something that the reaction that this tick bite gives you it makes you allergic to this specific element in red meat yeah you can only eat fish and like if you try to eat me to get really sick crazy that is crazy but they're trying to figure it out why this is going to be crazy why I'm 32 and I've had shingles 5 times what my first time I got malaria beard the first time I had malaria second time I had malaria at White come out my beard down here so your bottles freaking out Ingles five times and then this is going to sound crazy but I know I have to have a this might be too much information but I know I have to have a bowel movement whenever my nose starts running so literally whenever I have to go you know style tournament and running and running and running guided I don't know if that's what they're looking into that like that that's your second brain and so it's it I don't know how digestion what should I make is your second brain they said that they are realizing now like that whole idea of trusting your heart and trusting your gut like these these processes that people had might have actually been based on some intuitive understanding of how the body actually works really weird it is weird really weird strange everything everything's connected right has connected that's not weird really make sense overtime doctors in Oklahoma or like we have no explanation for that and then the doctors out here were like oh that's because this is connected to this and they did all of my blood work even though they did more blood Labs before I ever came out here like a week or two ago they still poke me 5 more Labs before I ever came out here like a week or two ago they still poked me five more times to get more blood work because we'll three times or drawing blood two times are putting that stuff in me so they could do the brains you're getting better doctors on here</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> men have you heard of hyperbarics yes I know you are a favor used it quite a bit after his fight with Jose Aldo Ronaldo f***** his leg up and is his leg swell up real bad and telling you this is one of the biggest game changers I love the float go and Float tanks I've done at least 50 times at float OKC in Oklahoma at my wife and I that's our date night once a week we go and we do that and I float fight week at least twice a week I really believe in floating hyperbarics is unlike anything I've ever done and felt an immediate long lasting benefits from also was not going to get better sleep than I've ever gotten when I was instant almost I mean I noticed that the first night the second night I've been over 20 treatments now of hyperbarics you get into tank you put on an oxygen mask and then it fill the tank up with oxygen and you lay there for an hour and a half to two hours some people only takes an hour but I'm bigger and they take me to a lower depth and in my ears going to mess up on me a little bit on flights they kind of get it clogged up or whatever because of the hyperbaric chamber know it just they've always done that on planes so it's like you're in a plane when you're in the hyperbarics and what it does is it pressurizes the oxygen down into your cells so it's literally going into your mitochondria that's what the new studies are showing them oxygen gets in there and it promotes healing and in your brain it literally brings blood flow into every part of the brain that needs it so it's one of the best things after a concussion with radon and what sometimes things everything happens for a reason you know where there's there's not a lot of places I just started hyperbarics 2 or 3 days before I met Raven then I'm doing in there saying some of the best things for concussions rate and gets a concussion from one of those fights or maybe as one of them that wasn't on the fight but they diagnose much with the doctors and his mom and his dad whenever the doctor says I think he really hasn't concussion did some testing on them wrote a prescription and said hey I think you need to do hyperbarics it's one of the best things for concussions now cuz I just started and so literally that day the doctor hand them a prescription for hyperbarics and I take him in there and get hyperbarics and this is probably the story I wanted to share with you about hyperbarics the most they're just kidding Caleb Freeman and he just made NBC Nightly News Fox News and ABC he's making the news everywhere because of his comeback Story the kid probably should have never been able to eat again on his own especially never be able to walk his parents were told that you would be left in a vegetative state if you have that Caleb Freeman video cuz of one he got a vicious car accident 16 years old you just start driving he was the number one cross country runner at his school but also in his district and then he got in this brutal car accident here's the video of him trying to learn to put up the finger number one again there's a he's trying to do it one that's his dad kind of coaching him but he was the cross-country running now trying to get them to do a thumbs-up this is off of Highland Drive yet traumatic brain injury driving down the road hit a hydroplaned got a brutal wreck and they thought you would be left in a vegetative state for the rest of his life so you can see right here is muscles are so atrophied because he had been in like a I think he was in a coma or he was in intensive care for so long and so is dad's trying to get him to do a thumbs-up you know he's trying his hardest to do that you're the second video and they're telling them you should really try hyperbarics to try everything you can and so the whole Community has rallied around them in Oklahoma he's from Newcastle or one of our board members are from there trying to help him learn to walk again assisted I don't know what they have them in pairs yeah he broke his arm he fall down another video how many are you trying to show them the try to show you both of these because this is how far gone he was and then after 40 Hyperbaric treatments they said get them in there will flood his brain with oxygen when has oxygen ill reproduce blood flow and I'll bring actual healing into his brain and so that third video is right here he's literally was the number one cross country runner at a school so now he's try learn how to do cross country again he was never supposed to walk again on his own he came in there to the hyperbarics assisted like you saw where people are assisting on both sides he does 40 treatments of hyperbarics and then all the sudden he walks up and down the football field 14 x unassisted nothing changed just 40 Hyperbaric treatments don't like you got to keep doing this is actually that's us a hyperbaric with Raiden the young man that got the concussion on the right in this video right here I don't know if there's volume but is actually pretty special video this is after 80 treatments he's literally finishing his cross-country run again when he was never supposed to walk and that's after like 3 or 5 miles and so and houses ability to communicate is that coming back this morning I forgot he goes he's weird where we take that picture again and where I don't have it saved and Caleb goes it's in your phone Dad just look at him so he's he's able to recollect a lot of different stuff that's the main this is all something that you're experiencing as well for your treatment for the parasites yet I've literally never gotten better sleep I feel more positive when I come out of it and then I feel like I can focus better because one of the things that they saw my brain scans were PTSD and then I have really severe ADD and you can see that on the how my brain functions they guess there's like eight different types of Duty zombie brain being one of them to do it is awesome man and so then I have that and then so going into the oxygen they can see from scan 1 to scan to how my brain is actually functioning better and the spots with a tdf kind of cooled off a little bit spots with PTSD of literally kind of gone down a little bit and so that was Caleb story there's also this girl named Eden Carlson and eating Carlson there's like a minute clip on the New York Post and they did it on YouTube this girl drowned for 2 hours she was facing float down in a pool or face down in a pool her mom pulled her out and maybe 15 minutes she drowned for 2 hours she didn't breathe shouldn't have a heartbeat and then at the hospital they miraculously got her back her stories all over if you just Google Eden dead for total hours 2 hours even Carlson Eden Carlson she's the first one to have brain damage reversal scientifically proven they've done all the MRIs my hands on the Hyperbaric from hyperbarics some of the hardest things you have to do for Steven play the doggie Campos please. But literally do the Eden curl some video on YouTube and it's wild to see how she's recovered and how they told her she would never be able to eat again never be able to go to school there will do that now she's basically a normal girl yet like they have to find out what are the parasites are still in your system. Identify the parasites cuz it could be an unknown parasite will they know it's just doing if I had just doing me for as long as they think they don't think it started in April I think maybe that was another that onset but took it to another level when I went there and got sick and it was brutal I mean I was hugging basically the the not the toilet but the while I was in Uganda with in April and May just Hyperbaric is helping you but you're still not able to train right now it's you not you not like you don't have a flight schedule into I do if I scheduled but I would like to fight first quarter next year if I can use that literally possible I mean if he's not 6 months from now I have another follow-up appointment here in March and we're going to have a lot more data to show like from my blood work to my bacteria in my stomach do those brain scans going to be the big thing that show how my brain is start to heal how my body started to feel and show my health just increasing and so that's the goal I'm on this mission to get get healthy so I can fight again but also just that I can function better and have like not these big swings so the hyperbaric chamber is helping you but yet you're still feeling some serious so I'm 20 treatments and I need to get 40 done as soon as possible in and they think I'll probably do another round of 40 and then yeah I seeing how how Caleb's doing I mean Caleb Caleb showed me this this is wild I come in and I'm about to get in the chamber with him and he shows me his hand shaking and he's showing me I don't know what that's called but it's whenever set with Parkinson's and different stuff like you have those kind of shakes in hand or Alzheimer's or whatever that is so Caleb's got that and he gets in the chamber 90 minutes later we get out he shows me his hand it's completely steel and he can put contacts back in as ice but before there's no way at all that you can get contacts in his eyes afterwards his body's calm down enough he's is brain has enough oxygen in blood flow in it that he can put his contacts back in on their own So Raven his parents say that he was always up and down in the middle of the night and that they'd have to try to put them back to sleep and now he just wants you to sleep he's asleep until I wake him up they think it's helping with his autism is diabetes his ac-1 levels or whatever those are called it was just started to come down and what the doctors have told us is like there's nothing better at the doctors take an oath that stay to do no harm like that's first and foremost is to do no harm like if someone has a concussion or someone has autism where someone has this bacteria or a parasite that might be in the brain why not flood the body on a cellular level of your love this part that can increase your your stem cells by eight times in your body so it's one of the best treatments for whenever you have the stem cells injected in you so I had the in SCS them as income all stem cells for my hip but my shoulder they said one of the best things I could have or it would have been to get in a hyperbaric chamber because that would promote the stem cell growth and life of the stem cells because their cells and you're pushing oxygen into the cells increasing blood flow into it and you're extending their life and helping them reproduce so it's one of the best things out there. I wouldn't be talking about it like this without Raphael is get into a Joe Namath Joe Namath has his own clinic now for Hyperbaric Centrum if you have a ball right about that right and it's the first time there's ever been documented cases of brain trauma reversal where if you can heal your brain you can basically heal your life where have a healthy brain you have a healthy life we need a hyperbaric chamber in here literally it's wild at how how much stuff that actually so what it what's the prognosis like with you with the doctors that look for parasites are doing all this Blood skins they think that they going to be able to straighten you out I think so yeah I think they think with doing a holistic approach where medication can come in at a later date I had this doctor that's all you have PTSD hears these pills depression pills starting to have anxiety for the first time in your life you've never had it before here's some more pills do you think you have ADD hear some more pills they put me on three or four different pills at the same time I was like a zombie you know I like a zombie I felt weird I felt like I start having like electricity running through my veins or something like like my muscle started twitching my eyelid was constantly spasming so did the doctors in and looked at this all the various elements that you have like and they don't to do pills so what what do they want you to do and what do they think is going to be able to happen they think you'll be able to fight again or are they so doctor came and he's a guy that says men our brains are the literally you can live or they can do lung transplants right and heart transplant kidney transplants like you can't do a brain transplant right and so he's saying that anyone that's in a brain damaging occupation and decide whether that's fighting football or even be in a firefight because that is a brain-damaging occupation you're breathing in burning couches which are putting off all these harmful chemicals and so he said you want to protect it and promote your brain health as much as you possibly can write I'm so he's a brilliant guy and he's going to be on weekly calls with me guiding me keeping me accountable on how am I protecting my sleep how am I what am I getting to eat also supplementation what's that one that you were on here with David Sinclair talking about and MN it's like that rolls Resveratrol plus some of the other things that you guys were talking about like they're all in his supplements retells you go get these sufferings from here and here and make sure that you're optimizing your brain health like that rolls Resveratrol will that plus some of the other things that you guys were talking about like they're all in his supplements retails you go get these sufferings from here and here and make sure that you're optimizing your brain out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you know everyone in this all this Nate Diaz s*** that happened there's it there's easier for people to understand what happened Nate Diaz Nate Diaz tested positive for Trace element of something called storm s a r m it's the type of it's it's basically a performance-enhancing substance but it's existed in in a minuscule Trace amount in vegan vitamin supplement and the reason these things are being found is that the test can run now that you saw at a testing the equipment is so powerful it's so much more powerful than it's ever been before that the problem is they're they're working with tools they're almost too good so instead of catching people cheating they're catching people that just hadn't have come in contact with something that's illegal it might have been like this the tiniest amount that was in a bin that they also use to mix these vitamins it didn't clean it properly and missed your parts per million is a little tiny amount but these you sound machine. shut up I said it looks like someone like Nate Diaz who everybody there's some that are Beyond reproach Nate Diaz and no he's never been eating with the Bourdain and they're eating fish I don't know if he's still eats fish but he's very clean dances performance maybe we'd does but I don't even think he eats meat I mean I think he's very clean with his. If you could just eat I know he's eating fish in the pastures of Vice video of him out eating with the board and they're eating fish I don't know if he's still eats fish but he's very clean with his diet</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> read the Green Lantern we wanted to buy Greenland not going to do this, the buying the green lamp thing as a great move if global warming is real if that becomes a part of the United States then you can go up there you don't have to worry about it. Will they say I think that they want rights not yet not to green line but also there is a movement in the ark but you got to click on it though Jamie so you can get the whole climate change things terrified to me but what's more terrifying I think than anything some people are resisting it and it has become politicized and some people are just buying Whole Hog into anything that gets sad that supports climate change of support the concept of climate change and that we've gotten into this thing rips and ideologically based sort of subject okay in a way that I hope I can convince when is first of all there's a lot of issues that you care about this will impact so there was a report that came out about a year ago was found that basically large swaths of the Middle East will be uninhabitable at a certain point because we just be too hot for human beings to live there are a lot of people from Saudi Arabia come over La during the summer cuz our summer ain't shitt compared to theirs so the thing is you think there's a refugee crisis when it comes to what's happening in in South and do you think there's a refugee crisis in Europe when it came to what happened in Syria and Iraq You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet right so if you're somebody who fancies yourself against immigration or a hardliner on immigration or against helping refugees or whatever it might be just think about what happens when you multiply What's Happening Now by a thousand okay cuz that's what's going to happen at some point it's just a matter of when and the other point I would make them as this people like to it you don't make fun of the green New Deal and then try to pick it up if we talk about the green New Deal and only Define it as basically a new new deal so the New Deal FDR you know put that into places to try to try to fight back against the Great Depression try to get people employed try to fix the country right and FDR kept getting re-elected because FDR was beloved by the entire country because he was fighting for regular working people that was his thing and that's when the Republicans when we talked about the green New Deal we're highlighting yes we're going to move towards renewable and Green Technology yes it's going to be a large part of what we're doing but the whole point guys is millions and millions of jobs created for regular people the whole point is to improve this country to fix this country to try to make it to that our infrastructure is better than the rest of the world what if instead of looking at this is like oh my God this is going to be such a drain on the economy and what's going to happen to the deficit how about you look at this like an Economic Opportunity because what's going to happen in the future Joe they're waiting to be had for all these green and renewable Tech Technologies we could leave the world on that front or we could leg behind Russia we can lag behind China we can lag behind everybody else and be stuck in you know what would effectively be a stone age so they're going to have courage this industry to flourish subsidies like how do you what do you do to get these industries to innovate into the pump a shitload of money into dudes Green Technology the right thing got to stop doing the wrong thing which is stop giving 4 billion dollars a year every year as a subsidy ExxonMobil and they hilariously say do they need this money because it's for research and development in a variety of different things, some things won't work stop was built and brought about because we did a massive investment in a green New Deal then everybody would talk about how it's a wonderful thing and how we're finally leaving the world and in our rightful place I find it hilarious that you do guys like Trump and guys like Joe Biden by the way love to say like there's nothing this country can't do and then in the next sentence they going to tell you a thousand things that they think we can't do it we shouldn't do what you need and try what what technologies have you heard if any that are being even propose to mitigate global warming or climate change there's the classic ones that I think are more effective than people give it credit for like solar is once it sits effective people I don't think it gets its do but then there's other things like thorium now let me just say I'm not not talk about a thorium car there was a car that was proposing it was apparently was total b******* they could make it a real car work but without the downside of like you kick a meltdown to destroy everything we're talking about power for the energy not because they were trying to make it seem like you was right around the corner or they had the plans and it just wasn't in those people were full of s*** but that doesn't mean thorium is bad and totally off the table it just means that that specific car they were talking about was nonsense meltdown proof facility what nonsense you have thorium reactors it's basically like meltdown proof nuclear facility now I'm an idiot I have no idea how far off we are from actually developing that but I do know that we need to invest in this and other things that show potential I mean that's the only way to move forward</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we have a giant problem is country with so right left sit s*** you known this what I was trying to say earlier when we were talking about the concept of classical liberals because most people don't even know what the f*** that means the idea behind it I just think that to have groups of people that think in certain ways the problem with ideologies whether it's a left-leaning or right-leaning is it makes you automatically predisposed to ignore or to refute the concepts that are on the other side and their leader in so many of share these ideas across the board and when one group is committed to one concept like one of the things that you do see this about climate change people on the right are more inclined to deny the negative effects of climate change because it's part of the right-wing the right-wing ideology this is something we have today right to get so you're right but also I would just advise people don't get too lost in the noise because we can sink that something is overwhelming and we can't defeat it and we can also think that you know for example the whole russiagate thing on the Democratic side that was such a fundamentalist religion and you couldn't leave it on the line and all excited and people would believe it and argue for even though the things weren't adding up and I was trying to point out where it's wrong but what I would say is at the end of the day people actually be relatively happy about the fact that I think the most strongest divided in the country is not right vs left how long is divided in the country I called a populist vs. elitist elitist in the Democratic party you have a lead us in the Republican party and you have the people and the people are at worth so much more in agreement than people give us credit for you know that I go down and I did this in some of my events at politicon as well but people would be surprised Matt 80% of the country wants to raise the minimum wage 58% of country wants to have free college like I said only 16% or so of the American people want to be involved in Iraq terrible farnworth 62% of the country wants to legalize marijuana I can sit here and bring off issue after it's over 80% of the American people out of the political system and has room for other parties we're so ingrained in this idea of left vs right Democrat vs Republican and it says the choices that we've always had with the occasional independent the occasional you know Ross Perot jumps into the race and throws a monkey wrench into everything but other than that or maybe been out and about 2 - 10th Gary Johnson but do you think there's room for other parties at this juncture that's a great question and what I would say is first let me get my personal take on in my personal take is I 100% want that to be the case because I prefer in many ways aspects of a parliamentary system to our system and I like the idea of having multiple parties I like the idea of having more choice so I want that to be true and I was going to suggest a Democrat do we go about trying to get these ideas implemented run basically we came to the conclusion that as much as we want it to be true as much as we'd like to start a third party and have it work and take off there is such a gigantic systemic bias against that happening that you really do have ultimately the choice of Republican or Democrat so then the idea becomes okay it's a reform movement now we have to try to reform the Democratic party and their people on the right who can try to reform the Republican party like if you're somebody on the right and you more with Ron Paul and you're more libertarian you want to end the wars you want to legalize drugs I hope those people take over the Republican party and you have people who are against like corporate welfare and whatnot in that party so what we really need to do is because it's just the nature of our system because there's such a bias against their party's we really need to do is harness all that energy to fix things and just try to take over the existing infrastructure because you're not going to build a counter infrastructure because there's so much name recognition it's like saying there's Democrat and Republican technically we could start up RC Cola and see if we could get a significant market share so really and I get I don't want this to be the answer but just factually speaking it is the answer that we have to try to overtake you know the the corrupt elements within the system and and bring rat change that way cuz that's the only way I think it will really work will the only way it's going to really work as if what you were talking about with voting on very specific issues because if you most of the things that are problem benefiting people they're benefiting the people that are in positions of power in positions where they can influence the way policies dictated because they contributed to campaigns and because they've got this sort of revolving-door thing going on with universities were mathematics professors and economic professors her to dictate policy or advise and then they get jobs in Banks and then you've got this whole weird thing going on with people in the government right now was that the inside job fantastic documentary for people to understand the collapse but you it's not benefiting us all these things that happened in the all this corruption to take place and I was influenced never benefits us it's only the right but that's what's weird about it and if we got a chance to vote on most of these ideas instead of voting on politicians and in the politicians Implement these ideas to it's only at the right but that's what's weird about it and if we got a chance to vote on most of these ideas instead of voting on politicians and in the politicians Implement these ideas to benefit themselves and benefit the special interest groups who got him into place then things will be much better</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Bugs Bunny the promise who is he running against I don't think that would have worked he was running against Obama I think Hillary such a deeply flawed candidate and so many people despise her and during the me-too era like her creepy f****** husband looming in the distance like knows ferrato I mean how many women have come out and accuse that guy of sexual assault and raping and he's still hovering and he's still around and that's all who is going to haunt her she's connected to that guy Forever on this topic and there's an amazing story so during the election River when the story broke of a trump on video saying I grabbed by the p**** I don't even wait and everyone blew up and all the mainstream media Talking Heads were like oh my God it's over apology video real quick on another way then the next night was a debate at the debate show he brought like eight Bill Clinton accusers yeah put them in the audience and then he goes out there on stage when he's asked a question the first thing he says is listen I'm not proud of what I said it wasn't a good thing what I said but what I did was just words with Bill Clinton did with actions folks it was actions if you want to see who the real problem is he's sitting right there in the audience and the Brilliance of that move is politics 101 never really go on defense your best defense is a really good offense for NP made it a wash all the sudden this issue which was supposed to be my God at the end of Donald Trump now the whole conversation shifted to I mean against Bill aren't there so maybe stopping completely that's all you had to do every single Scandal involved in you see how incredibly pathetic and ineffectual and weak the Democrats are at marketing strategy and you see how good he is because he is no matter he's going to flip it he's going to flip it back on you so the new thing is the Ukraine thing I don't know how close you been following this but do you think that you basically got caught on a phone call asking for dirt on his political opponents Joe Biden he was talking to the president of Ukraine and he said it in so many words I mean he likes there was no quid pro quo there doesn't have to be an implied what is Trump do again goes right back on the offense and he goes out there and says I have every right as president to investigate corruption and Joe Biden is incredibly corrupt and all I'm doing is on you know trying to figure out why was Hunter Biden getting $50,000 from an energy company doesn't know anything about energy why is he getting this and so now again the conversation isn't Manhattan Trump should have been doing that the conversation is okay sure maybe Trump should have been doing that yo where you saw the video where Trump released it where was Biden talking about yeah the loan like explain that I'll give you what the Democrats and Republicans hey man that's a misleading video because yes it's true abiding was holding a billion-dollar stops at you over the head of Ukraine to fire a prosecutor but by and wanted to get rid of the corrupt prosecutor and bring in a non-corrupt prosecutor that's why he was doing what he didn't holding that's up to you and they say the prosecutor that eventually came into place actually investigated the Biden family more so that's why the Democrats say there's you know you're kind of misleading by putting this out there. Argument that Trump is making his know you're holding a billion-dollar subsidy over the head of a foreign government and saying you have to listen to us and do X Y and Z that's problematic people change. If you have $83,000 a month is because his last eruption and this is where I think like Democrats are silly cuz they always find the weakest anti Trump argument possible and now they're putting a position where they have to try to say like the Biden's did nothing wrong at all and Trump is all bad and bottom-line nobody's going to believe that divides did nothing wrong with your getting $83,000 a month and you know anything about natural gas I don't even know what they give is the justification I mean the only thing I heard from I think it was Ted lieu was a he's a you know Democratic Congressman was you know hey man people sit on boards and there was a strong base which is really weak but they pick the anti Trump argument so they wanted to use this as a phone call me I'm sitting there I'm pulling my hair out because I can actually give you like three or four super legitimate things their impeachment worthy not that I think it's strategically make sense and we can get into that if you want to but like the one that drives me crazy is Donald Trump has a hotel in Washington DC that he owns okay he took $300,000 through that hotel from the Saudi government so they're funneling him money through his hotel in DC and then Donald Trump turns around and gives a multibillion-dollar weapons deal to the Saudi government as they're committing a genocide in Yemen we know they're committing a genocide in Yemen we know that we're arming them and he gave them even more weapons because he got that money through his hotel so for me I'll look at that I'm gone oh my God this candle has everything it's got personal corruption it's got guns going to a vicious genocide of country what was the money for the money in the hotel what they did is they had these like little Retreats at the hotel and Saudi Arabia would pay for US veterans to go and stay at these hotels and they would I don't know if it's like tours of the capitol or whatever it is but they pay for these veteran groups to go to the hotel but then of course you look at it and you go I don't know man $300,000 and speculation is full of course they overpaid on purpose but furthermore even if they didn't Jimmy Carter had to sell his Peanut Farm when he was president because the idea was hey we're not even saying you're doing anything corrupt but just the fact that you have is personal private business it is theoretically Stephan government's want to give you money through your Peanut Farm to have to sell it because just the existence of it enough it is enough to say it violates the emoluments Clause of the Constitution which is just a fancy way of saying that the president can't be corrupt and take money from foreign governments and Trump is doing that he just is right so this $300,000 though this is for services rendered this is for hotel rooms what it was like what they say is it in the hotel rooms and whatnot I hate to say it this way but that's not a lot of money to someone well you don't but then what I always think about when people make that point you have to flip it what would we be saying if it was the Clinton Foundation getting $300,000 from the Saudi government and then Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State approving the weapons deal to Saudi Arabia and the fact of the matter is that actually is almost exactly like what happened with the Clinton Foundation Bill Clinton was going around and giving speeches I feel like that's a little bit more egregious because he speeches are worthless like at least they're the Stella hotel rooms is like real real food he's is meals like that actually costs money these speeches are worthless that's a in my opinion and my opinion those speeches are a transparent bra drive so do you think they'll get a president should be able to have private businesses the foreign governments can pay him any amount of money no I didn't think so I don't I don't care but I just don't think they're comprable like I think with the Clinton Foundation the Clinton Foundation was egregiously gross right by they both of those things are egregiously girls because there is a deal or they have a deal even if it's only $300,000 which I know most people hear there's a lot of money it's a lot of money to me but is it a lot of money to a billionaire I don't necessarily think it is and it's it's also a lot of money that goes through his organization and that it cost money to make that money how much profit is that out of $300,000 is not that much profit with a $500,000 of speech that's one talk for 1 hour and it cost nothing for him and he's making a half a million dollars and you did it over and over and over and over and over again and it was all under this the guise of the Clinton Foundation is doing his great charitable work all across the country and all across the world and that to me was more transparently disgusting I understand I understand why you would say that but I also think that there's a problem with it in principle yet I would just nip it in the bud no-questions-asked but beyond that there's also other stuff so I'm just giving you one example there's so there's the other thing which again very few people spoke about a recognized that during the campaign Donald Trump a registered 8 new businesses and Saudi Arabia so again when you're running for president it's you know you're it's a public service you're trying to serve your country and you shouldn't intertwine business with that in any way shape or form there's another one I believe he has he has a hotel in in turkey and now his argument by the way is no it's okay because I transfer all this to my kids so while I'm present in my kids they run my businesses and take care of it but I think that's just a total nonsense. Because you're still your family is still profiting from it and here's a crazy fact your than this one really just blew my mind with Trump and office in one year Jared and Ivanka made I think it was 2 or 83 million dollars in one year. Like millions of dollars from Israeli Banks why and then there's the guy who they say it's okay example it's just that he kind of ripped the mask off and show you what everybody's doing but it's not like you didn't happen with Bill Clinton it's only like with the rock Obama it was Wall Street appointed his entire Administration I believe he got a list from Citigroup to to put people in his cabinet and it's like this is the way the system functions and my opinion is it shouldn't you shouldn't be taking money from foreign governments you shouldn't be taking money from corporations bomb it was Wall Street appointed his entire Administration I believe he got a list from Citigroup to put people in his cabinet and it's like this is the way the system functions and my opinion is it shouldn't you shouldn't be taking money from foreign governments you shouldn't be taking money from corporations</div>

Kamala Harris on Tulsi gabbard took her out the hamstrings that's a wrap baby Tulsi good dilute you for thanking down, going to cheat everybody was saying she's the one she's going to run it until she even thought you would have a stronger than she did fall apart it's fascinating she just shrunk into the Shadows like your little dog too you know did you see the last debate because that was like Peak okay she's done now because it was so hilarious to watch it her main issue that she decided I'm going to take a stand on this in the debate Trump with Twitter was she was begging Elizabeth Warren why don't you support Banning Trump from Twitter and we were talking about two different sets of rules she think that that was something to hang her had she surrounded by absolute morons who are democratic strategist in Washington DC and they think okay you have to outflank Elizabeth Warren on her left on some issue so use this issue and try to make it seem like you're standing up for the little guy and you're standing up for rules because even though I know man because even to people who are on the left that looks like you're just begging for the mods the real problem is she never did deny what Tulsi said and she can't about the record was awful the fact that she did with schools is the most disgusting when she didn't go to school and she joked around about it at these meetings he joked around about it and conferences you know about how she cleaned it up and she just had cops knocking on the door hahaha was bad disturbing yeah what was even worse is there was somebody who was found not guilty on something they were wrongfully imprisoned found not guilty on something when I came back up and then, Harris didn't let him out and kept him in on a technicality and said all your paperwork wasn't filed into proper time frame or whatever was on purpose or self she did it herself he was shining Spotlight for cheap labor for the State of California and she didn't deny any of that she could have her record is abysmal on this stuff I mean there's no there's no exposed just like click turn the lights on will look at the Steve mnuchin thing this is one that we've known for a while so Steve mnuchin was part of Goldman Sachs was also the head of One West Bank here in California and what happened was they were during the surprise crisis in the Great Recession they were illegally foreclosing on people early and kicking them out of their homes in violation of the law and so, Harris you know we was recommended by her own office you got to prosecute this guy he's doing she didn't do it why because he's a big Democratic donors choose his wife was taking all these f****** Instagram photos while the s*** she had on private jets and stuff they look like Bond villains bro fact that she looks so she should be f****** a football players out that she doesn't really should be she should be f****** that got a gazillion dollars. That's why kind of hilarious right when you look at the disparity and in the beauty will these are the assholes really run the economy that they committed fraud and a massive level what they would do is I'm going to order us a coffee if you'd like one it was found that in the lead-up to the subprime mortgage crisis in the Great Recession here's what they would do Joe they would sell to unsuspecting clients these packages these packages of subprime mortgages but they were rated AAA and they would sell them these packages saying hey man listen is a great long-term investment it's safe you're going to make a lot of money at the same time Goldman Sachs was doing that they would turn around and bet on those packages that they just sold as if they were awesome they would bet on those packages to fail so that's brought they were making money into different ways I'm going to sell you the package Pawnee okay and then on the other hand I'm going to bed on the same package I just told you to fail that's like a car salesman saying I'm going to tell you this car in this car works wonderfully everything's a hood he made his card on this believable why is it we can spend money on that but we can't have it infrastructure deal that gives our country and a plus infrastructure in the world Elon Musk hyperloop travel from New York to LA in like 3 hours or whatever it is on the ground I want why don't we have that everywhere in this country why do we have bridges that are fixed why do we have awesome Rose why can't we go to airports and feel national pride and say this airports absolutely beautiful hyperloop is supposed to be the future of travel where you can get in the Pod and it's vacuum powered you can go from New York to LA in like 3 hours or whatever it is on the ground I want why don't we have that everywhere in this country why do we have bridges that are fixed why do we have awesome Road why can't we go to airports and feel national pride and say this airports absolutely beautiful</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> got a way to grow meth with plants to figure out a way to make meth with plants this is a new thing they have been able to do this before meth had always been done with which nothing we need to talk about Sudafed what a good conversation that ass over the counter cold meds and the reason the only sell you a little bit the reason being is because people used to just buy everything on the Shelf throw it into a basket bring it up to the counter and they would use that stuff to make meth with because it's one of the ingredients right actually boil it all down I don't know the process but you can make meth out of cold medication well these f****** guys have figured out how to do this s*** with plants now Okay so next Frontier of Afghanistan's drug trade so investigators have uncovered a burgeoning local trade in the production of methamphetamine using a mountain shrub that if you like let's say you legalize lower-level uppers are amphetamines okay so what do you have a more benign version of all of these kinds of drugs that are legal and available doctor get prescription for that I'm talking about over-the-counter okay so do you think that cuz I think that would not fully eliminate the market for the much harder stuff but it would I think eliminate a majority of that market because if somebody yes right cuz nobody goes and gets more safer Alternatives that may not be a strong but then yeah why wouldn't you choose that over doing like crocodile the one that melts off your skin if you had for like a year so the ones that are interesting because their productivity drugs and that brings us to Trump let's do it this is so much like there's a there's a photograph of him it's a classic photograph because it's after I love Mexican yeah he was talking s*** about the wall and it's all rapists and murderers that says I love Hispanics I think and I remember watching that looking at that photograph going since motherfuker for real he really tweeted that I love Hispanics and he's eating a f****** taco bowl well the open desk drawer so many focus in on it they realized this is like years later they realize that it's all filled with Sudafed and Sudafed is again the active ingredient that you know one of the ingredients in Sudafed is the active ingredient in meth and so apparently people take Sudafed and if you take that stuff gives you like a little bit of a buzz and if you take large doses of Sudafed it's essentially like taking like he's microdosing dosing meth it's actually a little deeper than that which makes it even funnier yet because there's a certain form of Sudafed that they sell in the United States and there's a UK version of Sudafed and the UK version of Sudafed has that ingredient to it which is more more of an upper or a kind of acts like an amphetamine it says the desk drawer full of Sudafed including boxes in New York some UK indicator up say at the legal limits of purchase are being circumvented and that the then-candidate Trump was abusing Sudafed for a tie rather than its decongestant affect okay so there's that now I want to take it a step further because I don't know if you watch this video I sent you a while ago but I was absolutely floored by the contrast between the speech Trump gave at CPAC this year and then the speech Trump gave it to you end this year the CPAP Joe totally off-script bouncing off the walls an hour and 30 minutes moving all over the place so active so engaging making jokes all this stuff hilarious and then you go to the UN speech so he's talking like this and he literally he was so tired he couldn't even say the word sovereignty he quit halfway through and he was like and that's why we need to protect pakman show Pac-man had David pakman had a an episode when he was concentrating on this alleged drug used by Trump and he showed the contrast of him sniffing at the debates with Hillary Clinton get free did yeah this whole conglomeration of all of his sniffing moments this and also don't lie when he does a rally and he's high as balls on an upper I remember I'll never forget the morning I woke up and I go on Twitter which is like part of my morning routine and the first words I say you're from the president of the United States and it says washed up psycho Bette Midler and I just he's done a bunch of s*** on his Twitter that you just like this m*********** is crazy what was the one that we were talking about recently that he did was it a bull s*** yeah yeah little side things that he always does make me wait like the all-caps randomly or sometimes I'll capitalize letters for no reason in the tweet it was great when he was the f****** host of The Apprentice that's what it was great it was like he was an entertaining character it's just now that he's the present is like</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Rick Baker tried to explain Huawei to me and one things that you might be from the CIA thinks it is explained that he said you have to realize that there is no such thing as industry independent of government in China if you have something like Huawei if you have a giant Corporation they are inexorably connected to the Chinese government and the moves they make are not necessarily designed for you know the infant growth Paradigm this idea that we have in the United States with corporations holding the stockholders are just trying to make money that's not what they're doing over there they have a long game and the long game involves information involves Espionage involves stealing Trade Secrets and and and patents from other companies and so when they're selling them these modems they've got built-in third-party options so the third-party meaning China can extract information so if your if someone that has this modem and they're using this modem to send in someone in Beirut China can also get that information they do a lot of cyber on for a long time that they're You Know Jack Pattinson intellectual property and they had this whole you know economy that's kind of thriving all technology that's made elsewhere that's certainly an issue but also I would argue that it's probably the case with the US to that this kind of distinction between corporations in the state it is largely of the near because you have control of our political process because of big money from corporations flowing into the system so I think that a lot of these decisions that are made even when it comes to foreign policy or directly in relation to how it will impact those corporations like the thing that I remember was a lightbulb moment for me back in the day when I first learned about it was the banana Wars back in the day I think it was in the late 1800 but don't quote me on that we just went to South America started toppling governments because we wanted to jack their bananas I was literally further I think the Chiquita banana company that we did that yeah so when you look at that you go okay well that kind of distinction between Corporation and government is not even really a thing here it's like this veneer that's in between the two but really it it's the powerful money interest in the elites that kind of run everything and they're they're married at the hit whether they're in the government or whether their Incorporation what is the banana Wars I was like that clean stained has crazy how about when you go throughout history you find out that a lot of the wars were over salt I didn't even know that I did not know they killed people for salt is very important back in the day because they didn't have refrigerators so in order to preserve things to keep them from being infected by bacteria they would pour salt all over their meat and salt all of their fish and that's how they preserve things right apparently Preserve long periods of times when you completely cover them with salt yeah so it's I guess I guess it's just always been a thing that it's like Wars over resources taking these troops from northern Syria moving them over into Western Iraq and I'm going to be doing the same thing that they've been doing from Western Iraq and then Trump had the nerve to go out there and say and we've secured the oil it's so tremendous we've secured the oil we're not going to make the same mistake like we made no rack again and this is something that he had been saying it's he packed a conservative political action conference going back for years every year he give a speech and he actually said like we should we should have taken the oil should have taken the oil in Iraq because we didn't want us to have it and we should have it instead and it's like he's he actually rips the mask off of everything we're doing because he has no filter. Yeah that was a big part of it but what he's just admitting in front of the world is international love means nothing we don't care about you know the proper process we don't care about like imagine for a second China did that to us deeply about civilian Syrian civilians and that's why were there to protect them like know where there is Jack there oil that's what we're trying to do in the region so disturbing that all the other presidents they have this dislike fake holier-than-thou attitude where they really can like put on a happy face on a disgusting thing like Empire where Trump is and I think it's fair to say he's like too stupid to really go through the tap dance until people like there it is it's like it's right in front of our face about him is he says both things at the same time like he has the political instincts enough to know that people think war is generally bad so he always goes out there and he talks about how he thinks war is generally bad and we got to get our troops out of Middle East I don't know why were there so stupid do in the first place but when you actually doing it doesn't match his rhetoric turn off remember this but like a year or so ago he tweeted we're getting out of Afghanistan finally after all these years we've been there for 18 years was terribly to never been there in the first place and then we didn't get out he said that acting like we were going to do it and then the general by the scenes were like that's a good one and we never got out and then he just stopped up with it and he doesn't do their job and say wait we didn't actually get out of there but still comes across as a positive politically cuz he still doing the head face towards non-intervention with people agree with but it's business as usual behind-the-scenes how much time do you think he spends on any of these things if he does spend time how does he have the time to do these interviews how does he have the time to tweet how did you have the time to watch Fox News I mean I really want to know like how much interaction he he has with his cabinet like how much interaction does he actually have with the generals how much interaction that's that's the Dirty Little Secret show is that it can't be much it's not because what he really does is he watches Fox News all day into each other videos all day doing that and also doing what we think you should do look I don't have any time and all I do is do podcasts so I watch him before he became president I think was after he got the Republican nomination was an interesting story that it wasn't discussed too much but I thought it was fascinating because the Trump team apparently approached John Kasich who just like kind of a standard establishment Republican and he was the governor of Ohio but I'm not sure if I want you to kind of like be my vice president run the day today at the White House take care. Leo's cross all the t's do all the work like that and I want to go around the country and keep doing rallies and rile up everybody and get everybody to our side so basically and this shouldn't come to Earth is that and watching Fox News that he loves all of his time and everything else cheapest missing Joe he took all these deeply establishment figures Steve mnuchin of Goldman Sachs Steven on forgetting his name cone something count Cohen cone another guy from Goldman Sachs he had all these just career insiders brought them in his administration letters with the economy with foreign policy John Bolton deep neoconservative you said he believed in the opposite blast me with the power because he wants the system to keep running as it is and run smoothly while he goes around and just make the name for himself and talks about how amazing a tremendous this country is what an amazing job or doing so it is funny because he has two different personas one of them is going to pretend to BB&amp;T establishment guy and rally people up Non-Stop and be a politician and be good at it and then the other thing is behind the scenes he's like guys just keep everything running and hold it together with duct tape if you have to do before I get out of here so he's at the same time president actually doing some fascinating Dynamic that's going on right now it's a giant hustle that's right it's a giant Sandman and other people on the left my disagree with me on this but I think he's brilliant at it I think he's brilliant at this part of it but where he be really does have a way like he broke every single political rule that ever existed when he ran for president anyone so was that tell you it's a giant cement and other people on the left my disagree with me on this but I think he's f****** brilliant at it I think he's brilliant at this part of it but where he really does have a way like he broke every single political rule that ever existed when he ran for president anyone so what does that tell you</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you're going to hear what I just said about you know I care for all Single Payer Health Care and they're going to say yeah but how we going to pay for it cuz that's the commons one that she will bring up Melanie dress that because that's a really important question and usually when you actually substantially address of people go okay so now it cost more than if we had medicare-for-all why is that because we have an unnecessary for-profit middleman that essentially acts like a mafia so what we're saying is I'm going to remove that mop from around your neck and your ghost is basically what is that Mafia you referring to that Mafia the for-profit health insurance company so they have to they have to take their cut as the middleman between you and your doctor okay if we just remove that have the government at no profit margin be the single and sure that's what a single-payer means they're the single ensure then we actually end up saving 5 trillion dollars over the course of 10 years and that's not Kyle kulinski talking that's a detailed study from the University of massachusetts-amherst know. no f****** place so what do you what do you do when you have all these insurance companies like what happened to those insurance companies without all those jobs what happens all that money the insurance companies go away go away mean they go away and says go under so you killed a fight if I say you're not allowed to cut your lawn OK unless slushy the guy wants to charge you $100 I'm going to be the one who pays the person who cut your lawn you have to give me $200 or so if somebody came along and said no LOL hey middleman guy we're going to get rid of you and do you want to cut your lawn get back $100 in you're all set wouldn't you say well that makes sense the middleman guy it's he can piss off hey man don't take away my choice when it comes to picking my firefighter. What do you mean know the way it works is there's a fire get help end of discussion they will come you don't say well well well I want to pick my fire department will do the same thing with Healthcare the idea you're able to pick your doctor that's perfectly fine but the idea of you'll have your choice between insurance companies that's like saying pick which one you want the Irish mafia ripping you off for the Italian mafia rip you off at the Jewish Mafia ripping you off go ahead I'm giving you a choice public what type of privately-run and you can turn make a left on that road make a left on that road and make a right on that road don't take away my choice of road I want to pay for that one of them will ever know it's all there it's all free at the point of service and this is a whole idea of having a public utility does the whole idea of having something off the table in a civilized society study show is actually saved money so the real question people should be asking is how can we afford to keep having the system that we have right now because we pay more than the rest of the developed world and we have 40 to 45,000 Americans that die every year because they don't have access to basic health care and we have 500,000 people who go bankrupt as a result of medical bills so what you're saying is that they would do it abolish insurance companies actually so there is one caveat to that and that caveat is what's called supplemental health insurance so what that means is a medical procedure that isn't scientifically proven yet but it's still something that you like there would be Private health insurance companies that sell used Mitchell insurance which means on top of everything you already have through Medicare for all so if you were getting are stem cell therapy or something like that in an ideal medicare-for-all system and Bernie believe me has gone so far above and beyond any criticism I mean his things are tight it gives dental and vision to get everything I wouldn't be surprised if all Bill the stem cells thing is covered but Porsche Insurance on horse insurance or or or plastic surgery things of that nature and importance of private surgery or private insurance for for plastic I'm saying it would that you don't theoretically legal for it under Medicare for all system because it's supplement so how could you have insurance for plastic surgery say hey I'm in insurance company I'm going to come in and offer you something that's already covered in full by the single-payer system and the reason why that's there is we don't want you getting ripped off by some charlatans by Siri said but it was essentially gut the health insurance industry it would make it so that you no longer have health insurance company CEOs making tens of millions of dollars off the backs of people while people die because they can't get health insurance yes it would then that's a good thing that positive sale like to sell that well well the thing is we have this issue with where we have like a status quo bias where people think like well because it works how it works right now therefore the idea of addressing it and changing it seems like so overwhelming that we just kind of default to how we have it now but the problem is we know as a matter of fact that the way we do it now is the most batshit crazy way you could possibly do it because they researched this stuff all the time they studied this stuff and every single time they look at it the US comes dead last in the developer when it comes to health care so we finish there was a recent study from the Commonwealth fund they found that they sell the 11 different countries the US is 11th at 11 when it comes to health care so every other country that does the single-payer system with we were talking about and there's different versions of it there's multiplayer there single-payer is private funding of private insurance probably plenty of public insurance but bottom line is any other way you do it is better than the way we do it right now okay and just to be clear cuz some people table what about Obamacare was Obamacare Obamacare was originally a Heritage Foundation plan which is a right-wing think-tank so that was basically Mitt Romney's Healthcare Bill Newt gingrich's Healthcare Bill and whole idea was that that was we're going to force people to buy private insurance and I don't like that idea at all I think there's a good case to make that it was a step in the right direction because anything was better than the system that we had at the time but I would that was just a little step on the path to what we should have which is a medicare-for-all system where Healthcare is a right and a privilege we catch up the rest of the developed world and again we should go above and beyond the rest of the world cuz I can count and I don't think I have dental covered by it but burneyville does provide Dental so you know I think this is one of those issues where was fully 22 people is kind of a no-brainer and you can get people to realize I don't know the system is totally screwing you right now and we can fix it we should go above and beyond the rest of world cuz I can count and I don't think I have dental covered by it so don't put burneyville does provide Dental so you know I think this is one of those issues where was fully 22 people is kind of a no-brainer and you can get people to realize I don't know the system is totally screwing you right now and we can fix it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it's to me hits home because I needed to know when I needed to retire to when I stop fighting I knew I was like I'm not doing this the way I used to do this and I used to be completely obsessed but I saw a bunch of people getting knocked out an octave bunch of people out I knew that that easily could have visited you like to knock somebody out it's weird it's a Bittersweet feeling like you don't feel good you know it feels if you were in a true combat feel good and well fighting for your life you mean yeah competition mean it was all people my age you know I can 19 20 years old and I'm standing over the unconscious version of me you know that I just kicked in the head and that's how the person you can generate with a Kik is just so terrifying it's so terrifying you know the think that that's going to bounce off your head in the lights go out and then you could incur legitimate brain damage from something like that in the initial kick or in that hit the drops we can both kick someone kicks you in the head someone who really knows how to kick they bounce a f****** Shin off your temple you might not ever be the same again that's real been knocked out I've never been knocked out I've been stopped which means I got tko'd with a punch and the guy followed up with a bunch of punches in the referee stop the fight that was the last fight ever had but I would never cast of three fights in a day on my won the first two one the first one by knockout a beat the f*** out of the second guy and I was pretty sick actually going into the fight and going into the return I would get sick sometimes he'll be nervous and it wasn't my nutrition with terrible and then the third fight I got hit with a left hook and I got one the first round in the second round I got hit with a left hook my legs just want you to stop working and I remember going to f*** s*** I've never been dropped like that before where my legs just he was a perfect left his calling Ryan the chance of what if he catches you on the chin what is the what's happening that it's it hit its like it connected to the brain with your brain right and your brain like it it also does something is like nerves behind your jaw when you get hit hard it just it's like an electrical charge goes in your body and everything just shuts off it's weird like it was total ponchos for my legs just stopped working and then they'll all that happening while that's happening more punches are coming boxing was an MMA and MMA the guy would jump on you and then stop it right there or you would maybe grab hold of them and maybe you would survive maybe wouldn't it is arguments that is safer in MMA because they stopped it quicker is also arguments when I go to the ground you can actually survive better and get hold on and maybe that would allow you to take more damage and maybe that's not a safe I'm in the former I think it's safer cuz I think once fights get stop quicker and safer but when you got jolted and electricity went through did you go down to dust your gloves off and the kids swarmed at me again hit me with a bunch more punches and I covered up the referee stop the fight so that was a TKO technical knockout but I had already known that I was kind of I was already doing stand-up comedy at that time as well and I didn't know that I was half in half out and then I had to wait when is this 1989 so this evening before this before news radio not there's no future in this and I was trying to make the Olympic team which was the Nationals were in Miami in 1988 and wait where you from Boston that's why is Adam so I was Massachusetts state champion and then I would go to these National tournaments and compete against like the the Illinois champion of the New Hampshire champion and money in 1988 and wait where you from Boston Massachusetts state champion and then I would go to these National tournaments and compete against like the the Illinois champion of the New Hampshire champion and</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Barbie Fitness in my f****** jeans somewhere maybe cuz my mom's dad was a boxer like growing up like a like a guy and he had a record he was kid Dixie show growing up like my grandmother's house there's a picture of a guy like in that position with trunks but old timey like and Grandpa boxer not even box somebody but have someone hold pads for you and you learn how to punch and hit path cuz it's exciting it's fun to do it's like you can turn anything. the center of attention of a thousand 5000 bunch of people as a man on stage even the man in the ring sometimes when you're doing a UFC event and stuff like that you know what it's like of the surge the the energy that comes from like I'm here and everybody's got I got their attention and I command the f****** room is part of why we do what we do my grandfather having been a boxer must have felt that right like f****** probably way more than I feel when I walk up on stage we're on the reboot Roadshow tour I'm like why feel clever sitting in the back watching the movie with the audience in here and left this is a guy who is like I'm the Man in the ring and like it's all up to me and my fists and I could be a God or go tonight and like to know it becomes Primal and there's pounding and s*** like that you would imagine there's a if you got in the ring and he pursued it enough to have a record there must have been some sort of call some sort of satisfy maybe it's sometimes people do it for money right maybe with this guy now been a way to make a living know this guy know he I mean you don't think you did it I think it was hoping for purses but I don't think it was just like this or mailman or them although that's where the story is kind of going not mailman but this was a guy who boxed professionally and the story was that my grandmother like when they had their first kid might have to jinya my grandmother was like you can't be a boxer anymore and so he was like all right and then stop being a boxer and then my grandfather became a custodian in the Newark courthouse and every day he would like get dressed up in a suit and take the bus to the Newark Courthouse they lived in a different section or and then he'd put on his custodian outfit and like clean the toilet sweep the floors and stuff like that salt-of-the-earth s*** so my whole life I never question this you know your wife says you quit and you quit and stuff like that until I became older and I became something of the man in the ring myself I know what it's like to stand you know at attention for everybody where everybody you were the focus of thousands where you get a level of affection from a from a one vociferous mass that is unparalleled from any of the amount of affection you give him any other single human being in this world it is I've never done heroin but I imagine it's better than heroin it's one of the greatest drugs that they fuels us and you know we obviously like it we keep f****** doing it we make money off it yes but there's many ways to make money and we like it we do it because there's power to it and it feels fantastic and you feel like man they like me they really like me and then I start thinking why would he have put that all beside like how do you step outside all that just because your wife is like I don't want you to do that more and then it made me reconsider my grandparents and I figured out and I want to see if you back me on this play you don't know these cats you can have skin in the game so you can't offend anybody done that sound like she did dirty s*** that nobody else did the Badman somewhere else but the bed my thought is that he recognized it's very dangerous you probably knew people who died and he probably wanted to find a way out of it anyway which most Fighters do most Fighters at some point time to realize I'm going to have to jump off this ride one day I can't stay on this ride until I'm a dead man tells 90 years older a hundred years old it's not feasible it's does it doesn't exist there's no 98 year old boxers I don't think he faced his own mortality every boxer does every fighter does you you hit someone I try you see that well then he's probably been hurt you see people get hurt to see people get pummeled to see people get knocked out maybe been knocked out yourself and you realize that this is something that is unsustainable if he's not making any money at it it's extremely dangerous and you start you know you start thinking what could happen to you when you know what can happen to you it happens to people you see it happen if it hasn't happened you you watch it happen other people if you're around Combat Sports enough you're going to see people get f***** up and when you see people get f***** up you real hey this is voluntary there's other ways to make a living I don't have to do this anymore I can get off this ride or you're the type of person that doesn't give a f*** you want to be a champion and you're your thought is you are here for Glory you are here for a legacy you're here to leave your mark you want to go down in history as a great and if you don't feel that way I tell people to get out. I think fighting is one of the most singular Pursuits a person can get into you're not only giving like the I'm dedicating myself to some dick giving your body something that like you're taught your entire life protect this it's also the consequences are so grave the consummate zigging and zagging you you go the wrong way run into Annie wrong way run to head kick wrong way you wanted to a punch you know you duck into an apricot your f****** lights go out you're laying on your back they're going to Flashlight your face and ice in the backyard can you you don't even know what day it is you don't know what and then. You never get back and you can only get so many of those your life you know what there's it depends on the person but you get knocked out 345 x whatever the number is there's a certain number that your life is going to be f****** different now because now your brain doesn't work good anymore that's a fact and maybe we'll get a little bit better over time maybe can go through some cognitive therapy there's some different things are doing with magnets and different things are doing with stems are there shooting straight into your cerebral spinal fluid and they think that that might have some sort of a positive impact on CTE but man that the reality is Combat Sports are a f****** brutal brutal business and I think it's possible he just got to a place where but how do I get a dirty German girl who is just like I will let you do the anal you got to get out of the ring and he says she's like I'll give you one ring for the other and he was a God damn it cuz he called her gussied-up onion like lot of people that have Combat Sports induced brain damage there's no doubt about it no if ands or buts half-and-half out I go f****** hard in the paint I tell him that you got to get the f*** out of this now you have to trust me and let you know and I've done to the point where people think I'm mean and I'm like look I'm not mean about very many things in this life but when it comes to people are delusional about their abilities and Combat Sports or their future and Combat Sports I get f****** mean because I think you I know you got to know with no uncertain terms I can't be protective of your feelings I have to go in hard because no one else is going to people don't they b******* you coaches b******* you trainers b******* you they tell you got a chance promoters willing to put you on fights when you really should retire it is a dirty aspect of the business and I don't I don't play that s*** if I think that someone should get out I go hard and I tell him and you know I've done it to friends I've done it too commentary for the vast mean they pulled me aside and I said you got to get out man you got to get out cuz if you can talk right now you're okay right now but how many more shots can you take how many more times you get knocked out one KO can change your whole f****** life meldrick Taylor got knocked out by Julio Cesar Chavez and melchior tail was Olympic gold medalist of fantastic boxer was lightning-fast combinations beautiful skill but Julio Cesar Chavez just kept wearing on him and wearing on him only dropped him in the final round and they stop the fight would like seconds going to fight Richard Steele stop the fight was a big controversy like oh my God how can you stop the fight manager was heading the scorecards and you know it was only a couple seconds to go and Magic would have wanted decision it was a right call because he was done after that fight man after that play he was never the same you hear him talk today it's the saddest s*** in the world he can barely put together a sentence and he had a few fights after that against Terry Norris was a brutal knockout punch her and couple other she just was never the same again it was that one fight one fight one beating too much and it was just it all fell apart on them and that can happen that can happen to any fighter and when you're done you're done and the only way you should ever compete as a fighter is if it is this is your f****** callings the thing that you're obsessed with it is your one hundred percent focused and as soon as it's not as soon as you have doubts get out because there's a bunch of people out there that don't have doubts and I was trying to tell people I think about Mike Tyson before he won the title thing about the Mike Tyson that destroyed Marvis Frazier think about that m*********** that guy is all in you don't ever want to face a guy who's all in when you're half-assing it a lot of people half-assing it didn't even realize or half past mid-day just have this thing in her head well I'm trying pretty hard I'm doing good I got good skills I can beat this guy but when someone's in there in and it's Combat Sports are uniquely dangerous in terms of the consequences of you not being committed so you got to know when to get out and no one does very few people to look a few guys Andre Ward retired undefeated Olympic gold medals to division world champion he's the rarest of the rare most guys they keep going until they get f***** up they keep going until they get knocked out to get brutalize and then you meet him afterwards and could barely talk man they could barely talk I've seen so many guys I could just barely string words together everything's a mumble all the words of slurring to the next word it's horrible man and I saw it in the gym I saw in the gym with guys who never made it they still got brain damage. The f****** the gods of Combat Sports they don't give a f*** if you win a title if you're eating shots you take punches to the Head kicks to the head you're getting f***** up man no matter what it was like they did know the people get Punch-Drunk but they didn't know what was cause it's not even knock out it's it's sub-concussive trauma that does the Gallatin the world of hockey as well as terrible but Knockouts are also riffic and then from me my discussions with guys like dr. Mark Gordon who's an expert in traumatic brain injuries and he works with a lot of soldiers and he runs a TBI Foundation to deal with injuries that soldiers and football players and Fighters face and his descriptions of it will scare the f****** s*** out of you I mean people can get brain damage from f****** jet skiing I just bouncing up and down this is a real thing you can get a shot to the head or golf balls golf ball that kind of s*** changes people forever forever so you grandfather probably wanted out for some thought number one Sober Sober October gives you a different Joe Rogan Burns of the Combat Sports I can listen to you spin Yarns tell Tales you know what that's unfair to Ken Burns I call you the Jean Chef of I don't know who that is but I hope he's off you seem to remember Christmas story about the books the essays that it's all based on my other thoughts that is far more dignity than I ever afforded my grandfather I appreciate it my mom is going to appreciate that and then 4th f*** I lost my point are the thoughts that is far more dignity than I ever afforded my grandfather I appreciate it my mom is going to appreciate that and then fourth fuk I lost my point I thought I had enough of them</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you have you had some incredible fights but to me what one of my Fondest Memories is you know what Kevin James is from the King of Queens TV show me and Kevin James were at my house in Encino the night you fought Tyson the first one the first fight and went when you drop Tyson I'll never forget it because back then we need a bug Buster Douglas beat and Tyson but what kind of almost thought it was like a fluke but when you were batter enticing and then you put him down to stop him I'll never forget Kevin James jumping off the couch oh my god with throwing arms up in the air and that was for sure one of the greatest Heavyweight Championship victories in the in the history of sport it was just incredible fight because a lot of people's eyes Tyson was like this a bad guy he was like a live people thought of him as like a thug you know and you were thought I was just like really good guy and many people didn't think that you were going to be able to beat him so when you didn't just beat him but you took it to him took it to him you know like early on the fight you could tell that you had decided you're going to push him around and you know once you would stop him I mean it was it was pandemonium in my house who everybody was going crazy they couldn't believe it things that you do well so son you know which one which one is sports you going to do besides I was a good athlete but football and boxing with my two best one but you're not play basketball good morning back after a crime and you can't quit to the season is over so I had to play on that I play play on that game they found it let me play in championship game they see how good I was and asked me was I coming back next year I should know series at why I said I ain't got you told me you got the bed on yourself or you going to bed on the couch so in boxing you bet on yourself right and teens boy you better know the coach you bet on the culture been on the other players and you bet on the coach of letting you play right right where is inboxing they have to let you fight that's right now you may be asking somebody tagged him for you now when did you think that boxing was going to be your career was it right after that it's like around 10th grade was that you know and came down to one one sport that I really do real well until that fit 9 you know I just put everything in it where you are part of that incredible Olympic team to imeem so many great fighter came out of that Olympic team right Freeland Pernell Whitaker Taylor I can tell you all of them Bobby Shannon 125ml to Taylor my 32 Pernell Whitaker 139 Jerry Jerry and and 147 with Mark Breland 156 Frank take my 65 version Hill 78 wine silver amazing you besides Michael Spinks you were one of the rare guys to move up to move up and be successful as a heavyweight did you just decide like after you beat Dwight Muhammad qawi who was the cruiserweight champion and you'd beat you know some real good names at that way class you just decided that heavyweight was it where the real money was that actually you know I wanted to be and and only person that I knew is Mike Tyson doing I could do it so so when Mike Tyson what they're about you know you know you know people tend to make up excuses. Mike Tyson a small person 566 by 2030 lb he beat the Daylights I figured it might could do it I can do it so I gave you inspiration and you crazy you have to be a little of that to be in this anyway yeah there's no doubt about that right so when you first did fight Mike Tyson was that like something you would always knew was going to happen once he got out of jail and so you know what and you know and everybody and everything that I've done everybody will always remind me you didn't beat Mike Tyson is not like it was my fault mad at me they tell me I can't wait till you fight Mike Tyson thing is is that you know he was that person that I watch everyone is fine and then I realized you can't make that message that many mistakes with Mike Ryan when you finally did beat him do you think when you just fight them and did beat them to think that raised you or your celebrity and your notoriety to a different level not not really a thing it let people know that you ain't gotta you ain't got to be considered a bad person to be good and the rent and but everybody thought that because I didn't curse a lot I don't get in trouble that you you ain't mean enough to beat a mean guy so then I meant and I did everything right I want a lawyer for a lot bigger and and but it's alright to the game it's really our heart is really are in this is not just one thing you just you hit harder because you had a baby to take something to give some Brian where you always can take it yeah that was a big part of your your career when you have an iron chin I mean really opposed at giant man and he hit you with some bombs Wars that you guys had you were able to take some credible punches the argue with me I knew that I can take it but can you take it and so the whole big thing as the whole big thing my whole thing my old my whole big thing with Mike is that what Mike had told somebody say everybody got a plan till they get hit in the end he was right and so that was part of the plan was to let him know that early right it seems like that was when you when you fought him protecting the first round you pressed him and it was that was a rare moment to see someone like really pushing Mike back and getting my back on his heels if if you like might get you back that maybe it right right right when you know when you know how good you are when somebody press you with what you doing she said might load oppress other people can he handle depressed what you make what you do to somebody and somebody do it again you get ticked right like that's the thing was to we practice just pulling pressure when pressure One Direction make him feel the same way that he make other people feel so that was the game plan going into gameplay is the fight is probably the most famous fight cuz he bit of chunky ear off and I saw it when you come in here show everybody that and realize holy he bit a chunk out of your f****** ear right what what were you thinking of that time by New Bern getting ready to bite the Daylights out of him and I will bite him in the face for the ER I pretended like it like it was a real bad ass but I'll come swoop you up and fight you ready and your face everybody know what I was going to do ice but this this Prophet told us before the fight he told me he said look he going to do something and your face Aaron's that you but you got to stay focused if you don't stay focused when a man and I knew I'll give me the buy him back and and but my corner person to tell me keep my mind on the Lord I'm quite a chunkier and it hurts so bad if babies having a bad did it hurt did UCI high jump I was just trying to remember that get him I want to bite it I really wanted to bite him back and and all the sudden I hit my mind need to get back to being just the Lord so you don't go get back cuz you going to get cold I was amazing they didn't stop the fight immediately but they came back and check and then he asked me you all right I will be scared and he seen I called him Andy to shot then she bit me again man and I jumped back and I just getting ready to kick him in the balls and I went back to the corner and I was so I really don't get it and they stop the fight find a way out well well yeah but it's the only thing that I guess with me and what I stand on is that I was able to forgive her and yes that's has been to turn around in my life to tend to make people people always wanted by the Nazi but I forgave in there go around the world with the Muslim to whatever and people said while this guy kept Wiki of how can you put give for you already beating the guy I know but you don't but it's what is what life have to be if you going to buy with even your brothers and sisters cuz if you don't forgive nobody you going to be a mad person you're going to find yourself locked up Brian and it's going to haunt you you forgave him it took a weight off your shoulders yet Mike and I will do a lot of things together because they forgive this part and he's been cool to see you together now I mean when it when I have seen things that you've done together I'm like wow crazy like after he bit you those crazy fights and to see you together laughing and joking around together it's it's pretty interesting eventually she'll skin calling you ain't used to be tall to short but you know this is yours statue and at two people to people came from the ghetto who box and box with only thing I did real well okay in football and but the thing is that after all that looking at much money we made doing something that we not doing it properly we make money we make money and we can both raise our family in the way that we want to raise them how long did it take after the fight before you forgive them into the locker room and everybody start complaining that I can't believe you did this. You got to be given to bite you in the locker room right after the fight me I think it's who in control God so I wasn't Lord I wouldn't this thing all about it he said forgiving very important people that everybody come to see and they need to know that forgiveness is a big part of life and so I was able to do that so in the point of being able to do that you know how I realize that it made my life better than all over the world that's a very powerful decision and you know it's a very powerful statement you know to for you to forgive him after that I mean that really that probably did a lot of good for a lot of people to realize man of Evander Holyfield can forgive Mike Tyson after he bit a chunk of his ear off I mean that's a that's a wrong statement of character right there you know what mean when when things things don't go right I go back to the Branson Lord what it's all about forgiveness and I wouldn't be who I am is a short somewhere ball game in in New York head and I looked up and everybody was screaming and I wonder what they screaming about telling me to watch out watch out for who I looked up at Mike and had to Big Bear coat and he then he went to number shake hands and a week after a week after your nonsense is probably still sore not in Anger they smiled and said when he became that guy wow do when you saw mine did you guys talk come down with the door open and everybody was shocked so they was shot when the while we wasn't fight right. It's just you to an elevator other people drunk about a third fight date they mention it invite you to the thing is is that they want to give a lot of money and they they were asking me to try to an amount thing is that I got to feel like it's kind of a bully for you to answer my to fight the fight you again when you know you going to win again I just didn't I didn't think they if Mike is Mike want to do it I would have done it but I wasn't going to go ask all right I think you been a bully when you know you're better than somebody and you want to you want to play them at something that you know you going to beat up Ryan right but you know you know you feel that you better and so I think it'll be wrong with me I asked right now that's that's amazing I mean but that just shows what kind of a person you are like good that shows what kind of character you have and that's ordered defines your career that you are the guy that did always seek the big challenges anything that great it come from God at all given time I had a mom who who had a sixth grade education but she raised me she raised the 4 time heavyweight champ of the world she stayed on me all the time and my brothers and sisters and Mom you don't make a sister to him you need him go out to my mama said he going to be all right you just wait and see she never did give into nobody said about about me and I became who I am and I'm just here so I'm just so thankful they in in the Bible said all good things come from God anything that is good for you it came from God</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> there are aliens do you want to be here when they make contact why think they're making contact whether we like it or not because we're looking and watching whether we like it or not they're observing and I think if you were an intelligent being from another planet you would want to make sure that the territorial monkeys don't blow each other up and that's what we are we are like this adolescent stage of evolution where we still have all of our Primal territorial jungle instincts but yet we also have this insane a bit need to harness the Adam we also have this ability to send videos through space and then we can catch them on your phone and play it back and forth we hardly withhold energy in these little rectangular devices that we holding our Pkwy charge them and we charging them with f****** nuclear power that's you know the nuclear power plants are charging our phones then the phone's going to our pockets and then we're like real close you know we're real close to a lot of this crazy technological innovation and it keeps getting more and more spectacular with every passing generation and they're probably watching they're probably watching and waiting and trying to figure out what the f*** were doing and if you believe what they told Bob Lazar that they were responsible for an accelerated Evolution where they were Wayward lights come on too much information as they were saying who's they when he was working for the police to work for the Air Force was the air force that Lazar was working for whatever it whatever the government body that was operating area S4 they gave him a bunch of breakdowns on a lot of things they do and what were they think they got these crafts from where the crafts are one of them was from an archaeological dig he said but they gave him an explanation of what these aliens are here for and what they're doing and one of the things that they sat and he said I have no method of verifying whether or not it's true or not but that they had accelerated the evolution of primitive primates so they had taken primitive primates and they had done something to time to change them from a primitive being to what we have now and Homo sapiens and I was very quickly if you really look at Evolution the difference between Australia pithecus and Homosapien it's only a few hundred thousand years which is insane if you if you think of how much more advanced we are than those lower hominid and there's no other animal that's experienced that kind of a leap the human brain doubled in brain size over . of 2 million years we have no idea how we have no idea what happened is all speculation with her it's eating meat controlling fire using tools hunting increased access to protein changing from herbivores to omnivores to carnivores all these different theories the throwing arm that's another theory that it humans figured out a way to use an arm to throw and hit things and that accelerated alright problem solving skills is a lot we don't know Siri called the stoned ape theory he believed that human beings were experimenting with psilocybin mushrooms and it's psilocybin mushrooms accelerated Revolution who knows we don't know but one of the things that they were telling was our when he was working it as for back engineering and crafts were that human beings with a product of accelerated Evolution and that these space beans and there was more than one there's more than one civilization that was involved in this these space beings at crafts were the human beings were the product of accelerated Evolution and that these space beings and there was more than one there's more than one civilization that was involved in this these space beings had had some sort of hand and this running experiment that is the evolution of man</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's not that because you don't think about that but I think about that it's time to takes away from the actual thing the actual thing deserves 100% of your attention and the Apple has saying you feel that in the moment but when do you f****** feel it like when you like everybody icon I'm always concentrating on the things get the things that you do I make it where you all right so I concentrate on anything but like then if I can celebrate that like holyshit I stuck The Landing light like we we have a great show like me and Santino Saturday night we have the f****** wild show does arena in Cleveland was awesome after was over we high-five we get something to eat and that's it then then you let it go you got to let it go because my King is literally on the road every night and it's like a bee even though like it's a different show every night and that's it from wonderful audience like I'm still thinking about the two shows we have the music box Chicago Theater was religious of all the strings I've ever had in my life like those two will stick out and you get to sit down and watch people enjoy the peace is also also organic but it's organic as you want it to be nothing to do with that question but even then it's not like you're doing us like a bit you know like where you have to begin your set thank you very much cargo great to be here here's the thing about Chicago oh yeah there's bit but they don't I was I was blown away by Carlin like one that we were rehearsing on dogma and George Carlin was and we have smoked Burgers the 90s everybody smokes cigarettes and s*** and I was like what are you and everybody was then Linda, Chris Rock and George is like I'm working on this for the new HBO show he goes called advertising lullaby and that's what you mean working on it and it goes while memorizing I was like you memorize your bits and goes yeah right everything I think you write your bit I was just thought you kind of came up or shut up stop your head against Nazis like I tried everything and then have to memorize everything like a script and then we were like can you do it and he's like yeah you want to say it and so he did a Command Performance for the eight of us in the room of 1000 lullaby and it was Pitch Perfect I saw the HBO show like you know months later and it was Pitch Perfect so I couldn't believe that that dude was committed to the written word as he was but he fancied himself a writer first and foremost even want to do comedy though like he really backed into it he was he wanted to be Danny Kaye you wanted to act and stuff like that and he was just happen to be funny first to do the radio DJ thing and then they P2P weatherman Burns and Allen was Prior that stuff but it kind of backed into comedy and was excellent at it but was not like it was not like this is what I've always wanted to do since I was a kid just kind of you always seem to accept the fact that he was like all of this is that I'm a genius at this all right he did it differently he would do a man he was probably the most prolific big-name guy of all time and he actually inspired Louis CK to do a new hour every year because that's what he did Carlin George did a new hour every year and part of the reason why his seventy five nights a year how that happened but it is book last words he talks about like me but a chat sometimes he would like to chat in the seventies he was that f****** easy but a jet and he would sit on the runway in Long Island at a at LaGuardia and just do Coke in the f****** playing anytime I jump on stage cuz weed every night after reboot we get up on stage and work the crowd and stuff I got a chance to say hello to him once said hi to everybody said hi the door guys we go see him do a show me and Chris Rock is me and my wife Jen and Chris was married to his wife a lock of that point and George is playing at Caesars in Atlantic City and so he's like I got seats for you guys up front so you know rock was like it had his role with the new he was like f****** at the height of his game and s*** until we go see the shown and Carlin had a bit where he it was like people I could do without like guys named skip s*** like and one of my people I could do without any man over the age of 12 who wears their baseball cap backwards so you know long before I met him at the show he's up there doing it bit and you know he's like another person I could do without Kevin you exempt from this guy's over the age of 12 weather baseball cap backwards like my foot up and rocks next to me Rocco's he knows who you are even though like we did work together on the movie and it was so exempt though for the like he the like blows people for rides at the day he was such a committed after they would day we shot we had him for a few hours and then he had to rush off to go be on stage and be Carlin so he made a little window of time for us and he came to me on Saturday goes Kevin your the writer-director this I have a question for you as a good guy and he goes you know this says that I'm f****** with I talked to him about the rules of the road with these idiots or do I believe in the rules of the road can't believe you're giving it this much vodka and thought towards I said but like the way I wrote it I assume the guy believed in the rules of the road because that's what I thought I was that's exactly what I f****** thought he was so like committed to Performance man like he was an absolute joy to be around and he was never on he's like you like f****** not like a man how about them Donuts he doesn't feel the need to make you laugh I love Tracy Morgan death don't get me wrong but like you got to save 6 hours for facial you know Rehabilitation yes because you're just going to laugh until 11 in your faces in that rictus grin the entire if I can tell you ever met John Witherspoon and his son JD and my f****** face hurt after was over it was like cramps up Morgan like my cheeks were hurting George was not that guy he just sat there no conversation with him like he was just interesting f****** face hurts really tell my God she's so funny her stories are

Going or something I can do something I can be somebody I can I can I can do something that's fulfilling and rewarding and I know that I'm not a loser because a lot of it is like confidence write a lot of it is if you look at your life and you look at things that other people are doing you a card I can't do that he's doing that they these people could do that they're different than me I don't have confidence it takes doing something and having some success at that gives you confidence do other things and martial arts I wasn't so terrifying to me it was so scared of it that it became by overcoming that and becoming successful at it it gave me this understanding that you can do you can basically do with Envy whatever you want if you just focus on it and you're not going to do it it's not going to be a media you're not going to be successful immediately and you're going to fail but through those failures you learn and you go back and you get some experience you do it better next time and that is from the book of five rings and in that book he said something I read it when I was like 17 years old once you understand the way broadly you will see and everything and that that is that is if anything that is one of the main focuses of my life that I think that works on say once you understand the way broadly you can see it in everything that describes you your Seeker my favorite proverb is May you realize your own Divinity in this lifetime I saw it on a yoga wall hanging at my wife put on the house once and it's just it wasn't really the message she intended she just liked I think the image of Boo and one day I was letting the dogs out and I was waiting by the door so you have time to like really stare at and I was probably just stoned enough and then completely understood it was like you realized you're on Divinity meaning don't wait until you drop dead to find out you were got all along handing it off to somebody else and some higher power our powers and you became a fighter Twerk something before he became a filmmaker made him feel worth something make manifested he's absolutely right it's the you can kind of do anything so the shift to me from doing something it was competition especially concert competition with grave physical consequent really really doing stand-up when I first start doing stand-up I realized okay this could be at like the the fuking fighting thing that's like it's a dead end there's no money I just before the UFC there was no money intake box remember I'd gotten offered kickboxing fight a professional fight for 500 bucks and I was like what is at $500 a month have to train for 6 weeks no alcohol eat eat good run do all these different things trained and then five hundred bucks at the end of may be brain-damaged like when you see what pornstars get paid for anal and you're like what like you'd imagine like that.

really interesting they actually got the cameras for drug Runners right so you have you can see in the infrared so it's beyond the observable you know I myself have not detailed looked at the footage however Fleer experts some people that work with NSA have looked at it for me and these are not lights in the distance these are craft very similar Commander favorite talks about without plumes without heat signatures non-traditional field propulsion systems we don't have that and thought they tried to this it right here in system Mexican Airforce footage lights on like an oil rig out in the water that's been deep back and I think we're getting ready to go to Fallon and I'm Comcast ended the home page comes up and there's this video when I go holy cow that looks like what we chased finally went off script I was tracking the scripts for the last two years with Pentagon spokespeople say about Commander papers experience someone went off-script last week in the New York Times and she admitted there's an increased frequency of mrs. because of these aavs I'm almost Aerospace Vehicles so it it's pretty astounding we're getting all these kind of revelatory moments in these little seeds that these are not ours we don't have this even Eli doesn't have this I mean this is a propulsion system unlike anything we have it's amazing it's gravity Propel now that gimbal footage and it said that there's a fleet of them how far away are those guys where you're seeing you don't see the individual objects singular spot where the pot is you know when you get free Niro would be like you know if I put three people around you I can look at you and not see the other people so that the pot is doing but the radar is seeing everything cuz it has a nice to radar in which is an active electronically scanned array so instead of like The Radars we had which did the mechanical you know doing this like old-school this thing is just a panel that sits in the front of the airplane and they're being steering or beam shaping it can move and they can look all over so we used to have was called track while scan so we would be acotar why we're still scanning this thing has can log it scans while tracked so it it literally if it sees you if the radar sees you it has basically a weapons quality solution then it can do that on multiple targets is that's how it's the same way to the Spy radar the Aegis system works on the Cruisers they can track multiple Targets in at weapons quality on all these different targets while it's still scanning of volume so in that image you're seeing one individual object but there's other objects yes the radar is seeing the object at the pod hanging out where they're talkin and when you hear the video you hear the the pilot say do look at the essay page there's there's a whole Fleet of them so what they're seeing is the the the Pod is looking at the main that's the bigger object at the Kimbell the thing is rotating on the screen and there's five smaller things in front so just think they're sitting there and then they kind of he said they turn around on the on the radar and start going the other way while the pods looking at this guy just kind of rotating select a Mothership and smaller aircraft could be something cops are just the den of the one large one they have is the targeting pod I would highly not even if they had the video that they're going to release the radar video because of classification levels are you able to tell the story you told me about what was underwater with your your other buddy because they're gas at the time on a contract in one of the guys that story came out in the he was a Navy helicopter pilot any comes anybody comes in what he goes to talk to you man I go to talk to you getting off of at the time it was off of Puerto Rico and Roosevelt roads at the end up closing but he was flying out of there and super clear Caribbean water and they have these things they're called bqm as they fly around and then when they're all done cuz I'll fly towards the ships in the ship that they can track with the radar and then they also do in the like the ships or submarine shoot Torpedoes there are called Telemetry rounds so they have they gather all the data with a torpedo or is doing underwater and then they blow ballast in this thing will come to the surface and then I go pick him up and then they can extract all the data out of them so they do it for both so he said the first time they're out there going to pick up this bqm and those things when they're flying they're done a parachute comes out and I got to go hook it up a kilo drops the swimmer in the water he goes and hooks this whole thing up the whole thing up and fly back and then they tracked it and so the window to cuz you're just going to hang out he says he's going on there and they're getting this thing hooked up in his he's looking down you know cuz I know what 50 feet above the water he sees kind of his dark Mass coming up from the depths and they starting to Hoist the the diver up and he's got to got to be human is a hoist it up he says he's looking at what the hell is that and then it just goes back down underwater Lagos access Apple on later in a few months later he's out he's picking up a torpedo so he says they got the hook the diver up on the winch and they're lowering him in and he's he's looking down he sees this big massive because it's not a summary scene summaries before this big object and he starts screaming through the intercom system to tell him to pull the diver up in the divers like Fifi from the water so they reversed the winds in the divers thinking I was going on and if you getting pulled up and all the sudden he said the torpedo just got stuck down underwater and the object just to send it back down Into the Depths and they never recovered this the Torpedoes and this happened in the late 90s late mid-to-late 90s something happened when it flew ballast and it took on water and sink and he's like it didn't sink because it literally looks like it got sucked down the only reason I didn't talk to him when they did the New York Times stuff they talk to him about it because the incident was from the 90s they didn't want any they wanted something you do newer so he did not include it but I know they talked to him about it now what was the other foot pulled up there wasn't a gimbal footage that go fast back but it's I saw it going across the water in their there they're just grabbing a lock so they're seeing this with their eyes and he gets the flu to lock out and that's when you hear the kid go I got it cuz it gets the auto track and it's just something screaming across the surface of the water so in this is in the same area this is east coast this is the same time frame is the gimbal video so the idea that these are birds or the idea that this is a radar glitch or error like on a clear blue day Commander fravor has nerves I mean set on your show to you that you know this Vietnamese or explanations that makes sense I don't want to say that everything like every single thing that's ever happened has a rational explanation of the probability that you know all The Radars went off at the wrong time commander fravor and you know had nerves at all the other Pilots up there with him to know this thing shut off like a like a can like a gun instantly like that that was somehow perfectly that's a conspiracy that that's a fabrication probably Occam's razors the events happened exactly like we're being told us it was not go back to the beginning of the story of the other pilot whose brand new Squadron for 4 months 5 months so she's pretty Jr's used to working on her initial quality airplane and Associates then you see. The water and you think of something sinking cuz it's kind of like shape of an airplane you know that cross type so now it's pathetic and to the Tic Tac and as soon as a Tic Tac it's like being holyshit what is that you know and when you get you know some people get very emotional when you talk about it because for me it was like you know for her when you talk to her that she has a distain for some of the leadership that didn't tell us that these things were out there do you know they're here now we're getting Vector because we're the first time the man they're planted Bender board one of these things showed up that no one even gave us a brief the Hayward Sandy's object out here for the last two weeks or just you might want to know they're out there and they never told us no one knew these things existed besides the radar operators and the radar operators didn't know what they were they just lips also there's a lot of stuff that you know that it flew around and it came around me and it didn't do any of that stuff it's the story that I gave you a relatively benign but you know it's an interesting experience so these incidents that they reported were taking place before you saw your that Tic Tac encounter and they were taking place over a. Of how many weeks 2 weeks to the beginning of the month for that's just too weak at sea. we pulling for Thanksgiving but other than that we were out till thanks Amber 21st is when we push it back in. Besides pulling in for the 3 days of Thanksgiving so yeah for the two weeks prior so this was on the 14th and we went out to beginning of the month so about two weeks I've been watching these things come down and go up come down go up but it was always when we were not flying which is really probably like the midnight time frame until early in the morning the next Nino till noon the next day and then we just happen to go if you think about it you know I laughed at you know if there was some little green Man flying the next day and then we just happen to go if you think about it you know I laughed but you know if there was some little green Man flying around in that Tic Tac you probably got back to the Mothership and got yelled at for being see</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the gimbal video shows a different kind of thing yes how many different kinds of things are you aware of those are ours to attack I think there's other stuff out there sometimes it just like intelligence there's a guy Tom Cruise made the movie about him what's his name Louisiana dude was flying the drugs for Pablo in and out very seals Barry seal you know it was all great until Reagan posted that picture that they had the cameras inside the cargo plane and then Pablo put something out of the only place that picture came from is Barry seals are planning on there now Barry seals a Deadman. This video but it was supposed to be or how did they get that video are of the Tic Tac video that thing first came out it's kind of funny the guy that was in my backseat had sent me an e-mail this is about probably 2008 so I was retired and he sent me this video say Skippers is familiar it was on strangeland. Com but not suitable for work but I look and then next thing you know it on YouTube so my friend I would go to the YouTube video has years before the New York Times article when they did The Unofficial official report the YouTube video was taken down off of YouTube and you know what kind of puzzle me like why did you take the video down and I told the guys when they did The Unofficial Fisher-Price that we really need to look at how did this thing come off of a classified drive system on an aircraft carrier and end up on streamlined., YouTube because at the time the videos were classified secret and I know it's not because it was a UFO it's the 18th lunar video what they did not want that releases heat on CNN they blocked out all the performance stuff with your plane is actually doing in this case you know the one you see it it's not that big of a deal but you know how many different types of vehicles are you aware of that have been reported credible reports for decades hundreds of different shapes even Lazar himself said he saw you do 9 different styles or working up the same proportion system the Tic-Tac shaped in a vehicle that goes back in history some people say cigar-shaped you know big ship small ships they're all different kinds I think it's important to State though there are there are other funded government-funded UFO programs it's a misnomer actually that a tip was the recipient of the 22 million dollars was actually Harry Reid created program called all set. Was the sole beneficiary but 22-minute New York Times got it wrong and then what happen is a tip with a different funded program to study military encounters with UFOs. Was created because of Skinwalker Ranch government program to study UFOs and Associated phenomenon a tip and offset communicated and shared information but they were independently funded so the 22 million dollars was for Alsip and then a tip had its own sources and they did collaborate to UFO programs there are more that I think we're going to learn about so the different shapes that Bob Lazar saw there was nine different shapes that he is I want to close you and none of them were like to take Tac not specifically however that's not an uncommon if you go back in history of like military sightings of crap going to be over 20,000 miles an hour The Tick Tock is a shape they have triangles they have one that looks like rectangles the thing that is common with all of them is the non reactionary potion system I think even come out of favor said the thing noticed him was words he first said to me and I kind of went towards him with its nose but it could move in direction right I mean you could just move that will have a great morning when we first thought it was just basically never turned was just going left right now I'm kind of doing this probably doesn't matter and then or what it's pretty wild it's a big deal to actively Jim iradar of RC know it's you know whenever someone tells you an awesome story it's great to hear but kind of wish I saw it myself damn I wish I could say it story it's great to hear. I wish I saw it myself you know that thing that's yeah you like you you're telling me in my room listening I'm trying to imagine I'm putting it in my head and I'm visualizing it damn I wish I could see it</div>

She gives me more Goosebumps before because that's Best Buy trigger. To the fight right and this is a very old gesture from Myanmar from the Burmese Army back in the days when we were in the trenches and they were fighting enemies you challenge with honor and courage your opponents and you do that it activates the wing of an eagle fired up the rituals yes because some guys were coming from other disciplines other country and they were putting their white crew they were doing a bunch of other things you know I embrace the kosher guys were coming from other disciplines our country and they were putting their white crew they were doing a bunch of other things you know I embrace the kosher to get f***** by their guys and</div>

the prison for cancel it and then I like beat up to 2 and then I get right away challenge Manchester menu openweight so would like the the best in the country when are you open with champ you're the best in the world in Latoya Wright the biggest and 3rd 4th generation liquid by his grandfather was with and do all Golden Belt winners is born in in the like if you look where he lives it's wrong and it's a Hut it's in the jungle and he's he's raised in the head but culture like you is either Natalie's Headhunter you just go through the head and he has a good right hand so I'm like and I knew right away after that fight with tutu I see was fighting that night too so we I go shaking head he doesn't know yes or no in English that's how bad he is and iodized a good fight and you just give me a heads up and I need that we're going to meet so we meet and yeah and then where was I going with this basically talk about this cuz I was only my second like we fight every right and I'm fighting the best Legends in a row exactly so I'm like do you want to go and eat like so I go back I was at I was at Tiger at the time and that was a no what time I have to teach about the whole pads for headbutts and that's the way I did love it the way to do know Jack Russell headbutt elbow so then their last name is he cool I don't care I'm waiting fight I go there and first fight that's the hard part man like I the first round the first couple around the three round e i t i a push kick his stomach and he grabs it any issues Mardel egg many times so I actually section Maya the back of my leg like it was I had to do feel like my nerves I think in the back of my right leg was sex sections are not section but like seriously damaged okay so yeah section would be pretty bad so cuz I want to go inside and do my elbows and I can't cuz I and so then the patient I think is key in life as well ready to do it to adopt and that so again this guy is 70 fights you know like Michaelis is just smashing everyone and then I started acting I went to the leg instead looking to the like instead of this demand that he couldn't catch it anymore Above the Tie hyper-extended Anita and Isabel they call him the Bulls that goes inside he can't keep can't go inside if I'm pushing his life too much was a hard time and he's gassing out that little bit cuz you give is usually knocks him out in the first round equals Farm it so then I'm like I kind of I knocked him out a couple of times like knocking down a couple things I can do to fight so it was a real draw so we ended up right away automatic rematch fight you again how long 2 months 2 months for that leg is f***** up but then was it was it was an added sweetener that was very emotional today I have Goosebumps it's going to be a December 2011 2016 if you win this fight you got we're going to pay for your wedding and it's for the Golden Belt was only challenge fight this was actually for like you can is for the title fight so I got to draw and now it's like title fight sound like let's go by train and I train hard and yeah we go we need up again and now I have cuz I I propose you when I proposed the arena after the other fight in The Gambia if you have a chance to go there beautiful 10,000 temples UNESCO protected temples and that you would at 5 a.m. 4 a.m. and you see the sunrise on those like temples and like there's a hot air balloon is beautiful in Russian highlighting Ryland my script in Russian and she said yes I don't know how true to to to to love me but if so we go there but if you win you want to get married full gold would like Lake Elsinore picture that's pretty cool but it's going to be like we're going to make an event out of this MoneyGram but he's going to make an he's going to he's going to help me help Connor whatever like do you want to so that's why I want TV so I had a lot of pressure at 2 when I don't want my wife because their wedding was going to happen regardless right leg even after the Hova and the day of the week in Burmese language that was pictures from BBC look at my hat maybe you can go on the left and maybe consider this one yeah look at have like at everybody comfortable thing in the world you wear that it's like a kilt I have one for you you have one for me who's wearing underwear do guys wear underwear under their own comfortable but then when like War happens you put it up and it looks like it looks like a diaper I think you can kick cuz if you can't kick with this where you get all your tattoos and your legs yet to come from being over there yeah I wait before having done cuz I want to make sure I deserve that and you should always a fighter okay tell me what taxes so cuz we're doing a big 101 about me I'm all right now every about the fight and then I started the attic in Edenton TV falling me for that fight and usually told me that Deja when he followed somebody didn't the guy never wins a pretty big gap in the head is bleeding and then I get a takedown but I'm using a lot of my teeth this time and like a box of them up and I think the leg is their legs are not going too well and then I do a takedown and he like you fall on his leg and then he asked you this time out so Yeti bring him back and he's a looks in pain and I tell my corner and I'm bleeding cause you got me to cut to that's that's also pretty rabbit on end and then I'm here at it which leg is it which leg is it and it's the right legs on okay so I'm like I need the times up he goes back he's like he looks limping a little bit. Like I'm at talking to right leg so I try I try to hit but he's and then I don't have to take down and he's bleeding more than not long after that it was over he was even able to get up dried soy and next year when he fell down as a beautiful it was a pretty intense moment he sells down and right in front of educating TV crew and the blood-like Beats on the floor and it's that's like pretty cool that pretty cool. I'm excited about this because they just not a lot of good quality videos about the toy I mean if you if you go to my YouTube or something you could probably see the thing about it when we talk anyway so this makes you the Golden Bell Janet Jackson this is a giant bomb for you and this also spread the word about that way in Canada not automatically right cuz it happens in soham and then but then Myanmar it's just becoming like crazy people then we get married live on TV two days after the fight so it's like they don't resent you for a little bit because he's representing the entire Muslim Community in the EMR and I'm basically without even cuz I don't do anything but I can basically I'm representing all like the 95% hurts which is like Christian Buddhist and Hindu like everybody else visited so yeah so happy they were pretty excited Buddhist and Hindu like everybody else visited so yeah so happy they were pretty excited</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> difference like when when Tie fighters come over there would what gets in their way like what all the things to my very technical and would never brings me up to something else would they still very technical and they do very well for the first couple of rounds but then when the Patriots will start to kick in when they started Clinton in to get a head but there is no more what's happening and that's that's a good idea if you looked at me and more and then Thailand to neighboring countries were fighting for thousands of years old and that if you look at the back in the days and the tongue to Empire I think I don't know the exact date at that time to bring me some part was like all the southeast Asia the biggest empire southeast Asia so they were wanting all the Fine Line almost like trying my all these things like yeah I'm not sure I was all these things so it was very very powerful is the ancestor of all the mui-mui LA multi multi you know because it makes sense them while they were only in all these colonies right they were dropping their seeds of their martial arts so then as the retreat eventually pushed him away and then it became an Uber mais oui we have another starting a thing called mood but then it's very suspicious like how come you have that support now with no gloves and head butts move around is that yeah and you know what you were calling lights for a long time by little boy by me and so then and adding a scoring system and Ida gloves 8oz look beautiful intricate to any becomes beautiful moon Thai as we know very very you know technical very nice but then then what happened is that if I listen you're young with that guy say you have big and Love and You by the way if you punch you don't care a lot of points you know it's it's at elbows and knees and King the score point it was going to happen over hundreds of years the guys are going to practice your kicks and I think the tigers are the strongest I believe and so then if you could but you go across and mirrors by the way guys no gloves system and if you if you ask you only to win a swing for the freaking sense right so that's the two different type of toy we have will excuse him and which way because you put your viralized you you prefer like you no no gloves cuz you can draw blood right away with a bunch makes sense so history course fighting anime or do you have enough though I don't want to do it again getting a fight like I said will give me a couple years I have a lot of things to do that I want to be happy with my little career no more things to do but it's a possibility how old you now 2727 So you you're still young I mean you could make that transition into MMA actually actually fly me two times before raising enough money to go back and they're like I said My First Love was grappling right so I was doing I did some fight night, trying to me and I was I was I when I first MMA fight by guillotine and then I went to your again another Guillotine so they gave me like the octopus to get I am choking and then I'm super excited for my striking and I did some stupid decision like nobody wanted to fight that he's a good fighter he's a good fighter and you wasn't it easier if she now what's his name and so nobody wants to fight him and you know you would like UFC right so I took the fight at 170 but I was 170 so he was able to be boy and I think you dropped down to like from 190 and but then on the feet I'm like I'm winning I'm doing some good breastfeeding has been bunches and everything but then few rosters in his corner and you like him down so I just stupid on the floor and for me I treated as a BJJ competition on the floor on the floor pull up yet I do have the experience yet and I got to go to the better fighter that that night for sure I almost got the armbar actually in and I let it go and it wherever she said the fight because available wasn't in the clinch in the in the in the guard but that I was a bit disappointed for this and so is this a bad in early my career now I'm a complete different 5.5 thousands of people live I have have fell again he's a great fighter but I know that's how it would be different things nowadays you became is left Weight Champion Without Really training let's what like you didn't really go to a traditional let way gym or learn it from them you basically had your own approach everything together yeah yeah I think so I think it's like I said in my in my in Canada we we do a lot of like you know a lot of Central and my p**** but is it like to two profiles but he's a great coach is a very great coach and he he's just Build Me Up cuz it mg condos is a seafood right so you can slide out of that and in the in the pocket is not a head but actually stuff everything works and I have been so yeah I guess that's why I kind of did everything where do you want to do as far as your career do you want to establish some sort of dominance and left way before you leave and go do something else but to be honest the only reason why I want I would consider go back to him and many would be because I have Eagle at the Olive Fighters IV go and I want to hang out with a van what I would consider go back to him and many would be because I have Eagle at the golf Fighters have you go and I want to f****** I would avenge my loss and stuff like that so but honestly I'm super happy with doing this as my my my goal was to be champion and I've done it so I don't need $25 to be happy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's like something that people should experience I think that's up to people why do we have to be careful what we say to people but understand but yeah people need to do it I got to do everything I think you do whatever without ever having children it was very educational it helped me a lot I love it I'm very happy to be a father it's a learned a lot but I don't think it's necessary I think you can be a complete person without a lot of experiences I think what's more important is like what kind of experiences are you having with the people that you're around with and are you being fulfilled like if you inherently like inside of you you always want to be a chess master but you never pursued it you're going to have that regret in that longing for something you would let way if you didn't pursue that if you didn't go after that if you instead decided to get a job in accounting or something like that you would have this longing to do something and I think everyone has a different makeup but different psychological makeup different personality different interests and I think there's a lot of people that are interested in things that I have no desire to do and to them it's their whole life and I'm not interested in at all but I'm not them it's like finding out what it is what it is for you what what is it in your life that is I've been very very very fortunate and one things and I've been very fortunate as I I would say I'm a risk-taker but it's more that I don't I don't have any interest in doing safe things in terms of like I don't have any interest in my taking it easy job a safe job I normally get a paycheck every week and it's never interest me as a child that seems like prison was a loser because I couldn't do that people could work hard and then get a good job and they would get a Pyrenees whatever I felt like when I was young there something wrong with me but I couldn't do that cuz I grew up in New England and in Boston everybody worked hard as I go hard blue-collar sort of environment where ever I couldn't do it man I couldn't do it because all showed up for work everyday at 7 a.m. I wanted to kill myself because I felt like it was missing something in the world I wanted to leave with you though but look now you're filled your fulfilled person you're living your life but that's you for other person I would be torture you had some guy that really just want to be a mathematician and someone's like no no you're going to go to Myanmar going to be a f****** lethwei Champion you like what everyone has their own path some people like you know Alex Honnold is he's the guy who they made that movies free solo about these they the guy who climbs all these mountains with no rope look for a rush that's an amazing Rushton was get I think so but Alex the way he described it he said it's not really a rush he said it's pretty mellow because if every if you get a rush like you're in trouble true and I was like the whole thing I bet it's obviously there's something about that intense challenge that's appealing to him that doesn't attract me at all not even a little bit I'm no f****** desire but this guy loves it to bungee before they never do any of the world record in and then they realize that guy just slammed into a f****** to worry or out this is really horrible Video Bridge she's trying to go through a bridge who trying to make it through the gap of abridging misjudge needs slam right into Bridge while these people are on it filming it you see him come in and just missed judges a life tube a poet some people putting this right to be an author with inscribed put on this life whoever you are how you feel what is it what is the thing that you're drawn to for some people it's architecture they want to build houses they're fascinated by the construction methods of fasting by Design and they're just really drawn to want to build houses then some people want to make music some people are drawn to lyrics and they're drawn to musical notes and bars and changes and that's their thing everybody has meaning of many things you know and then something something for some people that's their problem is they have so many things it's hard to focus on one but it really the key I think that happiness is life is fight being honest with yourself and finding whatever it is that's attractive to you whatever it is a draws you when there is animation or sculpture or making clothes what is everyone has a thing while you were talking there really yeah why is the effective I think I'm crazy people out there that unfortunately whether it's their family sometimes your family they built try to influence you in a way to get you to do something that's safer me my own family did that there was always trying to get me to big one with graduate from college graduate from University get a degree you know have a safe in adult just try to God you do it cuz I know Gary's he's a big proponent of yeah I think my parents gave up on trying to control me very young as you know I didn't even want me to do martial arts when I start doing martial arts when did I start really heavily when I was 15 I started when I was fourteen but really heavily when I was fifteen but that's when I just became obsessed with Taekwondo and competing and and you know it first they didn't want me to do it but then that was like the first thing that I ever did that made me feel like I wasn't a loser there now it's like the first thing that ever did that I got really good at like a good at and getting recognition from it and third winning tournaments and then I'd I realize like wow if I focus on something and become obsessed with something I can get really good at it so that led to learning how to do that in applying that's where the same energy to other things in life you know I think sometimes people just have to find a thing whatever that thing is that really floats your boat and then find the time find the time to pursue it and set up your life so that you have the time to pursue it and now their schedule. you have the time to pursue it and now they're scheduled this isn't it does not going to even come around here and money will come and yes yeah everything is possible I think and it's crazy but I know that I kind of lived it it's true you can do whatever you can do whatever you want</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what is your perspective after the incident versus before the incident how much did it change the way you view the world and our place in the world for me I am and I always I never believed that we were alone this is me I just look up and go there's way too many stars up there for us to Brian on flight where to come from what was it doing you know and then I've asked why me why me why why did I happen to be cuz you can say wrong place wrong time right place to stay or right place right time for me it was I think there's more out there and if if I could get word out to anyone else like you know especially the bloody Bonkers of one quit trying to debunk it cuz it is what it is it wasn't a system glitch this was a real it happened a number 2 is what something are aperture little bit and start thinking outside of the box you know if you go you know you look at it going answers non-reactive propulsion because when we came up with propulsion weedy Lee you know the people long before it came up with a reactionary propulsion system in that became our standard had we done something different or we develop non-reaction we might look at something like a gasoline engine go to Holy Cow how's that thing work we wouldn't have that idea so you know I think there's you know if you look at it and go people thought Einstein was kind of nuts and we're still proving his theories today and what we're learning is it he was right and he was right there was a time when the Earth was flat except for some people in California the Earth isn't flat around but that isn't true I think let's get outside of the box and go we can develop a technology that would in and I'll look at it from a military standpoint because it would be a game-changer for military sandboy technology like that would be a game-changer for mankind completely I mean it would literally everything that we do you know when we don't know exactly what do you want that system in a car we can't even handle The Vaping thing let alone driving a car that goes up down Works in three dimension or Lowe's with the originally wanted helicopters to be they wanted to be flying cars yeah if you get out on the road if you can really work in the third dimension which is well we are three Dino Seventeen hundred feet high the big ones and you go now you know for an F-18 to do a split a switches go from up here and just do a vertical 180-degree turn so you're going this way and you go down here it just like 2500 feet turn for a jet go what the hell I got on a walk up that thing Brian in an airplane that's it it's a totally open up that expanse what we're trying to do for technology and go is there another way because we still build we still build suckers and blowers which is a jet engine we just refine the internals the turbines to get them to be more efficient where I go on a just put your efforts at someplace else I got to talking to really doesn't explain and it's about it's more into magnetics type side that we don't spend a lot of time on and I know what he said when he was working at skunkworks he did it said that he would fun to try and look at some of these other Technologies for propulsion and he's not since retired but talk to him at the level that you can behind closed doors reasons for it ain't because if a technology like that got out where someone could rapidly reproduce it after all you've done you know or they got it first atomic bomb you know Germans almost had it we got it rough into working on it we got it first change the world literally change the world when we detonated the first one and you go from not going to get into the politics behind it but now we had it and I was the race everyone else because they had to get on equal part because it's a destabilizing have you developed a technology like this and you keep it to yourself you've got something that no one else has and it's a huge leap I mean it's a Quantum Leap do you share it because it's such a mankind thing or do you keep it for yourself you know that's right now it's not for me to decide I'm just Dave well it's fascinating that some other method of propulsion could have been established in some other place and that we're experiencing or that you've experienced it and some other folks have experienced it in action and I just think for us as people as human beings in 2019 it's really easy to think that what we have now is so amazing and that what we have now is the Pinnacle discovering their what we have now is do you know what the with our electricity and with our LED screens and that we are experiencing like the height of Technology when if you or some creature from some other planet that is got easy access to Element 115 and some gravity propulsion system you're looking at us like we're digging holes in the side of a mountain to protect herself in the rain we're cave people diagram of the bucket Ryan or people in the rainforests are living in these indigenous Lifestyles yeah so you know take them something to kammi take them than one of these flat screens down one of these tribes and no one's ever seen a guy that's where we at and where we going to do and what did it change the way you look at life I mean even though you knew that had this feeling that we were not alone just from looking at the stars and but when you actually see the thing like how I would imagine that that has got to really shift your perspective of it shifted my perspective but it was more of a it's a validation a confirmation ago you go stars and then you see something to the next point to go you know one land in my then I'll be one hundred percent sure that we are not alone cuz it's sitting in my front yard but I mean I got within 1/2 Mile of this thing which is people do I have my house pretty far away again. When you're flying an airplane 1/2 mile is like really tight when they bring you in to have his conversations with high-level government officials how long are these conversations so I went to three different groups of people this is post the New York Times article so the New York time article comes down to 17 this and then our government the other pilot that was involved had been to DC multiple times this is how I kind of got in touch with Lou she had called me and said hey I need to talk to you so I got to call her and I said what's going on she says have you been called you about the Tic Tac show me pictures of ghosts look like this and then she gets pretty frustrating those that we called a Tic Tac cuz it look like a Tic Tac what part don't you get I mean go get a thing of tic tacs look at it look like this they showing that they have a video from someone else I asked in a multiple times to go down and talk to two people when we're supposed to be 20 minutes I need to know these are important people getting 20 minutes of somebody spoke time is like that's a huge deal out what we were saying like right now this is this is all real I mean easier these are three senior officials that are taking the time out of their day to take the serious to go you know maybe we do need to pull up assist on this I mean whatever it wants attention no I mean I know when the article came out and I talked about a chip program that Harry we got fun at 22 million dollars over or five years so yeah we just got to prove what it was 750 billion dollars for defense blanket 750 million if you took a hundred million out of that it's not even going to put a dent and I go why can't you eat 4.4 million dollars a year and you can actually get some good work done cuz you don't need a huge team because you figure if you look at I think that's what's a number like 10 15% of all these UFOs like you would you like a Project Blue Book really remains unexplained and Hugo okay so you can weed out you know you can read out me flying over someone in a campfire in like my afterburner so you can concentrate because we talked about funding and I said let me leave you with this and I had got some pretty good stuff I was talking to Chris Mellon he's a former undersecretary and understands how the government works who is Ricky gave me some really good feedback and I said I talked to her I said look at I'm off for you guys funding a program but what you need to do is find a program that there's going to be oversight over when I say oversight I mean because what happens if you go hear some money but we're going to distribute in the government's we're going to distribute it to these three different agencies across the United States government agency ab&amp;c give it to them you know and I'll go back to like the 9/11 stuff where we really had the answer but all the agencies weren't talking to each other to put all the pieces together and that's my fear that you go hey we're going to take a hundred million dollars of taxpayer money were going to fund a program to actually seriously investigate the stuff and look at the technology but they're three different entities working on their own and not talking to each other so there's got to be a joint collaboration twigo we're going to do it but you know Joe is going to be in charge and you guys are all going to play nice and be a joint collaboration twigo we're going to do it but you know Joe's going to be in charge and you guys are all going to play nice in the sandbox together because we want to get our money's worth because people will raise the the fraud waste and abuse flag that we're wasting money on something stupid</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you know if there's a very famous painting that shows what appears to be men in crafts flying through the sky in the background of an ancient painting do you know I'm talking about I do actually have a page one of the first page has ever put on a website is like a bunch of these because throughout history there are these indications of ships of crap but that's the shape of it so like a plate turned on its side and then there's a person inside of it yeah yeah man flying through in that same yeah that's it yeah look it's flying but you know the thing is is that everybody can stay or the one that's pretty cool because I was a hidden thing I've studied that one where it says that Discovery 15th century above the her left shoulder there is an object if you really zoom in look at the dude staring up at it as a painter my wife is payment everything tensional that wears the got the ground they got right over there looking up so I think I 15th century it said so did the palm of this Joe's it was the original one the one that we just looked at Jamie the one right before that yeah see you get a big picture that that is so strange like to hear you got Christ being crucified and then above him UFOs like it is that supposed to be aliens or is that supposed to be Angels like what is that supposed to be in these things that it's rabbits real similar to what we're talking about here that's the argument of Miracle of Fatima let's hit em again this is so speculative we have a witness here if you are Kylie but when you see something like the miracle of Fatima if you look at the miracle of Fatima. That's that one that was considered a real Miracle by the church and the three kids were getting messages I'll get this all wrong but for like months that they're going to be visited in to bring people and bigger and bigger groups gather to where there was over a hundred thousand people years has directions to 1917 you know dozens of thousands if not hundreds but dozens for sure see an event a mass sighting of something that happened we're talkin people that were religious people that weren't religious we are doctors at the time I real images of Jamie a little bit so you can see what they're all looking at something but that's not real and it was so intense some people thought it was religious that was a visitation but other people saw it as technological like something descended you know look into I'm just saying art pictures like paintings were talking about man you can interpret of all day I can't hold onto that I can't hold on to an eyewitness with other eyewitnesses with radar systems and with video where in a different era now we don't have to paint it man we get to see it it's fascinating that it is but it's way more fascinating with someone like you talks about it versus some f****** random cook yeah that's that's what makes me incredibly interested is the just your credibility in the fact that does not you know of a history of seeing wacky s*** that other people don't say not just this once and but it's on video and that there's other ones as well this it's really strange that I've seen people try to explain it away and what I don't like about when they explained it away or attempt to explain it away they're trying really hard they're not going who knows what this f****** thing is they're not looking at it like cleanly they're looking at it like a quote on quote skeptic I don't like the idea of being a skeptic not that I don't think you should be skeptical of certain things that certainly think you should be but there's a lot of people that brand themselves as Skeptics and I think it's a lazy way to look at things I really do because I think you're just looking for the holes in things without looking at it objectively if you wanted to be a sign if you wanted to be someone who is a fan of science then you have to look at it as a thing like look at this information and let's study this without any bias any preconceived notions I don't think they're doing that they're looking at in there trying to find a way where they can justify that it's fake and they're they're just doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to try to make it fake that video that you showed that thing slips off to the left and takes off incredible rate to speed that alone should Free People the f*** out because all the time like we took the video and it was another crew that took a video week we watched it for 5 minutes with their eyeballs and it was four of us and we all have the same store we all saw the same stuff we all came back and looked at each other and scratched her head and said WTF you know I mean serious what was that because people confuse all the time like we took the video and it was another crew that took a video week we watched it for 5 minutes with their eyeballs and there was four of us and we all have the same store we all saw the same stuff we all came back and looked at each other and scratched her head and said WTF you know I mean serious what was that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so what year was your incident and you give a very very famous incident described corroborated by actual evidence which is one of the rare ones what year was it and where to take place so is 2004 November 14th it's really if you draw San Diego to Ensenada Mexico or about 60 miles off the coast in between the two we're doing work up so when we get ready to deploy this was for the 2005 deployment that we were going SE for November and December 2004 so we've been out I just taken over the Squadron mid-october so I've been the CEO for a month so we go out to and we're putting the battlegroup pieces together so it's not just the air Wing but we were you know where they were on the carrier we've got the cruiser we've got all the support ships out there and we're going to integrate all the defenses and trained as one unit so the exercise were going to do is an air defense exercise where there's good guys bad guys are all from internal from the Air Wing So the bad guy today are going to be the Marines vmfa-232 the Red Devils are going to the ship and we're the good guys and it's we call the TV too so it's two of us skins to them or work with the USS Princeton which is going to be the controller and they're going to control the blue forces and then the red guys are going to give us a presentation that you know they're going to try and intercept we can stop them from getting up towards the carrier so that's kind of for two weeks is the two weeks we've been at Sea day been tracking these things coming out of the sky and I talked to the prince controller he's like up to about a dozen of them they would come down from above 80000 ft drop down to about 20,000 feet and hang out and then it goes straight back up after about 3 or 4 hours and when you say they've been tracking who specifically that you could see them so cuz they're out there you know that Radars on all the time in the Spy one system on it he just crew you know the state are one of the most sophisticated systems in the world so typically when something like this happens and there is some unexplained phenomenon what do they do we have no idea that these things are out there at all so they observe these things and they never bother telling any you guys that's correct so they just knew that these things had been visiting this area but they just allow this training exercise to take place anywhere talking to him the Prius for the two weeks they would show up but it was when we weren't flying so the typical carrier schedule is you know for us it was about noon to midnight it's a 12-hour day there's reasons for that you can go a lot longer they can but for training we just do the 12-hour day thing and it's like Black Ops 2 guys taking off and Landing periodically so we are on one of the first goes and it's noon somewhere around there and we take off the Marines take off first and my buddy shih tzus Marine Squadron was when he was leading the red are they had when he launched off the carrier first they called him and said hey what are you got on board with the small the original Legacy fa teams don't have as much gas as the Super Hornet suit points about 30% bigger so you start talking to him about Fuel and based on how long we're going to be airborne and everything else that goes hey why don't you just go ahead and proceed to your your cat point it cuz we had just taken off and that's when the controller had come out and said hey French control what do you got going to see your Loadout kind of chuckled he said that's why I got a cat of nine which is a it's a basically I'm just a blue metal tube with a Seeker head for a name 9 IR missile is it raining it doesn't come off the airplane you can beat with a sledgehammer that's the only way to get off or you can unlock a lock with a key so I'm like kind of chocolate to cancel the training that we're like okay he says we got real world vector and they're going to send us out to the West so picture you know what you got to clock the Nemesis in the middle or a little bit south of that about 40 miles south and then the Marines are about a hundred miles south of the ship about 60 miles between the two of us so is his joining up operator and I've got the other pilot and the weapon systems operator so they tell us all this further out to sea we have no idea what we're intercepting and this is when the controller starts talking to us he says Hey sir we seen these objects they've been for two weeks they've been coming down he's giving us the whole story so we need you to go investigate we want to know what these are but they're asking you to investigate in a jet is unarmed that's right we have no reason for that we don't fly or run as you can go through history of the Navy or Airforce you put live missiles on airplanes and then you start doing training or you're squeezing the trigger someone always messes switch ology up in someone get shot down happened multiple times so we don't do it you know there's times that we do it's rare so we start flying out to the West because the other pilot has a talk to a female when you talk to her Mexico real world Vector we have no idea we're going to look at Pride drug runner cuz you get the drug Runners coming up the coast so we're like okay so we drive out and they're calling down range is so they're telling us hey it's 2708 30 miles at 20,000 feet and it's you know it had a just Countdown the Rangers and we're talking back and forth whole time so they got to a point where they say hey. Which means Raiders have resolution sells you know range and a Smith of what the radar can actually see inside that box you can't tell the difference between me and the doctor come going it we're just become one Big Blob so they called murder plot and so the other jet is on my left hand side and we're going to go to go to make it simple so the odds are going to end up looking for isn't right in the middle of the clock and we are at the six position and my wingman is off to my left side so it's a cheeseburger down with her with him so we're looking around me right and there's a perfect example of that water is perfectly calm no Whitecaps I mean it's literally a perfect San Diego California day and we see white water sound like if you see a seamount in a rock under water when you're standing on the shore in the waves breaking over here like what is that it's usually cuz there's a rock under the water so it looks like that but it's about the size of a 737 and actually kind of has a shape of like a cross and it's pointing to the east so you've gotten along partner on East-West in you couple things going north and south so we're looking at it cuz I kind of draw their eyes were like oh that's kind of odd we looked down and when the other airplane comes up and says hey Skipper do you and that's about when he gets out of his mouth and I'm kind of looking at the same thing I could do do you see that what is that thing what we see is this white Tic Tac looking object just above the surface of the water pointing North South and it's going north south east west it's just moving forward back left right at will and it's moving around the disturbance the Whitewater that we see how big is this thing a lot of time fighting other airplanes so it's about lot size of a hornet so what is it the first thing look for is rotor wash you know if you watch any TV show that starts kicking a lot around you can see that it's really easy to see from there so we're like the rotor wash perfect don't see any rotors don't see any tail rotor don't see any the main rotors or like driving around we're looking at this thing is isshin how far are we from this thing at 20000 feet and it's right down on the surface right off all right side so I'm probably maybe a couple miles lateral 20000 ft and we're just watching it move around and so it's very small in your eyes and the other airplane left right is still pointing North South we get to about the twelve I'm just in a nice easy to send a reason is because I'm an ass, can you go more aggressive you can but when you're out of the water the water looks the same at 20000 feet is it does it 2052e don't you know yet so you can easily put yourself in a non-recoverable position if you're not paying attention and you go into the water I'm coming down the Tic Tac just kind of Rapid legal and turn so now it kind of pointless Weston out mirrors us so it's above the surface or a pie we're coming down it starts coming up this is getting interesting sweet kind of drive all the way around a circle I'm just sending it's coming up and I get over to about the 8th position of the line and it's over in about the two position while the quickest way as we know his kids to get someone you know you can keep going around the circle nothing's going to happen across a circle some about her two to three thousand feet above it and I just kind of dropped my nose aggressively and I cut across the circle and it's coming this way because I'm trying to fly to where it's going to be cuz I want to join. I want to see how close I can get to it as I'm pulling up across my nose and it starts to accelerate and within about less than a second is I start to pull nose onto an across is right in front of me just go poof minutes gone so I called the other airplane I said hey you guys yes see that thing they're like it's gone we don't want to see it all so I'm like okay that's kind of weird so we don't see it we're looking at the same time I said hey let's turn around and let's go back to see what was in the water was there something there so we turn around right there where it's going perfectly there's no Whitewater nothing it's just blue like okay so we turn back on our heading back out towards the east and I tell the controller I said well said that you're not forcing them kind of weirded out and I told my my backseat of that we start heading back and the controller on The Prince and comes at me sister you're not going to believe this but that thing is back at your cat point that was our original point where we're going to hold 40 miles south of the ship so this thing is went from wherever we were at 2 p.m. about 60 miles and you know maybe 30-40 seconds it's already over there and it just didn't track it it just appeared he just shows back up on the radar is here for like okay so we fly back we don't see it we don't see it on our radar we don't see it on any of our sensors we do like two runs and we come back to the ship and land so we're in our it's we called the pr Shopper taking off our flight gear one of my Crews is getting ready to go out and I think they're going to be on a tanker mission that they had a a targeting pod on board so they want to talk about this before and I in the backseat or Chad says they were in the finest thing out driving around and in the backseat of a Super Hornet there's no stick but their sites that controllers and there to control the sensors cuz that's what the weapon systems guys do and they can change this place really fast I just hit a button and I'll flip from the radar to the targeting pod and the way the system actually works is when you see something on the radar new designated as your primary target all the other sensors will look at that point so it's everything is kind of together so he picks up a hit on his radar and he goes to lock it up cuz I watched all the tapes he goes to lock it up and immediately the radar until it gets signals back that it's being jammed so and technically jamming is an act of War it starts jamming the radar goes into a jam extrapolate a bunch of stuff happens on the scope well he's smart enough to Castle to his targeting pod and he takes a passive tracking that's the video that you see of the Tic Tac words just sitting in the middle of screen real quiet acne and he goes through if you watch the video if we had it I'd go through it with you if they go through all the different modes when he goes it's an IR and if you do is TV black and white TV Camera we do we can get the video right online where would you can't show it to anybody we can't we can't show it on YouTube but you can see it and people will be able to go to it it'll do go to the video and we'll tell people when we're starting and we'll tell people with the title of the video that you get to is they can sink it up themselves if they watching it it's publicly owned its you know American government relied so it is actually something in the public domain so you think we could play it on YouTube and not get pulled a hundred percent you think the government that those things I would say yes we should be able to but sometimes things get messy and where we've always been like two steps away from getting pulled off of YouTube completely it's a real disaster it's to understand from their perspective a lot of legal issues they have to deal with but I have it on a private server I can maybe send Jamie issue I believe though is the actual copywriting video itself unwatermarked version mix look it up in the Senate have to figure out how to send it to you right here give me a second if you have a ear drop to your drop you pay I got it on a page private page that can send Jamie I think this is probably important to be able to have this the video itself so you can just talk about it and we're about to yank it up here for you give me a second to get it at okay and four people don't know Jeremy also produced Bob Lazar Area 51 &amp; flying saucers and he was in here when we had Bob Lazar and talk about Bob's experience in Jesus that wasn't a game-changer for me and for a lot of other people this is a subject that it's so easy to mock you know this is why I think it's so important that we talked to people like you because like I said your average everyday UFO crackpot they believe everything and anything I ever had any UFO experiences before this now that the irony and I tell the story she literally every time I would go home she would ask me agency UFO if you see if you have and I'll be like to know when I first started dating my wife she was a big like National Enquirer she had all the supermarket tabloid and I would always just for your crap for it so this happens and you know I never say a word so my friends all knew it was a great story over beers I got asked by Lou Elizondo to do the New York Times article which is like anything else I always say no like it took a bunch of times to get me on your show Jeremy kept asking asking asking and it was thank you Jeremy times articles going to come out and visit Thanksgiving in 20 whenever I cook my 17 so is Thanksgiving 2017 and everyone is kind of left the house it's just my wife and my in-laws a couple of sitting in the kitchen and I said not really told anyone I mean My Wife and Kids a new the event happened but they didn't have all the details cuz there's one of those things you just didn't I just didn't get into is it classified no was it at any point in time did not show up no one told us not to talk about it because there's a lot of other people saying you got the Admiral he got the captain of the ship the captain of the Princeton and then you've got the other CEOs sew-in position-wise I'm probably as a CEO of a squadron in the top 20 out of 6000 and no one came to talk to me no one came to take my tapes no one showed up in a suit no one told me not to talk I don't talk to any of my aircrew that were involved in this all there were six people total involved at 2 to shut the video on the four of us that looked at it for five minutes with our eyes no one and I can get into how do you know there's a report that that George Knapp got released it so I called The Unofficial official report and I had met someone and I'm like hey I was working I was doing some Aerospace work and I had gotten a call my cell phone from a guy and he said hey I want to investigate your incident and I go okay so he did he investigated the incident and it was very very thorough I mean even if you've read this about 10 pages long they need yummy he tracked on everybody he tracked down all the people that were there crew that were involved he talked to track down the Admiral he talked to you maybe it was a pretty thorough report cuz you know you know that the people wanted it's out there so they want to do foil it was never released in a foia request actually at the Navy call me I've been out of the Navy for like 6 years and thanks explain to people that means of freedom of them so I got called and she said yeah but to me it was an unofficial cuz I didn't know who where it went I and I had a copy of it but because it was official well then years later I find out that the guy who actually did the report was part of the A-Team and I was talking to Lou Elizondo who runs that program and you showed me the documentation of the original things like 13 people that were part of a tip and they were fully exempt and I'm like Mission act exempt obviously. He has the ability because I'm not a conspiracy theory tell you that you know I think there's reasons that the government doesn't tell the public everything and I don't speak for the government but I think there's a good reason for that not everything needs to go out to the public but most of it doesn't he just what I do is I put a clause on hate for this program or whatever we're doing which we've been in a tip program the work that they do and what they find is not it's not releasable through freedom information that there's probably Avenues to get that you know then you go what really is freedom information cuz I got into this on a I was talking to someone who's a conspiracy theorist they said will someone so wrote and they're not getting any information on your event I said they're going to call up you're going to put in your request for for freedom information you got here so I want it goes to some poor guy at the Pentagon he's like I have no idea what this is and he searches rounding doesn't find anything he looks at his butt and I can offer you a joke I'm not going to spend the next six months of my life doing a research project for you get nothing and then you assume the government covering up money got it really isn't he just you know the guys are doing the research doesn't know where that makes sense Jamie video okay here we go by we sing it and which is zoomed in I are at the top middle and means it's an infrared mode so instead of seeing color you're seeing temperature variations and these things are extremely sensitive to win like tense of degrees they will tell you the difference due to call shuttle go from black to white 2 in this case why does hot so if you look down in the bottom left corner says waht that's why it means white is hot so the object that you're looking at is hotter than the sky around it but we also notices there's no plumes not if you're looking at an airplane when you get close actually see the exhaust coming out in there will be a a really going to matter important as we look at the video and then the most the stuff on here you really don't need to know what you can look at is the bottom right corner says 19990 and Abby that's the altitude and if you look up in the little Ward versus HTG and then b a l t b s autopilot altitude hold its just flying for that so you can go ahead and play the video and so those two bars next to the white object that's that's a passive track so what he's done his he's commanded the Fleer to track that so what the system does is it uses its actually tracking a contract pixels and it's just basically block those hot pixels white pixels from the black ones and internecine out pause it real quick so it over the top see it once a white screen with a black object this is a black-and-white TV mode and he's looking at options TV so narrow in TV mode is actually you can get closer than their own IR it's literally Niro and I are as about medium and TV mode 13 get closer with the TV mode do you look at it now in this case you would actually start to see stuff going on and even a TV mode because you getting exhaust you know the black exhaust comes out you'll usually be able to see kind of some of that coming out the back and you don't see anything just sitting there maybe look at the the top or cyst rewrite that's the pot is looking 3° writer than those they're playing right so he's just fly along the bottom numbers don't worry those her time so it's 4156 so go and hit play what are you doing is he's going to Chad's going through all the different modes cuz he's like oh I got it and he's going to try and see the best-fitting get those rumors that this video is like 10 minutes long know what you're looking at is the entire video no nose where it says 99.9 so hit pause real quick what that means is that why he's got the Pod to Target card cuz that's his primary sensor right now the radar still trying to look at this object and try and arrange it and the radar can't get ranging on it so the object is doing something to say I'm not giving you back cuz it's just a. police radar Doppler is trying to get arranging on you and it can't do it so when it says 99.9 The Radar cannot see this object right now it's not allowing it to get range and I think that's super important day of the way he explained it to me active jamming compared to passive jamming this is a technology that is actively jamming this system rather than something like stealth aircraft which is little shaping dish the technology to to basically make it harder for Raiders to see you you know and that's the whole thing you know if you look at you know airplanes in her nose on are harder to see than airplanes at the side, like think of a barn door if you're looking at the whole barn door it's real easy if I turn the Barn Door sideways worth released in order for you to see it. He's going to different modes and try and lock it and it's just kind of sitting in all of a sudden is a video design I think it's a minute-and-a-half long she's going to try and require every centers of pod so it's it's slowly drifting to the left the The Hornet is still go on the same heading just going to hang out and they're just fell in this thing and when you get close it's going to sing off the left hand side when you see it on a full because it's anything digital you be able to get a one-for-one copy unlike you know we need copy your album to a cassette you know you lose a little are you still doing Digital World in their off it goes to the left and that's pretty fast believe that field of view on the when we eat me a big monitors that we look at these when they come back so we're looking at the original tapes so that's the end of that again please Jimmy so when it's taking off how fat when when it just sort of like leaves the field of view and takes up to 11 how fast is that going pretty fast just staring is pretty fast I mean it did just it's like out of here like nothing that we have no cuz we can't I Don't Care What airplane is so let's just use a F-22 Raptor that's probably one of those it's Friday best airplane in the world right now performance-wise it can't take off like that especially if it's a hover when you're you're talking something that's just sitting in space in the wind and then it just all the sudden accelerate airplanes don't work that way it's not leaving exhaust even in the IR you don't see how it takes off with active jamming it's intelligently control there's no rotors there's no flumes there's no exhaust there's no tail fin there's no tail number this thing goes from a standstill takes off it's a propulsion system we don't have in our inventory and No Other Nation does that's how it's understood by the government if the fastest plane on Earth was trying to do that same maneuver this system would be able to track it if you tell me but this was performance Beyond Emmaus like when we saw it disappear when it flew in front of my nose I'm I'm talking something I'm I'm within 1/2 Mile of it looking at it and it gets in front of me and just disappears so take will just go to something everyone knows is fast let's just say SR-71 Mach 3 you know the visibility is 50 miles at 35 miles a minute I'm going to be able to see this thing turn into a little. As it goes off into the Horizon 4 minute nothing that we start disappeared in a second just gone and I from two different angles remember the other airplanes 8000 feet above me cuz we we get closer to about 12,000 feet so the other airplanes above me looking down and when it disappeared I said you guys see it makes it not done it just literally with poop nothing that we saw disappeared in a second just gone and that's from two different angles remember the other airplanes 8000 feet above me cuz we we get closer to about 12,000 feet so the other airplanes above me looking down and when it disappeared I said you guys see and they said not done it just literally would poop</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I wanted to pick your brain on that because I'm me and my wife have a pact okay I know you're going to think we're crazy but I don't give a s*** that we have since we met in 2016 and in Thailand we never had a night apart I mean and then my point is that the reason behind eyes that I want to hear more coffee I need to I want to spend as much as I can cuz you don't know if there's something after so what do you think I think you should be happy and if you're happy doing that that's alright about the afterlife like I'm like the number for First like science I think a leads do that we're going to just see existing science honestly will science is the study of how the brain works in the study of where you know where the memory is located in what part of the brain are affected by injury and studies on fmri where they're measuring areas of the brain are active during specific activities science there's no real science about what happens when your speculation by your physical body and then we're going to just like it's going to die right and then I know there's actually no science about that but my point is I'm doing speculations that if we do stop existing we do stop living and breathing what's our accents where is it going right was it if is there's an energy. What makes it so hard to say skeptical people that think they know for sure nothing happens as much as I'm skeptical people think for sure they know what happens so it's just comforting for some people to have an answer whether it's the lights go out and that's it and that's Richard Dawkins perspective yeah but other people's perspective he's never done psychedelics and he's got this very reduction is prospective scientific based on what we know right now I understand that he's a man of science and logic and this is how he likes to frame the world but the reality is no one has any idea and most people don't want a deer today because it's very scary if you've done psychedelic drugs you know that there is a very strange thing that can happen to your brain into your Consciousness when it interacts with certain molecules what is that while some people believe that that is a portal to the afterlife and that what happens when you die during periods of extreme stress your brain produces psychedelic chemicals we don't know what the what the soul is what is that a real things that are not is it nonsense we don't know is your Consciousness your Consciousness is clearly affected by injury injury to the brain and it's clearly affected by age it's clearly affected by deterioration is clearly affected by some exhaustion is chemicals but is but is that you or is that something that your brain is housing like what happens when you die does that does it transfer to something else do you does your brain in-house Consciousness or does your body house Consciousness or as conscious as a part of it and when your brain shuts off is no activity has a Consciousness or do transcend no one knows he said we don't know that's the real answer there's a lot of people that don't believe that you are the same person everyday is a lot of people that believe that when you go to sleep that you will you wake up in the morning and you assume that all of your memories of your life they're accurate and that you are absolutely the person that you were when you went to bed the day before don't even know that Osho that's a great though I know that you know that you have some memories that you you can call upon unless you record them like you're do you record you sure that's you are you the same person at all these ideas of many worlds is quantum physicist like to that there's a bunch of different interactions that are happening simultaneously and that it's so hard to deaven it's so hard even to eat to even conceive of the possibility of multiple dimensions and then the possibility of infinite universes that based on the decisions that you make who the f*** now it's an infinite number variables that your life moves in a bunch of different directions yet the idea of an infinite Universe also means there's an infinite number of David look who's out there I know that's what's really crazy there's an infinite number of young Jamie's there's an infinite number of you know fill in the blank Neil deGrasse Tyson Mike Tyson slightly different lives how was it when you when you did those odmp it's very strange I'm scared of that you should be scared sometimes it's a little bit yellowish sore more but yellowish looking Crystal it's any on you Freebase it that's something that her brain create gas so your brain produces as it's one of the reasons why your body can bring the Baseline so quickly your body knows what to do with it it has it it's it's a part of your your whole chemical system how did you read about this how do you come over this remember how I first heard of it I think I've heard of it listening to Terence McKenna talk about it and that was the first thing I ever heard of it and when you know when I first did it I couldn't even believe I couldn't believe that this is a possibility that this that this is something that exists on Earth that so many people don't even know about did you like you need to lock the doors when you do it like you need me I did it and I did it in my living room with some friends how long does it last 15-20 minutes but it feels like you've been there before feels like it just happened and it also feels like forever but it's it's very strange it feels like you've been there before when you go there yeah it's like you leave the world you leave this space and you go to some incredible Dimension that seems more real than this it's very very big</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> because people have other motives emotion tribalism things like that will people find great comfort in these belief systems it gives them sort of have often said that it gives him some sort of like a scaffolding for their their structure of the world their ethics or morals they they can use religion as some sort of mechanism to help them get buy something that they can climb on to some of the confusion of the unknown the show that's true but I don't understand why anybody that for thinks that for the religion is true why would you think that because it provides you with a scaffold you can climb on that makes it true I can understand you erecting a scaffold that was a gymnastics or the universe comfortable provides you with a scaffold to climb on well it's almost like it's a spiritual system like a placebo effect like a spiritual placebo effect and by believing that this is true it gives you this comfort and allows you to condense your thoughts into a better path that the sea Poseidon closest very real but did you know that the receiver that works even if the patient is told it's a placebo that's why I didn't get in. It's very strange well it's sometimes people doing things and knowing that they're doing things gives them the sort of feeling of momentum of accomplishment of of progress and I think so many people are just so adrift and don't have Focus that even just telling them hey we're going to be going to be a part of this program has program to treat XY disease whatever it is and here's this thing like just just Folk the main reason why so many people believe in Homeopathy we should we talk to it doesn't look but cannot work is the placebo effect that they they enquiry has actually gotten a lawsuit against pharmaceutical shops selling homeopathic remedies alongside genuine ones we can't stop them actually selling tummy fat remedies what we can find them putting them on the same shelf as though there's no difference between them best friend how dare you MRSA yeah that I forgot where we were those women it was run by lesbians they they like Tommy some s*** that stuck with me my whole life like cluttered room cluttered mind I love that one I was basically like they were very strict but what happened was I learned how to be a really crafty drug addict so I was like well drilling my room is clean I don't have a problem cuz I came I came to La 19 or 20 I guess this is like 2,000 and I started interning at the website called buddy head is like his old music website and they were all pint and they had the number one gossip site for music in town at the time and everybody was obsessed with us with with this website and then seriously amazing Golden's our love sponge or she'll go sleep from one bed to another to another she gets all the love yeah that means it's crazy those used to be wolves I know I know play mode doesn't even turn off Wi-Fi really anymore just turns off the cellular modem but the whole idea is we need identify the problem and the central problem with smartphone use today is you have no idea what the hell it's doing at any given time like if the phone has a screen off you don't know what it's connected to unfortunately makes it impossible to see what kind of network I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now you know I don't want Google to build talk right now I just want my secure messenger app to be able to talk I just want my weather app to be able to talk but I just checked my weather and now I'm done with it so I don't want that to go to talk anymore and we need to be able to make these Intelligent Decisions on not just a nap by a basis for the connection by connection basis right you want what say you use Facebook because for whatever judgment we have a lot of people might do it you want it to be able to connect two Facebook's content servers you want to go to message a friend you want to be able to download a photograph or whatever but you don't want to be able to talk to me answer you don't want to talk to an analytic server that this modern your behavior right you don't want to talk all these third-party today is there is an industry that is built on keeping this Invisible by what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our devices when it's a phone with her computer whatever more visible and understandable to the average person and then give them control over it so it's like if you could see your phone right now in the very center of is a little green icon that's your pants at or it's a picture of your face whatever and you see all these little coming off of it is every app that your phone is talking to right now. Or every app that is active on your phone right now and all the hosts that is connecting to and you can see right now once every 3 seconds your phone is checking into Facebook and you can just poke that out and then boom it's not on your Facebook the demands a certain amount of exertion and I run everyday I feel like s*** I'm like running very addictive do I feel fine that you get from running that's really interesting and any long-term cardiovascular exercise you get this it's like we did last last October we did the sober October thing we have at this crazy fitness challenge so all of us were doing cardio like 5 hours a day really crazy amount of cardio and one thing that Tom Segura and I both agreed on his like the amount of internal chatter dissipates 204 give no anxiety it goes I didn't realize I had any anxiety until that happen and then I was like God it goes to zero it goes to nothing like when you do like 5 hours on a treadmill or you just running just run for when you when it's done man there's just like pee of mind that comes with that this it release of endorphins that's incredibly addictive cuz that feeling is so pleasing so it's not that it doesn't it doesn't feel good to get out of bed and then to just push when you don't want to but the end result feels amazing it does feel I wonder if there's any research looking into whether that affect happens universally because I've worked out I run there were times in my life I've never gotten a runner's high never I get my teeth hurt my knees hurt my back hurts I feel my brain bleed a bouncing around in my skull you know I'm half a mile into it I'm like f*** this this doesn't the gielgud you have to get in shape first that's never really in the running like the first time I really did any serious running my friend cam Hanes had a 5k which is what is at 3 miles and I didn't run at all in preparation for it and when I ran the 5K Jesus Christ I didn't have a good feeling at all but when it was over I was like okay obviously I'm not I'm in good shape but not in good running shape at all so I should probably get in shape for this and then I started running and then when I got into running and it practically running hills then I started feeling it once I kind of got in that kind of shape and then when the you know when do the workouts are over like I run all the time now and when it's over I just have this feeling your thing he loves it too so crazy bonding experience with that dog you know cuz he loves it now many things happened after that there was able to use that like I became when I was stuck on a beautiful mind because it wasn't cinematic I thought well how can I make it cinematic and I thought Veronica did Nick great she lived in an alternate reality oh that's exactly involuntarily with a schizophrenic have to do they live in realities so in the movie A Beautiful Mind make it really compelling we started an alternate reality and made it a thriller and realized oh my God there's this Epiphany and you realize that was not even reality right and and that's what blew people's minds and that's why the movie kind of worked because it was a Drew you in so deeply into this character that it became like the subjective experience that every audience every audience member feel like the pain of that name sanity of what that must feel like there's another brilliant movie make it cinematic what what do you mean by that exactly Well Ron and I realized that Ron howard-directed it and won an Oscar and we realized that in order to make it really interesting you have to see it to understand the mind of a the phrenic so they ever get to see somebody's mind how do you see somebody's mind other than just graphically you know where you know like through graphic design and it was that that's not very interesting you know like the insertion of graphic design or voiceover narration that makes it kind of a documentary so but we thought like but if you could if you could have an entire story kind of with the military and paranoia and all that that's exactly one of the tensor realities of a schizophrenic's mind so you get this filled it with other actors and other people and that's that was that's why I mean when I say cinematic so basically when you're seeing the 25 minutes of living in this alternate reality with Ed Harris and all that stuff craziness it blows your mind as an audience and then you reflect later like wow that wasn't even real and how that got is that guy really going to come back and you know you make it seem mostly cinematic with the rest of the narrative him trained to cope with schizophrenia itself it becomes the merging of an alternate reality and actual reality and the actual reality is when he's you watch him in that level of pain and just trying to survive you know like cope with meds and the wife and and then we we we we found the way to make it we we we we found the way to make it kind of worked triumphantly because it was love that was the most powerful force it was that one person decided to stay with this other one person the wife Alicia stay with John Nash</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> cool that we were just talking about your books and I try said let's save it let's save it for the podcast cuz I wanted to sound fresh so tell me about you grow two books I read two books and you know as you know I'm a movie writer and a movie and television producer my whole life and whatever those stories are the movies are in the successes I kind of think anyone that's really focused can can do what I do so that was kind of the end product of the first book which was installed a curious mind the secret to a bigger life and that book is really about I mean how much you want to know about everything whatever you want to tell me so basically I couldn't read in elementary school and it caused a lot of a lot of Shame and then a lot of trauma did you have dyslexia dyslexia very quite acute dyslexia and Woodland Hills fancy part of the valley I grew up in the flats of Sherman Oaks actually is as a little kid going to Riverside Drive Elementary School and then later to Nobel Junior High and then later Chatsworth High School and in Elementary School I couldn't read it all and they didn't classify it is dyslexia that was just your slow your dumb you why can't you answer this and then you'd say I can't read and then it didn't make sense it just didn't none of those things computed really that somebody couldn't actually read a word and I really couldn't read a word so when you can't read a word then you find ways to 5 cope and not have the teacher look you in the eyes and say okay Brian come to the board and answer this question because you're never get just going to produce more shame cuz you're not you don't know the answer so possible so I found that as that went on for a little while for quite a while around the 4th 5th 6th grade I really looked at people I really looked them in the eyes to learn and I found that file somebody in the eyes you couldn't gauge I didn't know this then but you engage their heart if you're really doing it with sincerity and interest you can engage people and move them in a banjo eyes things you get people to like play on your team and or you play on their team they pick you and stuff good things happen except the Reading part but it enabled me to learn a lot just by looking at people and talking to people and my when mentors little grandmother her name is Sonya and little Sonia she like 4:10 I guess you know and she would always say to me she see me once a week minimally always once a week and she said you're going all the way going to make it big think big be big and she had all these isms because I have my mom's side of the family was Jewish my dad's side of the family is Catholic the Jewish side the grandmother was my Mentor in the person that really was the single person that I could count account on her life and she constantly tell me how how things go great give a gift for gab should say and and every time she said you're going to go all the way I'm thinking there's like absolutely no empirical evidence I'm going all the way anywhere except my parents were so I just wasn't going anywhere I didn't think so so that gave rise to me give rise to the fact that I thought the wind can really learn a lot as have these kind of curiosity conversations and once I graduated college I did this on a weekly basis and I'm still do it to this day once a week sometimes once every two weeks but never more than once every two weeks I never I'm pretty militant I'm extremely militant about it but how do you do it look when you mean well what I do is I think it's often and I know you do something possibly similar to this end and but my sister would be I bombard myself with now I can read of course and I was able to start to read like in high school you tell me how they fix that like they couldn't fix it wasn't fixable how to scrambles the letters then when it gets better reverses the works and to this day I still start on the right and go to the left so it takes like really thoughtful discipline to make sure I'm always starting do you mean when the sentences or two sentences with a sentence but incidentally when you have dyslexia is very hard to learn other languages so very very hard but I can switch it around like when your brain is making you read right to left yes I started to learn just create like just like an exercise a discipline where I could liken as in college I was able to read force myself to start on the left and go to the right is there a certain mechanisms that's causing you to do right to laugh or do they know what the cause of this says not that I know of not that I know probably something neurological and certainly genetic I mean I have no genetic Trace but it has to be a letter within your Genome of having to guess so you learned how to read you learn how to figure it out and then you said you you have these stations at least once every two weeks so how do you do this like what are you organized on their structured they're structured that they they they sit there's a Randomness to them because often you have to have to it's not like getting on your show where everybody wants to be in the show I said it was a compliment of course but I I'm begging people you because even though it down with you I'm begging him to sit down with me and I'm groveling and I'm calling a since directly I still have three assistant but I make all of my own phone calls always you know why because I have this discipline of getting to know assistance and going if Brian is Richard around or and I just like I do that that's so refreshing from a guy who's as successful as you are because so many times when people get that successful you insulate yourself with a bunch of other people to do all the calls for you and open all the doors for you and you just kind of you stay insulated in aloof yeah well thank you thanks well yeah they did people do I mean look there are producers that are sort of you know what let's say we're in the same category as a milk choices through trial-and-error I saw I went through the 80s where power guys had desks above this other chairs that are on the other side I have the power guys always had lacquer furniture and they did all these power things and I thought I want to I want artists to like me relate to me and I always did everything to create a democratic environment because not that I was such a cool guy but more like you just get so much more out of a creative person by not intimidating them sure and I just saw you do my peers and some you know maybe a decade me and oh I almost felt so close to Saint names but but you're so sort of tough guys you know and I didn't think that was an effective I just didn't think was effective and I wasn't making these really hardcore action movies I was doing movies that were there designed to a might ignite emotion and feeling in fact people when I do public speaking isao business not a movie producer to I'm just I'm in the feelings business because I feel like that's what we want out of a cinematic experience for for me she want the movies I'm interested in doing her TV shows as so because I grew up loving those movies of the 70s and I'm captivated by things that move me emotionally and Elevate me emotionally so you make phone calls and you arranged conversations so you arranged basically a podcast that no one's listening to either and then second 10 years that was the United States 15 was nothing I just did it cuz I felt like that could inhibit somebody or I felt like I was trying to do these sort of down low and away like I didn't want to come modify them you know like industrialized my conversations and I had friends go like oh can we be part of it and I tried it once with a couple other guys it during my thing and it's fractionalized my attention yeah and it found the great thing about the conversations the one on one with no one else in the room which that's all I do again I've ever tried a different ways is it it it Kree you're what you're trying to do I'm trying to do is to create the best date that Isaac Asimov thyroid had or or you know or I mean I've so many people you know to Margaret Thatcher I'm trying to like I'm trying to have no idea of a time and space and I want them to have no idea of time and space and because that is like your best date and I always think like what is my best date with a girl is my very for me Brian cuz I my best date is I'm not even thinking about time and it just becomes almost like a biochemical event it's just things are evolving and I felt like I could do this would Noble many Nobel laureates was Sheldon Glascow who converted the four forces of day nation of nature to three and I brought his name up because I knew that your show you could you could do whatever you want and and was Sheldon glass goes like I usually try to do an hour or two hours but I hung out with this guy shut up my whole day down for 6 hours just because I was so captivated by I'm really wanting to meet and it's takes a year at least or sometimes years to organize this to get them to say yes or to be in the same city or be willing to say yes and meek fly to New York or some other place it sounds like you have figured out the benefit that I've experienced from having podcast and having these kind of conversations one-on-one conversations but you did it just for your own personal edification yeah yeah I have gotten more out of talking to people like this and it's it made me grow more as a person and make made me understand more about communication and how to talk to people than anything I've ever done in my whole life because you don't normally have this completely unfiltered 20 reasons why I like headsets as well because it locks you in like your your volume of you talking is the same level in my ears as it is in your ears we're all this one thing it's not like there's distance between us or in each other's ears and we're talkin there's no phones there's no nothing we're sitting across from each other how would I ever organized decide thought about that was so many different people that I've had a chance to talk to like how would I ever get Sean Carroll the astrophysicists sizdah sit down and just talk to me for 3 hours at the debate him I would never get put headphones on and you just tell me about stuff like you find me about there's no no never do that because of this thing called the podcast because I can share it with all the other people are listening I've had this chance to have these kind of conversations and it sounds like you've done the same thing but without an audience that you figured out that this is a great way to to expand your own understanding of people being one-on-one with these brilliant folks yes exactly and and and maybe you do this to but I found I mean I do meet a lot of people I reach out to me people that are you know expert at many different things that I that I don't to course but sometimes I just I become really motivated just to meet somebody because they're so uniquely committed to something they're so obsessed and I found it learned a lot from Uber drivers and Baristas and stuff were but I do reach out to me in a people that have really had a very intense committed to a really intense journey and often have triumphed.</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now what other stuff do you do in terms of self-improvement I think a little like you've as I've researched you that I'm constantly reading things like all of the time always a nonfiction however no friction at all no I just know that produces a lot of fiction or I would I like is either yes that's right what I found in my life the the like for me the foundational creative ingredients are in ingredients to a creative equation like making a movie or a TV show or painting or is CounterPoint so I have found that I'm Dreaming enough myself you know like I know what I've read. Of course I'll just have Campbell stuff so I kind of understand formats of myths and here with a thousand faces and and and I personally like Underdog stories there so many types of Underdog stories that it's some so anyway so I have that basic knowledge and then when I learn a subject was having the subject of architecture or physics or a little bit of chemistry or whatever the you know it's it's all like from an archaeological perspective cuz it's all new to me so I found for example when I produced the movie 8 Mile is about hip hop right is by battles in the Detroit I first I thought I could even go back further I'll go do this quickly though I thought I'm should get like the hottest you know video director the coolest guy and I won't say those names but they're there were the guys are very visible at being the best at those videos hot videos occurred to me I should get somebody that approaches it again Ark magically work everything is a discovery so I hired some of the knew nothing about hip-hop what was passionate about wanting to do the movie and he was named Curtis Hanson he's deceased right now but he won I think bleach to Oscars for LA Confidential that looked at everything was sort of a discovery Limbs and that's why you're able to see if if I pick the video guy that thinks he knows every hip hop then all the little nuances that are new to the audience's eyes would have never been shot because he think all everybody knows that stuff that's good stuff you know authority authority doesn't work out well and I found that my my my career all I did was write and produce comedies for the first 17 years of my movie career starting with nature Sunsplash in Parenthood in Nutty Professor in liar liar and I could get a lot of comedies allotted 5 Eddie Murphy thing in a Jim Carrey three times you know what I found was Jewish writers Christian actors in the Jewish writers Graham actor and Graham is like when Jewish people say it's the Christian year the Catholic I made 8 movies in with Tom Hanks but he's big he's like the Gary Cooper or he's the Christian guy with the Jewish writers so he's no good Christian and Christians not funny Tipsy was just like you know he he was sort of dominated the ethos you know of you and I mean he's of comedy in the 70s and 80s but yeah but it just didn't work you can't really talented director usually as you know like her pearls right I mean who's the cheddar chicken Trainwreck that Melissa McCarthy is what works as in Trainwreck Amy Schumer is it Melissa McCarthy tell you might be right Catholic right he's a Jew is like that's the the Counterpoint is what works isn't Trainwreck Amy Schumer is it Melissa McCarthy tell you might be right I might be both</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what's what's fat actually really GIF chip like a ghetto rolls at Good Guys in a rolls of fat in the thing and I was with a girl who you know was a very very serious young and everything and we went to her Beach her Beechwood cutting little-do-you-know Dume Beach little do and she's talked to these she goes have to go talk to these guys and there was a cool Surfer Dudes and it was like 25 years ago 30 years ago and she's talks and there's laughing and laughing at me to her cuz she's not Lefty's and they're back there and I see a chorus of them kind of laughing to go well I guess they're laughing because they said we never thought you'd be would like a fat guy and I don't know how they look at me and that's what they're that's what they're seeing and I think it's funny I got to fix this and I was like the straight up October forever for me that is what's called fat shaming that she may even know that it's a very controversial thought because some people think is fat shaming is terrible and they should do it to people it what other people say that but it makes people feel bad and some people think you should protect people from feeling bad whereas other people think you should tell them that they're fat so they feel bad they act on it how do you say it say it on Joe Rogan call it I'm the ladder I think you should tell people that they're fast if they want to know I don't think you should go out and do you mean like they want to know if you want to know like your wisdom friend about a husband way for boyfriend girlfriend on stuff cuz they even resent you forever yeah yeah yeah if you're a man and you resent your wife forever cuz she tells you you're probably not really a man inspect if my wife tells me I'm fat I'm glad I'm not fat yeah we talked about doesn't work only works if you're fat girl the way you think and the girl the girl that guy are together who did the girl ever say you have a little delay every time I'm sure someday say it but here's the thing some girls pretty rough guys we can talk sexual so they they like girls and guys here's a question with those girls be more likely to settle for a guy with a little dick yes or a rich guy would they like girls to be girls in like guys no matter what I do have a big dick damn thing a person can do about that one you know you can suck fat out of waste stuff in your ass you can get fake boobs there's a lot of things you can do if you got a little dick that's a wrap son Throwing Shade right now that would mean like we had looked Navy and if a crazy I think I think there's certain things that you know there's nothing you can do about it and I just have to handle that roll the dice whatever you got yeah I would guess that's one of them things like crispr and genetic manipulation I don't think there's anything more profitable except $9 personal mean maybe one day they'll be able to do something yeah they shoot a little virus in your body and then all sudden purple I got that that's didn't know about that that's like in the Zeitgeist right now is it that one James Corden maybe we should be kind of Weird Al Fat Jokes while you're being upset at someone's calling you fat that's one of the things that people have a problem with being sympathetic about it that was Bill Maher statements bills obviously very slim man yeah but it's not something you can't fix it's a problem to fix it hard to fix hard probably requires discipline and also your your gut biome is probably all screwed up from eating bad foods and you know you probably are accustomed to certain certain Behavior patterns or unhealthy for you yeah the times you're eating the kind of food you're eating yeah picture of fix mine with them but I mean I wasn't fat in the that really a shame I fix it would shame me and I start jumping rope and I started with I do all everything with an achievable goal I just did a couple minutes and I just kept going and then pretty soon you know I did the rope with the that had a counter on it with those plastic beads that gives a little weight on the end of a nylon rope nylon cord could really wet and get it going do you have to do 200 beats a minute for 30 minutes and holding your body very tight so it actually I didn't think of it that way but it really strengthen strengthen my core yeah yeah so obviously always on your toes yeah so it's it it keeps your caps condition to know helps your body building strong calves and strong feet very very important for boxing anything that requires movement football players a lot of football players you can jump rope help their ability to move side to side and helping Mobility yeah antidote to a fat shaming what is a lot of videos online where people doing like these YouTube workouts of jumping rope and then they also have weighted ropes which is a weighted rope to waiting and I was doing it I would do it in the rain always everyday I did it remember being on a Tarmac in Greece and Athens waiting and I was doing it I would do it in the rain I would always the everyday I did it without fail for almost 12 years</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> go back to these conversations that you had over these 35 years the ones that you've recorded what have you done with them you just you're holding on to them I just keep keep them people get so mad at me because I tell everybody they should do a podcast how mad do people get to me the title of your book yeah so in the kid that so that was so curious mind I realized that cheese have been 35 years of these at that time I might have been 30 and my kids my for kids don't really know what I'm doing you know like I'm really spending a lot of time hustling to get Edward tell her to meet me to a year-and-a-half two years or Daryl Gates was the craziest meeting of all time craziest want to give it to you real quick I'll give it to you so I really thought this guy he was going to want is one of the most well-known and most accomplished of police Chiefs in America think we're three of them and he was one of the three in a century and and then Daryl Gates I knew created was one of the creators of the fundamental creator of SWAT which is bringing paramilitary text to the LA Police Department he started out as a bright-eyed strong-minded clean-cut guy working for the police department and because he was sharp he was the driver to the police chief which was Chief Parker and then Chief Parker that do la there was a riot called the watch Ryan not the LA riots but the Watts Riot and the police went in and they were not qualified to be situation and they kind of failed at at and they felt they failed at it and Daryl Gates was like by the chief side the entire time and he kind of bowed to himself I'm not going to let that happen again and when he had the opportunity because he became later police chief and I'm not not much later became police chief of police department he instituted SWAT and other in a paramilitary tack set a mind discipline that was pretty you know with like creating you know like martial law people would argue and and then we went that kind of produced an environment that I think many think in my sights I think myself helped the environment that caused the LA riots because there was a lot of inequity I think human inequity felt and I'm getting this gonna politicon you should hit me with your point-of-view please I'm the on the LA Riot yeah well I moved here after that okay if I wasn't here while that was going down right it was pretty intense the LA riots were the Rodney King trial exactly the video I was watching Rodney King getting beaten like that then you also heard that they had been on the high-speed Pursuit with him and that there was more that video like that was the end of their altercation apparently there's much more physical altercation before that video and maybe if someone saw the full thing they would understand what okay you're dealing with a while persons on PCP in the cops are doing everything they can to detain MPA but there's a distrust of the police in these communities in the first place because they had seen so much police brutality real that reaction that right was not just because of that one thread yeah it was an accumulation of different of yeah different interactions with people that had with abuses at least moving pot yeah yeah and there was so much corruption 3DS during that time so all that just exploded and so that the thing about the story is there saying about I took I got a meeting with Daryl gate it was 10 months on the book 10 months wow ironically the day of my meeting with him was the day of the LA Riot so I thought and it already happened 2000 buildings on fire and everything and my office gets a phone call from jail case office confirming my meeting with him I'm thinking oh my God Parker Center is under siege you know it's like the whole city is under siege he still wanted to keep the meeting but the meeting that was on the books for 10 I thought that's really crazy so I went down at a guy drive me and I went down and they zigzag through like a security clearance thing or canoe other cars could get through that was really bizarre you know like we see this now often but they initiated this this kind of amazed at the car would go through I get to the get to the get to the front door a couple of police Chiefs of police officers escort me in they put me in a room they they didn't give me a cavity search but just about everything but you know took my clothes off you're too tuna fish sandwiches very you know a utility you do very utilitarian the sandwiches and we had the potato chips and you said you want an iced tea I couldn't even swallow I couldn't eat my food cuz it was so shocked by the whole thing that he had so much he was impervious to everything it was going down in the city council was on his TV and on the TV out there cheap you're on TV right now and they're yelling and he goes he says to me and of them this is nothing they'll never give me out of here and so much hubris it was it was it was amazing and I know he's so calm about it the course they did they did get him out today actually cuz the city council was really a very liberal guys on that board people on that poured rather and it's it's a long insane story I had my meeting got bad blood sugar normal like an hour or so you just have lunch and just pick his brain and yeah just had lunch and ask questions you know and try to act not be nervous or upset about the in what's going on environment and the TV flashing you know like archival footage that they chopped days before your the day of and buildings on fire in the Korean Korean Saw Shop Market somebody getting killed somebody getting killed and all that stuff they were showing on television and he he was just kind of matter-of-fact like this is just what's going down this time it's just pass wow that's crazy design for the job</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> cuz I don't really think of it you know that you know these sort of creative puzzles that way I'd be going to help you create a puzzle would be like you know what movie or TV show or documentary and I could go on and but you're okay Jay-Z ask me cuz I new Jay-Z because he was very obsessed with wanting to do the soundtrack to a movie called American Gangster which I produced oh great thanks I I like that one looked too but so and I said as much you know what is impressive name of Jay-Z and his level of you do Mastery of self I said look we've already done the entire score I mean you can't do it it's been done he said we'll look I feel a kinship to Frank Lucas who was played by Denzel Washington is a ninja being a drug dealer like the base Irwin dealer in America that and head of like his own Mafia that he creates in study when the bottom line is he feels this kinship to him he wants to do this is very dedicated I said it's already done as much as you know Superstar you are and how great you are and he said look I will do a second album I don't have to be the primary elements on the screen I'll do a second album and I said I only have three weeks because I will do the whole thing in 3 weeks and he oh and I went and saw him he did the singing he did the writing he did it engineer that he did every single thing so the guy is the king of hip-hop he goes to work and I was really blown away because he still you know how he has that grit in him and and it turned out to be like for real hip hop lovers they really like this album I guess it was everybody loves everything he does though something I wish it but he doesn't really yeah he's kind of brilliant actually he's a yeah he's not really any marketer he's when he says things that are very insightful so he wanted to do after that we got to know each other and then he said hey I'm going to do a festival festival with 2422 different artists all different types of Scooby in Love Park installed we're calling it made in America would you produce it and and I said yeah and I knew that Ron Howard could get a chance of directing it and I thought it'd be really good for Ron to be around Jay-Z that's a good thing for him it's a good he's got a good Aura and the right one for Ron and I thought was so we joined him I said what is this about you know what's the premise and he said it's about democratization of music itself is no record stores anymore and in the walls are down you could you know you can get you know there's a crossover between hip-hop and you know trance music and all that stuff so and I thought that was kind of cool and then I said if you're seeing this movie called because it didn't have a story that this concert I shall receive Amadeus Amadeus genius and you asked about it. put the premise of this will be in immediately. Had this idea that it should be every artist every human being has a little bit of Genius in them and he made it very relatable and that became the thesis of what this documentary became and he only had that like a week before we were shooting show me human being has a little bit of Genius in them and he made it very relatable and that became the thesis of what this documentary became and he only had that like a week before we were shooting</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I had to either another thing I put on my list here I wanted to mention I almost as a public service sleep apnea I have sleep apnea and I have you know about this yeah you snore mouthpiece the CPAP changed everything that's that's why I wanted to mention it like anybody who's got like I was not breathing for 20 seconds at at and yeah this this woman I was sleeping with like actually counted you know and she's like dude like you're choking you're suffocating so I went and got tested super easy to take it home and hook this thing your finger and all that and they told me I think it was like 25 episodes per hour is considered severe I had 74 every minute I was suffocating to the point where I sort of woke up and like my throat tissue unit with the muscles contract so you can breathe again so you're like always at the surface I got one of those machines dude I'm like sleeping again I'm Dreaming at fantastic now do you have a hard time or they have met just go over your knee which one do you have I have both I started cuz I use their nose one and then I was breathing through my mouth and that's all weird so then I got the big one but after a month with that now I just use the nose one now that pumps air what it does is it creates air pressure but just very suggestible it adjusts based on your reaction to it and so when you are when you're breathing the air pressure keeps the passages open so it can be anatomical that can be your tongue falling back I have floaters for me yeah so it keeps the passage open it's just a slight pressure and it's really nice cuz you take a it's like you take a deep breath and it fills your lungs cuz there's just that little extra push and it's totally quiet like there's all this stigma around it like people think it's really like gross or loud or whatever it's not written of a humidifier in them so you can adjust the how do you power it up when you're camping and stuff well I've got electrical system in the van and I also have a backup battery a lithium battery that's why you need the whole night like that yeah if you don't use the humidifier if you use the humidifier it sucks up more cuz it's it's a heating thing is humidifier help turn it off if you're in a nose and Seattle to turn it off doesn't matter so it's just change the way you you feel I feel so much better I'm like sleeping through the night I dream again yeah I didn't I mean I feel kind of Evangelical about it because you know I know a lot of people have this men and women and there's this weird kind of Shame around it and I'm just trying to be like you're like 50% more likely to have car accidents if you have sleep at all yeah yeah it'll suck up your job it'll fit you won't get hard-ons it'll like ruin everything some people it's really bad too and that it goes on for years and years and years they don't even know about I was on a plane once and it was a guy behind me and I would hear and lying there with his mouth open like suffocate a long time and then finally he would jostle and catch some air and he woke up and I said hey man and I said do you know you have sleep apnea is like what do you mean and I said okay let me tell you what's going on and I showed him my mouthpiece I feel like I have this thing that I have to sleep with is it a long flight we're on and I said you got to go to a doctor get that checked out and he was okay thanks I go no really yeah you got to go to a doctor it'll change your life heart disease like a lot of bad shitcan had also affects people's dietary choices because when you're exhausted like that I know how I am like last night I was tired I came home from The Improv is like 1 in the morning I should not have eaten but I was like f*** it and I made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for 1 a.m. make bad choices make that dietary choices it's very very common people are exhausted and overworked and I think that has to apply to people with sleep apnea when you're you're always exhausted like throughout the day you're just sucking down coffee and trying to stay awake my dad had it for sure yeah maybe that's another reason messed up our lives are really hard to address like that you know the Litany of things you were talking about board meetings and all that but you know if you can get a good night sleep for you know a visit to the doctor and having this thing cost eight hundred bucks for this machine I have your whole life solves the problem you know like that's pretty cool maybe it's just the kind they use Joey Diaz changed his life started using that thing you brings it got a portable unit to bring some on planes</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how to measure a placebo that works we know that hypnosis people can have open heart surgery under hypnosis or having limbs amputated her all sorts of amazing things with no anaesthesia whatsoever hypnotic actually has a really interesting Theory along those lines which is that in prehistoric populations hypnotic ability would be adaptive because a lot of the healing rituals were keying into Placebo response so if we have a certain ritual if you are susceptible to the you know you believe in that like voodoo voodoo deaf people die when they're a spell is cast as they believe it if you don't believe it doesn't happen so what happens the opposite direction well with healing so his his idea is that that would have been a very adaptive characteristic in prehistoric societies where is in contemporary societies it's maladaptive because you're more susceptible to advertising your your easier to manipulate multiple personality disorder cuz I was really interested in this question of how the brain and the body interact how much of it was all this research showing that people with the same condition and in hospitals exactly the same age the prognosis and all that they heal significantly faster if they're Hospital window looks out on trees as opposed to looks out and another building something like that just something like nature she's the body into to some sort of energy that that helps it to you completely makes sense that people with multiple personalities will Roseanne Roseanne 147 having 7 personalities to stuff her saying it so here's the thing about Roseanne and I'm saying this for the 10th time I guess she was hit by a car when she was 15 and she was put in a mental institute for 9 months afterwards she has severe brain damage and she lost her bill to do mathematics and like really scrambled brain and that is probably the birth of the Roseanne that we know the comedian and that's also the case of Sam Kinison Sam Kinison so I like a pretty normal kid and then he was hit by a car and you know pretty severe brain damage as well and brain damage for especially apparently especially as an impact on your ability to be rational and impulsive behavior it like people with brain damage lot of times get very impulsive it's very so widely you know it's what happens to you dependent like what kind of trauma where the trauma is what part of brain but when they said about Herschel Walker was always confuse I wonder if it was from football like football trauma or was it personal trauma like you know abuse yeah people with diagnosed with multiple personality disorder if I remember correctly almost always were severely abused as kids you know and in fact the the rationale is that they develop the alternate personalities as a way of escaping a reality that's intolerable yeah yeah I mean people do weird things with horrible memories you know they bury them to the point where they don't even really have access to them anymore sexual abuse some some traumatic events by the way the art is done by a guy listen to my podcast now really it looks like but the art by guy was cheeseburger that they hang out grasshoppers that they're dispersed they eat grass the chill right rains come the grasslands expand grasshopper population increases then the rain stopped the grasslands contract to the point where the the density of the Grasshoppers triggers dormant Gene so is an epigenetic event in these Grasshoppers and they start to transform and not over Generations individuals front legs get shorter back get longer thorax changes shape of the head changes coloring changes and behavior changes from being these chilled-out solitary relax grasshoppers they start attacking each other they become cannibalistic and they swarm Locust Locust and act like they become locusts so this species of grasshopper and Locust is the same species as the same DNA it's just responding to different conditions so you know we're talkin about the brain and the who you are and what identity isn't all that fits I was reminded us when you said your people are so different and the H2O think we're not only different as individuals in the same context we changed completely given the context were in so the focus of his book is a hunter-gatherers were essentially a different sort of animal they were essentially you know the parallel is with the Grasshoppers and now we're swarming now we're a different kind of animal even though our DNA is the same but it makes sense to me people that live in small towns are so different than people live in cities yeah it's so rare that you find someone was a small-town sensibility in Manhattan got to get chewed up yeah making their way across the country and dealing with the Swarms of locusts and really not having any what to do with them and how to handle them Native Americans ate him yeah that's probably an excellent solution to some of the issues that people have with meat cuz a lot of people don't have any problem killing bugs but they wouldn't want to kill lamb right now but you can have Cricket proteins agriculture in Thailand I've had him in Mexico they have them fried and we're staying at a resort in Puerto Vallarta parts of crickets and grasshoppers it's a Mexican place they specialize in mole Mexican food is very damn gourmet Mexican I just another word that's like a I don't know if it means party but it's a celebration. famous people that are allergic to shellfish are also allergic to roaches allergies are above a special African peanut I've heard peanut allergies are so bad that people would ask you to not eat peanuts on a plane someone who has a peanut allergy like some people's pee no doubt she is so severe that even like the dust of you chewing peanuts on a plane next to them get them sick and and it's interesting to think about the State of Consciousness and how that affects allergies because apparently and again I'm always caught about to get on the show too many people listening so caveats been a long time since I read the research but if I remember correctly under hypnosis a lot of people with allergies no longer expect I remember the research yeah there was a it was a setup where the person could see so like you and I are talking across the table and there's a mirror behind me and in the mirror in your peripheral vision you see roses and you're allergic to roses you'll have a reaction even though they're plastic roses so it's enters the Consciousness and triggers their response subconsciously yeah I think that's how it was and then with people under hypnosis like he was tripping it was on MDMA I think and he's playing with no reaction to it self-hypnosis squelches allergies in my life look at that picture and ski slopes dissipation your heart starts quickening you get rug really weirded out by it but then you get the shine like I wasn't sure it was a freaking out like that but it's this the psychosomatic aspect of it that's what life is basically and I'm not share. She'll like we're always worried about things we spend so much time worrying about things most of which never occur it would never occur you know and even the ones that do occur it's like wow whatever like death you know what he's worried about that dying maybe if it takes too long but if it's if it takes like an hour or a day to die that's a tiny fraction of your life who gives a s***</div>

To do it ad or something got the story got interrupted and I felt like you thought I was trying to diss you or something that definitely didn't yeah well I was paranoid then you lit up a joint my chair trying not to fall out of the chair and I we start talking and I'm telling the story about a dude that I'd met on an airplane and he was super into a sex at dawn and then we are going to do a movie together and whatever and then his wife like took the book away from him I was like yo can we just like cut this and start over and you look the music is live b**** you don't remember any of that I do now video and we laugh we got in the car and I said man was that is awkward as I felt and she's like that's the worst I've ever seen you about the sober October things is you realize like there's so many things that are so much easier when you're not high yeah it's almost like yeah handicap Yourself by getting fake like I was talking to Redban Brian Redban about this look blue talking about like how the early days of podcast we would get obliterated before we do the podcast like four years like up until like maybe two thousand thirteen or fourteen like we would Volcano Vaporizer up his bag and you take these big deep hits off this THC vapor and then as soon as you put the bag down and we are okay let's get going let's start the podcast and be like oh my god what have we done it was this feeling every time we did the podcast was all my god what have we done and you'd be in the middle of saying something and as you're saying like what am I talking about stop he gets scrambled in your head when there's no power at all that never happens like you mean you might make mistakes but you know what you're talkin about while you're talkin about it right like when you're really really high like that there's a lot of times where you're talkin about stuff will you literally don't know exactly what you're talkin about like that split personality thing we're talking about it food and sleep the pros and cons and then the cons become very evident when you're not doing it you know I still think every time I do the sober October things I always think while I'm going to cut back I'm going to cut back on some weed and I think I did last year like after October else like I am not going to do it as much as I used to do it the cons become very evident when you're not doing it you know I still think every time I do the sober October things I always think while I'm going to cut back I'm going to cut back on some weed and I think I did last year like after October I was like I am not going to do it as much as I used to do it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I think that's what life is basically and I'm not share. She'll like we're always worried about things we spent so much time worrying about things most of which never occur even the ones that do occur it's like wow whatever death dying maybe if it takes too long but if it's if it takes like an hour or a day to die that's a tiny fraction of your life working on yes Sir Arthur is what you're trying to say I take it as a compliment to do then work out Joe if I keep writing books which is sort of a self-help book but it's a parody of self-help books and so it'll be it'll be calling attention to the way so much of what we do to try to be healthy is actually counterproductive cuz we stress especially Americans everything's work you know everything turns into work and Americans are very suspicious of pleasure were taught to the pleasure is you know evil and dangerous and all this I've never bought that line of reasoning I've always felt like what feels good generally is good there's a reason it feels good you know know that can get corrupted by advertising and false messaging from a sick society that tells you you know sit on the sofa and drink beer and eat bags of chips all day but if you get beyond that and you can actually hear the voice of your body I think if your body is telling you to you know stay in bed because it's a rainy cold day and I know this is play against your perspective on life where you're like you got to tame the in her bed she got to get out of bed you got to work out it doesn't matter I'm like no man I'm staying in bed you go to what you need to do I used to climb mountains with his friend of mine in Spain and he was like you he was a f****** billy goat he'd like go up and I'd go with him till I got to a nice spot with a nice view I'd be like dude I'll be here when you come down take a nap got a bottle of wine cheese I appreciate that too I'm not married to my perspective but I think I have a very peculiar biology that Demands a certain amount of exertion does you get this it's like we did you know it was last October we did the sober October thing we had at this crazy fitness challenge so all of us were doing cardio like 5 hours a day really crazy amount of cardio and mouthing to Tom Segura and I both agreed on his like the the amount of internal chatter dissipates 2-0 gives no anxiety it goes I didn't realize I had any anxiety until that happen and then I was like God it goes to zero because the nothing like when you do like 5 hours on a treadmill or just running just run for when you when it's done man there's just like peace of mind that comes with that this release of endorphins that's incredibly addictive cuz that feeling is so pleasing so it's not that it doesn't it doesn't feel good to get out of bed and then to just push when you don't want to but the end result feels amazing I wonder if there's any research looking into whether that affect happens universally because I've worked out I've run there were times in my life I've never gotten never I get my teeth hurt my knees hurt my back hurts I feel my brain bouncing around in my skull you know I'm half a mile into it I'm like f*** this he doesn't feel good you have to get in shape first that's a big part of it it's not it's not that simple it's like for me I never really got into running but I do like the first time I really did any serious running up my friend cam Hanes had a 5k which is what is a 3-mile run at all in preparation for it and when I ran the 5K Jesus Christ can have it was no good feeling at all now it's running on concrete and shittin in Vegas grow some Vegas Melanson in the air and but when it was over I was like okay obviously I'm not I'm in good shape but not in good running shape at all so I should probably get in shape for this and then I started running and then when I got into running in a particular running hills then I started feeling it once I kind of got in that kind of shape and then when the you know the workouts are over like I run all the time now and when it's over I just have this yeah you and Marshall are doing your thing is great my mother didn't like dogs but my sister and I convinced her that Dad needs a dog cuz that'll get this dog will go for walks cuz the dog needs to walk and so going to Golden Retriever he named it Stoli right there and then and then he never went for a walk so we just sat next to him and got fact going to another team needs exercise yeah it does but it helps me too and it's fun like I talk to him when we run you know my cuz we're running and you know I have low conversations with him fun is he's not judging you right he wouldn't probably prefer that more interesting but you have to achieve some Level Fitness before I think it kicks in</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> not only individually but I think we very we become different creatures in different conditions shorter people sometimes you ask me like what's your you know what is human nature what's your opinion you know based on these books and I say it's like asking what's the natural state of H2O a Spanish shoes her mother is French or Father's Catalan she was raised in Spain and then lived in Miami when she was 13 to 15 or something so she spoke English really well Spanish French and Catalan perfectly right and we're living in San Francisco and I was high or smoking a joint she was across the room talking to her mom on the phone in French and then her mom put her dad on the phone so she switch to Catalan and I was just high enough that I noticed like wow that's not Peggy talking to different languages and at 3 cuz she would like put her hand on phone so my mom said so it's not Peggy speaking 3 languages changed depending on the language you were speaking right and at the time I was in grad school and I thought this is like multiple personality disorder so I started researching multiple personality and I got should have came up with this idea that language in her case because she learned them all when she was very young reconfigures the brain in such a way that she actually has different identities in those languages and next time we were f****** I started talking to her in Spanish and she freaked out I was a stranger suddenly I just said I just said like you're beautiful or something she's like the research on that and there's a movie called Sybil he was the consultant for that mood he was also a consultant for Rosemary's Baby remember that the possession is bizarre it it seems to indicate that people have physiological states in the different personalities so you can have a different Baseline heart rate blood pressure in the different even if I don't know how reliable this is but I even read that some people have different ocular pressure so that one personality needs reading glasses and another doesn't yeah somatic like really I count how much how much of who you are and how you how your body works is dependent upon the way your brain is getting things right culture language personal experience how much you slept the night before you know all these things is something we take for granted but if you start to look at it it's like it's like gravity you do gravity included in our calculations but nobody has any idea what's happening how does that work like the other things are track real touchy about it oh really since he's been accused of you know when they're doing a television show all right but it's still even if even if he's proven innocent you you know you got the weight of who knows how many people that think you're a creep now you know and he's carrying that around because he was always thought of as being this jovial yeah sweet nice guy that's why I start out admitting I'm a creep Charlie Sheen but we have this conversation about gravity and it was weird it was like I was arguing with him but I wasn't arguing cuz like I was like what what is cause you like you like what causes it and he's like we know it like he went into this whole thing we know what it is we know how to measure it we can but that's good enough for me it was a very tense conversation you know how to measure a placebo that works we know that hypnosis people can have open heart surgery under hypnosis or having limbs amputated her all sorts of amazing things with no anaesthesia whatsoever hypnotic ability that actually has a really interesting Theory along those lines which is that in prehistoric populations hypnotic ability would be adaptive because a lot of the healing rituals were Keating into Placebo response so if we have a certain ritual if you are susceptible to the you know you believe in that like voodoo voodoo deaf people die when they're a spell is cast cuz they believe it if you don't believe it doesn't happen so it happens the opposite well with healing so his his idea is that that would have been a very adaptive characteristic in prehistoric societies where is in contemporary societies it's maladaptive because you're more susceptible to advertising your your easier to manipulate multiple personality disorder cuz I was really interested in this question of how the brain and the body interact how much of it was all this research showing that people with the same condition and in hospitals exactly same age same prognosis and all that they heal significantly faster if they're Hospital window looks out on trees as opposed to looks out at another building something like that just getting it something like nature she's the body into to some sort of energy that that helps it to you completely makes sense that people with multiple personalities as well Roseanne Roseanne seven having 7 personalities as tough her saying it so here's the thing about Roseanne scientist for the 10th time I guess she was hit by a car when she was 15 and she was put in a mental institute for 9 months afterwards she has severe brain damage and she lost her bill to do mathematics and like really scrambled brain and that is probably the birth of the Roseanne that we know the comedian and Sam Kinison I like a pretty normal kid and then he was hit by a car and you know pretty severe brain damage as well and brain damage for especially apparently especially has an impact on your ability to be rational and impulsive behavior it like people with brain damage a lot of time to get very impulsive the gun very so widely you know it's what happens to you depended upon what kind of trauma where the trauma is what part of brain but when they said about Herschel Walker was always confuse I wonder if it was from football like football trauma or was it personal trauma like you know abuse yeah people with diagnosed with multiple personality disorder if I remember correctly almost always were severely abused as kids you know and in fact of the rationale is that they develop the alternate personalities the way of escaping a reality that's intolerable yeah yeah I mean weird things with horrible memories bury them to the point where they don't even really have access to them anymore sexual abuse some some traumatic events pull up at the art is done by a guy listen to my podcast now really it looks like but the art by guy was cheeseburger copperstate there dispersed they eat grass the chill right rains come the grasslands expand grasshopper population increases then the rain stop in grasslands contract to the point where the the density of the Grasshoppers triggers dormant Gene so is an epigenetic event in these Grasshoppers and they start to transform and not over Generations individuals front legs get shorter back legs longer thorax changes shape of the head changes coloring changes and behavior changes from being these chilled-out solitary relax grasshoppers they start attacking each other they become cannibalistic and they swarm Locust Locust and act like they become locusts for this species of grasshopper and Locust is the same species as the same DNA it's just responding to different conditions so you know we're talkin about the brain and the sorry what identity isn't all that if it's I was reminded us when you said your people are so different and the H2O think we're not only different as individuals in the same context we changed completely given the context were in so the focus of his book is a hunter-gatherers were essentially a different sort of animal they were essentially you know the parallel is with the Grasshoppers and now we're swarming now we're a different kind of animal even though our DNA is the same now we're different kind of animals even though our DNA is the same that makes sense me people that live in small towns are so different than people live in cities yeah it's so rare that you find someone was a small-town sensibility in Manhattan got to get chewed up yeah</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I want to bring it back to the initial question so you're working for the NSA when do you realize there's a huge issue and when do you feel this responsibility to let the American people know about this issue like wind when do you contact these journalists and what was his thought process regarding it's like what what steps did you go through once you realize that this was in violation of the Constitution and that even with the laws the Patriot Act in The Patriot Act two things had changed so radically that you knew this was wrong you had to do something about it you felt a responsibility to speak out people are sticking Dixie Cups on the top of every chain link fence on every overpass is like stand together you know never forget united we stand cronies are going to look it's Al-Qaeda is Terrorism terrorist organization to have all these International connections. There's a rock you know dictators weapons of mass destruction soon so it didn't work out I I join the special program others call the 18 x-ray program where they take you in off the street and they actually have a shot at becoming a special forces Soldier so you train harder and special platoons you go further and I ended up breaking my legs I had a 24 inch waist when I when I join the Army girls are jealous and 28 lb text about that you're running in like boots and then you doing exercise in the Army is like a whole chapter in the book you got your battle buddy right cuz I never allow you to be alone it was going to have somebody watching you they thought it was funny to put me the smallest Woods doing these marches and things like that we have to practice buddy carries like a fireman carry things like that he throws me around his neck you know I'm like a towel he's just skipping down like it's nothing and then I got to put him on me and I might just like it was it was I see a snake my memory you know it's like time slows down to North Carolina anyway I tried to take a much longer step in mid-air I'll and badly and it's it's just one leg is is like fire I'm limping but you know General infantry regular Infantry Flex they just give out underneath me and I try to get up and I just can't get off until I go to sick call and I end up going to the hospital and they end up X-ray and me and they also actually my battle buddy because I got to go there with somebody else and he has a broken hip start phase of the training was jump school right where you got to jump out of the plane and the doctor you know is like a son if you jump on those legs they're going to turn into powder I can hold you back because of the way these things are scheduled and everything like that and then you basically be re-signed of the needs of the army or which probably meant I was going back to it which was what I joined the army to kind of Escape knowing a marriage it's as if it never happened as if he never joined and at the time I was like well you know that's very kind of him to do that sick call if you take administrative discharge it exempts the Army for liability for your injuries so actually because I had gotten the basic security clearance just for going through sign up for the military process I applied for a security guard position at the University of Maryland because it said you had to get a top secret clearance with a higher clearance than I had of time the way it works if you have a top secret security clearance and Tech skills you get a paid a ridiculous amount of money for doing very little work so I was like all right well you know I can basically make twice what I would be making in the private sector not working for government at this level what we talked about earlier government purposes it was the same as if I was a high school graduate so now suddenly was like these these doors are open now this University of Maryland facility turned out to be an NSA facility Advanced study of language I'm managing the electronic alarm system and things like that but once I had my foot in the door there I could start climbing the ladder step by step and I applied for I went to a job fair actually it was only for people who had security clearances yeah we got tons of positions for somebody like you are you comfortable working nights and I was like yeah you know I wake up in the middle of the day anyway. That's fine with me and suddenly I've gone from working at for the NSA through a university in a weird way where it's like Fantastical 2 clearance but I'm formally an employee of the state of Maryland at the college in this is government's all these weird dogism boondoggles for how people are employed there suddenly I'm working at CIA headquarters rind of the place where all the movie show you swoop over the marble seal and everything like that I'm the king of the castle at the middle of the night when no one else is there the lights are on motion sensors in the creepiest thing in the world there's like Flags disappear behind you and there's there's no one that I can go down to the gym at like 2 in the morning the CIA and it's like not see a soul on the other side of the building then go all the way back and this kind of thing was going to happen the Washington metropolitan area writing so every basically CIA server this is a computer system that like data is stored on the reporting a stored on that traffic has moved on all of this stuff suddenly me 2005 I'm in charge of if you're interested in the book there's a lot of detail on this but I get sort of scouted from this position because they realize I actually know a lot about technology they were expecting me just to basically make sure the building doesn't burn down all these systems don't go down and never come back up the work overseas for the CIA and there's a lot of people listen to podcasts or like not me I didn't have skepticism is really what I'm trying to establish here this special training school in Virginia called the hill Warrenton Virginia worst media but I think this is one of the few book-length discussions what would happens there in permit record in Geneva Switzerland undercover as a diplomat right I think I might my formal title for the embassy is diplomatic you into kind of a MacGyver right yes you can handle all the computers up but you can also handle the connections for the embassies Power Systems write the actual electrical connections you can handle the HVAC systems right you can handle locks and alarms and security systems Geneva to other countries in Europe for assignment now there are many different types of intelligence the intelligence Community is responsible for the primary ones are human intelligence and signals intelligence you want to think of signals intelligence right as tapping lines hacking computers all of these sort of things that provide electronic information for analog signal intelligence has seen all that fun stuff we further the CIA doing for four decades and decades. Which is where they try to turn people basically they say look will give you money if you sell out your country they don't it's not even your country but anyway that that's sort of how it works and what I saw was they were way more aggressive for the lowest Stakes than was reasonable responsible they were totally willing to destroy somebody's life because what I what I've learned over my life Percy's and you notice them and give somebody the benefit of the doubt or you trust them you think it's all right but then over time you see it's not an isolated instance it's a pattern behavior and overtime that exposure to inconsistency builds and builds and builds until something that you can no longer ignore I didn't from there a couple years later I went to the CIA again now I was working employee from Dale senior technical official on sales account search for the entire agency or the chief intelligence Chief Information officer for the entire CIA email account is available wherever you go it's my Facebook has this massive system of records for everyone everywhere by the government wanted to have this these kind of capabilities to people classifieds bass that just goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper but at this point I I was already I had misgivings because of what I'd seen in Japan about government but I was just trying to get by I was trying to ignore the conflicts I was trying to ignore the inconsistencies and I think this is a state that a lot of people in these large institutions struggle with everyday when did they got a job they going to family they got the bills they dick they're just trying to get by and they know it's some of the things to do in are not good things they know some of the things that are actively wrong but they know what happens to people who Rock the Boat eventually I changed my mind and when I had gone to Hawaii which was the fire decision in my career with the intelligence Community I was because of an accident of History here I wasn't supposed to be in this position at all I was supposed to be in a group called The National threat operations center and dock but because of the way Contracting works assigned to this little rinky-dink office that nobody's ever heard of in Hawaii called the office of information sharing and I'm replacing this old-timer who's about to retire really really nice guy but he spent most of his days just reading novels and doing nothing but it's actually over a larger group and they just look so him as a sort of a favor so now I come in and now I'm the sole employee of the office of information sharing but I'm not close enough to retirement nothing at all call the heartbeat is connect to basically every information repository in the intelligence community and a cross Network boundaries what you normally can't cross but with the CIA and the NSA I knew the network well enough both sides of its sides than the normal Christian if they would never have seen because you have to be in one or the other actually connect these together records into a new kind of system that was supposed to look at your digital ID basically your office so you could hit this site and it would be an update of what we used to call re boards at which were manually created there we go look you working Network defense m-44 Windows networks because I have been Microsoft certified systems engineer. Which means basically I knew how to take care of Windows networks and this was all those guys did and they always had way too much work way too much work and I had basically no work that I need to do it all because all I was supposed to do was share information because most people already knew what they wanted her what they needed so it was basically my job was to sit there and collect a paycheck unless I wanted to get ambitious I did some side gigs everything that the NSA does in large part is classified everything the CIA does in large part is classified if I made lunch plans with other people my office it was classified that was the policy it's done this over classification problem is one of the central flaws in government right now I can get away with breaking the law that were violating rights for so long in a 5 years 10 years 15 50 years before they see before we see what they were doing and it's because of this routine classification right but every system computer system has a limit on what level of classified information is supposed to be stored on it and we've got all these complicated systems established a system of What's called compartmentation the CIA when you work at the NSA you're not supposed to know what's happening in the office next to you right because you don't have need to know right there in that thing from the the movies and the reason they have this is they don't want one person to be able to go and know everything Ryan tell everybody everything they don't want anybody to know too much for tickly when they're doing bad things because then there's the risk that you realize they're doing so many bad things that it's past the point that we can justify by they might develop serve an idiot logical objection to that part of my career I had access to everything I had to privileged access this means you're kind of Superuser you know most people have all of these controls on the kind of information they can access a but I'm in charge this system right people who need information to have to get it from somewhere they don't know even the director of the CIA right cuz I need to know everything about this he doesn't know where to get it he's just a manager somebody has to be able to actually crossed these thresholds and get those things that guy was me and so dirty word searches is automated queries that I would set up to go across the whole network and look at all of the different levels of classification compartmentation exceptionally controlled information you can think of it as above-top-secret in the special compartments right where you're not even supposed to know what these compartments are for you only know the code word unless you work in them unless you have access to them unless you read into them for a program that I never heard of called Stellar Wind it came back because the the little caveat for their they're called handling caveats which is like you know you can turn out this document was placed on the system because one of the employees who would work on this program years before had come to Hawaii and this person was a lawyer I believe I work in the inspector General's office and they had compiled a report part of the inspector General's report which is when the government is investigating itself into the operations and activities of this program this was the domestic Mass surveillance program that I talked about in the very beginning of our conversation that started under the bush White House I'm Stellar Wind was no longer supposed to be really operation it had been unveiled in a big scandal in December 2005 in the New York Times but there's there's a lot of history here too but what they found was of course the bush White House had constructed a warrantless wiretapping program if you remember the warrantless wiretapping Scandal it was affecting everyone in the United States well the bush White House was really put in a difficult position by the Scandal over the Scandal because the New York Times actually had this story in October 2004 which was the election year they were they were ready to go with it but at the specific request of the White House talking to the publisher just said if you run this story a month before the election that's very tight margin if you work all you'll have blood on your hands and it was so close in 2001 Vine Americans don't need to know what they think it means if it's alright now December 2005 why did that change why did the New York Times has suddenly run this story while it's because James Rising the reporter who found the story had written a book and he was about to publish this book and the New York Times was about to be in very uncomfortable position of having to explain why they didn't run this story and how they got scooped by their own journalist until they finally did it but it was too late last rites so Congress effective and as I said before telling a very few select members of Congress that this program existed and they told them this program existed in ways that they wouldn't object to but made them culpable for hiding the existence from the program the existence of the program from the American people okay and defending this kind of program in fact in the you know later she said although she had objections to the program that she wrote in a letter the White House but she never showed us the letter she went home that was that was classified Brian this is not the bag on her individually it's just she's a great example in here when the White House gets in trouble for it the Congress has to run cover for the White House. And so what happened was Congress passed an emergency law in 2007 called the Protect America act now which should have been our first indication this is a very bad thing United States that had been breaking the law millions of times a day but handing your records over to the government which they weren't allowed to do not simply on the basis of a letter from the president saying please do this and these Americans and staggering scale that could bankrupt our company's because we can be sued for this we will no longer cooperate with you unless you pass a law that says people can't sue us for having done this until we get the paper Protect America Act do we have to pass this now we have to keep this program active do what she's going to end the warrantless wiretapping program and continued it under this new Authority we're going to have some special level oversight in these kind of things eventually but for now we just have to make sure people are safe again that go to fear chances the company's get off the hook the bush White House gets off the hook the Congress that was then sharing in criminal culpability for authorizing letting these things go by without stopping them surveillance act Amendments of 2008 all of the unlawful and unconstitutional activities that the intelligence agency was doing they continued it in different ways simply by creating a few legal help troops for them to jump through make the activities of the person who's caught breaking the law comply with the law but instead make the activities of the person who was breaking the law legal right they make the law comply with the agencies want to do rather than make the agencies comply with the law that's a problem what happened here now because Congress was on the hook and I just wanted to move on and get this over with and there were objections there were people who knew this was a bad idea but it didn't passed on not what the public took away from this book is a part of these laws was a requirement that the inspector general of all of these different intelligence Community elements in the Director of National Intelligence submit a report saying this is what happened this is how a comply with the law or how it didn't comply with the law and back at how this program was constituted what it did what the impacts and effects were and that was supposed to be sort of the Truth and Reconciliation Council right now why am I talking about all this ancient history while I'm sitting here in 2012 draft report from the NSA names names it says Dick Cheney this is David Addington by the White House in the Department of Justice these programs were not lawful but they were not constitutional and the president said would you continue this program on my say-so alone knowing that it's risky I knowing that it's unlawful and he said yes sir I will because I don't care about the American people they care about the continuity-of-government they care about the state rhyme in this is something that people have lost we hear this phrase over and over again National Security National Security National Security to interpret that to mean Public Safety to run cover for the fact that we were elevating a new kind of secret police across the country and what does it mean when again in a democracy in the United States the public is not partner government public does not hold the leash of government we are subject to nothing in the book II tell the fact that I had access to the unclassified version of this report back in Japan and what's interesting is the unclassified version of a report and we've all seen this today with things like a Mueller report and all the intelligence reporting has happened in the last several years blacked out or redacted the they say all you know how to do this sentence of this paragraph of this page or whatever the document that the public have been given about the warrantless wiretapping program was a completely different document it was a document TaylorMade to deceive and mislead the Congress and the public of the United States and it was effective in doing that end in 2012 was this is what real world conspiracies look like right now it doesn't have to be smoking Man Behind Closed Doors right it's lawyers and politicians it's ordinary people from the working-level to the management level who go if we don't explain this in a certain way we're all going to lose our jobs or the other way they go where we're going to get something out of this if we all work together civilization is the history of conspiracy right what what is civilization but a conspiracy for all of us to do better by working together right but it's this kind of thing that I think too often we forget because it's boring as hell has been published courtesy of the Washington Post it's called the inspector General's report on on Stellar Wind and you can look at the actual document that I saw that was unredacted and unelected worked together to actively Underwood the rights of the American people to give themselves expanded Powers now in their defense they said they were seeking these powers for good and Justin why wouldn't they simply just tell us that why wouldn't they have that debate in Congress why wouldn't they put that to vote because if they were and they could convince us that they were they win the vote and pretty good we all know like the Patriot Act passed the worst pieces of legislation passed why didn't we get to vote I'm sorry Joey I went on for very long at all it's just completely fascinating that the continuation of this policy came down to one man and the president having this discussion that is so much more but fascinating of this policy came down to one man and the president having this discussion that is so much more but</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I want to bring it back to when you first started with the NSA you started as a contractor right what was your initial impression and when did you know that things were really squirrely with the program no I have not read your book or got a copy of it okay well I will send you a signed copy brother seasoning all the subcontractors all the defense industries that serve that government and really are kind of control and the world broadly spreads my father works for the Coast Guard retired after 30 years my grandfather was an admiral and they work for the FBI is is for my family my whole line of family even Generations back was working for the government I'm so pretty ordinary pretty expected for me to take to go into the same kind of work now I started and I wasn't super successful in school because I felt and you know this is the most arrogant thing in the world that everybody says that I had more to learn from computers than I did from you know biology class and I spent more time focusing on technology all right how do I make this up if I should drop out of high school but I'm actually going to community college right they called it concurrent enrollment where am I taking the classes at high school I'm going to community college instead and I'm not doing that great it's fine you know you're bored I ran into somebody at the community college who ran their own home based business doing web design and they could see I was kind of Technical and they went hey do you want to work for me and I was like that sounds great she's married to an NSA analyst a linguist right and so she lived on Fort Meade and she ran her business out of their home on for me it's right up the street trained and certified all these little industry stamps you've got to get as a technologist to say do you know this program or whatever and just start climbing the ladder but then 911 happens in the book I was born in 83 so I was probably 18 years old and yes I just turned 18 a couple months before and what people forget is who knew what was going on before anybody else get out of public mourning do they tell you guys were evacuated they said you this letter that no no not for everybody not for long time but at the NSA Michael Hayden the CIA did the same thing they were running on skeleton Crews at the moment the country needed them more than they ever had run and I get a call I hear call from my bosses wife her husband to her he's calling from sound like this is crazy never closes down I we don't know what time then we start checking the news which is through websites right because we're we're doing all this stuff and suddenly it's the big story everywhere and Justice absolute state of pandemonium Psycho-Pass canine road which is the road that travels right in Patton in front of the nsa's headquarters and it's just a parking lot as far as you can see they have military police out under the stop lights directing traffic why did these people have so much power and so much money and so much Authority at the moment we need them the most they're the first ones in the country that are leaving their buildings and get a later on they said and this is covered in the book I believe that director venison gave that order now that what was happening he was going well you know he called his wife and he was asking where their kids were and everything like that then after that he wanted to think about what where could these other planes that they knew were in the air that hadn't Struck it where could they be headed Congress the Supreme Court all they're going to fly their planes into the CIA headquarters airplanes into the NSA headquarters of course it was never realistic that these would be the targets they knew that there isn't a cabbage look it's it's absolutely possible they could attack your Denny's risk assessment and if history intelligence forces in in the history of the species are going to take those off the board or at least the majority of their personnel off the board and then in a chance that you have no sort of Browns for substantiating the higher the chance very small chance even if it's somebody who doesn't work on terrorism it's not a desired outcome if they had asked the staff to do then they all would have agreed that's what these people signed up to do and yet the director goes no no we're not going to take it says so much about the bureaucratic character government works it's about risk management for them right is about never being criticized for something in this is really controversial misses something that'll that'll haunting people ask about people still criticize me you want there to be aliens I do but I do need the grass Tyson badly wants there to be aliens and there probably are right up with the idea that they were hiding them if we are hiding everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories because it helps life makes sense it helps us believe that somebody is control in control right that somebody is calling the shots these things happen for a reason the other there are real conspiracies but they're not typically know that they've got tens of thousands of people did you can get I think there is a 4 million or 1.4 million people in the United States who hold security clearances and you can get all of these people to it to not talk ever the journalist but when you look back at the 911 when you look back at the history of what actually have and what we can prove it's very clear to me that someone worked in the intelligence Community not during this. Of course I was too young but very shortly thereafter that these attacks could have been prevented painting before Patriots at the NSA and CIA and FBI from and to some extent they're their correct on this right there there were limits on the way agencies were supposed to play ball with each other but I worked there and I know how much of this is b******* and how much is this is not those are procedural and policy limits in some cases basically asking for permission without getting sign off or anything like that yet the FBI wanted to send absolutely everything they had the CIA what agencies can do or costing lives there for naturally we just have to unchain these guys and everything will be better right and if you remember that post 911 moment you can understand how that actually could come off as persuasive and who protested the Iraq War at the same time I don't self was signing up to go fight it not volunteering but we lost our heads and all the traditional constitutional and we've been in all of the traditional political restraints and just social logical systems of belief about the limitations that the secret police should have in a free and open society and we will look you know a terrorist unlimited government has results and we should have been surprised everyone panicked pre 9-11 moment hotline back the tapes those silos those walls that they said needed to come down because that was restrained government instead of the rules you're doing something you don't think they should be at with another agency that because no one's going to question a judge is going to question government agrees agrees the tax probably could have been prevented if information has been shared so why wasn't information shared government says information information with the FBI with the CIA in case of married major terrorist plot and if you've worked in government if you worked in the office for budget for cloud for promotions and this is the sad reality of what actually happened everyone agencies wanted to be the guy who bust flop they wanted to be the one who got credit for it and they didn't realize how serious it was until it was too late because they were competing with each other rather than cooperating that's exactly what I was going to ask you if that was the issue the competition between these agencies because they they are very proud of the CIA accomplishing something with the FBI accomplishing something and they they want to be the one to take credit for that I mean I think it's important to like in their defense because nobody else here that is going to provide a defense for them actually Darkly your folks were listening instead of having someone be responsible for Bridging the Gap I had no interest in putting the hit on them the public had no interest in putting hit on them at the time because everybody understood terrorism is a real thing there are bad people in the world and that's true right that will always be true there's always going to be criminals there's always out there who are angry their disenfranchised their violent and they just want Carm something they want to change something even in a negative way because that's what they feel is all they have left which these are Cruz right these are people that we don't need to pity a but if we ever want to stop at we do need to understand it and where those things come from where there's this drives come from in the first place but next time you go in at 9 so everybody just want it I don't care who does it stop it and they said this to Dick Cheney which is a historic mistake but cuz he knows how government works best placed that's not allowed to do and what he did dial on what we're not allowed to do and he changed it all the way until it broke and it snapped off and then there was nothing that we couldn't do anymore and you were there why this is happening this was the snow I don't know this right this is public record this is kind but we all know what we have though but the bottom line is there going this is a guy who's in the White House restored elbows to hurt people as long as the bad guy country after country. This is why you have Vladimir Putin in Russia who's been there for 20 years free which you know even I don't know that much about the 90s after the collapse of the Soviet Union were an extraordinary league dark time if you look at Russian Cinema all they had for gangster movies right all they had were the disintegration of society how things are dark and broken enemy and defeat the enemy to restore Prosperity will put them in office we see it happened in turkey with other one. We've seen it happen this excessively with bad government even in Western democracies and this is the lesson that we didn't learn from 2001 is when we become fearful we become vulnerable right not to anyone who promises they will make things better even if they have no ability to make things better open their bodies by taking from you but if they tell you that they'll make things better and you believed them in a moment of fear that that typically leads to unfortunate outcomes so sorry</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> caso4 for those people first off who have no idea who the hell I am I'm the guy who's behind the revelation of global Mass surveillance in 2013 my work for the CIA I work for the NSA as a contractor something wrong the government was violating the law and what I believe to be the Constitution of the United States and more broadly human rights for everyone in the United States around the world it's only supposed to be monitoring people that it has an individualized particularized that's suspicion of wrongdoing for right there this is we think about this in the investigative means right like all those TV shows where they like go and get a warrant the reason they have to do that the revolution you know it's just a pot smoker get his diary you know whatever it is and just like if you find evidence of crime you marching off to prison and it's all good you found evidence there criminal or you didn't find evidence well no harm no foul you just doing what government does we were trying to build a better system we should be afraid of the person who's got like a baggie of weed in their dresser 4 or something like that that is not a threat to National Security Public Safety but what happened is personal attorney the Giuliani Dick Cheney David Addington and a secret legal interpretation I talked to the heads of the agency the NSA in the CIA and the FBI and all the stuff they told them call sign internet communications emails on that basis they started doing this in secret and it was completely unconstitutional was completely illegal under the very loose requirements the Patriot Act what they did it for so long that they got comfortable with it affected because these were guys in Pakistan until weren't using you know email and phone calls they were getting on a in a moped with their cousin who's a courier was bringing a letter to his guy you know who runs the the food stand or whatever but and we weren't allowed to knowing we were never granted a boat on it and even the many members of Congress right 535 in the United States they were prohibited from knowing this and instead they told only a few select people and the original members of Congress about it they weren't told the full scope of it and now that they've been told about it because they had security clearances and things like that they weren't allowed to tell anybody else about it so journalists were like you know that got concerns what is that last thing where you trying to say being a constant kind of shift where we have we the public have less say and less influence over the policy of government with each passing year there's kind of a new class that's being created a government class and the public civil class that are held to different standards of behavior Mark Wright I just wanted everybody to know what was going on I didn't want to say the Gomery can't do this I didn't want to say this is how you guys have to live because that's not for me to say. But I do believe that everybody in the United States cast of old about them so that they can say you know what you guys say this is okay but I disagree with this is not okay I am Jackson I want things to change it so I gathered evidence of what I believe to be a criminal or unconstitutional activity on the part of them and I gave this to journalists right now I gave this to journalists anything just because they thought it would make news we get them Awards not they would only publish stories that they were willing to make an Institutional judgment stand behind this was three different newspapers to know and then beyond that the system of checks and balances that supposed to self-regulate our government had failed the courts had advocated their role in policing the executive in the Congress because terrorism was such a a hot argument at the time they were worried about being criticized and blamed if something went wrong and it did go through and they didn't have access to the information right in the ones who didn't know it was the same thing they were getting their pockets stuffed with money by the defense contractors that we're getting rich from building these systems were violating the rights of each bus so they benefited by just saying nothing use it if you had a little search box in front of you they would give you the email history then you know of everybody in the United States anybody want you to pull up their text messages anybody want he could see anything ever typed what is the worst thing you've ever typed that last forever so when you have somebody who wants to inform the public of something that will get in the proper channels arguments later but you can't go through the institution to get these corrected because the institution knows it's wrong and it's doing it anyway I worked with a journalist and then that to create an adversarial step right someone who would argue against what I believed and hopefully with the journalist believe once they consulted the documents to play that role right is that the journalist would go to the government and get them morning so we're about to run this story about this secret program that says you did X Y and Z bad thing one is that right play we shouldn't run the story every case I'm aware of that process was followed and that's why and you know as well as I do I think I'm happy to leave things when it's in their interest nobody has been hurt as a result of these disclosures because people who were in the room with the documents Laura poitras Glenn Greenwald you and mccaskill napkin and those policies change after that I went six months without giving any interviews because I didn't want people talk about me I wanted them to talk about what actually matters self said that's why I said is I I really kind of appreciate your your take on the media and everything like that because when you don't tell your story you know other people will tell it for you they'll say so many things about you stop when I actually listen to you when I actually look at the facts right and when I hear you just speak I've actually this is a thoughtful guy actually this is somebody who does care who does want to look at these things this is a thoughtful guy I actually this is somebody who does care who does want to look at these things deeply and appearances are First Impressions can be very misleading I work hard on that I try to mislead people good</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> at the heart of every expression of executive power by executive cleaning the White House here the CIA what is an employee of government policies the worst thing that happens to you if you lose your job because there's no criminal penalty for violation of these laws for people who exist in these structures particularly the very top levels of these structures authorities to to give us leeway to do whatever it is we think is proper and appropriate just now take that proper inappropriate and just from the perspective of Any Given individual Ryan any given president now intersect that with what's good for them politically and that's where problems began to arise now the safety measure that's supposed to protect us probably is these people are supposed to be with a cold public officials that means we know their decisions that means we know their policies that means we know their programs and prerogatives and powers like what they are doing both in our name and what they're doing against us because they are to us do whatever they are public officials and we are private citizens they're not supposed to know anything about us right because we're in relative terms hold no power and they hold all the power so they have to be under the Titus constraints we need to be in the freest circumstances leave this is when I really started getting test in court and I think you know more about this in many cases than I do when you start talk about what happened in the FBI and the CIA and the NSA Super Bowl Dirty Work in the 20th century has repeatedly to domestic politics in the United States yeah I was spying on Martin Luther King and trying to get Martin Luther King to kill himself before the Nobel Prize was going to be awarded after MLK gave his two days later he's wonderful Patriots and heroes I'm not saying I'm not saying Anybody Everybody the CIA and NSA is bad I'm saying that you don't become Patriot based on where you work patriotism is not about loyalty to the government patriotism patriotism is a constant effort to do good for the people of your country right it's not the government it's not about the state and this is loyalty loyal to a bad person if you loyal to a bad program if you're loyal to bad government that that loyalty is actively harmful and I I think that's overlooked but yeah this whole thing about why it happened how it could come out of just the small group and then they could slowly and then having them not say anything about it wider and wider broad body people and then want you got enough people in on it it's much easier to convince other people that have lived in them so they can go look we got 30 people who know about this practice secret Governor body of secret law body of secret policy did is far beyond what legitimate government secrets need to know again the powers and program the policies that govern is asserting at least the broad outlines of it because otherwise how can we control it how do we know if the government is applying its authorities that are supposed to be granted to it by us if we don't know what it is that they're doing I am so this is the main thing and really does the story behind the title permanent record is look joke you're a kid you know when I was a kid when you were teenagers what's the worst thing you ever said they did when they were 13 it's exactly that our worst mistakes are our deepest chains that were forgotten right they were lost they were ephemeral that even the things we did get caught for they were known for time maybe they're still remember by people who are closest to us whether we like them or dislike them now we're forced to live in look for Power Facebook where they were talking about the government of any country they know everything about us or much about us rather and we know very little about them and we're not allowed to no more everything we do now lasts forever not because we want to remember but because we're not allowed to forget just carrying a phone in your pocket is enough for your movements so you immortalised because every cell phone tower that you passed it keeping a record of that and the AT&amp;T keeps those records going back to 2800 program called hemisphere search for Hemisphere and AT&amp;T U-verse store in The Daily Beast about it if they're born after 1987 and their AT&amp;T customer or their calls cost 18 C's Network AT&amp;T has every phone call they ever made the record that it happened not necessarily the contents on the phone call Bush White House if you can see this trend happening when you look what's happening with Facebook when you look at what's happening with Google when you love the fact that you go to every restaurant today and you see people looking phones and you know you get on a bus you get on a subway you know you see somebody sitting next to you in traffic you see people looking at funds these devices are connected all the time now people get an Alexa right now people have good microphones where do you think this means and what is it that gives you sort of trust in the system faith in the system and how they just just so we can start a conversation here and it's new this is something that's unprecedented we don't have a Long human history of being completely connected via technology this is something we're navigating right now for the first time and it's probably the most powerful thing that the human race has ever seen in terms of the distribution of information is nothing that even comes close to it in all of human history and we're figuring it out as we go along and what you exposed is that not only are we figuring out as we go along but that to cover their ass legal for them to gather up all of your calls or text messages all of your emails and store them somewhere so that retroactively if you ever say they don't do something and we don't know who they are we don't know why we didn't know they could do it until you exposed it terrifying in terms of the government's ability to track our movements track your phone calls track everything under the guise of protecting us from terrorists protecting us from sleeper cells protecting us from attacks but they really are attacked protecting us from these attacks that's great but there's there's no provision in the Constitution that allows any of this and this is where it gets really squirrely because they're making up the rules as and then making up these rules is implicated in what has been a violation of didn't just put it on the internet and people criticize me for this they go I didn't share enough information because the journalists are gatekeeping fry they got a big archive and I haven't published everything from it and I told him not to publish everything why why did you do that why did you do that Brian you're getting some information about that useful agreed on a Russian general in charge about you know rocket division useful but there are lines and and degrees in that words not useful example is where you're spying on an individual person related well if you need for foreign intelligence is some indication you don't need a warrant strictly although I think they should have warrants for all because they established a quart Boris badenov of the rocket division right that that's okay they're going to go with that but then you look at the recent cases in the archives that are provided to journalists have been out where they spied on journalists right they spied on human rights groups and these kind of things since I came forward this foreign intelligence surveillance court that the government says authorized these programs 15 different times was overruled by the first open chords to look at the program these are federal courts hear right that's when you start looking at the facts they broke their own laws in a 2776 times in a single year and then you ask about that thing that motivates me like why I came forward we had been trying as a country before I came forward to prove the existence of these programs legally get the executive we got the legislature we got the Judiciary right so congress makes the laws that the courts are supposed to play referee executive all of these human rights groups in the non-governmental organizations had established that you know these programs are likely unlawful likely exist there simply classified but the government responded with this argument that you just saw saying that well it's a state secret if they do exist you the plaintiffs don't have a hard concrete evidence that they do exist and the governor saying legally you have no right to discover evidence from the government right documents demand documents of Mansfield covered as to whether things these forward as to whether or not these things exist because the government's just going to give its standard can't prove it because the government just want to play ball and the government says if we were doing this it would be legal and it would be necessary for National Security whatever the court and can't presume to know National Security better than the executive because the courts aren't elected review the legality of the programs the programs exist but the programs are classified so you can't stop existing unless you have evidence but providing that evidence to courts to journalists to anyone is a felony punishable by 10 years Espionage Act it's always the same law in this is There's no distinction to government between whether you sold information to a foreign government for private benefit right or whether you provide information only two journalists for the public interest I am fundamentally a harmful thing when you look at things that have come in the wake of this were talking about the post 2013 court rulings I found out what the government was doing with unlawful you see the courts saying actually that didn't leaks or are quotes leaks I can actually be beneficial leek is used in the government's in this universe is from a federal court he's not exactly my biggest supporters they're recognizing daylight text that is the only thing that allows the system to operate in a contacts where one year before I came forward we had the NSA saying this kind of stuff didn't happen we had hang on this famous Exchange whatever the one of those Senators I told you that have ejected to this stuff that was doing the last parts for all those years Ron Wyden in the United States I'm going to ask him very specific question about a program mind you the wrong one knows exists because he has security clearance he sits on the intelligence committee and he knows there's tens or hundreds of millions of Americans not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly so that was a lie organ of three months later but he said it was the least untruthful thing he could think of to say in the context of of being in the hot seat there but what does it mean for a democracy when you can lie under oath to Congress and the car's not even knows you're lying to them but they are afraid to correct you and widen by the way what am I surprised not even the press conference could just say this was incorrect whatever so he could go through the legal process and show his fellow congressmen that there was a problem and they need to do it for all of that was refused to us all of it was denying to us and here I am play with it it's like what are you going to do these guys are you know they're there bullshitters that the system is built on lies even many people many experts so who said this or lies but if you can't prove their lies how do you move beyond that and that's really question that has never been more relevant than I think it is today under the current White House even many people many experts so who said this know are lies but if you can't prove their lies how do you move beyond that and that's really question that has never been more relevant than I think it is today under the current White House</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so you're in this position will you have this information and you know that these surveillance systems are in place and they're unconstitutional and you feel this deep responsibility to let the American people know about this what what makes you take the leap so this is covered extensively in the book because it took a long time I would imagine people people exactly people like to think it's like a cinematic moment where I find this golden document my best seller wind report and that's the closest thing was smoking gun right that it exists but you can read that later look at that the question is what would it take for you to light a match and burn your life to the ground play Ron White on this when I saw people like the court case that I showed before with people would actively challenging these programs right there a lot of people who are going to be in and Bill Binney is part of fish always at the group of early NSA whistleblower that came with Thomas Drake and Bill Binney Kirk wiebe I believe in Ed Loomis Beetle made its alleged I want to put them on the spot maybe they deny maybe they don't leave that to them but somebody somewhere was informing this reporting right but got into the New York Times about the bush-era warrantless wiretapping program and eventually journals put this out there people knew these capabilities existed know with certainty that the stuff is capable or is it is possible to keep bill exist you can know the government has done this stuff in the past you can know they're likely to do it again you can have all these indications you can have like a juul vs. NSA case that's run by the FF which is about the 18 secret rooms Communications in Lake phone communication into a room that purpose built for the NSA and then they bring it out reporting and you actually know you can't prove it but you know this is going on but that's the thing in a democracy the distance between speculation and fact the distance between what you know and what you can prove to everybody else in the country he's everything you know model of government because what you know doesn't matter what matters is what we all know the only way we can prove it if you can prove it and of course when we talked about the earlier stuff right leg is sore no more corporatized media they got a thousand incentives not to get involved in this stuff they need access to the White House they need to sit down with them and they need to be taken seriously they need to be admitted it's rather and so the only way to make sure people understand this probably is if we all work together right if we collectively can establish a corpus of evidence write a body of facts that is so large and so persuasive it overcomes the natural and understandable overcomes the political and partisan sort of loyalties that that all of these are political factions in the country do where they go you know it's he's my president to even if I don't like this stuff even if I don't agree with this stuff I don't want to say it exists the opportunities that we have to prove this like that the moments in history where we do prove something anything beyond A Reasonable Doubt are so few and so rare that they almost always only come from whistleblowers and I think that's one of the problems that we have Obama when he was running for office and in his hope and change website Provisions to protect whistleblowers and Provisions to its reward people right that means you remember all that mean it was eventually redacted or eventually deleted it from the website unlawful activity did that you take a knee, also campaigned Obama also during his campaign said he campaigned actively against the warrantless wiretapping the book now he's sitting in that chair resin extinguishing these programs he Embraces them and expand action findings and things like that which are basically you know the intelligence Community wants to assassinate somebody they want to run this illegal program here there everywhere and they can't do it because their executive agencies without that top-level executive sign off what's a golf gearing up where is soon as they come in a hellish election because our electoral politics are so diseased and now after you crawled through fire you already thinking for years ahead you know how how do I stay in this seat and these guys are basically saying if you don't do X Y and Z this is going to fall on your lap and the application if you got the IC against you right they can Stonewall you they can put out the stories that are could be problematic for you but everyday your presidency send this kind of National Security foreign policy stuff throughout his earlier career he's more interested in domestic policy always has been that's the positive things to say about Barack Obama he's just trying to make things better at home and now suddenly they go look any of this or these terrible terrible terrible terrible programs right there in fact wonderful things because they keep back the darkness that's the real problem I ever present here so you know. Obama second-term president one of the responses that they had the mass surveillance the scandal with a yes we think they went a little too far this is after the initial thing where they when nobody's listening to your phone calls you know we were going to get to it when do these programs were problematic but if they just gave us more time we would have fixed them maybe it's true right thing seems awful convenient in hindsight than throughout the entirety the first time real and legitimate threats and they scare the hell out of them I'm sure and we can we can all imagine being there ride those those of us who remember what the world was like post 911 fear is a powerful thing but the guys who are doing that briefing they're no longer scared of it because they've been dealing with this for years is the oldest thing they give in this briefing times before the I didn't not that it's something much simpler the Deep state is simply the career government it's the people who are in the same offices who outlive and Outlast presidents is Ryan they've seen Republicans they've seen Democrats They Don't Really Care and they give that same briefing again and again I am so they give this very effective during juicing speech and then they followed up with their asks which are really demands just politely provided and anyone in that position who is not an expert on this stuff who is not ready for this sort of trade-off and who you have to understand is a career politician is entirely used to the horse trading game Ryan gone I'll deal with this later or not what are the mister cost-benefit here let me tell if you give us what we want no one will ever know about it because it's classified it's obviously the easy answer and maybe Barack Obama and honestly did want to get this later but we can say today is for all the good that where the president went through to full Obama and I honestly did want to get this later but we can say today is for all the good that may been done in that white house said this is an issue where the president went through two full terms and did not fix the problem but in fact made it worse</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> are you aware at all of the current state of surveillance and what if anything has changed since your Revelations hands around and to deal with it but now people are much less likely to use laptop and use a desktop than then you should know got any kind of wired phone then they already use a smartphone and both Apple and Android devices unfortunately are not especially good in protecting your privacy how to train from wearing in traffic right now I'm worried or youjo right now you can you get a phone somewhere in the room right the phone is turned off for at least the screen is turned off its sitting there and it is powered on and if somebody send you a message with rainbro blinks to life how does that happen anybody else's number and only their phone rings every smartphone every phone at all is constantly connected to the nearest Cellular Tower mom every phone even when the screen is off you think it's doing nothing you can't see it because it's screaming in the air high-end IMEI individual manufacturers subscriber identity I I could be wrong on though the break out there but the the acronyms are the IMEI and the imsi you can search thing for these things there to globally unique identifiers that only exist anywhere in the world it's always going to be the same and it's always going to be telling the phone network its disc physical handset is in your sim card right in this is what holds your phone number right is the right to use that phone number answer your phone is sitting there doing nothing you think alright I see Joe Rogan's phone right now I see Jamie's phone I I see all these phones that are here right now and it Compares notes with the other network towers and your smartphone Compares nose with them to go who do I hear the loudest and who you hear the loudest is a proxy for proximity for closeness distance right Lego whoever I hear more loudly than anybody else that's close to me so you're going to be bound to this cell phone tower and that cell phone towers going to make a note a permanent record saying this phone this phone handset with this phone number at this time was connected to me right and based on your phone handset and your phone number they can get your identity right because you pay for the stuff with your credit card overnight is still active you do on your nightstand when you're sleeping and still whatever the movements of your phone or the movements of you as a person and those are often quite uniquely identifying it goes to your home and goes to your workplace other people have it sorry this phone with this phone number in the world right now and to that cell phone tower that is closest to that phone it sends out a signal saying we have a call for you make your phone start ringing so you can answer it and then what this means the phone is turned on there is a record of your presence at that place that has been made and created by companies it does not need to be kept forever fact there's no good argument for it to be kept forever but these companies see that is invaluable information right this is the whole big data problem that we're running into an all this information that used to be ephemeral where were you when you were eight years old these things are saved it doesn't matter what they're doing anything wrong doesn't matter what even was ordinary person on Earth that sell bulk collection which is the government's euphemism for massive England's Works they simply collected all in advance and hopes that one day it will become useful and that was just talkin about how you connect to phone network right how do you get a text message notification how do you get an email notification how is it the Facebook knows where you're at you know all of these things these analytics they are trying to keep track GPS in the world right Yuri cable modem at home whether it's in your laptop every device that has a radio modem has a globally unique identifier in it and how does Google Street View cars that go back and forth right they're keeping notes on who's Wi-Fi is active on this block right and they building a giant that so even if you have GPS turned off right as long as you connect to Wi-Fi those for globally unique Wi-Fi access points from these points in physical space write the intersection in between the spreads the domes of all those wireless access point it's a proxy for location and it just goes on and on and we can talk about this for four more hours we don't have that kind of time single shutting your phone off that is a risk is how do you know your phone's actually turned off used to be when I was in Geneva for example working for the CIA we would all carry like drug dealer phones the old smartphones the old dumb phones are not smartphones and the reason why was just because they had removal sing about technology is if there's no electricity in it right if there's no gold juice available to it if there's no battery connected to it it's not sending anything because you have to get power from somewhere you have to have power in order to do work for the average person that doesn't apply Ryan I got to tell you guys they've been chasing me all over the place I don't worry about that stuff right because if they are applying that level of effort to me even for someone like me to keep that up on a constant basis also if they get me I only trust phones so much so there's only so much they can derive from the compromise of this is how operational security works that you're trying to mitigate and the mitigation that you're trying to do is what would be the loss what we would damage done to you if this stuff was exploited Mystic than worrying about these things that I called Voodoo hacks right with your like next level stuff and actually just shot up for those of your readers who are interested in this stuff on I wrote a paper on this specific problem how do you know when a phone is actually off how do you know when it's actually not fine when you with a brilliant brilliant guy name to Andrew bunnie Huang he's an MIT PhD and I think electrical engineering called the introspection engine was published in the Journal of open engineering you can find it online and it'll go as deep down in the weeds I promise you it is you while we take an iPhone 6 that this was back when I was barely knew I only modified it so we could actually not trusted device to report its own state but physically programs your primary threat is the fact that your phone is constantly squawking to the cell phone towers is doing all these things because we leave our phones and state that is constantly on your constantly connected right at airplane mode doesn't even turn off Wi-Fi really anymore just turns off the cellular modem but the whole idea is we need identify the problem and the central problem with smartphone use today is you have no idea what the hell it's doing the phone has a screen off you don't know what it's connected to you don't know how frequent is doing it apple and iOS unfortunately makes it impossible to see what kind of network connections are consoling mean on the device and two intermediate them I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now I don't want Google to build talk right now I just want my secure messenger app to be able to talk I just want my weather app to be able to talk but I just checked my weather and now I'm done with it so I don't want that to build and we need to be able to make these and Intelligent Decisions on not just a nap by a basis for the connection by connection basis right you want what say you use Facebook because you know for whatever judgment we have a lot of people might do it you want it to be able to connect two Facebook's content servers you want to build a message a friend you want to be able to download photograph or whatever but you don't Methodist modern your behavior right you don't want to talk all these third-party think because Facebook crams their garbage and almost every app that you download and you don't even know what's happening because you can't see this is the problem with the data collection used today is there is an industry that is built on keeping this in this pool what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our devices when there's a phone with her computer whatever more visible and standable to the average person and then give them control over it so like if you could see your phone right now and the very center of is a little green icons it's your pants at or it's a picture your face whatever and you see all these little Smoke's coming off of it that every app that your phone is talking to right now or every app that is active on your phone right now and all the hosts that have connecting to and you can see right now you just poked that out and if it's not on your Facebook anymore Facebook's not allowed to take food speaking privileges have been revoked you would do that do what I want but not spy on me disinfected actively interfere with it because they say it's a security risk and for my particular perspective and they actually aren't wrong there but it's not enough to go we have to block that came really off from people because we don't trust it would make the right decisions we think it's too complicated for people to do this we think there's too many connections be made well that is actually a confession of the problem right there if you think people can't understand it too much complexity in their it needs to be simplified just like the president can't control everything like that if you have to be to present of the phone and the phone is as complex as the United States government we have a problem guys this should be much more some processed it should be obvious and the fact that it's not and the fact that we read story after Story these things from your timeline not weirder influencing you were manipulating in all of these different ways that happens as a result of a single problem increasingly these corporations Own It increasingly these governments own it and increasingly we are living in a world where we do all the work right we pay all the taxes we pay all the costs but we owned less and less and nobody understands this better than the youngest Generations will it seems like our data became a commodity before we understood what it was it became this thing that's insanely valuable to Google and Facebook and all these social media platforms are we understood what we were giving up they were making billions of dollars and then once that money is being earned once everyone's accustomed to the situation it's very difficult to pull the reins back is very difficult to turn around yeah I know you're you're exactly correct and this is the subject of the book I mean this is this is the permanent record in this is where it came from this is how it came to exist the story of our lifetimes is how intentionally by Design number of Institutions both governmental and corporate not realize it was in their mutual interest to conceal their data collection activities to increase the breadth and depth of their sensor networks that were us or spread out through Society rumor back-in-the-day intelligence collection in the United States agent alligator clips well the desert somewhere they built a big parabolic collector and it's just listening to send light emissions right these satellite satellite links were owned by military bulk collection which should become one of the dirtiest phrases in the language if we have any kind of decency but we were intentionally this was intentionally concealed from us right to govern did it that use classification companies did it intentionally didn't talk about it they denied these things were going they they said you agreed to this and you did agree to nothing the service page up and you click that you click a button that said I agree because you were trying to open an account so you can talk to your friends you were trying to get driving directions you were trying to get an email account you weren't trying to agree to some 600-page legal form built illegal Paradigm that presumes records collected about us do not belong to us this is one of the core principles on which Mass surveillance from the government's perspective in the United States is legal how they're breaking flaw scandals that they don't have to break the law and the way they say they're not breaking the law is something called a third party Doctrine third party Doctrine is a legal principle and I believe the 1970s called Smith versus Maryland and Smith was this knucklehead who is harassing this lady making phone calls to her house would pick up you just don't know who sit there heavy breathing whatever like a classic creeper and terrifying this poor lady so she calls the cops and says one day I got one of these phone calls and then I see this car creeping past my house on the street and she got a license plate number so she goes to the cops and the cops again and they find out where this guy is and then they go with what phone number is registered to that house and then go to the phone company and they said can you give us this record the phone company says yeah sure and it's the guy the cops got there man so they go arrest this guy and then in court his lawyer brings all this stuff up and you did this without a warrant I mean I got the records without a warrant they just asked for the they subpoenaed it right some lower standard legal review and company gave it to him in jail and they could have got no more it's right it wasn't actually they weren't his records and so because they didn't belong to him he didn't have a 4th Amendment right to demand a warrant be issued for them they were the company's records and the company provided them voluntarily and has no warrant was required because you can get whatever you want without a warrant as long as it's yours and here's the problem the government extrapolated principle in a single case of a single real good reasons not suspect suspect was their guy and use that to go to a company and get records from them and establish a precedent of these records don't belong to the guy they belong the company and then they said well if one person doesn't have a fourth amendment interest in records held by company no one does the company then has absolute proprietary ownership seventies the internet hardly exists in these kind of contact smartphones you know don't exist modern society and they are still relying on this President about this perfect to go and so long as they do that companies are going to be extraordinary powerful and they're going to be externally abusive this is something that people don't get they go all well it's data collection right they're exploiting data about human lives you just being manipulated and this is this is this is something that I think a lot of people are beginning to understand the problem is the companies in the government's are still pretending they don't understand or disagreeing with this reminds me of something that one of my old friends John Perry Barlow one of my old friends John Perry Barlow who serve with me the freedom press foundation on the prison of the board used to say to me which is you can't awaken someone who's pretending to be asleep</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> talk about you like where you are right now in your life and how you're handling this because you've been in exile for how many years now it's been more than six years six years 2013 what is life like I mean I mean what it what are the issues like in the beginning Maya operational security level as we would call it was was very high I was concerned about being recognized was concerned about being followed I was concerned really about very bad things happening to me because the government made it very clear that from their position I was the most wanted man in the world they literally brought down the president of Bolivia his aircraft that it would not let it depart Liza try to cry piece of Europe not even the United States they wouldn't let it leave until they confirmed I was not on board I'm so nervous but you can't live like that forever and although I was as careful as I could be I still lived pretty happily but the in the years past my life has become more and more open you know now I like speak openly I live openly I go out I ride the Metro I go to restaurants I do you know how often then I can go about my life but it's one of the weird thing is that I'm recognized a couple times a year either one of them I'm not wearing my glasses in a museum or a grocery store or something like that or out on the street just by somebody who I swear like these people are already I can be like you wearing a hood and like a jacket can have a scarf around my face like the winter and it's like you can barely see my face and they'll come up to me they're like are you Snowden and I'm like woah I would much rather go unrecognized like I don't want to be a celebrity, but the other thing is I'll get recognized in computer stores and I think this just like a mental Association where people are like Aveda brain when it's cycling through phases that it recognizes its going through like the subset of nerdy or people or something like that when your computer Locust so you're living freely did you have to learn Russian did you learn it my my Russian is still pretty crappy to talk to my great shame because all of my life all of my work is if you could get a fair trial is is that feasible thing. Fair trial for someone like is that such a is that even possible question I mean we're being frank principal what happens to me is less important if I spend the rest of my life in jail that that's less important than what I'm actually requiring the government to agree to that which is a single thing right. right now going through a trial that is precisely similar to what I would be facing his lawyer is asking the court to or telling the court that we want to tell the jury why he did what he did that the government is violating laws we should be able to hear why he did what he did in the jury should be able to decide whether that was right or wrong and the government has responded you know to this whistleblower argument basically saying we Demand Court forbid this guy from breathing the word whistleblower in court and she cannot talk about what motivated because it doesn't matter people because that's what Fair trial is the Espionage Act the strict liability crime a strict liability crime is what the government worse than murder you if you murdered somebody like if you just I don't know beat Jamie with the microphone stand right now you would be able to go to the court and say it was self-defense right you felt threatened you were in danger. in fact acting in self-defense if they did in fact believe you they could take that into consideration and establishing their verdict find strict liability crimes forbid that the jury is not allowed to consider why you committed a crime they're only allowed to consider we're talkin about is telling the truth the Espionage Act in every case is a law of the government exclusively uses against people who told the truth right like that that's what it's about in the context of Journalism to the American people by where the journalist is it crime worse than murder and I believe and I think most Americans would agree this is fundamentally indefensibly wrong and so my whole argument but you have to agree whistleblower or not they have to consider the motivations of why someone did what they did the government says we refuse to allow that because that puts the government on trial and we don't trust the jury to consider those questions wow so you have had these conversations then so this has been dispatched they went we have no good argument against this and we will never permit this to happen and then again I just want to make clear this is not speculation this is not the me thinking this is actively happening the case of Daniel Hale right now I hope you guys can pull up graphic limbo then you're they're not actively pursuing you it seems that you if you're able to move around freely they they haven't discovered where you are you're just free to live your life you like what people are saying about Tulsi gabbard and things like that any kind of Association any anytime your name appears in the same sentence it is considered a negative thing now it's only Russian though and it's saying because I spoke favorably about a member of the Russian opposition Alexei navalny which I have a right to express their opposition in a country it's been a long time so born in Russia Administration side and they've just suddenly magically I've been accused of being foreign agents or something like that and so everyone connected to this which is like a big Civil Society body I had their doors like simultaneously kicked and across the country and they're being investigated footage of ballot stuffing in the Russian elections just like I criticized the Russian president by name I've criticized Russian surveillance laws so many things again again again again again entire book that has a lot of detail on this but yeah it's difficult to be basically engaged in civil opposition to policies of the United States consider those kind of conversations in the current world people believe and the sexual the worst things that the Western media does it in the context of discussing Russia is Big Freedia sore of invincibility around the Russian president they do you know this cat calling all the shots there's no question America's going to be interfering with Russian elections right nobody nobody likes to talk about this and I need to substantiate that now that I've said that I've signed a billion times the New York Times wake of you notice condesa 2016 election not where they look into the history of electoral interference in Russia and the Soviet Union and they found in roughly fifty years 36 different cases election interference by Russia or the Soviets friends not a new thing this something that always happens separate covert action from intelligence-gathering not but in that same study that they come 36 different cases by the Russians in the Soviets they found 81 different cases by the us and this was published by Scott chain in the New York Times and both the washing post as well people who are ordinary people who just want to have a happy life and just want to do better they want the same things that you do right and every time people who have nothing to do with the government feel implicated by that like do you feel like you're in charge of Donald Trump do you want to be have Donald Trump's Legacy around your neck and then people go all will you know Donald Trump you know you could overthrow Putin can you really like is that how it works so yeah I mean look I have no affiliation I have no love it's not my choice to be here and I made it very clear I would be happy to return home Mommy's going to be renewed every 3 years so yeah sure it's possible they could kick me out in this was with the story I was telling you about before rush media was they were saying you know the Russian government should take some action against me I should be welcome here I should go home because why is he criticizing the Russian government but the thing is this what's the alternative yes the Russian government could screw me to screw me even if I didn't say anything and so should I shut up and be quiet in the face of things that I think are in justices because it makes me safer do they say whatever be safe livelong be happy but I didn't come forward to be safe if I wanted to be safe and still be sitting in Hawaii making a hell of a lot of money to spy on all of you right and nobody ever would have known about this the system would have gotten worse but the system the world the future gets worse every day that we don't do something about every day that we stay silent about all the Injustice as we see the world worst thing yeah it's risky yeah it's uncomfortable but that's why we do it because if we don't no one else will all those years I was sitting hoping for someone else to come forward and no one did right that's cuz I was waiting for hero but there are no Heroes only her decisions you are never further than one difference . you can't all you have to do is lay down one brick all you have to do is make things a little bit better in a small way so that other people can lay their brick on top of that we're beside to end together step-by-step day-by-day it's the Iron Man I don't care if you're the biggest Doomsday prepper with pecans full beans not if the world ends it's going to affect you we make things better we become safe take gather right collectively that is our strength that is the power of civilization safe her you can be more careful when I you can be more clever and there's nothing wrong with that but at the end of the day you have to recognize if you're trying to eliminate all risks from your life what you're actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life you're trying to collapse the universe of outcomes such that what you lost his freedom because you were afraid actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life you you're trying to collapse the universe of outcomes such that what you lost his freedom you've lost the ability to act because you were afraid that's a beautiful mess that's a beautiful</div>

When when Trent when women transition to men and they want to be a man and compete with men they going to get f***** up in almost every sport protect like fighting what man has ever had a problem with women talking about there. No no I know but there is gender like stereotype toward being determined by biology and now we're using biology now we're using gender to determine biology as so biology determine gender stereotypes the male and a female whatever and there was a reaction to that and now is a reaction to it they're using gender to determine biology and how its get it yet gender to determine biology and how its get it yeah it's a broad spectrum of people and is low testosterone male since high testosterone female and that should be okay we should be allowed to be whatever the f*** we want</div>

from the east coast and then I graduate from high school Minnesota so to give you we just moved a lot until like 11 schools in 12 years so I started drinking really young I started smoking weed from the day that I found weed it was like normal you know my my upbringing was kind of chaotic and honestly I think that I owe you a debt of gratitude because I don't know that I could have been fully present for what was going on and in the house and and and not like killed myself or done something worse it was just too much for like a small developing brain to handle and we'd put enough of that nice like fuzzy distance between me and the like going to be me alone crying for that happening but I I do have to take responsibility for the fact that when you're a woman or girl in you're out getting blacked out and in this instance you're around people who are bad things happen that are not good is it sucks but you know if I had daughters I would be like watch your f****** drinks then like be careful and don't get don't try not to black out cuz you don't know what is going to go down cool that I know that have been drugged I know that the thing about that that's so weird to me while I don't I try to make light of everything I have to do in order to survive just be like I'm on top of it or you're like you're not you're the loser in the family and you drinking too obviously unfortunate enough to make sure that I don't come Fred just been nothingness of you know it being lunch like stuck in my subconscious I think I wrote a whole thing about it because I wrote this piece on medium Bill Cosby rape me kind of because we're not and like evaluate my own my own and just responds to that and writing is pretty much how I process everything it always has been and so I'm like I'm just going to write about this and see what comes to an essentially it was that internalized shame that had I had been holding onto was I was projecting it onto these women who work cuz if a bunch of girls from Minnesota came forward and said this lazy dude and you know drugged and raped us back 9840 so yeah I was like the 90s I would come forward and and support them and support of that if it was the person who did it to me I wouldn't be like him on late is it's a little late for this now but that was my kind of gut instinct I like I said I think it's internal shame I think I just I had not forgiven the girl in me the young girl me who blamed myself I didn't tell anyone when it happened I I woke up and I'm lucky I'm not dead I'm lucky I made it to get sober 6 years ago when I look at how my trajectory was and so I ended up my kind of coming to and the weird thing about roofies is that you don't really remember so I like thank the guy for having it you know it's like God thanks for letting us crash in this place I didn't even mean to crash at I think and then things started coming back and one of my friends I think so they having her too and and it's crazy and telling the story just based on what happened last week so I just went we went to like the Apple River which is misplaced Minnesota and just I got blackout drunk for like the next five days I couldn't I couldn't handle it I felt ashamed because I was drinking underage I had I was working in restaurant I had a lot of we're friends we were Downtown Minneapolis I felt super cool and my friend and I both have the exact last memory and then I have memories of like crawling around on the floor and trying to find a phone like just bad things and I always hesitate to tell them too cuz I know they're gay didn't you think you did that as a response to that really I mean I think I just was trying I was already running from so much there's already been my crazy I don't really publicly talk about it all that often but it was like whatever escalated my drug use I found hard drugs and like that I'd tried speed and math and I hated it cuz my brain already races I don't need any help with that I don't need stimulation for my brain I need a chi-o is wanted relief from this what yeah and smoking it and right before I quit so it once and then I was like I'm going to die essentially and he had a movie and we were just like it was like Sid and Nancy movie I was parent I was doing so much blow I had delusions of like at privacy in one and you're out here in 2010 basically and so somebody dared me to do it and The Comedy Store is where I pop my cherry and it was on like one of those bringer shows and it was an absolute shitshow like every f****** stereotype that you ever heard people are doing Blow The Green Room yeah you aren't around 2007 you got there in the darkest days in the darkest days were like 2070 2012 it was dark and then my set went okay enough that I decided I wanted to like do it again but that was many years after after the like trajectory so I ended up and Rehab at 19 and I was there for supper so you know I put myself in a halfway house but it was like it's like no it's not drags in like 2 minutes and so no I took a bus and put myself on general assistance in Minnesota that joke isn't Semana sober land of 10000 treatment centers it's like a great place to get sober and so I put myself on basically welfare and then I found a place and I'll never forget I called this place of the woman answered and she was like I was like hi and I had some guys try to do stuff to me so I'm looking for a woman's place and this one was like yeah but what's it like it's like you ever heard of bootcamp perfect I needed that structure I needed something and so they basically cuz I was on welfare they accepted me and it was like me and I was the only white girl I was by far the youngest it was it was basically a lot of women just who the judge said like go to this program for 3 months and you won't go to jail is nuts oh yeah I mean I realize what a privilege little spoiled brat I was that's for sure and then I never but I also hide behind that so I never wanted to share anything and they're like it's all relative everyone has their problems and the cab but these stories versus mine they're not I feel like I just had too much can I learn it was really an early lesson in like all this intersection of b******* it was very early lesson for me that like it doesn't matter it does not matter what color your skin is white like when you're an addict or when you're at rock bottom or we're all humans just like f***** up trying to get out of our own way and so that was that was an interesting experience and then I got in my car moved to LA does not matter what color your skin is white like when you're an addict or when you're at rock bottom or we're all humans just like f***** up trying to get out of our own way and so that was that was an interesting experience and then I

I don't know you know I don't know I've had some pretty profound psychedelic experiences that make me wonder what what thoughts are what would Consciousness is whether or not there's some way that it transcends what I want to do with brains and Brains Brains and we know brain damaged severely perturbs Consciousness but there's some interaction with certain chemicals and that makes this experience far different than what it is when we're certain chemicals and that makes this experience far different than what it is when we're on the match as we are right now</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when you look at human civilization and you go back to the origins of religion in you look towards the future do you envision a time where humanity is free of what you would consider a irrational belief systems or belief systems not based on fact I do I'm not telling you to come sooner that I do and I look forward to that time of course I think we're moving in the right direction than the figure is badass out in Even In America which is this is off the scale of of Western Civilization evening in in America the number of people who do not subscribe to a religion is is is dropping dramatically and the number who say they have no religion is not about 25% that's a lot Avenue Longview they have no no powerful a pressure group so politicians will go out there and suck out to the Irish Lobby the Polish. Lovett of Jewish law visit Catholic love etcetera for the atheist together to go out on The God Delusion was the willingness of people to vote for a gay candidate for president a black candidate for president woman candidate for president but then an atheist which is what I believe 40% they think they think that you've got to have a belief in some kind of higher power in order to be moral but the weird thing is that it doesn't have to be the same height as the one you believe in anyone will do as long as that as long as there is one but if you do you must be immoral horrible immorality of example the best Bible and the Koran with a bushel or riffic in the sense that if you believe you already got your morals you got your moral values from the Old Testament sacrifices B-17 devices and animal sacrifice all sorts of horrible things we do go on in Islamic countries especially gay people getting thrown off high buildings and women being beheaded for the crime of being seen with a mammal that husband that kind of thing so that that we could see what you get when you get your morality from an abrahamic scripture is there still people in this country who say you cannot be moral unless you believe in a higher power what do you think it lets extract these this concept of a higher power let's let's get rid of it that's let's get rid of where where do you think people get their morals and their ethics from that's a profound a difficult question we clearly don't get them from religion and yet we get them from somewhere and you can demonstrate that by the fact that the model use of any particular Century Immokalee differ from those of other centuries even decades so in the 21st century we here now have moral values which are really significantly different from a hundred years ago or two hundred years ago 308 progressed for example in the 19th century Abraham Lincoln Charles Darwin t h Huxley would have been on the liberal Progressive end of the spectrum and other people to be on the opposite end but even Abraham Lincoln for example made a speech reported in our growing God in which he said nobody was there I love my allowed to marry white people this is Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves run and was as I say in the Forefront of progressive sold Charles Darwin was in favor freeing the slaves you passing the anti-slavery but he too thought that there was no question about black people be the equal of white people they don't really want to sleep again bulldog other people were at the Forefront did I say today they would still be in the Forefront and they would be horrified to look back on what they said in the 19th century something is changing as the centuries go by I in audrain God I call it something in the air with your boss doesn't explain anything but what I mean by that is that is hovering in the air but it's a collection of conversations between people dinner party conversations parliamentary decisions Congressional debates judicial Decisions by judges jewelries newspaper articles journalism all these things together conspire together to produce something in the ass something that that defines ever given Century or maybe even a decade with the moral values of that of that decade then the knowledge base which is just so Superior today in in terms of what with the general public has access to in terms of what we understand about human beings it's just different than it was back then and it continues to be different and now with the internet we have so much more access to these conversations and it's not just about being a dinner table with the right people you can watch YouTube videos of myself debate flowers that Progressive something in the air has to take on the accelerated Pace because of the internet. So very hopeful sign kind of asymmetry there because inconsiderate it wasn't something that they thought was possible now they do because they can make up the internet I'm leave out a project with ncfi of downloading free of charge as PDFs several of my books including The God Delusion that will be out during God as well and these are being downloaded by large numbers of people the first PDF download of the Arabic edition of The God Delusion was downloaded 13 billion x Arabic Edition so no they are being exposed to the possibility of atheism with wasn't deposit Islamic propaganda but they had that hoe long from imams and schools what's a seal between exposing them to Islamic propaganda but they had that hoe long from Eminem's mother's and schools as well and I have great hope that the internet will Mark a turning point</div>

I'll leave my one of my close to the Afghans. Ali have been shot he he got killed and killed and I came around the stairs to get him and I was on my knee and this guy came up behind me and so he didn't have a weapon either he was so he did he had a weapon and I end up shooting him from the ground and I thought he was dead when he fell on the ground and I kind of moved down and got down with. because we are still getting shot at from this machine gun up on this hill and I was trying to make myself small as I could and this guy ends up coming up with choking me like I thought he was I thought he was dead and he ends up choking me out he starts trying to choke me out and eventually let up a little bit and I end up getting around him and I just got we were fighting back and forth and I can remember I was thinking about was like don't let his legs get on me like you and these guys are legs are uneven crawling up mountains or whole life and music dude and I just remember getting on top of them finally got on top of him and I. I was rolling on top of him he didn't have all the gear on I did and I made up my member getting on top of him like like I was straddling him and I'm just waking up trying to grab for anything I can I'm holding him and hold him down with my throat with my my forearm just grab anything I can it finally ended up grabbing a rock and I just started beating this dude's face in and I start beating and beating them beating I member I member psych finally like after hitting him you know I don't know 3/4 x 45 x whatever I remembered like finally just kind of looking at me and like just it's it's like he's like just I'm just looking in the eyes like obviously closer than me to you right now and you just see although you can tell like he knows where this is going and I always think about that you know obviously I would kill him a million times over again right he was dating me like I don't feel bad about that part of it but I just think about in that moment if I can find a way to relate to him in that moment a man I'm taking his life we all in America can find a way to connect with each other if we don't connect with each other because we choose not to I don't care what your differences are like don't like find a reason why we can get along not why we should not get along and I always think about that moment you know this guy in you know obviously end up dying and it would it showed me was is it no cause that you have that's built on hate will survive I didn't hate this guy didn't even know him but I was willing to to take his life because of what I loved he was so cool like f****** everybody like that guy and he still like to get high and go to strip clubs get high and go to strip clubs get high and ride around his boat I went to strip club with him under which one was Bob classy lady was called anymore but he had an appreciation for these young ladies that was like it was it was almost childlike but it wasn't creepy was like a beautiful look amazing this is incredible like he was having a good time it was it was a really really unique character I remember there was a guy who is some guy was blackmailing him and some guy filmed him at a strip club with his wife and his wife was getting a lap dance and he was getting a lap dance to and the guy was like he wrote some really creepy letter saying that this is going to violate the policies cuz add endorsements and Commercial deals and who's doing movies and stuff like that just blowing up. Ferrari know he's blowing up and this guy had went to his house and nail this VHS tape in an envelope to his garage door and I was with him on on a phone call so Cal II talk to him right now and come come come come in my room and the guy calls me Ron buddy you stalking the guy like the guy was his friend and they're setting the guy up and you know it was going to give him like I forget what the money was tens of thousands of dollars meet me at this place and I'll meet you there and he had these for lack of a better term he had someone who's a dangerous person meet this guy and let him know in no uncertain terms that is life is going to take a terrible turn for the worst if we continue down this path and but it was it was weird to say like someone trying to exploit him and the guy was so dummy actually met with Phil and field knew who the guy was like you eat besides face you know I was there with you on the couch light luck and I just need some money and feels like like I get it's no big deal just it's weird when you see someone trying to like crayons like they think that their way out because my way out of I get this guy to give me some money and I'm going to put it all together you get it felt I mean I just need some money he's like I get it buddy no big deal I was just playing this guy long until the dangerous men came and talked to him these vegans were set up in front of this I guess we get hamburgers get confrontational and violent with people who don't want to eat meat will they think somehow or another by blocking is burger stand that they're changing the world they're just trying to be activists you know they're trying to get a message out and most of them will quit their could quit veganism going to start eating meat again because their health yes that's the truth it's some ridiculous number Google this what number I think they said the number of vegans and vegetarians eat meat when they're drunk is something outrageous they close to 90% yeah how many how many vegans quitting and eating meat or have they ever done a study on that this is like a big thing cuz you know there's been a movement sort of a movement and people have different success rates with being a vegan but Cam Newton who's the quarterback of the Carolina Panthers big dude 662 5260 he went vegan and he cannot get healthy he cannot he's been injured he's I mean the face of the franchise probably a hundred million dollar contract I mean made it to the Superbowl but since just been on a decline and it's like almost hand-in-hand with the changing to vegan what you know that guy dr. Shawn Baker he's adequate it's an indoctrination movie and it's also it's extremely biased and it's not focusing on all of the various problems that people have it's only focused on the positive aspects of it and distorting the reality of those positive right is the strong man who's on a fuckload of steroids to get that get that part and then all these other he's like everybody's the same s*** he's like meat and rice like they meet at all those strong men eat the same thing the real strong than the ones that actually win the competition's what are you got Jamie it's very controversial research that I came out but it's very repeated number of 84% of vegans and vegetarians end up going back to eating meat ups at some level right before they die play the same to do real strong man they want to actually win the competition's what he got Jamie it's very controversial research that I came out but it's very repeated number of 84% of vegans and vegetarians end up going back to eating meat at some level right before they die</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> show the Western Hunter with the nickname scan documents on the show all the time is the grind of public land hunting he's always getting he's always running at the guys on Horseback that run off the Animals still find guys the wall tent f*** like he's a great hunter he's the very first person to fill me in the wilderness. Wow it was as like I had never he wanted hunter Wilderness had never done it he knew I'd done it actually maybe wish a man who fell at first but then I can remember maybe they was first they are both right around 2002 but Nate I saw him at the bow rack and he's like man I've always want to have to Wilderness and I'm like well do you want to feel me yeah I'd love to so he didn't know how to run a camera but he hit his sister was getting married on a Friday opening day was Saturday I said go to the wedding you drive to the trailhead after the reception you get to the trailhead at 1 in the morning you walk all night 12 miles you can be in there by first light opening day and I'll tell you where to go and it's like on these maps and all the you know I thought there's no way this kids ever going to make it so this was how many 17 years ago he's not old now so 17 years ago and I got up opening morning and I went up to the saddle way deep in the wilderness and I'm like looking right old Nate to come from first light comes and I look over there and here's this guy walk in and it's him and he made it all the way in there Drove all night packing all in the dark made it in there and fill me it took day6 day6 I killed a buck he filmed the great job they 7 I killed a bowl and he that was his first ever with a camera whatever time he's doing Western Hunter just amazing work but one of the best shows that did it hit really depicts he honey gets it yes he gets it and he gets the the grind if you said and the emotion tied to it and I think his first bowl with the bow is when he's 13 wow and always ever done is Belmont his whole life so that he's one of the most I mean I respect him as much as anybody he's just and I was just I saw set can years ago he had it he had a thin and he wanted to learn and he wanted to experience it and then he's went from there to making one best shows on TV great lesson in that that there's the opportunity it's not easy you're going to a wedding at 1 in the morning you're going to have to hike in. It's a 12-mile hike it should take you about five or six hours but if you want to do it a lot of people like you know that night Saturday night no I said I need you there open the morning that's a giant part of life is those opportunities capitalizing on those opportunities cuz a person could easily have blown that off and we have another time hold on the capitalizing on those opportunities and making it happen and then you keep going that's the whole thing is like these uncomfortable moments pushing through them having discipline and drive getting it done when you don't want to and then you go I know how to do that I can do that through this I can get through it and then that's how you build in life you just step by step by step you keep doing it and that's when when that happens when this happen to me in my life where I decided to by step you keep doing it and that's when will not happen to me that's happened to me in my life where I decided to do something and it was really difficult when I got through it I can do it I can push through things I guess things happen such an important lesson and he's probably one of the most important lessons</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you ran more than you bargained but that was that was far I mean I asked the guys there said hey how far is it if I go from here to here and there like 7 miles now is like 15 it was a grind and humid oh my God that's how it works yeah it was yeah you know when I was when I first started I mean I was okay and high school you know cuz I did all the sports then we do maybe a 10K during the summer so but then after high school then I was just like I thought it was really cool I could buy beer so it's like 21 I'd swing by Riverview Market on the way home and buy a six pack of tall boys and you know I thought that was cool I can pound some and I might go I'm a stud now and then I started you know to get fat and I'm like I didn't nobody cared who was like I didn't have I wasn't living up to expectations I actually looking down to expectations and so I went through a phase there where I was just like not healthy I was still hunting but no real sense of I don't I didn't have I wasn't account for anything or anybody didn't have any high expectations so Mike whatever and I remember I am I signed up for the Butte to Butte 10K and I got there to 5th Street Public Market about 5 miles ahead another mile left and I quit this sucks and so that was a thing from there I'm like nobody feels good you know you don't feel good when you're not in that so I'm it was a slow grind but I got to where I just kept doing more more more than I did my first marathon like in 2002 when you quit the next day how shity did you feel I felt shity all the time so it wasn't like I mean it wasn't you know I was living with 4 guys and we just drink beer all the time and you know remember this one guy got DUI DUIs in 3 weeks I think both in my truck please I wasn't right I would never dry you know me I never got caught but it was just like just stupid so is just like another disappointment it wasn't didn't stand out cuz it was just there was no success no no it was just everything going just like that's where my life was so it's just like what changed something must have changed cuz now you're running 240 miles probably the most successful bowhunter on the planet Earth I mean that's that's a giant mean you have 800,000 Instagram followers something f****** changed like what you mean how did it go from you being this guy who quit after 5 miles and you drink a beer all the time and you hanging out with a bunch of ner do Wells millions of people how does what's the shift I think having kids you know so I got married and then Canter was born in 93 and then a psych man it's not cool being a loser dad not that it's one thing being a loser being a loser dad now I'm affecting other people's lives and so I'm like I thought I got a I got to be an example you know I got it I want my kids every parent wants our kids to to have more than they had and have the better life than they had and so you know my dad wasn't around and you know I always remember wanting him around and just you know wanting to see him so I'm like maybe that and then it was I think I wanted my kids I wanted to challenge them so I remember my first marathon I also made Tanner he was 7 and yes is 2002 I think earlier would have been no I'm not ya anyway he was young I think you just turned eight actually and I made him to the half-marathon so I ran the marathon he did the half marathon at 8 at 8 she's good good got like 202 which is a good half marathon for especially for an eight-year-old so then I started in introducing my kids to these challenges cuz I'm like you know I remember my life growing up and it wasn't comfortable but not not a positive way and I'm like well I think these kids if they don't have challenges introduced they're going to be soft and have it too easy so I would you know that's why they've they've run marathons and they've done these things because that's kind of how they grew up so I think it was kind of a combination of being a parent wanting my kids to to have acid Towpath and then just saying I don't want to be a loser dad so just kind of evolved from their true it run a hundred miles with you ran over to get to 80-85 my this past summer and yolk is running a hundred miles and 24 hours is that's something I mean I can never do that at that he's 22 I think there's no way I could have done that then I mean it takes mental usually don't have that mental strength until you're older you've been through life and you've been beat down and disappointed and had your heartbroken that's when you get like hey this pain is a temper this it for one day I can get through anything for a day but when you're 22 is flash point of reference baby the whole time but to run a hundred miles of 24 hours is you can tell that to anybody going to be like God dang congratulations you know so he wanted to do that that was his goal so I said all right I go if you get to 60 miles and 12 hours you can grind out 40 in a second 12 and I said that would be good so he got to 60 miles and 12 hours on on Pace everything was good and it just to paint like he got 31 miles maybe almost 31 I think it's 90 point something just you know he ended up taking trying to take a couple naps was in the truck for a while and I remember I'd do I so what are we doing I'd go by the truck cuz I never stopped 1.1 mile Loop oh my God that's all I'd come by and I'll be I give him a little bit little while right to chill out and within a bit what are we doing here and whatever for whatever reason he got 90 which is still 90 miles is a long-ass way so long I mean I I am how I am so I might I go cash you could have got 10 more miles 10 more miles and you would have been in a hundred mile club cuz I got this little wood chip just like the it's like the smallest little token you can get it's not even like Goggins coin right here but it's half the size as a wood chip and it says 100 miles and so I'd like we said it's like God. The worst part about that is to get those last 10 you got to get the first 90 and now her right I think he's going to get his big goal was to get a hundred miles and 24 hour 24 hours and she didn't get and then also qualify for Boston what she did so I think we're going to Austin for his age age group he had to run 3 hours in a marathon so he ran the Eugene Marathon a257 wow so he qualified that's amazing yeah 44 that's fast miles for 26 that's f****** fast yeah I said yes now he ran that would have been that's like 644 that's fast miles for 26 that's f****** fast yeah yeah</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you eat too many comments so I'm saying I think you recently I think you do you mention commas before to the top and the other day and it said I always will what it looks like what it would look like if Cameron Hanes and Joe Rogan had a baby and we almost found out that was a good one every once in awhile you get a gym I'm let off the hook a little bit cuz it's not like I'm making a post call somebody but I can say in a comment and it kind of sneaks through but why do you want to or just be funny you're so busy that I don't understand how do you have the time or full-time job mean it's normal that you run a marathon in a day so how the f*** do you have the time to be commenting I don't know I'll feel like waiting out here right now on the plane I don't know the times of boredom I guess topsmarkets Eric Weinstein was making it an argument that you probably should read some of them that there's like and you know he's a genius he was saying like I'm going to be cut off completely from from feedback so you have to find that sweet spot between reading some and yeah I feel like other people read them I'll get them to me the good ones people share with you go back and forth they just argue all the time or sometimes or I mean like I posted a couple times yesterday and I don't think I don't think I read any till maybe this morning you know we're just so it's like I don't post and then just like totally check them every second you know refresh refresh but 417 the 198 but there's also going to be like that you're just like oh my God this is how impactful is it affects your life you provide inspiration know we were talking yesterday when I had to go to Meijer on we were talking about Goggins and Jocko and you do the same thing it's like you provide something where people they could they could see you working hard and see you smiling and and getting after it and it makes people want to do things and when they know that you doing these Hundred Mile races and I was crazy s*** that you do they dig it gives them like this just enough of a push to get off the couch and get going and sometimes that's awesome Annie change your whole life you need a day a good day a good day when you get moving and you get your legs pump in and you you know you get huffing and puffing and get your heart rate up if you sweat and then afterwards you feel great and go okay tomorrow I'm going to do it again then and then next thing you know you got 15 days in a row and the next thing you know you down 10 lb lifemoves smoother it's yeah I mean as it builds up momentum in it you know the Journey of a Thousand Miles begins with one step in that one step is one day or maybe the first first step on up your first run but you know I see that all the time too because I genuinely enjoy working hard and so I am smiling and and it's like people say okay enough's enough I'm going to have been watching you for whatever I'm going to do it and so it's like I don't know if you beat them into submission finally but whatever the case is whatever for whatever reason people get out there they do and then it starts that Journey like like you said towards a different life essentially about accidentally influencing dudes when I apologize the girlfriends but there is a certain amount of responsibility that you have to assume the one that starts happening when you do have a pause impact on people you realize like hey you know this this show having people like you and Jocko and Andy Stumpf and all kinds of interesting fast any people on directly influences people's lives for the better and changes the way they view things for the better give them a positive outlook and it also gives them an opportunity to hear from people the way people think that maybe they said they would never get to meet these people in real life right they would never get to know these people if they feel like they do you you know that's one thing I love about Jocko to is you know just the shot of his watch everyday I mean you know he's up at 4:30 and he's getting it done no excuses none ya and he's done and that's I think that accountability is probably accountability for him but also it's like the people know okay this is what we need to expect of ourselves missing the point at that's a new picture yeah the new picture every goddamn day of a new day with his f****** watch getting up and getting after and then afterwards is a puddle of sweat in the ground and man people ask so how is Jocko and I'm like exactly like what you do what he says and how he play some self and he's like you know they had that day they were expecting a long day of of blood trailing or discover miles in the mountains and he's like he couldn't wait was looking forward to it couldn't wait three plates of Meatloaf but he said remember this specifically he said what sucks is when it doesn't suck he wants the challenge but he said and I remember this specifically he said what sucks is when it doesn't suck he wants to challenge if something without a challenges like what's the point yeah he's turned his mind into this like challenge seeking missile yeah yeah</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> GQ thing you did today it was just so they had me breaking down like archery and movies so I did Hunger Games may feel my reaction and him got me like talking about if it's realistic so I did Jeremy Renner I did Robert De Niro he was in God's some terrible movie and I don't even think you I was kind of surprised he's actually with the bow in the movie what movie was that movie with him and John Travolta yes yes and they had a fight John Travolta played a Russian yeah and he shot John Travolta shot an arrow at him so Robert De Niro is in a treestand John Travolta shot and it stuck in the tree Robert De Niro jump fell out of the tree and broke his bow it's a been he who I started crawling towards John Travolta anyway they had me Robert De Niro actually had a pretty good anchor I mean he looked pretty good with the boat really had a whisker biscuit on there which wasn't good for the rest but he was going to shoot this bull like this five point bull came out and he couldn't do it he like I don't know what happened he like had he hesitated then I felt bad something like that I don't know what how do you have it Killing Season it's pretty intense he had a compound bow but he he jumped out and broke that bow so I I did that one how dumb was the movie is terrible apparently the new Rambo is unbelievably bad yeah we did Rambo 2 cuz I said I go we have to do Rambo I want to talk about when he remember we had the exploding chip and shot the guy that was awesome atrocious I'm sure Killing Season 2 what is it going to Rotten Tomatoes Rotten Tomatoes wine I want to see a 3 what is it get please tell me it's like 13 that's that's pretty high yeah it looks like an arrow I think I don't know want to hear voice what's up with your boy has very few movies that depict bowhunting correctly yeah I didn't see any Russian stop that right now I am not I cannot I can't do this no no no no the best form I saw Annie the movie that I that I reviewed form today was I think it's called Brave it was an animated movie red headed girl show where someone bowhunts correctly I mean is there one movie when she so yeah but you'll see her she steps up that innocent, it's a confidence confidence confidence so you know she's going to put put on the ax watches watch his confidence in the attitude see that she's pretty bossy my kids did not like this movie they watch it for some reason weird movie she needs her dress is too tight see that back son on the move this last one downtown. Look at this form and this is with a Broadhead with distraction she's so focused the feather cut her face a little for some reason I like of the arrows I know I'm like a real Arrow I know but watch this do that, that's so that's what I say to all the ones that I reviewed today. The best that's the best for her release that follow through was excellent very sweet but there's no movie where bowhunting accurately depicted I know movie now I'm thinking I'm trying to think of a movie that even involves bowhunting Play Once Upon people member yeah Burt Reynolds Reynolds I wanted to do that but they didn't have that today they had Walking Dead they had that I listen to call that a bow that's a shity gun that's what I said I said I do I'm not down with the Cross by bad and you got a rotten rotten corpse head and stopping a narrow not a pass-through scuse me I think he might have been Secret Service protecting the president either way the plane crashes or something in the ends up with a kid to learn how to bow hunt to survive I would really go stop stop that before I get brain damage yeah I know you would think that they would be a way to make a movie that involves bowhunting no be interesting you think so good pool movies is that your Hustler Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason and then the color of money with Paul Newman and Tom Cruise pool exploded the 1960s when the Hustler came out of exploded good and then with The Hunger Games apparently a lot of people get into archery because of Jennifer Lawrence we got a beautiful woman on the bow that's what I said what was good with her was she could go from having the bow to grab in an arrow to put it on the string to shooting in like half a second. Easy to do some serious training just to be able to pull that off on film yeah I think she and I think she shot a Hoyt and I think she took lessons from a Hook shooter and same thing with even Rambo's old bow I believe as well wait that's hilarious I know but yeah he he had the exploding tip and the guy the bad guy was shooting ran out of bullets with a gun through down pulled his pistol out and a shooting around on Rambo just stood up there this like you're not going to hit me but it's that did get a lot of people involved and get girls yeah yeah yeah young girls apparently Geena Davis has a big-time archers who loves ya O'Reilly this year did he yeah you know that it's a really big ass Bowl training as a single movie where someone goes bow hunting like you addicted. That could be mean that could be a good movies that use Davis turn off the Olympic team OSHA Olympic recurve but you didn't find any of their super legitly reform everything they are such good Shooters it's amazing how good they get ya with tabs mean it's crazy like Yuri shooting off your fingers and shooting really accurately is she still doing it what the context was a couple years old gun too so just get to see I know I want to see it yeah I mean she obviously has got to have a lot of training the way she executes that it seems cuz like you know when you see Keanu Reeves in John Wick that guy's shooting 100%</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> juicy the Phil Hartman documentary that was interesting I didn't know a lot of it they really really you're in a little bit I didn't know a lot of things when they didn't know is how they gave you a part in the show where it was supposed to be Phyllis character writing you or something like that like a will or something and they gave it to each person of the cast and they didn't let you read it beforehand so that when you're reading it in the show it was actually your first time reading like this letter that was supposed to be from Phil and I didn't know that it was amazing that was one of the weirdest moments my life you know I'm getting phone calls he's dead the phone just kept ringing people just kept calling and friends and loved ones of family members and it was just it didn't seem more real like who would kill that guy he was the nicest guy I wish you would met him he was so cool everybody liked that guy and he still like to get high and go to strip clubs and go to strip clubs get high and riding around his boat I went to strip club with him he had an appreciation for these young ladies that was like it was almost childlike but it wasn't creepy was like a beautiful you look at McClure's High look amazing this is incredible a good time it was it was a really really unique character I remember there was a guy who was some guy was blackmailing him and some guy filmed him at a strip club with his wife and his wife was getting and he was getting a lap dance to and the guy was like he wrote some really creepy letter saying that this is going to violate the policies cuz you don't feel it had endorsements and Commercial deals and who's doing movies and stuff like that it just blowing up. Ferrari know he's blowing up and this guy had went to his house and nail this VHS tape in an envelope to his garage door and I was with him on a phone call so I can talk to him right now I'm come come come come in my room so I went in his dressing room and the guy calls Melody hey what's going on buddy and their set the guy up and you know it was going to give him like I forget what the money was tens of thousands of dollars meet me at this place and I'll meet you there and he had these from lack of a better term he had someone who's a dangerous meet this guy and let him know in no uncertain terms that is life is going to take a terrible turn for the worst that we continue down this path and but it was it was weird to see like someone trying to exploit him and the guy was so dummy actually met with Phil Phil knew who the guy was like you eat you saw its face you know it was there with her and I just need some money and feels like it's weird when you see someone trying to like prey on like they think that's their way out because my way out I'm just going to get this guy to give me some money and I'm going to put it all together you get it felt I mean I just need some money he's like I get it buddy no big deal I was just playing this guy long until the dangerous men came and talked to him when I know they also really focused a lot on the wife which I didn't really know much about about the house she wanted to be an actress also in like she trying to get filter like put her into shows and do them that you do and stuff like that and she was very was up pull them to the insulting like insulting publicly like it was just really gross of sad that he didn't think you should get divorced because he felt like it was bad for his image he was like really concerned about his image cuz he was like the squeaky-clean family guy who was you know I mean it was really starting to take off for him really make it until he was older in life like I don't think he was I don't think John Saturday Night Live until he was in his late 30s MyVanilla than that when he was on news radio I think he was like 46 yeah so he was like he had worked as a graphic artist you know he that album cover that's him he's a super versatile guy he could do a lot of different things and his work ethic was amazing they would have a binder and his scenes he would have different color tabs for each scene and he would go over his notes and go over his lines like I've never seen anybody do if like none of us did not know the rest of us did like the only one who's like Stephen Root was even more different than him cuz Stephen Root was a character like you play Jimmy Jazz and he in real life is like the sweetest most normal guy but when he was playing that character like he would become this Jimmy James guy but it was spooky like you've seen him in a milli like what is the movie The Ballad of Buster Scruggs what is it called Buster Scruggs what is it called it's really good but it's like all right just weird you know but but Steven Rosen it's amazing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> play on the new on iPhone something I didn't notice that you were getting close to is that they added in the health app your headphone audio levels so it tracks how loud your listening to stuff over time and it tells you when you're in a good or bad audio listening rain like if you're listening to ship too loud and started damage your hearing so this then gets into the Apple watch so if your environment like it's too loud you're audio hell I give you warnings also cuz one thing I've been doing lately at The Comedy Store when you know the back back back place where you smoke the weed you can download a audio meter that tells you how loud it is and so I've been down I download a long time ago it is so bad back there when there's a lot of people back there that it's like emergency get out of that area are bad for your eyes or ears weigh High allowing them to listen to all these microphones you're just giving them access to listen to you everywhere. fire LA area because the way that they linked to each other and there's like some like Watchdog people are saying that like even if you're smart enough to like not do this the person next to you might not be or your neighbor might not be they might have it on and just because your proximity is close enough your iPhone knows that your iPhone's next to it it just goes yeah yeah you were here is there cameras in net camera Nest cameras of people having the front doors after wild everywhere you go you going to be filmed to pass the law thing today that the California like body cameras that cops use can't be used for face recognition at the ACLU got a law passed through that stuff like that won't be able to happen or something like that a lot more people yeah but that think what's happening right now that I've been reading is like third-party companies are getting access to that stuff and like they can buy it and that's where some of the discrepancy cuz it's just happening too fast there are laws in place to stop some of the things from happening I think it's just there's lots of great area that can people can maneuver in it seems to be a people just a matter of time before you have surveillance everywhere everywhere you go everywhere everything is available to everyone except inside your house like people going to tin foil up the inside of their bedrooms just to try to keep people out and then you have the f****** television the probably as a webcam on it you know what's going on in your house and even contractors who work for Alexa and an apple pods and all that s*** was I think Apple's one is it is is that apple as well because apples pretty damn strict on privacy which is kind of interesting it's one of the reasons why Apple Maps is not very good because they don't collect data on everybody the way Google does like did the benefit of the Google map of the Google data collection as you get like really detailed analytics on everything and so they know exactly what's going to try something like Waze work so well because there's so many different people giving up information you know that's mean it shows you for the slowdowns are and where the cops are and you know it's it's there's benefits to it it's super effective but the drawbacks are you're going down this weird Road where these companies are selling your information and that's what would Google is is a company that provides you date other provide you information but they're also selling your data they're constantly selling what you're interested in like if you ever went like say like you're interested in the watch f****** time you go to any website now those Google ads will be a watch weird like their there they're just tempting you like him on Jamie I was listening to a podcast about the beginning of the history of the Internet it's called X-Men cast this was a couple months ago but he was talking about how I can arpanet was starting up in the sixties but a lot of protests about just even turning it on because people were knew that was going to do surveillance system like sort of like what is happening now really and the ability it doesn't work if people aren't using it kinda like it needs to spread and get a tick grow and personal Computing started like tight end and that came along their perfect time for this like grow more like phones or even the next the next evolution of it now but doesn't it make life better Mina's pros and cons right in the cons were all terrified of but isn't it amazing that you can just Google things in the movie and my wife is just Googling it's like nope nope nope nope like crazy is that you just find out like in a movie but how many goddamn movies are there you just type in something in quotes and it'll say oh that's from The Shining and then bam the lyrics for every song on every song every song it's just the the pros I think at least right now outweigh the cons it's just we all wonder where it's going that's what's up what's Gary's the unknown you know scary is unknown surveillance State aspect of it all you know it's just it's better though it's like makes your life better he's like his take on it was but people's lives are improved because of this technology and that this is you know they look yes people do get addicted to be on the screens but one of the reasons why is because it's it seems better to them than not being on the screens like there's benefits it's making their life more enjoyable but you're looking at it that way but that's convenient when you're in technology to look at it that way the people that look at it like in terms of like beings and our connection with each other like how much of his how much of it as getting a row did because so much mean how much how many times do you and I and once we see each other at the store how many times we talk on the phone like I called you up the other day we go out at night we see each other we all see our friends you know we talked like there's a lot of folks who don't do that they see each other at work during the day and then at night time there was sitting at home watching TV or staring at their phone and their interactions severely limited like our business is a social business like we're always out you know we're always out and about and talking to people and interacting with people but I think some folks today because of this technology there socially a bit stunned can severely limited like our business is a social business like we're always out you know we're always out and about and talking to people and interacting with people but I think some folks today because of this technology there socially a bit stunted and that's what I worry about</div>

That's hard to do the opposite like I'm just like that's what it is it's people don't like being told to do they don't like being forced into something that they don't enjoy that's you know that's why schools ineffective that's why so many things don't work but the keto thing the problem with it is I think it's a healthy thing for a lot of folks if you have epilepsy apparently it's the thing because it can stop your seizures knows people that have epilepsy they they get ketogenic and it just kicks kicks it off if you don't you don't get seizures anymore but it's boring I don't know and then I want pasta and also fruit I like fruit that was the biggest one for me just fruit like watermelon you know how great it just having some watermelon in the morning is you know it's the most delicious food ever I think good perfect watermelon on a hot day my God is amazing the only fruit to detach the racism there's no other fruit where you can make fun of someone for eating and it's like racist if you had that durian yeah I said it's good it's not bad it's not my favorite but I tried it but God damn it smells like dogshit it smells so bad that they ban in a lot of hotels because people will go into hotels and you know like folks that they come from a culture where they eat that stuff all the time don't bring bags of it the whole family is eating that stuff and it walks down the hallway of people like what in the f*** cuz it smells like Limburger for a has been compared to Limburger it's weird but taste good like I did that fasting diet you know that the one that wants where you only eat like a small part of the day and found out on Nest cam security cameras he goes into the bathroom passes in like not fall down and hit his head and he should a picture is just blood everywhere in his bathroom goes back to bed didn't even know about it wakes up in the Seas blood everywhere I checked his cameras finally sleepwalking couple days later you start having seizures bike bike out of the blue go to the doctor doctor says it's because of that that died he was doing his brain was starving that's what that doctor said body trying to find sugar cuz I never sleep walk cuz I have cameras in my living room and yeah I know it's kind of weird but I slept like maybe 10 times since I've been off haven't slept walk once and you say slept boss I don't think I've ever heard anybody say it past tense if you can't pass the first part of the compound word I was a weird one slept I slept well last night but I slept walked I'm sleepwalking how long will you keep it for 7 months you know he wants the intermittent fasting is a good move because I think most of the time look for me I eat when I'm bored I do it all the time like when I come home from the store and I'm riding I just started eating and I'm like what am I doing because I try to do intermittent fasting so that means if I come home it's midnight I'm riding and I start eating it means I can't eat until 2 in the afternoon the next day and then just don't wake up till 10 have kids I will have responsibilities I'm not I'm not a like a Peter Pan like you I think that would be the diet that makes the most sense but because I already seem to only eat once a day but that's not healthy though it's not a strategy before I'm like you keep saying you can't lose what you like I know what I'm doing I'm going to get really big because I always forget to take the before photo now it's like yeah but you didn't look that bad before you died I got a big fat beard on just this. It looks like I gained 20 lb had to shave the beard at the end it sort of like when people get a tan and they're after photos and they look more ripped before after like 2 after you just hand bro</div>

John McAfee guy halfway trolling people it's hard to tell what he's doing like what what he's doing seems to be like almost like a sum of its very theatrical remember when we interviewed him when he was on the Run we interviewed him remotely when he was on the run for murder and he was saying that it was all nonsense and I was asking him about math like how much Matthews a you really smoking meth like I read an article that showed that you had a meth lab that you've in your backyard is like without that was all fiction is like that was a prank I was trolling people I believe that you think so yeah I know does a f****** antivirus Mogul you know I mean death McAfee McAfee Antivirus who's the who's like Norton and McAfee those are the two big names in antivirus won't accept it right now great move you think you never see yourself doing that hell yeah you can podcast from anion somewhere as soon as that's possible being hologram hologram style anywhere that's wouldn't like it if you could have you somebody on as a guest has a podcast button hologram form will listen if we decided to set up a studio like on an island somewhere and do the podcast from an island somewhere and we have to fly some guests in right like save there's a few of us we just talk s*** about the news all the things are going down the Trump impeachment this now we all did it form an ion somewhere and occasionally fly people in safety do it in on Lanai right you got everybody flies in the Four Seasons stay the nice place has to be somewhere where there's no do you think you still allow you to stop talking about the fact that guy I mean out of all the things that I'm sure about that I don't know and this is one that I'm most sure I'm most sure they murdered that guy he knew so much from so many different people and all the things that went wrong even Michael Shermer who is like a professional skeptic anyting he found out that the cameras were broken and then they did they weren't working on the day the guy got off he's like oh maybe this is a conspiracy Island 26 x he flew with Epstein Island but he flew on Epstein's jet 26 different time to Hell. Chapo there for quite a quite a long time and nothing happened to him I heard they whacked. Guy the most hilarious thing is his cellmate ones that know his cellmate was a f****** Gorila like the biggest guy you could ever imagine being yourself I think I looked like like if you would have a movie about the worst possible cellmate you could ever have it would be this guy he's a former cop of former cop built like a brick shithouse I mean he's enormous but when you look at the size of them you like come on man that's really his helmet look like dude was his cellmate and was he there when he got offed no it wasn't the first time that he committed suicide that's built like a brick shithouse to put him in there with him he got some wet cocaine he's transferred out the eve of a suicide Vincent in and had the doctor picture with clay mask while at the in and out and Studio City like what would they put that out disappeared made the news doctor Photoshop for some reason high-profile cases out of all of them that's got to be the most strange right this guy has an island on the island he has a building that's colored in the the mate it's painted in the colors of the Israeli flag I think is a Mossad agent he's some sort of intelligence agent the report that said that he was released earlier is giving a sweet deal because he was intelligent that's not been verified right right there from one article that Vanity Fair thing price on them that got repeated a lot but I don't know that I don't know of anywhere other than that right the whole thing so hard and fast you can't keep up with it this was his drone there's someone flying a drone over his island ever get to pay stop three weeks ago for the like almost every day there was updated Drone footage for some reason I don't know how this person was getting at their boat he paid someone something like $50,000 extra to have a cement truck delivered there a couple months before he got arrested cement truck shipped out to his Island and they think they had some chick I buried in that tunnel or something I don't know so they've been like that they have footage on this island pre-raid and post rate of the FBI making it there just like a worker from the islands just going to be so many stories about this but we're never going to know it's going to be one of those things it's like the Kennedy assassination or something for decades will go by you'll hear all these crazy different stories people write books about it but you'll never really know exactly what happened we should I don't know if that's really smart doesn't seem like a good move it seems like you want to bite you want to do like but Roseanne did you get a place on an island that is already populated bunch of nice people you stab yourself as a valuable member in the community and then you set up a camp there imagine the Big Island the big move set up a f****** Studio on the big island not a bad idea right Conservatory can we do it up there or they let us temporary oxygen baseball in the Four Seasons we rent a suite at the Four Seasons set it up as a studio sounds great escape oxygen like basement we can go to just in case of a hurricane or something crazy happens when oxygen face more like like an escape room we could rewrite the Airbnb podcast not anyone like a good friend of yours that would ruin it we could bring the Airbnb.
