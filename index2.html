		<div class="paragraph"> look at this like okay now we know something can happen that we never talked to happen for the whole world shuts down now we know that's it we should we should act accordingly in like how we run things now we know what that's a silver lining I mean like that's a silver line it's like when you have a thing happened that you realized like you know whatever like in your car you get lucky and you notice that the tire is like super flat and you feel you fill it up whatever you see thing and it saves you from a later f****** thing they could have been a million times worse but you know man the wake-up call to me is like it's no joke that you need to at least be on like some terms of your neighbors and it's no joke that you need to understand how to do like how to grow food out of the ground and it seemed like basic first aid and stuff like that and I always have gas in your car trees in like f****** the Vino left a credit card at the house right in like the car was kind of low on fuel cuz I didn't gas it up like I should have right and no combination of settling not being able to put gas in the car and he's too dumb mistakes it wasn't just a normal shity day where your car I got a gas now it's your cars run out of gas during a pandemic meaning you got to call somebody to come and get put gas in your car or walk somewhere to get gas at the whole different Denver for not asking someone to come and help you it's kind of like asking to me would you mind like taking a chance and I know you're wearing a mask and everything but you know what I mean so suddenly f*** ups in this kind of environment they mean a lot more than f****** in like the previous world that we are in and that's teaching me a real kind of responsibility you know like having some cash on it like stuff like that I hate using every season with turn Silver Lining right now and it's like anytime you say I saw you at the Silver Lining on the people who drown in their own f****** mucus it's not the few know it's f***** up but I guess one of the Silver Linings in it is just that the fact that it's like look man Trump just was talking about maybe we should inject ourselves with a Lysol okay Yeah Yeah Yeahs tweeted it when you look into the abyss the abyss looks into you release date of an entire planet that it might be a good idea to inject Lysol in your body's here at let's hear my computer I had to get the sound out of it nothing anyway bottom line is he's saying wacky s*** in the focuses on this lady and now she's watching him she's like I can't even f****** believe I have to handle this I don't know how you doing there you go cuz you see a thing like that and it's like okay lean into that like that's going to fly Queen into that is a thing that you can count on that's a thing saying inject Lysol that's the kind of thing where you're crazy as friend if they said that to you you wouldn't be considering like calling their of their friends their mom to be like hey Jackie's having like a hardcore manic episode he's talking about injecting Lysol I knew himself you better do something that's a f****** president and it mean what that tells me is like Parker you need gas in your car you need to make sure your phone is do stuff you know whatever you need to make sure that you are like you got to be ready because if if we like think we're going to lean into some like imaginary hammock made of like people Doterra saying that we should inject yourself with Lysol then wormate then it's our fault cuz you know it's like let's say you went and you I don't know you went into the forest and you got attacked by a tiger but right before you went in the Tiger use the force you said to somebody hate you think I should go in that fourth or Tigers down there like no and then they start shooting up with Lysol you know what I mean if you go in that Forest that's your fault you f****** listen to a dude you thought you could shoot up Lysol you know what I mean that's your fault intelligent way to get out of this f****** subject and I've already started and I've already coming up with perhaps for instance maybe you could maybe you could hit somebody with a tremendous whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light and I think you had fun some of the way and I think you said you going to test that to sounds interesting right and then I see the disinfectant with knocks it out in a minute 1 minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or or almost deplaning cuz you see gets in the lungs and volume down put your lungs to a carwash like what what a crazy thing to say I mean cleaning cleaning give him a cleaning you know soap to me you see that and it's like okay well I'm not quite certain that that is where I'm going to get my data stream from because that's a Lysol person and then but then we but then there must be like a thing we can do regardless of the fact that clearly you wouldn't even talk like that on a podcast imagine you have zero expertise in a certain subject to talking to someone is like some expert in this said subject and you're proposing these outlandish like you're at a Podium you don't even have a private conversation in front everybody you're someone to have an aside conversation we are proposing these ridiculous ideas you can't do that you can inject this infection he probably upset and she wants to do the best work that she can do and this is just some nonsense just to handle along the way a lot of things might be able to be done and maybe you could do a strong ultraviolet light like in the skin that is like oh my God I'm laying out possible ways that you could tear this terrible to keep going I better have more than one yeah for support like I think you said maybe I think you said maybe looking at that yeah man I mean it definitely has that sense like when you had to give her a report at school and you hadn't prepared.</div>

alright so that and the Bry activity that and then bribed the rest of it sure you know you're you're getting a picture taken of you to try to get you into the school that your dad went through or whatever you're complicit to some degree like you have to be a little bit good luck stop go up look at that that's a grey sweater grey t-shirt grey t-shirts it's really f*****-up is like there's some kid whose parents like like you're making 20K a year who's working as f****** ass off you know I just like somehow managing do I study non-stop to try to get into a good school and doesn't get into the school cuz of that s*** that's the that's the satanic part is like they buy their way in and that's someone's place they have a limited number of places meaning like theoretically somewhat doesn't get into the school who could be the person teleportation or some s*** schools are you have your first choice second choice 1/2 Billy custard Choice yeah he's going on where's it going South Dakota Illuminati with an embarrassing and if you don't know how I talk around my friends what if that's how it is with like Illuminati to like these kids don't even know their parents were the Illuminati

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm not like a paranoid person but I'll tell you a joke you got me to leave my house for the first time in five weeks since I don't have you left and I'm so happy I tested the first time in five weeks that I've left the house and yeah Airsoft but no great to be here thank you my pleasure and I haven't I haven't left my house in 5 weeks I've been isolating as a responsible Citizen and excited to be here okay at this point in my life there you go right before this happened and I kind of think of myself sometimes I think okay imagine if I had been in a relationship that hadn't been going well and this happened and then you have to make the decision to isolate with somebody I'm not in that situation I'm home alone and I've been talking a lot to my friends on FaceTime and I've been socializing and I've been you know living life in this world but alone in my house I'm going through my computer's started going through old footage I found that clip from when you came up to my house back in the day and now I just saw this moment were in the clip where we started talking about my old web show and you come up to my house back in the day and it was so cool that you came up then and remember the time your website was like way advance write like it had all sorts of extra stuff on it that people weren't really doing on the web back then and you came up we start talking about the web and that was because of my webmaster Andrew Blevins shout out to Andrew Webb creating talking about what we got to do prophetic moment how can we make money off of it now we're here in this beautiful Studio really planted a seed in my head to do something like this online this yours was a big one got done at your house and seen how you had servers is not a sophisticated service provider set up at your house like you could have run like a network in 2007 the whole rack set like it was much more like a sad than anything I've ever seen before outside of a set it would light screwed into those ceiling I kind of trashed my place even figured out how to take video calls from people that was exciting then I guess you and that's that was a bad Corner my living room there to Genie delete all the wires going up to that that's going up into the ceiling. Through the ceiling into the spare room which I turned into the editing room I forget what models is Sony's Witcher so you started with a tricaster and Mister system first I had that for a year then we got this the first person to tricaster that's Victor who was working on the show until you stuck that I'm here today I still talk to Victor quite a bit to shout out today but but still kind of legit oh my God cuz Anthony cumia had a kind of a pretty high-tech set up in his basement that was another inspiration cuz he was doing that while he was doing Opie and Anthony and you know they actually is important I'm wanted him to stop doing it they decided something or another it's not he shouldn't be allowed to do an extra show karaoke with machine guns in front of green screen haha he was always really funny and just like like a comic but he never did stand up I mean I'm just making this up right now but I think sometimes people that have never done stand-up who do radio or afraid of it because and that went out and it was defining what's happened in our world you were just saying you know like what we do we don't need the advertisers anyway we do you need the Network's anymore we don't know we can cattle go straight to the advertiser that video available anywhere I think I saw it on the internet about how this internet stuff is played out since then so I remember I got a call this is one of those like you know when you think about syncback user kick yourself I was so I mean how far in the weeds the guys from Denver is San Francisco San Francisco and Barrett Lions did he do some stuff with some guys from Denver that was that was sort of around the same time they were that was Mania TV but TV was the only people that were really doing live streaming and I said hey you know like I want to build this TV studio and the studio but I wanted to I wanted to be autonomous of them as well so I got my own servers through this company bit gravity where they basically invented the technology to upload video and then serve it up so I would link that to my website on green.com completely autonomous of the other website Mania TV so made a few mistakes all the stuff to be on my website and then YouTube started now what's this will YouTube all the school they're still doing things out of an apartment in Sanford on the member one point somebody called me from YouTube said hey man we really like what you're doing be on your server right so you have those fuse not thinking okay we could have it out spread it send it out but it was it was exciting everybody thought that ya done now it's like comparing two of them because all those other video things it's like yeah you'll get some views but it's just YouTube for whatever reason captured the day I have the market could never became my space you with your phone or camera development you can upload it like real simple anybody can do it and then anybody else I can get views like that is amazing that one company has that locked up in technology and they got the fun to be able to stay right on top of it just make it the strongest platform possibly I don't know I don't even Twitter like how they do that just like one Twitter I mean there's Facebook on Instagram but if I if I go to your page and I'm reading one of your caption someone will say something in response to someone that like a f*** you dick boy or whatever and then I try to click and find out what they were talking about and someone will say something in response to someone that like a f*** you dick boy or whatever and then I try to click and find out what they were talking about and I get to the beginning of the comments and then I got to go through all the comments to try to figure this out like why can't I just click</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and you start thinking about all the possibilities what could happen and then this Panda happens and then you know I still live in the same place where did the show you know I just started seeing you know I'm here in Los Angeles to I was seeing Black Hawk helicopter Apache helicopter do you know I haven't watched it let me know it's crazy Walking Dead Seasons Ross hear about it now but maybe even better is the first season of the LA version of Walking Dead what's that one called couple episodes of spectacular felt like is that what time the beginning the beginning in the beginning it felt touch-and-go when everybody was hoarding all the tooth to toilet paper and I were fighting a gun the gun lines were giant Rife gun stores were creepy maybe it's not obvious enough so toilet papers big ass so because it's big takes up a lot of shelf space who takes up a lot of space so everybody went to the grocery store at the same time and there's probably far less toilet paper at the grocery store then it would appear too because it takes an entire Royal cuz it's big so everybody want but one piece of package of toilet paper on the first day he was instantly all it's instantly an entire empty aisle which is dramatic looking and it was the first sign of shelves being cleared and it was the toilet paper was gone and everyone went on their f****** phone toilet paper and all of a sudden. Compounded it exponentially and I was going to the toilet paper they don't need to be gone for the toilet paper and we had the great toilet paper shortage of 20/20 this is the type of investigative reporting you do when you're alone for five weeks Columbo toilet paper cuz it's big dumb people think about a lot of shiting write wash your ass with a washcloth back because s*** is going down alrighty that's the last thing you need to worry about is my toilet paper you need to worry about consuming food and staying alive don't think it's ever going to get to that and those the ones that stock up on toilet paper the ones who buy like rice and beans and stuff like that those the people that are planning their legitimately planning ahead you want to stay a lot corn and rice that's what I was a subsystem enough vitamins and everything you need so you don't get enough protein that way but you get some from being overly not as available sun is bioavailable as it is in other Foods so protein you just going to eat a lot of protein vitamins and everything you need so I'm sure you don't get enough protein that way but you get some from being overly not as available bioavailable as it is in other Foods so protein you just going to eat a lot complete some forms of protein</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> watch the movie about the free free free climbing movie that's playing on the plane but the guy that climbed Alex Honnold besides like I said earlier we're going to make pants I want to make tents I'm going to climb that you get to meet so many people like that yeah that must be fun well it's it's very important for me as a person trying to figure people out is to be able to see this insane spectrum of exceptional people right to see some like Alex Honnold has a really fascinating guy very fast really smart is really to India and he's really mellow he's got hands like saucing ass right you realize he didn't bring his chalk with him so he found some other climbers that were on their way out there were on ropes and said hey do you think I can borrow some chalk and they gay I have an extra bag here take it so he's f****** thousand feet up just hang it on finding other people were connected to the ropes with and they give him a bag of cherries over he leaves at the top of the mountain cuz he passes that cuz he's in he's not your man don't show me on freaked out food bro. Down to that wow holy s*** dude f*** all that look I know it's together with a group of people and I'd always said I'm never going to jump out of an airplane that was always my thing parachuting because we drove out there together group of people and I realized on the drive that I was the only person that wasn't coming out the airplane OG's and for whatever reason my competitive spirit that the best of me I said there's no way I'm going to be the one that didn't jump out of the airplane on the way back so we suited up and I just in that movie Charlie's Angels okay and there's a lot of parachuting in it and the stunt coordinators from that movie were taking the cast out to jump out if they wanted to so I went and Jared Leto was there you know my friends were there and I did and I didn't regret it but I'll never do it again it was amazing it was exciting you're you're strapped onto a guy doesn't your back right doesn't your body is getting a lot further away and then you're now the weirdest part about it was 20 years ago now but or 18 or whatever that you're now you're doing this right and you kind of realized control because there's another guy over there he's kind of far away and all sudden like you lean into it and you fly up to him like Superman this far away is far away I don't know what a papist you looking at each other and it's amazing and exciting and then nothing was weird about this then you pull the Chute or the guy on your back both the shoot and now you're hanging from ropes and you would be the time where it's you can relax but to me the one time I've done it talking about parachuting like I know about it the one time I've done at 18 years ago that's the scariest moment that the only thing preventing you in your face looking at your feet now you're looking at your feet hanging below you and your feelings ropes you're holding on holding the ropes gun these ropes gift like nothing nothing but amazing experience will never do it again surprised you haven't I think you got a contact high song there's no reason for that I think you would I think you would if I lived yeah yeah I'm pretty yeah I get it I get it but I don't I don't think I need that my life now I don't that's what I always said to where you end up going out to parachuting thing with a bunch of people unless you know here in a relationship and the person when you going to be that the chickenshit you got to do what you got to do save face ya almost. One of those things that you kind of you do it and you think I'm going to be okay and then one time maybe you're not and that's all it takes one of red bands dad his friend worked with a lady was little it was really in the sky diamond she's always trying to get him to do it and then one day he showed up at work and she wasn't at her desk and so what happened last night all that f*** all that dude</div>

These guys race runways out here now that's like the thing now is run Runway racing so they go out and they go side-by-side half-mile they're doing like to 2230 and 1/2 Mile would fly through the Air Jordan Fly you would drive the number being more than normal car that doesn't fly yeah I would drive something then by the way after that they changed the they read sculpted that section of track Brianna yes they for a. Of time Shane they impose the speed limit even during races through that section to prevent that from happening again they changed I believe the rules of the racing series to unload the cars down and then I believe they re did the track there is well after that incident like that or at least to make it substantially less likely scary crazy place at every every reputation that it every bit of reputations are ended it deserves and it's but you going to doing it is like one of the more unique experience of your life and you don't have to like you know like you said you have to go for time you can just go and drive it as a fast fun road which is what I've done as Americans we should be ashamed that the Germans have the Nurburgring Amelia but it was a Hitler it was a fourth Reich superiority thing right alongside the Autobahn best race tracks best race cars best highways as part of their deal and it is how to figure out speed people run speed and they're giving it to the pilot at a speed probably was doing speedballs like f****** John Belushi I mean it was it was crazy and yeah yeah yeah submarine base leaders of floating coffin and they sent these people out with like 10 tablets of meth and nothing else and this little submarine that had a little gun in like none of them came back just can't. That I have sympathy for Nazis but messed up soldiers and death submarines maybe a little bit is that what it was that little thing oh my God yeah, it's the picture I saw had the bubble somewhere in Columbia is a dude with a thousand pounds of Coke in one of those right now that a great idea anyway knocking on the bed early do they open up the jumped on top of a goddamn submarine and made the guys open the pulse open the sub bro it is Bonkers a submarine holyshit looking this 25 footlong sub so these guys are following behind it and he jumps off we was bad motherfuker so we do you think you think this sub is capable of fulsome urging or this is the closest to sublet it gets stops and filling them up with Cocoa FL in that made any way to another country in that big ship in Philadelphia that cargo ship that was supposed on by Chase but I had 200 or 400 million dollars worth of cocaine really Paris to Dakar Rally is the car race like cars like my Safari or like built for that and it's Grace and then there's these support trucks right and they they race the trucks to since like he's like, pause and like man trucks big off road tires huge engines and the trucks are in the race and so these Coke Smugglers that the trucks the bat in the back of the truck is enough parts to like rebuild the whole car and the truck has a racing driver and a v mechanic screw and they chase the car at the car brakes right and so Smuggler's bought one of these Dakar race trucks did it up like The Livery and just like couple miles after the start just like enter the race 13000 pounds I'm sorry it's like seven and a half times that is crazy and 37 Bales million pounds worth escape the built the sub Ray Liotta and Kevin Dillon invention No Escape with her on the prison Island they get the</div>

I'm all your babies I'm all your baby that is very kind of you to say I'm sitting here on your incredible show with everybody is riveted by your show when you say something it matters which is different than when you do a show on your audio podcast now I got a few people listening but it's not like it doesn't matter right that's responsibilities out but you're when you say something here it will affect the entire Society you have people now who don't believe in the stay home order there but they should until the actual scientific experts that they should go out but here's the thing who are the experts and are they different in different states and I think that's one of the benefits of having 50 states when I'm talking about the different styles of living Arizona lets you have a gun just carried on your hip right you can't do that in San Francisco right this different styles of living let's find out what different styles are right way to reopen the world we know the world got to be reopened okay we're not going to just stay Oscar winning run out of food I have to do things so do we have to do things after the vaccinations and can our society survive that do not many people are committing suicide right now my Suicide a week now they're doing a day this is something that needs to be factored in the drop in the economy equivalent to a loss of a certain number of lives and that every time the economy drops a certain percentage equal to x amount of life we might get to a place where it's conceivable that more lives are lost because of the ensuing depression and economic shutdown then we would have been lost if we didn't open up we didn't close anything and we just let everybody get sick it's a complicated thing and this is one thing that we have to really rely on the people posed to be in power to address accurately and honestly no one knows the right way to do this there's some real good protocols and replaced for 4p keeping people healthy and protecting each other and staying away from each other as much as possible and wiping things down and using hand sanitizer and stopping the spread yes for sure but no one knows how to get this thing started again no one knows what's going to happen and in the meantime what about the other diseases that are still around but about the colds and flus and what about all that stuff that kills more people than any of these things including covid-19 projections attacks not knowing I mean you don't know if you can prevent this right you know you know you eat well you can you look after yourself you'll be less likely to have a heart attack but you don't know if you can breathe can't breathe in a heart attack thing is all dependent upon your genetics as well as some people that have a predisposition to heart attacks but I'm wrong and it's so you must I'm just kind of curious how much time do you do spend research and cuz you know you know so much information 99% of the time you Jamie Google things to correct me in Midstream Instinct sort of the the you know the truth through the b******* and then you kind of cuz cuz I mean because everything is so polarized oh I've got to choose to say this because that's what everyone saying and they're just kind of saying it cuz everyone saying it was you definitely straddle that line in a way that to me seems incredibly astute but also must be some pressure to to make sure that you're right tell me about it this is b******* Go music is my daddy is being he's being like a real elf have a hard conversation things I make mistakes too if you're doing 1500 whatever the f*** shows plus by Companions and shut I don't know JRE MMA shows another 50 those at least write a hundred Jesus number of interactions that most people have with each other are positive right otherwise the world be a war zone on hey what's up hey this thing is podcast the vast majority of the stuff you do is going to be good this going to be moments where those some guy you were taking a left turn and he talked to you and you said f*** you need to know f*** you in like how do you decide to not and I don't feel like you do have an agenda to change or change things in it and it's premeditated Direction you just you're trying to be honest yeah yeah I can tell you just want to be real I wanted I just want to be able to talk to friends about stuff that's actually happening that's it but if you have any at all cuz I want people to do better included do martial arts really think about how you're doing it and More You Realize are others like a lot of stuff I could learn here that's what I want to do I want people to find things and try to get better at them doesn't mean try to be the best does it mean to be obsessed with it there's something that you get out of trying to be better</div>

A lot of sleeping do you not love your neighbors do you want to get sick or is there any been any evidence that that is happening now that there is with our phone specifically to do you know the phone tracking who destroyed like are they to the concept of it is definitely available right the concept of it of contact tracking is being talked about openly and then if if a company Shores figured out I say it's like there was a place to go right this is becoming interesting so say there's a place you go Tom Green you go and they give you a vaccination what's a vaccination comes available and you know that you now don't have to worry about getting this thing so we can track all the people that have been vaccinated as long as you sign up for the app and all the people not be vaccinated you see them and see them on the app well before we stepped in this mall will see what kind of shity f****** citizen through have been vaccinated you're not allowed in the mall on a map and it will get real weird yeah it's another step a really quick step in a dragging us into the machine and to take away you know the nuances of just human life they were accustomed to and it would become more more digitized and organized and people need Freedom man and if you don't have the freedom to just be somewhere without the government knowing that they're like it if you haven't committed any crime you're not a criminal and if they can just monitor you and you've never committed any crime that has a weird place that's weird things getting weird is supposed to be supposed to be following criminals only and I know it makes it easier for you to follow criminals if you can follow everybody but you were changing what everybody is you change if you follow them all the time everywhere they go if you listen to everything that they ever say through the microphone and they're f*** changing what they are and you're making up scared and everybody knows it and no one wants to admit it you're making people scared of people do things because they don't want censorship they don't to be censored then we yell at they self-censor they don't want to be not in compliance it changes their behavior we all know that we all know that it's dangerous to creativity dangerous to authenticity is dangerous to so many things it's not it's not a good way to be as a person like looking over your shoulder people to watch you all the time 2 we're just too weird too weird to force the hold and then who's got control that the government like what some people that got elected to a position the only one to get the look in and everybody and then would have that opens up with you know everybody can look in and everybody f*** it the information act what is kind of given to the evitable tell me to watch this s*** I'm going to watch you s*** from your toaster cuz you toast yeah man it's not going to be pretty but it's almost like we're taking a step closer and closer towards the digital world with this and that's I don't I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the sense that I don't I don't I don't think that robots are out to get us I don't think that the electronic world is looking to consume us but I am concerned with some steps that we could take that make our life more digital to take away too much of what it means to be a person some what it means to be a person is like fun is this find the weirdness of the world there's fun in the danger of the world you take away all that s*** with apps but and and alerts and you know and like where I can't go down that street there's a guy down the street that was arrested at one point in time s*** to do for safety and then we become what would have become his unromantic boring bulshit digital things that are locked in the pleasure sources it pumpkin pleasure to they taking the place you know me really they could do that if they could get to a point where you wear an implant it just keeps your dopamine levels up at a very high high note you get augmented reality glasses were buddies hot and be pretty cool do you like The Matrix member when the one dude was given into matrices like luck I just want to be an important person or Duncan actor some memories writing he's</div>

I like what you can't believe sometimes people I out there that don't do that that are in like the media that are in this that sort of video loves this s*** more than I mean how to hate Trump when it's like 90% they're f****** fault part is there's a lot of different things going on in sports you want your team to win that's a huge amount of that you know that movie Annihilation with Natalie Portman where they buy the same people can see that movie now alright well when you see the time to watch it it's pressing against the door she's fighting it and then she stops for a minute and then she gives it a grenade and pulls it in and gets away by being the more she would fight it would give equal reaction back at her reflection and you hate it the more they fight it the more it presses them back up against the door and that's that's there's nothing I'm never going to figure out how to just like give him the grenade and pull the pin and walk away cuz they can't like a Uzi he definitely makes mistakes but they are also so wrapped up in everything that he does in a way that they distort even things that probably turn out to be a good idea anything you like I'll do a thing every f****** day and what you going to do and people like there's like a bunch of us don't follow me they like his genius all the time you see Fighters talk s*** to each other right one of the reason why they talk s*** to each is it trying to get the other person emotionally invested in the fight right to try to get him angry and pissed off we're going to do something irrational they're not going to be logical right that's what you're saying front and he was like the people that vote for a feel like that Obama feeling that's what it's such an offense it's anything Obama did or didn't do its the feeling that it's send it right when you want that back always said about him I forget about his policies like he was a great Statesman the way he would talk that's because he was reserved and he was articulate and smooth and when you would hear them talk but that's an excellent representation of the United States where's like the thing with Trump is that he's you know like you said he's not really a politician so he's just being the guy who's always been there but it's like I thought you were going to be a president though I thought you going to act like we need cuz you want to be called POTUS people got him for specifically the opposite of that it's done now so people still want that The West Wing or whatever the f*** like that's what it is it's like your West Wing kind of people that you want well I think it exposes how not rigged it is cuz it's only controlled it no f****** way to know you don't like trolls some of it well this is one of the reasons why they're so scared of Tulsi gabbard cuz she doesn't lay down like that you see that moment was Kamala Harris in the debates they haven't either the internal thing you got to settle with all the people that are actual left that are like mad and they want their Trump so they're not going to go along with the same cuz cuz I think a lot alike just liberals don't get that the the lefties hate you more than they hate or not they hate you more than any right-winger just a regular liberal that's who they want to get them that's why they turn on Eleanor whoever the f*** cuz they're waiting to have a reason to turn on you cuz cuz I think a lot alike just liberals don't get that the the lefties hate you more than they hate a Nazi they hate you more than any right winger just a regular liberal that's who they want to get them that's why they turn on Ellen or whoever the f*** cuz they're waiting to have a reason to turn on you</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> has there been discussion it like as anybody brought this out like a Dan Crenshaw was not aware of this when I discussed it with him when they were talking about federally legalizing marijuana right it's not just about saying it's okay for kids right it's a it's about mitigating these problems that you have with cartel sure is when there is an illegal opportunity to sell something that there's a demand for than the criminals going to sell it and that's what we have now exactly and it has there been discussion like to someone to bring this up like this is one of the primary problems with having marijuana federally illegal with California having its state legal that there is this massive confusion in this you know diminishing of penalties in California with growing illegally there totally is and you know you got the opposite ends of the Spectrum in and here's what we're learning with regulation I've always said this I said look if we're going to regulate and we need to regulate to stop this black market let's do it smart you know let's for one everything we we we really try to push here in California was regulate legitimate cannabis the correct way keep people safe child it tested make sure those pesticides cartel pesticides are absolutely man and other people they're not destroying waterways when I get in gunfights over it great you know no problem but for like that you know the outdoor trespassing with these cartels let's take that funding and put more effort into stopping that you know that's not water down to misdemeanors and infractions things like that and you know it's an even if we keeping take cannabis out of the equation show from the standpoint of I remember a few years ago as quoted by the Associated Press of saying if cherry tomatoes were so desired on the black market or illegal and people were paying $4,000 a pound for cherry tomatoes we haven't gun fights over cherry tomatoes and having band Poison Sun cherry tomatoes that are kids are being in the salads you know because of the black market so you can take you know cannabis even out of the equation and look at the environmental in and look at the public safety but we have to do something to regulate this thing uniformly over the across-the-board and we have to break the black market but what I've seen and I go into the last chapter of my new book hidden were extensively on this is what are the challenges moving forward after seeing regulation in play for 2 years boots-on-the-ground watching it and having a great relationship with legit legitimate cannabis Growers and I'll tell you a few stories that really open my eyes and and got us unified right cuz the whole thing is we the unified on this concept non-polarized left to ride anti cannabis grow cannabis let's get you to fight environmental safety Public Safety all of it but because of how we regulated and the licensing fees and the protocol and everything else we've had all of these you know Black Market growers in the 215 days that wanted to get legal and saw everything coming into cost to do it and being on Big Brothers radar or law enforcement's radar and they backed out like in Humboldt County we had it like I want to stay in the better part of ten to fifty thousand Growers ready to regulate and we barely got a thousand you know and they went you know I can't afford to go through this permitting process I can't afford the delay so I'm just going to go back on the black market I'm not going to be on the radar and that has to stop if we're going to regulate right now the thing it was what was really interesting and I never saw this coming but win and we're about to roll out prop 64 and you know it had been voted and recreational and in the medical laws were tidying up how's the first law enforcement guy being from a marijuana enforcement team to to go into these California Grower Association hosted grower meetings in Santa Cruz right over the hill from my place right and I mean I'm in the oven be to use the camo bottoms the polo I'm going in might you might rain attire for met and the look on 500 Grovers faces when I walked into that meeting just like what you doing here tell your story I'm going to show you a powerpoint it's going to be graphic I'm not here to work anybody you know I'm here to unify just hear what I have to say no judgement and so I was on these guys aware of how big the situation was before because bite but anyway I explain that literally would back in hundreds and hundreds of yards of pipe and tubing like roses on their back other tough yeah I've got I got photos in the new book on trail cam with felt on their feet covering their tracks with the sea bags 100 + pounds and a split pipe they're tough and there I mean to look at the environment they live in for 6 months man they're all Outdoors but I was at this meeting and I gave the presentation I talked about it and it was crazy to see look a shock on these these groups faces I mean some women were in tears some of the guys were just like pissed off and pump in their face and they're like that's b******* we are not about that we're not about doing anything bad with our water we like our wild life we just want to grow cannabis we want to be regulated you know and it was such a turnaround you know from the traditional relationship between law enforcement and a cannabis world and has to be the one guy there with all of the growing Community there and then go from complete horror that I was there isn't a berseria judgment or anything of that or you know to to do anything negative from enforcement standpoint to suddenly haven't real talks about was going out and and I could kind of see the authenticity but genuine is on some of their faces reacted to my slides to the videos and so when I left that first meeting I remember I just got flooded in my patrol truck and I had Apollo with me my little lab and she's an icebreaker I thought well could be an interesting meeting I should have the dog for pets you know and she jumped in and I always Growers were coming to my truck and I'm packing up my stuff and while this is weird and was always you know farmer supervisors from all over the state Mendocino County of the Emerald Triangle Santa Cruz just give me their cars and I have work I have resources we will hike and clean up a grow with you let us help the Met team let us help the Cannabis program whatever we can do and no no charge and and that was genuine man I was really really taken back by that in a positive way and I realized if we get the legitimate Farmers on her side and they're aware of this they will help Market that message nikhil they have money and they have money Cochran campus as it is right but if we could allocate that taxes absolutely to you guys would be incredible where's the money going let's have a certain percentage of it designated for wardens that's starting to happen to because what's now that we've had a couple of years and we're seeing some of the regulatory funding on the taxes trickle back I'm in contact with my team all the time I still get to see him periodically and train and do things like that and really give him a shout out for amazing Risser taken in the work they're doing and promote their message with her out there doing but the money starting come back to us now we're starting to get equipment we start to get more bodies or starting to get like overtime funding so the ridiculous long hours are small Teamworks are compensated for that just happened literally you know within a month or two of Abbey on the show with you so we should have some positives it's great stuff makes your mouth smacked out gives a little it does a little more problems they still have a black market you know and anything right now because we're not regulating federally and so every state anything that's grown stays in that perlot right but every all the demand is back east in these non-regulated states are I don't grow it sew Colorado has you know when Interstate Black Market that's done by the you know quasi legitimate Growers as well as the cartel element so they're still that black market thriving within you know the black market cannabis industry that isn't cartel public lands we got different mixes and we've got a different kind of a problem in Colorado so they don't have as many Epsom I talked to those guys work with him a little bit and they do have some but again they're kind of like where I'm at Montana now tight little growing when do you know early winners late father's plea don't have a very good growing season Outdoors the conditions aren't Prime like they are here in Cali this is a giant issue that is largely undiscussed and it's one of the reasons why I was so fascinated by that podcast isn't it and this is one more one more piece of the puzzle when you talk about border control somehow or another we've gotten into this state in our country this this place our country where some people want to control the border and some people don't want any borders right and do you have to understand that this is the number one problem with the border the number one problem with the borders cartel violence cartel violence cartel crime that's the number one problem and the giant percentage of these people that are coming over and doing illegal activity or doing it because it's profitable write a reason why profitable is because it's illegal and so they can do these things and then sell marijuana Friday all over this country illegally because it's illegal and if it was legal we could regulate it we could tax it the money go into schools and pay for guys like you and and go to fixing this problem instead we're playing this little stupid game where you know some states are legal in some states are and lets lets you know and it's federally it's still schedule 1 time when there's millions of legitimate law-abiding taxpaying citizens and enjoy it and crazy it is and into that point you know you you look at you know the discrepancy and just the inconsistency on cannabis regulation some states I'm not federally not but when you go to the Border issue you brought up that good point of it's not just that cartel element for Discount this poison cannabis stuff for this toxically Tina canvas as a better way to phrase it it's the smuggling traffic in this all those other crimes I may have sediment production so I'm not sure I get asked a lot like after you know what you had a great conversation with the with with my Baker on this was no are open borders going to work and no again about some regulation it's just not going to work does not even so that's why I open borders are going to wear it right if the world was even then start a dialogue in last week. Yeah boy is he scared the s*** out of you though when he comes to the stories about Maco about how bad I was down there and there's there's just an insane amount of violence it's going on down there and it's insane amount of crime and so much of it is connected to the illegal drug trade and it looked that you're not going to kill at all if you make marijuana legal but you would kill a percentage at least it would make it a little bit better and Woodstock that yeah it one of the things we we we get from from getting that regulation if we can stop that black market for you know cartel weed we're going to save a lot of wildlife we're going to preserve a lot of water weighs right because all those other crimes are very heinous and very destructive and I hate to see the human trafficking and all the meth problems and and anything related to violence or by deterioration of a soul but you know I love the wild man was Irma Church yours D I mean what you do for conservation the elk hunting that you're doing all those different things it's magical out there and it's just most people just don't even know I don't think know but I know you don't get a chance to experience what it's like to actually be a real Woodsman the real woods Witcher but what you're getting shrinker smaller and smaller and smaller even here in Cali that is so much Beauty but I look at it this way I said look if we lose all over open space to a problem like this and a compound the problem and we lose our wildlife and good water you may not be in the outdoors right now you might be a preservationist you might be you know on your freaking digital ice all the time and looking at Wildlife through through screen but if you ever do go out and you get that peace and Tranquility to get Center like we do run a trail hike Aveeno LA County Mountain Trail open space don't even get that far in the woods it's just soothing you know brings us back to our Center in you know if the new generations that aren't getting that from the cities can get that or they get their kids doing it with our grandkids are here about it but it's not there to go do that to me man we're just we're just not paying for it this is this is something I got to stay on and I really appreciate you and what you stand for because of the message I think just some people don't know yeah I just think that's a big part of it I said I don't know what's interesting to me to is that the allocation of resources that it's it's so when you have something that's illegal you're not getting any of that money no and if it was legal there's an enormous amount of money that could go to schools and fix the roads and we can allocate it to a bunch of different big time you leave ways to spend it and we're not doing that and it's it's the reason why is because that illegal and this is crime problem is very similar to what they faced during prohibition with alcohol and you the rise of organized crime and that's where they were getting their money from because there was such a demand it's really a disgusting dumb way to approach problem that is many people's ideas of social problem that money could go to so many. positive things for perpetuating it true that reason and many others we're basically you know we're basically embedding a problem in our country and Ed said this called romwe our dialogue in earlier this week and he said you know he's kind of look at things from the border and South and the issues coming in from the border from the cartel front he said you know now getting into your book and I'm starting to analyze what year you guys are fighting on the ground inside the borders of California the rest of country goes it's embedded now I mean it's not like it's just coming across mean the Enterprises in here in the nation because they have the pipeline they have the distribution they have a market and they don't have to deal with border issue and round for bull because of exactly where we're at and when people aren't aware of and in California that it's just a misdemeanor which is even more so yeah it's that's got to change a background and crime especially violent crime and you get caught doing something like that I mean it should be severe severe penalty it should absolutely severe the same Grace that is when we get the environmental crimes that we bring from the fish and wildlife standpoint to those charges for these guys we get it back to felony status because we had an interesting thing happen as soon as all that regulation started two years ago and the water you know those trespass programs or water down hangover talking about District Attorney's all throughout the state said oh man we're not going to be able to prosecute these crimes I mean we're not going to have you know we're not going to have a jury that's static to these issues it's not worth it some Sheriff's departments were saying hey we know how violent these guys are we know your team's been in like six gun fights man and your partner was almost killed in 05 in the first one you guys take these guys head on you know you want to protect your Wildlife whatever but they're not stopping and it's a misdemeanor and we can't convict him so we're not going to play so a backlash of those crimes be watered down Joe was team stop working it except us and like the feds you know and not only that. execute so I remember speaking for the California District Attorneys Association on this and saying guys are the solution everybody no matter where they sit on the Cannabis Spectrum everybody hates to see Bambi dead water poisoned everyone has a little bit of environmental passion in my both sides of the fence and that's why I say here we get to the you we can unify and not worry about where we sit on the performer against and if you take these water code enhancements if you take the felony in the penal code from the band you take these water code enhancements if you take the felony in the penal code from the band toxic Carlos here in if you take a streambed alteration diversion or dead Wildlife or littering close to estate Waterway you stack all those up you get all these penalties and you can convicted on that you know even in a sympathetic jury on Sia cannabis issues so we started to prosecute these cases and it started to come back and it's an arduous and around it's more work than we should have to do but we're doing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Sears man we are just tested on yes apparently it's been some controversy about this so just let me let everybody know right away there's no shortage of antibody tests and what were using there's no shortage of them people say white people in the front light and it's just misunderstanding and confusion these tasks there's no shortage of I understand some people in some places have a hard time getting access to the test not the case here so I take it upon myself to test everybody as a coming to the studio is not taking away from anybody that's on the front lines cuz I'm taking test away from any medical workers that does the test they would use for them particularly that they're using swabs I mean look man those f****** people that are working in those hospitals in the medical workers those people are legit hero yes you know and if I found out that there was something we were doing that was somehow another taking away from there would you be tested I would never do it so people got upset apparently because people writing articles about things cuz you know it's like it's Hot Topic right and their own people like posted some story making comments from Instagram and using them as quotes just some random mcgough that's posting something in this one of them said that we were low-key flexing that we had tests higher time I just shared with you earlier today there was a new study that Jamie Siri pull up that study it is out of I think it's out of UCLA is that what I do it's it says early antibody tests indicate far more cases and a much lower mortality rate Ryan so they think there's at least four hundred. people have been infected in in California so the mortality rate is way way lower than they previously thought it was at least in California you know it's obviously varies there's a crazy disease if it's raised doesn't make any sense it varies depending upon your physical condition whether or not you've been smoking with a night is apparently up a great benefit to exercising regularly even while you have it if you cash it exercising but then it was his f****** what is that guy's name the fox thing we'll do the first there's a there's one on La, look at you indicates far more covid-19 cases lower mortality rate there's a decrease in number of deaths study indicates that there could be hundreds of thousands of people could be infected without knowing it that's what's so weird about it the only time they think that if they catch it before the symptoms set in you survive survive but if they don't catch it for the symptoms I didn't like you just get rabies you don't get over like I do every black person I know always cross the street the only time they think they if they catch it before the symptoms set in you survive survive but if they don't catch it for the symptoms I didn't like you just get rabies you don't get over like I do every black person I know always cross the street when they see a random dog</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but to share that with everybody nationally in my world in the thin green line and for them to start having it happening on the refuges and even just a know this stuff's getting back to their parts of the world and poisoning there are cannabis users you unsuspectingly horrible information right but we need to know a lot of guys didn't know it and so that was one thing to see hey what we need a baseline training in the way we do it here in California is we all go through a really strange an academy everyone gets their basic tools arrest control defensive tactics and firearms training all of that and get good at being the traditional game warden doing all the traditional stuff and they get you know get get their feet wet out doing their own thing for a couple years and then we start to find the people that have the motivation I want to get onto a specialized unit like our met team or one of the Watershed teams or Wildlife trafficking team very seldomly do we put a fresh person there because you know I think to really be a good game warden you got to cut your teeth on all the traditional stuff Google just how how to check guys with guns all the time you know most cops look at that and go that's crazy I mean everybody you check has a knife or a firearm 99% on work I want to see a game warden and game warden wants to see us but for that one felon it's on parole and he's in the woods hiding out and we run across that a lot and I ran across a ton of that down here and So Cal at the start of my career and I'll get some interesting stories about that but so guys who are like Ben skip bail and then hide yep and they've got like a no-bail warrant their wanted on some warrant somewhere and so they're efficient they have an illegal firearm maybe there a felon in possession of a firearm they can't even have and now they're out and remote area where no cops going to find me here and then on the new game warden the Riverside County you know all freaking motivated really green I don't know totally what I'm doing yet and I'm in that truck cruising and something I got into down here that was just crazy but I will say this was a heck of learning curve and I'm really blessed it went out the way it did and it was definite but we would gang banger something from La here and they would go over in the Riverside County and get into my kind of rule Foothills on the edge of the national forest and they have AK-47s and they have you know automatic pistols and they would Spotlight through these Canyons gun in for everything they kill rabbits that kill coyotes they kill deer they get to the end of like a canyon that has like a an outlet of a damn bro Gill night out and spend all night or just gillnet fish turn freely and shooting and killing everything with the spotlights grab their gillnet grab hundreds of fish pack up and then head back you know back to the LA basin I just retired with what you and Marshall Ave Apollo yellow lab English lab she's amazing never to buy a bad guy but you can't lick them to death and try to shoot right you know turn them our way but I didn't have a companion dog the time and I would go and run into these guys and go okay this is what I learned in the academy that you know that that head-on spotlighting stop that you never want to have her get in behind and blacked out and track them down and next thing I know I got a case and I got all these freaking prohibit exotic weapons and I'm going this is crazy Tony's guys that alone I don't have a lot of last year it was just me how many guys did you run into some time to be to one. I pulled like eight people out of a man and I was alone ocean and they were all armed and it was one of my heaviest most intense cases and I've been on one year so this was 1994 and what we were doing in the Riverside Squad as we were just Saturday in the area cuz we're getting everybody from overlay side here spotlighting all our games are like okay with saturate this and back. Joe the game was to catch a spotlight a right-handed cuz they're so deliver his light spotlights all yeah I should I should have done that but there's a handheld Spotlight flashlight whatever and you going to remote areas and you look to find animals at night because they freeze the really relaxed their eyes glow and then you shoot him that way you kill him illegally at night after dark which is never allowed you know it's usually in or out of hunting season any ones go Spotlight a deer nine times out of ten they're they're not lice they're not going to do it during season like we do so they're doing that so in the in our world is game wardens that's the ultimate Wildlife criminal because they're going to kill those you know that have that unborn trophy Buck for good genetics they're going to kill a trophy deer weigh in the right you know that you know needs to go another year or whatever so that's what we focused on that was like if I can cut my teeth and get you know become a reputable game or in a going after the hardcore is that was the game then it was 94 and I'm pulling these guys out call him Alan Ladd I've got my weapon on him and I'm like oh man there's a lot of guys out there I can't get him to jail I'm calling back up I got Riverside County coming and I'm even have the Sheriff's Office helicopter come in several nights once we got to know each other and they realized who is this game or an order these game worms Riverside County going out and dug just crazy areas by themself they monitor our traffic and they come in on the helicopter and light it up and call them I'll call these bad guys out on loudspeaker system make sure we were okay and feels good when the calvary comes on those nice man let me tell you they just didn't know that you would ever run into someone that's that arm that many guys and a van or what have you ate people but it says hold there was a reason why your Patron by yourself because they didn't anticipate anything like this well and we do know the bodies right this was one of the things that was crazy we get back to the thin Green Line concept and realize it one game warden is responsible for 200 to 250 square miles give or take you know so I squat a seven-game words to put in perspective check this out brother so when I was supervising traditional Patrol before we started the special ops met team in Santa Clara County we always have vacancies because we always alone bodies we couldn't hire game Words fast enough we weren't funded for it over the case maybe so we might have for 5 game wardens for 7 positions and we had to cover all the Santa Clara County which is everything from the city to all those Foothills and there's a lot in Silicon Valley people don't realize all of San Benito County which is huge Hollister Gilroy right where I'm from in Gilroy that whole area down to the South that is just mass amount country full of Wildlife and then like part of Monterey County and I had five people in myself as Lieutenant that is insane I can't believe that so to go out on a spot to that point and have a partner with you just one other game warden that stuff you know you're basically pulling a whole other area you can work 9 or so is spotlighting common it is still going on in the state and its going on a lot back then here because we've been so little presents here in Southern California it was off the hook it was crazy one week in 1994 I remember I was at a really good ride along with me a wildlife biologist social Savvy Hunter great eyes he became kind of like my right-hand man Brian and we I said we're going to catch spotliter every night this week just think so I was a crazy let's see if we can do it and so we went and worked all night long you start Monday night how do you catch a body look for a spotlight like what you give me an appointment glass it's ya just like the glass in a big Basin for help write in a really good OverWatch you get the most visibility in a pie the truck and you watch and you find areas where it's likely to happen and it takes awhile to learn where that's going to be just because you got this huge district and you could have 20 places where guy spotlight you get into the areas a new war normally get to figure it all out you don't know where to be in it it's a trial-and-error but it took me six months give or take adjust just going out and it's gotten hard and in seeing where this road goes and how does that canyon look what type of water do I have down there what am I seeing a low light in the evening when animals are coming to Waterloo I got to hold her to healthcare I got a whole herd of deer got some bucks you know I'm seeing other animals run around this is going to be a hot spot because guys can get to it and if you just put the time and you just kind of lion wait you don't come up with tied together just like hunting big game eventually starts happening and by 1994 and I've been in District a year down here I pretty much had my spots figured out my partners in other parts of Riverside did too so we'd all be out alone so we can cover more area and talking back and forth I mean and I'm a date myself here but cell phones brand new so I'll have those flip cell phones and we're it was the flip phone you have the Star Trek Communicator, partnered really love those where you at their crate Haystack type thing you know but once you get into it you get really good at it but it it always is difficult because again just the percentages of catching a guy on the right night that he's going to be out there and then you got the guys are kind of get Savvy to North game warden lives driving by his house looking for his patrol truck to see if he's out that night where's the truck parked we start getting into that problem so we always kind of you know kind of maintain as covert as we can you know we're known in the neighborhood in the thing is we live at home we work out of our homes home crossword clue store Community because if we kept our truck in a field office we have no response time all spread out so we get very community-oriented in in community functions and conservation groups and everybody knows us whether it's a big city or small little town in the mountains so you got guys doing the cat-and-mouse thing looking for us and you know making sure he has his truck there or is he out patrolling I'll maybe I won't go out tonight but that would show in in 1994 was was off the hook I didn't get a spot lighter every night that week but I got 6 out of 7 at 1 a double so it's crazy Mom Season the time guns and you know some guys were going to jail somewhere but a lot of wildlife would say that night because they wouldn't they would it would have done a lot of harm you know most of these guys are they doing this recreationally forefathers unit for food like what are they the group I was getting into down here it was it was recreational it might have been to sell the meat I couldn't prove that or it was just to go kill stuff you do get people that need me you know that do Spotlight after dark because they need the meat and stuff like that it's still a violation we still deal with it as such but if we ascertain that we're going to be fair about it you know we said okay look you're poaching I know you're starving it's out of season since season you have a tag but you just really got to get that meat I mean there are certain cases we just kind of feel for that person to go I see what the motivation was you know and a very small percentage of poachers are that way but some of them were just you know they're just trying to feed their family and it's a whole different game we're going to be fair about it or we should be fair but most of them gang Bangerz are most of them criminals like what there's it was there a felony she Ridge down here seventy 80%. Criminal histories had illegal weapons associated with gains those almost like Recreation for that little boy that was practice guys pretty inebriated pretty liquored up and I'm as a head-on stop and one of them had a like a $50,000 no bail warrant for cocaine trafficking phone case down here that was a pretty crazy one it was it was three guys pretty inebriated pretty liquored up and almost a head-on stop and one of them had a like a $50,000 no bail warrant for cocaine trafficking out of Mexico and that was in that week that we had you know crazy Spotlight things going on so it was just the demographic of down here we're up north it it won't it won't be necessary that fell into that guy that just wanted a trophy buck and to get it cheap to get</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what is the is there an estimate of how many cartel members are growing in this country right now if it with you save there's 27 28 States is that what you said what is the is there a rough estimate of how many cartel members are here right now doing this kind of this comes to it you know it's it's a real approximation because you only know based on who you catch your driving ability breathe but like in California when you're from the amount of grows we we deal with every year just on the trespass you know cartel front number of operatives it takes to run a grow and get it started and then harvested I mean conservative estimate 10,000 10,000 very conservative because it's such a kind of a silent Enterprise and it's really hard to get some of this data but we've we've just validated it through the numbers of things we run across you know when you look at the fact that it takes to skill Growers that are vetted because they cut their teeth done do do it effectively under the Federalist nose and they grow well in and you mention this weekend Mike Baker on the show which was interesting and you hit on the head when you said man these guys are really resourceful you know if you got to respect their work ethic and now you have to because they're there hiking water line of hiking infrastructure in their covering their tracks they're out there for 6 months at a time whole lot of photos in that book about things we've seen on trail cameras and they will put felt-lined line soft felt on their shoes time of tight and if they're walking like an Old Forest Road you know that's got a gravel base you'll never see that track I mean you know you've tracked a game I've done it you know it's the same type of technique and if you don't have any sign I mean the really good at disguising to actually found a guy and I have a picture of this in the book and also in the PowerPoint when I when I teach this throughout the country actually carved out of wood because a couple years ago we were in the u.s. forest service a lot of this grow problem is on or national forest you know Northern California Northeastern California not so much Silicon Valley where I started but the rest of this day even down here and what these guys to do with those cattle leases on those properties were in a Rancher can run cattle and part of the forest and you know originally on private property and we were getting tips on a bunch of crows you know where you seen from the air or Hunter Wrangler would report them or we do suspicion cuz of water weigh and we get see some plants from satellite or whatever and we go try to find the screen we weren't picking up tracks and we're we're pretty good at finding these things now we've been trialling are in it for a lot of lot of years but we're sitting like Halifax cuz we're running around with cows and sure enough they were putting on calipers and strap them on top or underneath their their boots clomping around to disguise themselves as cattle clever right and then once I get way up into a deep Canyon where they're going to put or they just take them off and throw my backpack in the light bulb went off with we better look at you know our tracks little more carefully so how do you guys try to go about finding these things do you do rely on people reporting them or do you have like aerial surveys how do you it's it's a mix of all event we get a lot of reports from people in the ground and are our best reporting parties or we call our peas are Hunters &amp; Anglers I'm going to come to the outdoor public but across some butt Hunters &amp; Anglers especially because where do we go when we when we're going to find a good water hole for Elk or you know what hunting black-tail we're going to go stay on the beaten path man we're going to go down to the headwaters we're going to find a pristine area we're going to get away from people so people that are going the deepest into the backcountry absolutely absolutely in their finding the water you know source and then maybe they're following it and it's dry or it's diverted like what I found in 2004 that started this whole craziness and running to aggro we also do find it from the area now we do all agencies it's no no secret and no tactical reveal we've we fly look for the stuff from the air I have a friend of found one on Tejon Ranch really yeah yeah a few years back and I didn't think anything of it I thought it was just some crazy person decided try to grow pot his back for is recreationally legal okay and it was no shootout or anything crazy like that they got there after realize that their grow up it been compromised and they took off but you know Tejon Ranch has enormous thick 270,000 Acres yeah and just the gall of these guys to go deep into that ranch and set up this grow site right on the guys who work there they I guess they just stumbled upon it I think they stumbled upon it because of garbage to if I remember correctly yeah that that that follows track in the thing now you're talkin about private hunting ranches got a catalyst and all that tones huge we've done a lot of good stuff supported you know good hunting programs are but an interesting statistic when I retired last year in December 2018 you know I mean we keep stats ever since one of the cool things about the are specialized team start in 2013 as we solidified all the documentation to be spot-on you know reporting was kind of haphazard throughout this day we weren't sure what other agencies were doing but we knew what we were doing now and so I'm keeping that data and there was a real shift in just public land presence of these cartel Growers and by the time I retired last year I won't have 50/50 split so ranches like Tejon Ranch a private hunting club in the Silicon Valley one up in Shasta County so you know where they're doing big-time conservation projects to get black tail and mule deer in Tule elk and everything else up and numbers and now they've got this presents on their hunting club hitting one of their sensitive waterways you know so so it's it's not just a public land thing is really good for everybody listening to know that you can find it anywhere in and you stumbled on it and it is 20 mm reporting parties a cool thing after I did Stephen show on a mediator and talk to those guys was hard to get tips actually got a tip and you know when it's it's in play and I won't say too much more about it but will definitely be talking when it's all over and done but it's it's going to get handled and it's so cool to see the guys like you and I didn't love it and love the passion of what's out there are out there stumbled on this stuff and getting out safely and and were fired up enough not to wait you don't work for calling people to say it's out there can you help us Ritz award a mediator and talk to those guys we start to get tips actually got a tip and you know when it's it's in play and I won't say too much more about it but will definitely will be talking when it's all over and done but it's it's going to get handled and it's so cool to see the guys like you and I didn't love it and love the passion of what's out there are out there stumbled on this stuff and getting out safely and and were fired up enough not to wait you don't work for calling people to say it's out there can you help us with the warden Sheriff's</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> don't these dogs that your training know Phoebe was like there was very interesting listening to how effective is using Belgian Malinois that were using your permit earlier main dogs Belgian Mel and Powerful dogs they are amazing so smart and I can't talk enough about it man cuz no matter where you sit everybody loves a good dog story and you know some people say well Dual Purpose you got a bike guys what's what with that is really aggressive and look at it's a lifesaver for everybody it's a lifesaver for us Lifesaver for the suspect to because it usually involves a potential gunfight at the dog basically you know alleviated because she or he was there so we got our K-9 program in agency going kind of full speed around 2018 I'm at 3 we have three levels of canine we have like the companion right along canine the kind of does everything with you she's never going to bite anybody unless Apollo that's like my lap right then we have the detection level dog eye muscles are Labradors like Marshall like Apollo because Labs have such amazing noses they really can hold on sent you know that they can trained it to Tech many cents and we certify him and different things and then there's the feebies you know the bells romells or the Shepherds and really it's become mostly males now in our age why Mount horse shelters in the heat you know Shepherds have longer hair and 100° weather we're on Long hikes you know or unsupported those dogs might have to sit quietly after hiking 8 Miles and sit in a prone quietly while we're watching observing and stocking it on suspects to make an apprehension in a rest safely and hopefully avoid a gunfight so and we also found with the with the males it's like I said they just hold up better on average and they're certainly exceptions to that but when we got our Dual Purpose program back on track these are dogs that will buy 22 on command but they have great noses so let's still detect wonderfully you know Finding evidence fine in tainted weed whatever the case may be a firearm a bear gallbladder all of that but they'll also you know like Phoebe was nicknamed the fur missile because when it was time for her to go to work and some guy was going to pull a weapon on us she was all business and cool thing about a dog like her in the end and Michael and I got into I'll hit you especially in he was going away he said I've never heard of a dog in a domestic law enforcement team that's had like a hundred sixteen apprehension bites in her career and she has 216 know JoJo Diaz on the cool thing about that was a stampede of life she saved and she also arrest another 8 to 900 that she didn't have to buy in her career why how many of you guys arrested when I retired with over thousand and in five and a half years yeah and we ran against all grow-ops grow-ops are related to grow up so that they are all guys that are armed all gussied up knives or guns you know that you're not getting bit unless you know you're a deadly force threat on some level or significant threat so yeah it's been a lot of guys so that number that you talking about 10,000 I think it's very much so yeah that is so insane because if you fly over like Humboldt or any any of these areas I can particularly medicino Northern California the density of the forest of the the the public land out there there's a lot of land there's a lot of land in a lot of potential we're not seeing so and that's still still thriving so when you you know when you when you look at Phoebe has a canine and you go well let's see if she was in the field doing these type of operations for about seven or eight and yeah that's great for my records standpoint and numbers in the life you save but it gives you a like a like a snapshot of the issue how many guys did we not catch that were out there or that we weren't involved in and the dogs are just say lives man they have saved this in the new book especially in 2012 but right before our team started Phoebe save my life Brian's life and all these other operators in Santa Clara County in Silicon Valley right where I grew up engage the guy that was pulling up a Russian automatic pistol on me and I was the support for the for Brian I was basically a k9 Handler or support guy and Brian had to deal with this other Growers partner that had a big Taurus Judge revolver on his hip and he was pulling it so he goes for that guy and says John just take my dog to be something by it and he's biting this guy in the calf and yeah this guy's nose down and we don't know he's got this weapon and I start to see it coming out and I get on him and I do what I need to do some physical control and Strikes and whatnot to get the gun Christian but had she not been on that guy in a bike show. Guns turned on me at 5 feet I'm engaged All The Rifleman behind me on you know I'm in a gunfight again we've been in too many of those already how many gun fights in 6 and I've been on the ground for four out of the six there guys have been involved in and they've all been around this particular problem we had a lot last once the team about formalize and so we started using dogs but we still had two during the window of the team being operational that we could avoid and dog four out of the six other guys have been involved in and they've all been around this particular problem we had a lot less once the team got formalize and so we started using dogs but we still had two during the window of the team being operational that we could avoid and dogs played a big part in that as I go into a new stories</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Trump like even Trump like as much as he hates it he has tone down a lot of his rhetoric because of the criticisms he's faced you know and that's it's important it's very important to him and he has the that's one thing as viruses making everybody have to do their job everyone have to actually do their job wondering if you would do it again all over again if you knew how hard it would be and how much you would get s*** on I don't know I think it was so funny when he presented to me was like it was like like the hot new nightclub you know what I mean like everybody was in there you know what is like like a nightclub and you can pretend to be who you want to be and you can just in the coronavirus comes and that's like when the lights come on in the club and you get to see you know I have fuckedupshit really is and and so was when the cold country just kind of like I said I was going to go with your biting regardless of how loose if you feel he is or how sharp you thinking is when the whole country is like his Uncle Joe just let me think like Trump is like a fancy a nice resort like hotels is the number one thing I want to do that but after awhile you get tired of spending $21 for internet and $40 for pancakes and you just want to go home and enjoy his kind of sent it felt like he represent home you don't mean like people I kill all the kids dementia but I think he's going to be propped up by so many different people going to motor like President Obama's going to come out in the door soon and if he doesn't listen that's crazy what I'm saying because he's familiar he was dead next to the guy that we all felt more comfortable with especially in situations like this endorsement video straight up gaslighting matter whether or not I think he's going to lose I do think is going to lose record even if I thought he's going to win he shouldn't do the job he there's no way you can take the pressure of that position with the cognitive decline that he's already showing but there's no but you just want the Democratic party to be back in control I get it how much time does Michael open the damn trying to give you an example to me just the way that Trump is handling having any kind of criticism is anything it's unsettling it's like so you have to have degrees or whatever but to be in charge of everybody else that guy who's in charge of everybody else is just it's like man I just wish he didn't cost so much just wasn't the way he he was you know what I mean I wish you could just take the kids seriously once again into office and Uncle did expect him to yeah he's always been the guy that if anybody says anything about him he talked mad s*** about that person wonders never lied to you or respect all of that but it's just like in times like this one is required some empathy and say I feel for the people that are dying not give me credit I come over it so I feel like so what I'm saying is I feel like having Joe come up there and play those notes it feels like he will everyone just all of a sudden overnight goes Joe Biden's our guy it felt like everyone together but what is going to be like after a year in office dealing with International Politics the economy the environment for all these different things people how quickly who's going to be the vice president Elizabeth Warren who's going to put in there the country or would it be a good thing for the country because it's the best person for the job both both best person for the best person for the job I feel could be a woman of color in the Best Western Plus country could also be a woman of God because a lot of policies kind of stop before Consulting the people of color in a woman of color can see what we're leaving out this group male of color who's better qualified for the job I don't but that's not my point what is what are the qualifications for this job is is what I just said there's no test you have to take is just a popularity contest remember she just she just did a whole thing about something on Netflix and she was like we aren't even on Ellen's that we just like it was like yeah you probably should I think I'm not the right person to be talking about this but I feel like you know what they say Stacey Abrams is in the running and I don't think he'd be a bad choice but why she just puts things in context and she is very smart very sharp and she is not thrown like she would be extremely qualified she could be president she was the first lady so she's accustomed to the public eye she's accustomed to speaking publicly and that's why they say Joe Biden was the best bet because Joe Biden so Pennsylvania it was a is a swing state and Joe Biden is the only person out of the democratic nominees who did not say he was against fracking he was like you can't you can't be again you can't you can't do it all at once and then they have to have the clip of the fracking protesters at CoCo for somebody else man and he also supports he has an in with you know the coal miners and the fracking industry just like you know Trump so when it comes to Electoral College votes Trump doesn't knows he can't beat them Sy hence the whole Ukrainian get some dirt on them just announced something's happening. I think that was kind of like The Narrative of that and know when it comes to electoral votes that whole Midwest game that whole Michigan Michigan to buy in his right there and that's what I'm saying like them yes man oh no I don't know but what's going to happen once people start hearing him talk on the campaign Trail but I don't know I don't know how I don't know how brilliant or a ticket at Trump is like I don't know I think I think everyone it's a matter of being able to control crowds and have these exciting rallies he does Arenas dude he does sold out Arenas and he kills you want a woman of color to be the vice president wife and I would love that I would love for I'm not saying I would love for things to feel like that I want to say back to normal but I would just love to feel like when the president speaking with it what I'm talking about is his ability to excited base in the ability to get people behind him he's a unprecedented ability and depending upon how he handles this coronavirus crisis they could swing left or right it really depends entirely upon who Biden pics because remember when George W was president is really was like President Dick Cheney doing everyday and Cheney was consistently in the bunker he was in the bunker for like weeks of time they were saying he's an update demon told us he was in a bunker but just in case anything happens like why isn't Bush and government will you have a guy who was the former CEO of Halliburton company that countries after we blow them up getting no-bid contract to rebuild a country that we blew up while he's making the decisions to blow up his country powerful speakers someone who apparently and if they pick someone and I'm sure the groom and someone right now who you get excited about yuto okay this person this person could step if Biden lost or find lost it right or find died which is also possible bro there's a there's a photo of him that was on the New York Times yesterday we can see you like where they gave him the f****** the face is that like you know and just just just how the government works well what the what was it the pandemic agency was closed down in my pantry what's the his lawyers fight what can I do what can I do Shore what can I do what can I do and he just goes you know then he takes his stance based on what he is known he's no he's going to be protected legally and he doesn't equate that he's present of all of us you know I mean it so I just feel like that's what's missing and he is incapable of doing it I know when Prince had the Mike Pence was getting popular at 8 at Trump music you want to talk about advice but I don't know what that guy's voice sounds like somebody so emotional right like nnnn I feel like Trump's a businessman so he he's not approaching this if any emotion and it's a good thing that he did was blocked travel from China that's a good thing that probably saved a lot a lot of people saying you're crazy for doing that but so what do you mean you actually didn't I don't know I just heard that's why I'm saying that I was saying conflicting with Mikey block travel because of diplomatic reasons to go out and go to Chinatown with no worries bullshittin the way out of this while she was blaming the present it look everybody got this wrong everybody got it wrong everybody did fournette 30,000 people of travel from China to u.s. Sister coronavirus surfaced the coronavirus surfaced in this is just a this I think this is just an article about yeah I know but this is an article about when the coronavirus surface which was in January that's just letting people know how I made it over to America that's not how many people came to America this is since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak on New Year's Eve in two months after the president impose restrictions arrived in January at airports in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Chicago Newark and Detroit all places fuk by Coronavirus what kind of restrictions were they the bulk of The Travelers who were of multiple nationalities arrived in January at airports in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Chicago Newark and Detroit all places fuk by Coronavirus</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you seen all the s*** that point to the fact that this came from a lab viruses there are a ton there's a ton of of scientists that are pointing to that just one French virologist Gmail send you this there's a French virologist who identified HIV and this French virologist was looking at this disease and it's like this is not a disease that came from nature know that this is a disease that came from the lab on Netflix the series on Netflix that takes place in China that like two or three years ago they called the coronavirus in Eli played the thing really yeah there's like episode 13 season 3 or something like that of the show Jesus Christ than they knew this stuff was happening while people knew that it was always a possibility TV industry like it feels like everything is becoming YouTube you know. I mean like all the time or I'll just I'll send you this right now Jamie hold on a second Bill Maher has some great f****** rants I mean these are tweeted twice to him that where I said Bravo yet are you playing it you know he's he's pushing all the buttons you know he's he's doing, he's doing like real edgy comedy while he's pointing out how crazy this all is I appreciate him right now is so sad guy who's on the left that I really I really like the fact that he doesn't give in to all the craziness he doesn't get given to the the lunacy of of left-wing policies he still he still like rational about it all although clearly left-wing bias he still rational goes with comedy but it was well yeah I want some I don't know man I like him a lot and I watch you like a bunch, I want to know cuz I watched some of his stuff and I feel like it's two things you should have me on this show basically cuz he's always talking about kids or he would be talking about he did his whole rant about why can't we call it the China disease and stuff and I was listening to a chinese-american on on The Daily talking about her experience of a feeling like being an Asian-American he was always like a probationary experience as long as I did the right thing and stay out the way people left me alone but when this came up just for going out why people like you f****** Chinese detective you know and and it's kind of like so it is it's me I love watching them because it's because it's also these blind spots that he just his whole rant was really about stop these wet markets you can do it you didn't have to do these but here the other like you know SARS or murderers are two middle eastern respiratory did make that point he was the head of China you know he would say that and then the Chinese guy was saying hey this is the whole world's problems whole world pandemic but yeah kind of but it did come from a f****** if it did if it did come from a lab you know we should call the lab-created Wuhan virus how do we know that this guy's correct it says analysis indicates the virus has a natural origin it was not engineered the so-called unique protein sequences her since found the 2019 coronavirus can be found in many of the organizing not just HIV but that doesn't mean it's organic or natural in origin I think that we are right now in this. Of conflicting information and you going to get it bouncing back and forth from con but I've read multiple sources that seem and end from respected scientist to seem to indicate that there's a distinct possibility that came from that lab one of things they're saying is the actual bats that they sequence The genome when it when it when they found the genetics for this virus the bats that tested you know that we're this originated from where the same exact they're from the same exact locations the bats are they do research on in this lab and Elizabeth form I mean it's not it's not outside the realm of possibility we're in the Wheelhouse what they're obviously I'm a moron I don't know s*** about viruses but when China says all definitely wet Market nothing to see here yeah well the web markets are f****** gross you know it is but that's also a sad thing about you trying to feed a billion people and you feeding them Wildlife a lot of what they're eating as Wildlife they're so cool it's like squirrels in</div>

He's got to go to that got to go to that but that's very important for everybody when people get sick it spreads to all of us now we also we don't want ever to know anyone that you love is going to die because they can't get Healthcare that's available for people that have money that stop that just stop with fire department Fire Department EMS fires on fire how to help Healthcare we should be we what is the what is the what is Covered California what the f*** is that all about that I don't know man I don't mean if you think about how much money gets spent on things right with her it's computers whether it's cars whether it's houses whether it's with his it seems that people by how much of a percentage of that if you could escalate just a little bit and all that money goes into just Healthcare not just taxes worth no one's accountable you don't know where the f*** is going to go everybody's dollar cost $2.05 for most things you buy up to a certain point all that money go straight to healthcare wouldn't you be willing to pay instead of a dollar a dollar five or something if you knew that $0.05 going to go towards Healthcare Ben billions and millions I mean after while it seems like it would be better for everybody and it would be better for us to not worry about what happens if you get sick cuz you don't know if you can deal with pay for it sometimes people get hit with crazy medical bills after the unexpected injury worried about what happens if you get sick cuz you don't know if you can be able to pay for it sometimes people get hit with crazy medical bills after you do an unexpected injury</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> stories crazy it's crazy and I think it's also a really important part of human history imagine if the Whistleblower had not come forward and we didn't know about MK Ultra and and then all those documents didn't get but they didn't find a warehouse for the documents fall back on you know we signing I was with the agency if we talk to you without permission and they're not going to give us permission we could go to prison imagine what life must have been like for them knowing that this is what they were doing people that such a strange way to also these people are agents for the federal government and what kind of precedent does this establishment most of the people doing the research were subcontracted researchers at medical personnel at prisons and in the case of Jolly West he was first in the Air Force and then he was in university settings and jolly was once it got to University of Oklahoma he was experimenting on patients and in one of his letters to God leave asking for more funding he's saying working with psychiatric patients actually benefits us because people can't not quoting directly weird behavior wouldn't be noticed by anybody at the hospitals because they're psychiatric patient so these people are getting LSD which is a pretty powerful drug and Other Drugs he was using and he was hypnotizing them and some of it many of his experiments without without their knowledge and their psychiatric patients I mean that it's worse than Nazis your mind is you know the next most important thing besides your soul and they're tampering with it you know one of the jollies take the guy who actually took over the department when jolly and 69 came out to UCLA from Oklahoma said to me cuz I would show them all the documents and he said he always has one of his best friends I think 45 years when West died in 99 he said what he said to me Jolly it doesn't surprise me that he would have done this this is the Jack Ruby stuff which I guess gotten to yet Jolly was Jack Ruby psychiatrist Jesus after Ruby was convicted of shooting and killing Oswald in the spring of 64 before he was going to testify to the Warren Commission he had never told him never testified at his trial about why he he killed Oswald his defense argument was that he had epilepsy and he had had an epileptic fit and shot him and was amnesiac of the of the the shooting yeah so that's right into the narrative like a key well it's gets better so West inserts and shine through his connections to Ruby's new lawyer you were Winston Smith his old other kettle of fish but anyway goes to the Dallas County Jail in thing was April 64 to examine Ruby in preparation for not the Warren Commission testimony when she was giving in a couple months before his next trial cuz he had you got a new or an appeal for a psychiatric review and West who had told Sidney Gottlieb and in these early letters from the 50s that part of his experiments were inducing insanity and a person without their awareness West goes to examine Ruby emerges from the county jail and there's press weight for him and he announces that within the preceding 48 Hours Ruby had had a psychotic break that was a irrevocable couldn't he couldn't return to sanity he had audio and visual hallucinations during the exam he said Ruby hit under a table cuz he thought they were people in the room trying to kill him told Weston he could hear children's screams outside his jail cell as juice children as they were boiled alive and West said he's completely insane that was the day I mean there was no evidence of Ruby being mentally ill prior to West exam West was alone with him in the cell and then treated him for about six months when Ruby finally gave his testimony the Warren Commission so Earl Warren chief justice Warren who was head of the commission down the Dallas with Joe Ford who is Congressman and on the commission and Arlen Specter the young while inspector who was an investigator for the Warren Commission to eventually came up with the magic bullet theory he called it the Magic Bullet anyway on the three of them Ruby Underoath and Ruby battle was incoherent grabbed on inspector who was like him. cities that don't you know that killing Jews and and that they've killed my brother and cut off his legs I hear them being tortured outside my other good news anyting West that was one of his objectives and his uncal to research was to make people into sinsanity without a person's awareness was there any contact with Jack Ruby before he killed I won't again that was one of the things I can't tell you how hard give me Western movie anyone anyone could have done something to get out to kill to organized crime and federal he was part of which later emerged the anti-castro Cubans effort to overthrow Fidel Castro which was Ron it was Operation Mongoose by the CIA with an illegal assassination program Ruby tonight in the book I found out that we can through West papers that I got access to Ruby admitted never that he stalked and killed Oswald on the orders of anyone but that he was working with these people who were suspected of being involved in the assassination if there was a conspiracy and he had never admitted that to anyone it's only an in West file and West with how that the the the primary theory of who was responsible if there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy and one of the thoughts was that it had to do with some sort of us CIA operation to overthrow Castro yeah well there was that by John F Kennedy was second-in-command to judge Warren on the commission Richard Helms who was actually Jolly West employer for MKUltra was the liaison between the CIA and the commission so Helms new that Ruby who they call their most important witness in their investigation the Warren Commission investigation because he was the one who silenced the killer there could be no trial for Oswald cuz he was dead so they try to learn everything they could about Ruby to see if he had had any meetings with Oswald prior if he had connections Beyond The Superficial ones to organized crime was there something deeper the commission which I believe was you know a joke from the beginning it was set to determine mean they said in the beginning their objective was to prove that Oswald acted alone they came up with that conclusion but after the first Intelligence Center in what is hearings in the in the early 70s that exposed MKUltra chaos cointelpro primarily that the Frank Church hearings are they found out that fellows and Helms and others had lied about the cia's involvement with Oswald and and with their own agents who have had these peripheral will not their peripheral not but definitely encounters with Oswald they withheld all that so the house voted to have they call the house select committee on assassinations that began in 77 and 78 they released a report which they concluded that was all a probable conspiracy to kill Kennedy that Oswald didn't act alone and you know it's there's lots of books about that and in their findings and then later the to the head of the committee Robert Blakely wrote a book where he said that that Ruby had acted on behalf of The Conspiracy to silence Oswald that he had stalked him premeditated the murder and that the whole thing was part of keeping the secret so was West apart of that and you know again I can't prove it I wanted to find out if what I said had any encounter or any interaction with Ruby prior to Ruby committing the murder couldn't find that and that's the kind of thing that maybe no evidence maybe it happened but there's no evidence but I wasn't going to put it in the book and I exhausted every resource I had you know cuz that that one is always been so puzzling for me cuz here's this guy that's not connected to the murder allegedly and then steps forward and shoots Oswald in front of everybody in himself mean like there's no doubt about it and you're the guy who did it go to jail forever report which was fabricated by his first lawyer who admitted this years and years later he told Ruby to say he did it to spare Jackie Kennedy from having to come to Dallas for a trial of Oswald that was made up and then Melvin Bell I was assigned to the case was I mean really fired like three lawyers in the first couple weeks and I took over and took it to trial and his argument was that he had had an epileptic fit and didn't know what he was doing when he was grabbed by the cops after he shot Oswald he said hey I'm Jack Ruby what what am I doing here what are you doing to me don't you know who I am cuz he knew all the cops my argument of my book is this important my most important finding is that a CIA contracted agent or researcher for mind control became the most important witness to the Warren Commission he came this is doctor right before he testified and told his story I go that should have been disclosed obviously to the commission but they're not going to say it cuz it's a secret program and then he goes crazy crazy by a couple of people who were nobody on the commission would talk to me that was alive when I started pursuing them Joel Ford wouldn't talk to me or I think I mentioned that to you before there's an interesting I approached inspector who was running for re-election this was 2002 and told him I had new information and he had all he had always maintained you know he would he made a lot of money off of his books about Justice and hit in the magic video defending is magic bullet bullet theory he always said if anybody comes to me with new evidence I'll look at it with no open mind so I had sent him a persuasive letter while his people they finally said all right if you have these documents showing this is Doctor Who treated Ruby you know within the 24 hours he lost his mind Specter will look at them and then decide if I'll talk to you fax them to us and at that point that was 2002 I lost a magazine story and I didn't have a book deal so I was operating entirely on my own I said I can't send this stuff to you because it's my Smoking Gun the letters between got leading and why scribing off the experiments so finally Spectre agreed to talk to me on the phone for a few minutes and it was amazing he called me from the senate floor while they were waiting to vote on whether or not they were going to invade Iraq this is 2002 so we were only supposed to talk for a few minutes and when I explained what I had and what it showed West had you know been involved with at the time he treated Ruby he said well if you're not going to send the stuff to me I don't know you know I need to see it and I go well I can't send it to you and he said where you want to meet me cuz I told him I was in Philadelphia visiting my folks and he he was from Philadelphia to he says I'm there in the weekend I'll meet you Saturday I have a squash game at the Wyndham Hotel meet me there squash so we had a meeting set up for like 3 days later and this is something I'm always second-guessing about I made a decision I don't think I got to I don't think I've ever really got paranoid doing this but it's factory been a long-term Senator he was running for re-election and it was the first time in his career but the polls were against him that his opponent was they were predicting that he was going to Spectre was going to lose he had also you know defended this magic bullet theory forever I mean more people knowing for the Kennedy assassination than anything else I thought so if I do meet with him and I show him these documents Maybe diosa me too I thought he's going to go my God I need to be part of their you know exposure cuz if he didn't and walked away from it I thought they were important enough that he would know that that would you know once they were publicized and he had the opportunity to say hey we need to look into this and didn't he was like bass and I thought well maybe he's going to two things he's either going to use it for to get publicity have a press conference and help him in his re-election or he's going to use it to be the hero of it and run with it before I publish the book and then I'll just be a footnote you know to all those cuz he took it so I cancelled the meeting the morning of I called up his press secretary and his cell phone like the three phones I have for my said you have to tell Senator Specter I am so sorry but there's an emergency I've got to go back to Los Angeles actually was scheduled to go the day after on Sunday so it's a lie and I didn't talk to anyone I just left a message and I said I'm so sorry but I obviously I've worked so hard to get this meaning it's embarrassing but I have to go back so I left my parents place to go to the post office cuz I've been there for three months I was actually writing the first version to proposal at their place to get away from my friends and you know all the distractions in LA and I was only going for like 15 minutes ago mom if that press secretary calls I told him I was leaving till tell him that I'm I just went to the airport and I and I apologize so I can't lie to a press secretary I got to go to the Post Office and I come home 15 minutes later she's like this why does it goes I go watch Senator Specter called himself he wanted to know what happened why you changed your mind so I don't know if that was a mistake on my part I think you know 20/20 hindsight I should have done it and taking my chances I did all those what that would have done come up with that whack iron without ya ya ya and the fact that never gets brought up if there were more bullet fragments in Connelly's body then there were missing from that bullet in the fact that anyone who knows anything about guns and if anyone has ever shot a gun as seen with a bullet went on what it looks like wood look at that f****** bullet and think that bullet went through to human beings Siri in the first place is because the guy was hit by a Ricochet on the underpass don't know the whole story behind that I did I tried not to lose myself anymore than I had two in each compartmentalize area I was going to so with the Kennedy assassination I just did a superficial like Manson I was never interested in any thing so called conspiracies yeah I never cared about Kennedy or that's was connected to Ruby and again that was a moment that I was like oh no I mean first it was West in the CIA and then I'm like and Ruby how can I not look at the Kennedy assassination so I kept my focus narrowly just on Ruby Oswald West Spectre I look a little bit of the Magic Bullet and agree with you but I never did a deep dive into a lot of that stuff first it was West in the CIA and then I'm like 10 Ruby how can I not look at the Kennedy assassination so I kept my focus narrowly just on Ruby Oswald West Spectre I look a little bit of the Magic Bullet and agree with you but I never did a deep dive into a lot of that stuff</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I would do without Iowa seduce people into the story and get them as I would love to. I was like pretend I'm a guy and you trying to pitch me this book in the beginning of the first years just that the trial that had occurred that have been prosecuted by Vincent bugliosi had a lot of malfeasance in it by the prosecution I was able to document that they planted former prosecutor on the defense team to sabotage the defense I doubt that two or three of the principal Witnesses including Terry Melcher who played a big part in this and will probably talk about that at some point lied on the stand you know supporting themselves and in a murder trial and if you commit perjury in a murder trial you could be convicted of murder I mean you could be sentenced to a motor if you get up at murder sentence to because of that so there was about a thousand of those and none of them happened all at once. surgery during a murder trial you could be sentenced for murder for the same amount of time that someone would get sentence if they murdered somebody are subject to an actual Capital you could be elected you could be sent to the chair wow and the five people who were convicted of murder in the first trial once had I been around and able to prove this in the early 70s Vincent bugliosi and the three people who lied on the stand in a material way you know I'm a very important way they all could have been tried for that perjury and sentenced to the same or given the same sentence of the people who have gotten the Destin I told you that I just got to the 11 chapter of your book right and essentially what I'm getting so far I haven't finished the book what I'm getting so far is there was some sort of a CIA program where they were explain how they did it they they infiltrated these hippie communities and they allow Charles Manson over and over and over again to get out of jail they knew that he was committing all these crimes and instead of an operating careful required for the first year after Manson was released from prison and 19s Rodgers Matthew and he was a criminologist in the Bay Area Manson violated his parole the day that he was released in Los Angeles and this is one of the you think it's a little lie but it's an important lie that been fully OC presented not just a trial but also in his book a trial it's much more serious he change the narrative he said Manson have been given permission to try San Francisco from La when Manson was paroled meth and hadn't been giving that promotion he just showed up there they originally were going to violate them set them right back to prison and someone stepped in and took care of that and let Madison stay in San Francisco and he was assigned to Rodger Smith it took about a year-and-a-half but through a Freedom of Information Act process I got his Federal parole file and those with a kind of seeds of how I found out that Manson has its immunity prosecution for the two years he was out of prison from 67 until the murders occurred in the Summer of 69 who was Smith doing this for who was giving him the instructions to continue to let Manson out and they needed a modern well that's a problem I didn't get the whole file and the file I got had weird actions he would report to the head office and they would give him instructions and then he would violate those instructions and there be no repercussions for him Warframe Manson for instance Manson was arrested in July of 1967 three or four months after you got out of prison when he was under by Christmas supervision for interfering with an officer who was trying to arrest one of his first young followers Ruth Ann moorehouse who was 15 and he was put in jail plead out so he got a 3-day sentence a new probation sentence as well all that was hidden like this not believe she's booked the parole officer Rodger Smith a week later wrote to the head office at Mattson was doing fine and he actually recommended that Manson be allowed to go to Mexico and work in Mexico and the head parole office in the United States census Federal wrote back and they said that's insane he was supposed the job that he was going to do in Mexico was surveying soil for insect insect the size and they had nothing to do with it documents showing the who is hiring Charles Manson to survey soil it was a company and Nevada which disappeared a couple years later it was a b******* company's I believe so yeah 1959 the last time he free man he had violated his parole then he was arrested in Mexico right he was arrested in Mexico and brought over by the federales and and given over to Federal custody for I was a drug violation and then some other stuff so why would his parole officer send them back to this place three months after he been released and how do you supervise somebody who's in another country can I make a summary just for people who like what the f*** is going on right now what you're saying is that Charles Manson was a part of some sort of a program yes and that through this program they were using him and using but with LSD and all the members of the family they were turning them violent and why why do you think they were doing this together so I got to reel it in a little about not saying anything that I have been able to prove what I proven is if he was getting leniency from the federal government and the law enforcement first in San Francisco that year the person who represented the federal government there was his parole officer Rodger Smith Federal parole officer was getting him leniency Rodger was also doing drug research at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic which opened in June of 67 Manson during that period turned the Manson that were familiar with today you know the monster the embodiment of evil as been fully OC call them the guru who could control the minds of these followers so he would come into the clinic to see Rogers when he went for two reasons but it was a free clinic it was at the height of the summer of love summer of 67 and he will come in with a women two girls here about five or six followers then and they would walk behind them they wouldn't speak unless he spoke to them the man he issued towards then they would follow and they became very well known around the clinic and they were there principally for Manson to see Rodger for his weekly parole appointments and then the girls were going in for STDs and there was some pregnancies and stuff never getting free treatment that was the summer that the Manson family formed and then they left in late 67 early 68 and migrated down to Los Angeles and became is Killer caught it's crazy how quickly this all happened it's insane in Haight-Ashbury 69 the tate-labianca murders and then the trial and then everything else was basically just sort of a two-bit criminal who would spend most of his life inside the system and had been incarcerated for what half of his life his life when he was released about 8:32 and 67 off Federal institutions to which was interesting even pelillos he pointed that out in his book first of all his mother was a prostitute kind of she would get sent to jail for petty theft or prostitution and she had them off to her parents or other people and by the time he was 10 11 12 years old he was stealing cars committing petty theft and stuff so that he was sent to adult detention centers in schools reform schools are run by the federal government and then when he committed his first crimes as an adult which was again car theft the first crimes require that but when he stole the cars across state lines so then it became a federal offense and he got in prison but with much more serious sentences if it's a federal offense in if it's state and he do these long sentences back-to-back-to-back and then every time he was released he either violated parole and probation and they were actually strict with him in the 50s and early well still 60 when he finally went to prison for 7 years it wasn't until 67 when he came out that all the sudden with hands off and what do you think happened in prison did they find him in prison again I'll go there with you okay which we know was a good possibility as I lay out circumstantial evidence for a case with proof of each circumstance but when you put them all together that's the hardest part is linking them finding the bridges what I do is show what the objectives were either the federal government's case to MKUltra than other programs cointelpro and it and chaos and the enforcement in Los Angeles and San Francisco at the time so MK Ultra began in the in the federal prisons experiments on prisoners famously or notoriously Whitey Bulger I don't know if you heard about this but a few years ago it was revealed that Whitey Bulger had been apart of MK Ultra experimentation the fifties when he was incarcerated and after he was convicted he was claiming that he believed that all of his violence was a product of what it happened to him in prison when he was experimented upon with LSD through these scientists so theoretically Manson was in the pine place where the experiments were occurring in prison before he was released in 67 in federal institutions they couldn't do it in the state of Mo is federal parole file which was an accident never been released from 67 to 69 but I also have the one prior to that from the 50s and the 60s and all the correspondence and he would talk about these doctor's coming in to examine him and he didn't trust them and didn't know what they were doing and this was late 50s and unfortunately he never had the first names for the doctors over to one of them was dr. Hartman I can remember the other one's name that was in Hartman in Los Angeles who was one of the early psychiatrist using LSD and in the 50s Cary Grant was one of his patient so theoretically he could have come out of the program or the experimentation that began there but you know I hate to even I rather all this without showing all the documentation and stuff what was going on where he was and how everything matches up but you see that when you get through chapter 11 okay so far so 1967 he gets out of jail and he how long before he hooks up with this clinic so he got out in March of 67 the clinic open in June of 67 so just a few months it Will Rogers Smith he was a living in Berkeley Manson was and he got his first follower Mary Brunner and then two or three or four more and then Rodger was the one who suggested that he go to the hate to absorb The Vibes he thought Manson my benefit from the love and peace five that were happening in the Summer of Love Smith was his parole officer in 67 that gal Sedalia told me she was his assistant at the clinic at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic when he was running his amphetamines study in in 68 she said that Rodger had told her he met Manson when he was doing probation work and Illinois and the early sixties eventually interview Rodger several times and Rodger denied that and when I went back to jail she doxycyc I can't believe he's denying that that was a connection here. That's why I meant was able to leave Los Angeles he was sent to Rodger Smith so Rodger could be his parole officer I was never able to document that Benson had been in Illinois except for 3 days for in 61 or excuse me in 60 when he was brought from Mexico to Texas and then they brought him to Los Angeles to be violated in front of the judge there he did spend free days at Joliet prison where Rodger Smith work but he was there a year or two later know that was one of the one of the many frustrating moments where everything makes sense except for one but one very important whole which was will they weren't there at the same time at least as far as the official record shows so if Smith was a part of these experiments in Smith was also his parole officer and did know him before he did this 10 years before he got out which is when it's speculated that Manson was possibly experimented on and Smith might have been aware of the entire process of it and was supervising him upon his release they would just let him go and give you a little background on Smith is he told me he called himself he goes I was at Rock rib republican from the Midwest and I came out he went to Berkeley to the school of criminology to become a criminologist I think I'm 65 or 66 he was getting his master's and his PhD and his special area of study was in the beginning gangs Collective behavior and violence and then how drugs would make some of these gangs that he had people he was working with infiltrate students infiltrate mention that this isn't an Oakland in the ghettos and in like 6566 on the Panthers were forming then and 6866 he decided to become a federal parole officer while he was still writing his dissertation and he got assigned to something called the San Francisco project which was an experimental program run by the federal government to see how different numbers of parole clients caseloads for parole officer where you know supervision it was about recidivism so if you had the lowest low was 20 clients the largest was like 50 or 60 were you able to supervisor you wouldn't think that 50 or 60 is going to be a lot more difficult but it always wasn't so Smith join that program where he's supposed to be paying much more attention and care to his clients because are the special program called the San Francisco project and in fact you was I mean he was he was seeing Manson more than he was even officially supposed to thinks he's stopping his parole officer was actually removed and he said it was voluntarily so he could focus more on his drugs and violence research at the clinic Manson three or four women followers got arrested in Mendocino they had lured a cup young boys into a house giving them LSD they're advancing it sent them out up to Mendocino to recruit people for the family the three women were four women were arrested one of the Mary Brunner had the first baby with Manson in the group and Rodger Smith and his wife Carol went up to Mendocino and petition the court to take Foster custody of the child until Mary was until her case was resolved so they were the foster parents of Manson's son I mean nothing was irregular about this that actually that case is pretty interesting so Mary Brunner and Susan Atkins two women who actually killed for Manson in 1969 were given they were convicted of contributing to the delinquency of minors illegal drug possession and without a trial a plat out and then there was what they called the sentencing phase where a probation officer is assigned to decide whether or not they should the prison are given probation supervised probation so I got access to their files Brunner's and Atkins and in the file with recommendations to the core by Rodger Smith and his wife saying these are good women they shouldn't go to prison Susan Atkins who you know stab Sharon Tate and is that proven cuz she said it and then we went back and forth and back and forth murder she couldn't do it but this was later on that she did it and then when she testified to the grand jury she said that she didn't do it she held Sharon while text abdur later in prison she said that she did do it then she changed again she go back and forth that she was pretty brutal and probation instead of sentence partially based on Rodger Smith recommendation Rodger Smith identified himself as a form of parole officer you know what this expertise and he said he had known both of them for two years and which was also a lie I had only known Susan could have known Susan for 2 years but he knew her for about a year he did not marry pretty well and he never disclosed that he was Manson's parole officer a Manson hide in the same files as the person who lured these women into crimes that they were his communal wives that they would steal for him prostitutes themselves for him and the other people that they interviewed the probation officer are good against it saying they're going to go right back to this guy who's down in Los Angeles and continue the life of crime but the judge released them what they were trying to do was people into the family so they would offer them drugs and and and sacks and lot of women and bring them to these parties and where they screwed up is they got an underage boy who was Rick out right and he was the son of a sheriff so many of these instances where Charlie or members of the family were arrested and then it seems like the police officers who were holding them we're being told hey you got to let these guys go the others this is a higher the situation is above your paygrade and saw that I mean I think describes to arrest that Manson released on a technicality you know the shoddy police work or something when he should have been violated but what he didn't do was talk about three or four more and if you've got enough to chapter 10 you seen all that stuff laid out so when I got this record of a pretty substantial record I took it to someone in Lewis walk neck who was a retired judge and retired district attorney from the valley at around here Van Nuys cuz I needed somebody with the expertise and the knowledge how things work have to look at everything in context things work out differently today than they did in 2009 or 2100 him but he was there and 69 in the DA's office I brought the documents to him and we lay them all out on his kitchen table and he's looking at them in the poor guy was very sick with cancer and the recorder going and he's looking at all the documents and he's seeing this pattern of catch release catch release chickenshit chickenshit this is all chickenshit because he shouldn't he should have gone back the first time because they wanted him out he said he thought he was more important to somebody out than in he goes you got to find out who it was and I go out how do I do that and go you're not going to be able to that's using informant I go but who should I what should I look at because what he was working either for local law enforcement the federal government the FBI somebody wanted him out there doing whatever he was doing so that was important another turning point was a bunch of years later was when I brought similar materials to Steven K who was blue Yoshi's co-prosecutor in the case was an informant that's not just informing on crime and also can be doing the police's bidding that's where the CIA are the FBI part of a program where they're allowing this and also there's speculation that the the goal was to try to diminish the anti-war movement and that this guy was a part of the hippie movement and then so now people with associate hippies with violence and drugs and murder and all this horrific stuff and also there's speculation that the the goal was to try to diminish the anti-war movement and that this guy was a part of the hippie movement and then so now people with associate hippies with violence and drugs and murder and all this horrific stuff</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so you brought up MK Ultra MK Ultra was a government program run by the Central Intelligence Agency originally started as something called Blue Bird and 1948-49 morph into artichoke and then in 1952 became MKUltra was a mind control program a brainwashing program the CIA was trying to learn how to control people's behavior without their knowledge now this is all came Senate and Congressional hearings in the 70s that was exposed but nobody knew about it until 1974 when Seymour Hersh the New York Times Reporter ever put it on the front page of the paper so their main objective was to commit to create what they called Hypno programmed assassins people who would kill on command popularly known as with Manchurian candidates after a book that was written 1962 and later became a movie movie again the people would be through drugs and hypnotism the objective was to get people to go and commit an act of murder against their moral code and have no memory of their programming and be amnesic even of the ACT after-the-fact often that was just one of those are mango but they were also trying to create careers people you know military people that they couldn't plant messages send them you know dangerous areas where they were at that time was the Vietnam War and deliver messages and then have them wipe from their remember in case they were captured that all kinds of objectives so Rodger Smith was supervising Manson when he became exactly what are he was able to do exactly what the mk-ultra program have been trying to create and do for at that point about 15 17 years when it was off supposed in the seventies and there were these hearings first the Rockefeller commission hearings and the church hearings and then finally Senator Ted Kennedy and Daniel anyway held hearings the CIA admitted that they had done this but they know one would say exactly what they did all the records have been destroyed when the two people who ran it Richard Helms would become the director of the CIA in the sixties and dr. Sidney Gottlieb who was kind of the mad scientist 2 had supervised doll that all the plants safe houses in San Francisco New York Los Angeles where they would experiment on people that were lured into these apartments and houses that were either look like brothels or hippie communes or whatever and the people who are working at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic that was run by another Smith which makes it a little confusing but dr. David Smith who founded it he had given and what's to a scientist name Jolly West Louis J West who was when when the killings occurred in the seventies identified as a top and kale to researcher he was an academic come out of the military have been at the University of Oklahoma University at University of Oklahoma sorry and that UCLA running psychiatric division he denied ever being involved in MK Ultra and this was one of the moment. 2001 when you know things really kind of shook the course of my reporting was I learned that West had been at the same place of Manson was in the hate in the summer that Manson became exactly what the CIA was trying to create and I knew lactide interviewed West about 7 years before for a story I did about celebrity stalkers with people who are obsessed with scars and then only to kill them or try to kill them is an expert and violence hypnotism brainwashing and he was a chair of the Psychiatry department at UCLA at that point he was dead when his name came up in the Manson story and there wasn't a lot of I mean I guess it was a lot of Google then or a little bit when I did a little research I found out that there been these allegations that he been involved in MKUltra he always denied it he was never prosecuted never even investigated he went to his grave threatening to sue anybody that said he would have anything to do kind of a program again through another long story but I got access to his files which is been left at UCLA and never been never been processed when I called and went when I made the request it took him two or three months to process the papers I went through them to the whole summer looking for a needle in a haystack and it was intuition God I just thought there might be something there and sure enough I eventually found it it was correspondence between Jolly West and Sidney Godley doctor that ran MK Ultra beginning in 1953 about Kentucky conducting experiments on people without their knowledge to get them to have a musics Asia of the ax after they were programmed and everything that he had been accused of and denied he did not only did he do it he created the blueprint for the whole program of God lead the fact that all these kind of interesting research problems emerged at the hate at the clinic and then Manson came out of it with the power to do exactly what the mk-ultra have been trying to create up to that point I thought was worth investigating further and that's why I kept going and going and going and a lot of crazy s*** back then do you wear of operation would like midnight climax that does with the safehouse play Lordi John's and fees brothels and then dose them up with LSD and studied them yeah George Hunter white was ahead CIA get guy and he would sit behind a two-way or one-way mirror and watch the the John's will be dosed with LSD they try to aerosol or just drinks different things and then they would study their behaviors aerosol sprays play The Wreckers are so scat because Helms order gotlib to destroy all the records in 1973 when the two men left the agency and the only reason anybody ever discovered that it existed was a whistle-blower somebody who used to work for the state department who remembered that there were records in a warehouse and they were just Financial records from the beginning of the program and 52 until the end and the possible and in 73 and it was just Financial records of where research took place how much was spent what kind of equipment was bought but nothing about the content the guy that found that ended up testifying to Congress and working with Seymour Hersh to expose it was named John Marks he wrote the first book about MKUltra that came out in the mid-to-late seventies called The Search for The Manchurian Candidate and after he wrote his book he never you know he spoke to the little bit of a tour and then retreated Into Obscurity and never would do an interview again until I approached them in the early 2000s and when I told him what I had what I had found West files these documents he agreed to meet with me at his townhouse in Washington DC and he told me he said the reason I stopped talking or writing about this is people were camping out on my front lawn you know telling me that they've been victims of MKUltra because I couldn't go anywhere in my whole life became crazy cuz everybody thought that they were subject to this cuz nobody knew they did these drug test on prisoners hospital patients John's hippies people that had no idea this was going on for 25 years so marks became the authority so he had never given an interview till he met with me and when he looked at my documents at that point I think I had about 10 or 12 or 15 pages that grew eventually cuz I kept going back to the files and get him or he said it was the unredacted uncensored account of what the real objectives were and what was really being done had never he said if I had had that my whole book would have been different so that's one of the problems about saying how much did they do or how far did they go there's barely any record and that's another reason it took me 20 years cuz I was trying to find out whether or not West it actually interacted with Manson and was a girls I know he was in the same facility I know that everybody that work there cuz I interviewed everybody that was a lie there most of them were still alive back in the late 90s early 2000s when I did this they all said oh yeah Charlie was eating them we knew it was Charlie in the girls they come in every day or every few days to see Rodger and and West was their recruiting subjects now west while he was there that summer had opened something called what he called the Haight-Ashbury project and in his correspondence and papers that I found he called it a laboratory disguise as a hippie crash pad and and just like the operation midnight safe how they calm safe houses which were disguises Bethea Cordello's and that type of thing or brothels these this was an apartment that was decked out or is he called a tricked-out to look like a communal hippie places six graduate students and I have his letters to them before they came to does grow your hair long wear jeans dress like hippies and lure people in there so they ran that for the summer of 67 and West was getting people from that Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic on Clayton Street and sending them around the corner to Frederick Street to participate in that and and they said idea what we're really supposed to be doing here we feel like this whole thing as a cover for something else what is Jolly want why is he making us bring these people in so I can do to bring people in and drugged programming go on to do legitimate work the ethical foundations of your career or set up in such a strange wife you're manipulating people against their knowledge will they didn't know who they were doing it for that's why they were always questioning at so you know I don't know how I found one or two of them after and they were very careful talking to me I'm sure that yeah that there's no statute of limitations on murder right I mean that's one of the biggest disappointments of my book is that people like West aren't alive you know that to answer for that to answer this and it was really frustrating for me because his name was on the front page of the New York Times in 1977 when they had the major hearings about MKUltra and it identified him as the head of the Psychiatry department at UCLA very prominent doctor researcher and he said he had nothing to do with that he never used LSD on humans and he wouldn't he said they had asked him and he said no I have all these letters between him and the guy who was running the program describing how they're going to do it hide it from his colleagues when he started at he started at Lackland Air Force Base he was running the Psychiatry department at the hospital there 1952 when he was there running that hospital that's when he started his prisoners human subjects and one letter to Gottlieb he says eventually we have to take these experiments out to the field of Jesus exactly does that mean well if you haven't gotten it through a chapter 11 yet you haven't gone to the Jimmy shaver a year after maybe Jamie did a year after I was contracted with the CIA to do these experiments July 4th 1950 for 3 year old girl went missing from the parking lot of a bar at about 11 or 12 at night and her parents with a heatwave they couldn't sleep they went to the bar they brought their two kids they let them play in the parking lot at midnight the little girl disappeared they organize a search party about three or four hours later they went to a gravel pit and two Arrow to Airmen itinerant guys had called the police the local sheriff and said there's a guy here that wandered out of the brush with scratches and blood no shirt and he doesn't know how he got here who he is the police came his name was Jimmy shaver he was in Harriman they did a search and they found a little girl's body not too far away and she had been raped and murdered by this guy who had no memory of doing it the guy no History of Violence had a couple kids and he was a flight instructor at the school he been in the military for a number of years I think it was in his early 30s well guess who became his psychiatrist in preparation for the trial Jolly West who inserted himself into the case and then extracted his memory from him using sodium pentathol where he admitted to the the murderer now in the context of what we found out west was doing and what is detectives were at that same time it raises huge questions about this was an experiment gone wrong you know that he was part of one of these experiments at Lackland Air Force Base where he was signed up during the trial it came out that he had had treatment for severe migraines experimental treatment at Lackland that's another you know smaller subchapter in the book but is it described what kind of experimental treatment he received nobody I mean I have all the testimony of there was actually a treat a trial or jury trial and sentencing and every time it came up it was really frustrating because he never testified so that it was either his wife or his mother who would talk about it was mostly his mother saying well all I knew it was they wanted him to be involved in this two years study to try to relieve his his migraines he would have such horrible migraines he would put his head in bucket of ice water the people who described encountering him that night when he was arrested and immediately taken out of the sheriff's custody by the military police and brought the Lachlan and then back to the Sheriff's he was in a trance the doctors tested him for alcohol cuz he's drunk Uno out just a little bit of alcohol in the system but he wasn't drunk and after the fact they found out that he had I don't want to get into this cuz it's really getting into the weeds but he had hallucinated that this little girl was a cousin who sexually abused him as a child and he was trying to kill her name was Beth rainbow all the stuff came out at the trial Jolly West in 1955 send a report to Sidney Gottlieb which nobody had seen it was another document I found in his files and now it's saying that he had learned how to develop the technology to remove true memories and replace them with false memories and a human subject without their knowledge which was one of the main goals the biggest goals of the MKUltra program it again when the CIA when they have the hearings in the 70s the CIA said nothing was successful everything we try was a failure it was a waste of money we shouldn't have done it and most experts think that that was a cover that they didn't want to admit they that they had developed these technologies that were effective they also claimed that they had released everything they had I found the same report where West said that he had learned how to replace true memories with false ones without a person's awareness but they had remove that from the report and then release it to Congress so that's a crime right there you know there's a lot of that stuff in the book is that this guy through these experimental treatments that they do stuff up with LSD and experimented using these MKUltra techniques and did that to him and then do some sort of this is speculation. I'll go there a History of Violence never been arrested upstanding citizen is only problem with these horrible headaches and he shows up by a small girl's body who been brutally murder with no memory of doing it a year earlier doctor West who became a psychiatrist within a week or two possibly had experiences with them before but there was no record when I try to get the record from the medical center at Lackland his file his name was shaver I think it was essay was missing so where shaver would have been in the medical records it was gone so I couldn't find out whether he'll actually participated in any kind of experimental program that so is the speculation the Genesis speculation that he did commit the crime that he was somehow another induced into committing this crime will go out and do things not even necessarily what to do things against their will against their moral Cody but how would they know that this child would be there how would they do know she wasn't targeted so was it just that they put it into his head to go and downplay anyone was one of the Premier Research new to it he had actually come out of here first gained national attention for being one of four or five doctors who treated Korean prisoners of War who were returned to the United States after they had made confessions of spraying the Korean Countryside with you legal biological weapons the United States so that we don't use that that's against the Geneva codes and these guys were brainwashed by the North Korea Chinese Soviets so when they were brought back after the war West and four other psychiatrists were assigned to de-program them what a lot of researchers believe is that they actually brainwash them into thinking they've been brainwashed by the Koreans where they actually were telling the truth because there's a lot of evidence has come out as recently as 5-6 years ago that we did use these weapons in Korea is that they actually brainwash them into thinking they've been brainwashed by the Koreans where they actually were telling the truth because there's a lot of evidence has come out as recently as 5-6 years ago that we did use these weapons in Korea double cross</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> other big eye opener for what's kept from us at one point 2011 I had a researcher at the Washington Post a woman there who has been there for years so I can get myself in trouble for this to I won't say her name but anyway she's very well known and she's their intelligence researcher she works with all of the reporters at the post on intelligence stories National Security stories and she had someone at the CIA fashion Department who would confirm or deny stuff with her and she said I completely trust these people I've been working with him for 10 years I'll ask them about Jolly West and see what they have on them and I said before you ask them don't tell them cuz she had the documents I share them with her don't tell them what I have proven that he was part of MKUltra just say you're working with an author of the book who wants to know whether there cuz I redone request we can neither confirm nor deny then she said they don't they'll tell me the truth like they're not going to give you another confirm or deny we'll just say we have something and we can't tell you if we can or we have nothing but we'll get the truth to see what they have so a week later she lets me know and she said they said there's nothing he never participated in the program there's no record and I go up and want to say her name I go well I don't think you should be using them anymore because they're not liable and you know that cuz you've seen the documents so she we think that I don't know we know what you did after that's the way they can embed themselves with reporters by letting me know that I'm your friend like I'll tell you the truth it's a complicated world where I keep people safe discuss three Woodson he's the guy that claim to it he'll infiltrator the Manson family no no no no is that after 11 chapters are there 13 including the apologue yeah yeah yeah what's a spook and unfortunately was dead by the time I start a record I wasn't interested listen to some of his close friends he lives in Los Angeles and then he disappear for months doing undercover work and he said we never he would even tell us who we work for but his wife and daughter who were in Sweden and other people who said it was a CIA he told before he died a couple years before his death three or four of his closest friends including his attorney that he had worked on an operation and he wouldn't tell them who but he had infiltrated the Manson family prior to the murders and it was. His dying regret was he could have prevented them but didn't he also said that he was at the crime scene after the killers had left before the police had arrived which was like a four or five-hour window and I was able to confirm not that he was there those five hours but that he was missing and that the police set up watch at his father's house he was living with the try to figure out what was going on he ended up helping Colonel taejon Tate's father who left his job in Military Intelligence to help police in the investigation even dressed up like a hippie dress up like a hippie and soda Reeve and Ray was a really hardcore right-wing guy I mean he was racist and and his daughter sent me pictures of him and she said once he dies in fact this is how serious this guy was he divorce read divorced his wife was a Swedish model first he sent her and his infant daughter back to Sweden from the United States in 61 cuz he thought there was going to be nuclear war and then in the mid-sixties he told his wife he had to divorce her and he couldn't have any relationship with his daughter because his daughter this is only vulnerability because of the work he did that would be how they heard even if they lived all the way in Sweden so the daughter Liza who I've never met but we started talking on the phone and she started sending me materials didn't meet him until a couple years before his death he reached out to her that I couldn't have any relationship with you because of my work but I want to do that now so he Florida Los Angeles introduced her to all of his friends and he died she went to his apartment and went through his things and found a picture of him dressed up as a hippie it's in the book and I mean it's hard to tell but it's in the parking lot and the cars are always late 60s models so this is one of the parts of the book where I work so hard to try to prove that the definite link interview probably 12 or 13 Manson family members and I show them that picture and they say he look like any number of guys you look like any number of guys that that came in and out of there they come for a day to screw us women would say Charlie would bring guys in and we didn't know if they were the ones we're providing drugs or who they were but yeah maybe or maybe not you know and they were all high most of the time too</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the block there's a murder in there that I think the Manson family committed that was covered up by the law enforcement cuz it's screwed up it would have screwed up the prosecution I want that looked into there's also at the end of the book there these texts Watson audio tapes that I found out about in 2008 when Watson turned himself in when he found he was alerted and in Texas he was at his parents house so they call the police call the local sheriff who was Texas cousin and his parents and said he's wanted for questioning in is unsalted murders this is November 29th nobody had been identified publicly as suspects the police were just starting to figure out that these people that killed their victims so to LAPD flew down to Texas Watson was brought into the station question by the LAPD put under arrest they had to extradite I'm so that the sheriff there Texas doesn't put them in a Cell the family call up a lawyer Bill boy who would actually Arizona tax on a college case when he stole a typewriter from a college and a prank Bill Boyd told me an interview in 2008 that that day he had text tell him the whole story or Charles is he called him about how he met Manson why the murders were committed how they happen he said he spoke to me for 20 hours and he goes I've got all those audio tapes in a safe in my office he told me that in 2008 he said he also described other murders that the family had committed that hadn't been connected to them so right away when you're on 2009 working on it that long I thought other murders that's important to me but more important did he tell his attorney why the murders really happen you know why they picked those houses you know this was the first account that was recorded the next one was Susan Atkins about a week later after she had gotten her new attorney that the prosecution planted they audio taped her telling her version which became the official version so Watson's would predate that by a week and when I found out that they were in that safe and he's telling me this on the phone I thought he can't play that to me because that would violate Watson's attorney-client privilege but I thought have to ask is there any chance that's what I could come down and listen to those tapes and he said that's when he realized he shouldn't have told me that all will you I couldn't do that without Charlie Charles Watson Charles permission I go you still in touch with me also I write to him every now and then he writes me he didn't represent him a trial after he was extradited and I thought what you please ask so that began three or four months of me pestering and he would never take the phone call and then finally after 4 months I call open the secretaries and I'm sorry mr. Boys in China on business today and I said what you have to tell him I'm not going to wait anymore I'm going to write to Charles and tell him what he told me I go if there's other bodies I mean I didn't let them know that I was more interested in the motive story but I said if I was interested in the other bodies are victims out there who've never been connected or even the remains were because there's a lot of evidence that there might have been people killed out in the desert and buried there I need to know that and she said okay I'll tell him my phone rang like literally 30 seconds after I hung it up and I had caller ID it was from his Texas office cuz this is Billy boy you cannot call Charles and tell him I told you that I sent mr. Boyd you haven't call me back before Monday cuz why I'm telling you now you can't do that I go well are you going to get his permission I can't wait anymore he says if you do that and you tell him I'll deny ever telling you I said it's all on tape you don't have permission to tape that cargo yeah you gave me permission at the beginning and that's on tape to the goddamn they hung up on me bankrupt and then it was until two or three years later and it's all in there the backstory but I finally went to try to get the tapes again and found out he had died found out that the tapes were in the possession of the trustee who was waiting for the bankruptcy to be evolved over resolved and it took me three or four months of back-and-forth and to try to get them to release the tapes to me and I made an argument for why they weren't protected anymore again long story short I was sharing information with the deputy da in Los Angeles who I thought was friendly he was until he wasn't and he was handling all the parole hearings of the Manson family guy named Pat Sakura the woman who was in charge of the tapes the trustee said it's secure calls me and tells me that it's okay for me to release them to you and explain how it's not a violation I'll do it I said Alaskan so I absolutely I want to talk to her and I said great a day later I got a call from security cuz you're not going to believe that she's releasing the tapes to us I know you because you don't worry I'll let you hear him when we got them then I have lost any kind of control and sure enough number one the trustee had to notify Watson's new attorney Watson put up a fight in court and it's in you can read about the other times I reported on that the year for about a year and one from the local Court of the state supreme court for the judge finally ruled that the LAPD should have the tapes they sent two officers down to get the tapes in 2013 they came back and then nobody at the DA's office would talk to me anymore the promise that have been made that I would be the first one to listen to them reneged those tapes a million journalist have made a Freedom of Information Act request for them they won't release them to Locked Up less mountains attorney want some he thinks it'll help her at her parole hearings because he thinks there's information on there to show that you've been telling the truth all these years he's gone to the state supreme court to other courts they block them down 20 hours first account of how and why these murders occurred and they're not releasing them I think it's because the truth is on there information on there to show that you've been telling the truth all these years he's gone to the state supreme court through the other courts they blocked them down 20 hours first account of how and why these murders occurred and they're not releasing them I think it's because the truth is on there</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is the speculation terms of gliosis connection was he given a narrative was did did you do think that they want to answer that he was compromised when he was given this case in 1969 it's in the book he has family out there but they know about this he was involved in a couple cases the first one before the trial that are crazy I mean when you see the stuff that happened between him and I you know all those years later it makes sense when you see what he was like before he became famous so in 1965 he had his first child Vincent bugliosi junior he decided that he wasn't the father that the Milkman was the father and back in those days you're too young to know people used to deliver milk to home remember hearing about it so he believed that the Milkman was a father he was a whopping coming this Deputy district attorney in Los Angeles and for about I think 12 or 16 months he stalked his Milkman trying to get him to take a blood test to prove that he fathered his wife's child it got so bad that they had to they stop letting their kids take the bus homeschool their two young kids they didn't know who he was he wouldn't tell them who he was all he would say was I was on the Milkman has left the job a month after his wife found out she was pregnant then says why then send his delirium decided that he was fired because he gotten you know clients are people who delivered milk to pregnant so he was writing them Anonymous letters following the kids I actually this is one thing I did hear I heard from the two little girl sent one who's now a grown woman read about this in my book and she sent me a letter and she goes you only got half of it he said he terrorized us he said my father she said my father than what we had a nervous breakdown she said he came to my school and pick me up and and he took me to a toy store bought all these toys me whatever I wanted brought me to the house and he had a driver and he met at the end of the driveway my mom came out and I was like so happy I was like five or six years old I had all these gifts and she goes get into the house getting to the house so what happened was Vince got caught I mean he eventually what was stalking and he sent his wife to the house to beg the milkman's wife to get her husband to do a paternity test and I've done all this from all these civil depositions when it came when the man sued him later Vince that the milkmaid eventually got his brother-in-law to follow them from one of his Steakhouse Pennswoods put the car outside the house he sent them letters like they changed her phone number he goes I noticed you change your phone number that wasn't nice I mean not so the Milkman followed Vance brother-in-law that got the plate number found out who he was and that he was at the DA's office called his personal attorney and the personal attorney called Vince and they meeting between Vince the Milkman the milkman's wife and this is Julio C and then admitted that he had been stalking them because he thought it was his wife here Tuesday as investigators calling this guy a material witness in a murder case to follow him get information private information on Lake big so Vince said he would pay them $100 and never do it again and the Milkman said we don't want your money just never bother us again so that way all about the end of 68 or early 69 the DA's office knew about this he should have been fired immediately instead he gets the biggest case at that point in the history of Los Angeles the tate-labianca trial this is where we get speculative you have a guy like Vince whose compromise he'll do what the hires up tell him to do and if you read in the book Apple younger was a district attorney at the time he was a shady guy who died OSS which was the predecessor to the CIA trained in Espionage don't think too much it's in the book that's where we got speculative it since was answering for something the explanation is because he didn't go into this case clean he had to do what he was told and to this day is the best selling True Crime book of all time and it's a wonderfully written block I mean I could take a page by Page and show your stuff is completely fabricated and made up and that contradicts the real record but you know best seller and that same year then was going to run for district attorney and the Milkman and his wife had never told anyone I guess outside of their family what it happened for 5 before but when I saw that fence was trying to be the most powerful long first person in the city of Los Angeles they went to his opponent and said you need to know this this man cannot get this job so they told the opponent and they had a press conference so the Milkman and his wife went public Vince responded by having his own press conference and telling the reporters here's here's what happened the Milkman We Believe call $300 in cash on my kitchen table when he was on the route so I'm just doing a personal investigation and through reporters that will did you hire let me did you contact the Pasadena Police cuz I know I just wanted to do it on my own and then it's other people pointed out later he was doing this this was 65 he was doing it through the end of 68 the statute of limitations on theft burglary robbery is 3 year it would even if he found out that he had someone the $3 they would have been able to prosecute it so the whole thing went with a live-in slide to the media and he lost the money lost that election then he ran again after Health escape this culture came out for Attorney General of California at that point the Milkman and the wife were going to go public again at the hey we have even more to tell about the Hoosiers I think of what the daughter wants to tell me she actually hasn't gotten in touch with me after the first email I said I want to hear what you have and see she said she's all these. but then a woman named return your car well that she was going to go public to she came out and said excuse me after Vince told the world that the Milkman has stolen $300 for him the Milkman his wife filed a civil suit against pins and Gail his wife because Gail also publicly said with ants in an interview that that's a true that was all about it at this petty theft they sue them for defamation and they settled and then pay them I think it was $12,000 in cash and hundred dollar bills and you know part of the agreement was they weren't allowed to talk about it they couldn't say they've gotten any money and he would only give it in cash so they couldn't trace it to him I ended up getting all the documents that took a long time but I got them then when they went public again when he was running for attorney general they were subject to you know being in violation of that but they said he can't you know them will tell everything he doesn't want to tell he lied under oath and deposition so did his wife about the stalking so in 73 Vince had an affair with a woman named Virginia Cardwell Virginia Cardwell was Catholic she got pregnant she told Vincent that she was pregnant with his child and then said she had to get an abortion and she said I can't get an abortion on the Catholic she was a single mother he said he would set it up he had a doctor it was still illegal and I he he gave her the money to pay the doctor and then he called her and she said she had gotten a abortion everything was fine then he called the doctor violating HIPAA rules the doctor said actually I've never heard from this woman I didn't give her the procedure so Vince went to her house and beat the hell out of her and I've got all those depositions to he he just according to the her Story 2 she reported that he dragged her across the hair about the four by the hair satin her and punched her and punched her again in the face told her she had to get an abortion she miscarried after that episode she went she went to the Santa Monica Police as soon as he left and reported it and nobody would have known about it but the reporter saw it on that you know the police wire service or whatever so the next day it was on the front page of all the LA papers that vents Puleo's he had been accused of battery of a man who said that he wanted her to have an abortion and she wouldn't so Vince went to the police told them she was lying she was a client that he had had one phone consultation with never met her face-to-face and she was trying to embarrass him because he wanted her to pay him two or $300 he defend her like he did the Milkman he he made up a story and worse this time he told that to the police this was an in their investigation of the battery he lied to the police that it did not happen but here's what happened the next day after the newspapers reported it and then said it was a lie and he told the police that Ben's went back to her apartment with his secretary and a typewriter and he held her hostage I know that sounds crazy it's in the book at the end held her hostage for I think three or four hours bagging her and then bullying her like he might hit her then so I can't remember to go to the police and say that she had made the whole story up his secretary was there cuz once he got her to agree to do it she wrote up backdated bill the bill for the money and had Virginia sign it so Virginia finally agreed to go to the police said look you're going to be charged with filing a false report which is a felon it was a misdemeanor but it could go to a felony and you I can take care of all that I've got the connections to the DA's office in Santa Monica what you did and he did take care of it so she called up the Santa Monica Police Department to say she was coming in to report that she had made the story up because she was angry about this money and the cop said right away he knew that something was wrong in the Tremor of her voice is it what kind of got you and Vince was on the other line he said no no no they can't come here this is no no no I'm coming and they said okay we'll see you when you get here and then they dispatched two cops to her apartment now this endeavor in public before I found a did become public about what happened Vince got away with denying it the cop that went to see what was going on in to get her Sunday Michael Landes he was retired in Santa Monica I got his name from the report he said oh yeah pencils at the house he wouldn't let us end he said he and his partner Steinberg were there and she's cowering behind them crying and we got her out of the house prior to the station and she told the the store that it was fake that and he said what we saw him there she goes you have no idea how dangerous he is I didn't I made it up please it was a false report so she got charged the next day's papers reported that this woman to come out and admitted that the whole thing was made up nobody said anything to the cops didn't talk to reporters about fence being at the house and then we know he prevailed he won then when he ran for Attorney General of California and 76 Virginia Cardwell went public and then then said told the same lie about her he'd never seen her face-to-face she was trying to get two or three hundred dollars from him for a phone, do not pay the money for a phone consultation he lost the Attorney General's race when she went public and again with the Milkman and mistress then she sued then dang he lied in the depositions and then when he got caught with the cop the other people who could show that they've been together and there was a history of that had an affair for like six months he was all that and paid her a substantial amount of money to go away so this is the kind of person who when I told Vince I was writing about this in my book he's like the number one I can't talk about either of those cases because they were resolved and there is non-disclosures and I do the things you know that's not true because number one Virginia is dead she had died so she can't see you and she went public and so did the wise owls that the Milkman in the mistress and I wouldn't you know I'm not interested in your sordid you know personal life but it's relevant because I'm arguing that you committed crimes in the prosecution of the Manson family suborn perjury hit evidence you know manipulator the defense by planning an attorney so I if I'm going to you know try to make this case and everyone's not going to believe it because you're Invincible EOC you know this prominent prosecutor author will I have to show that there's a pattern in this Behavior not only that you are lying under oath in the depositions in these two cases before you settle but you also lied to the police in the in the Cardwell case and you lied to the papers and both if I have that in my book then people be more prone to believe that you do the same thing in and the tate-labianca but you would break rules to win your connections did he have a Ghostwriter for Helter Skelter. Collaborate call Vince's wife came to her house and knocked on her door and said please do this my husband's making me crazy we know that he's your husband. Man isn't the father of my my boy but just do it to make him stop and the milkman's wife said we're not we don't want anything to do with you people just leave us alone and go away if you cuz you don't understand my husband is mentally ill he goes he'll never stop that's why there's nothing I can do to get him to stop at the end of our 6 hours I don't know put in the book I might not have he said to me no kill things I have some psychiatric issues and she's been trying to get me to go to a doctor for ever so you know I'm not saying that this is a reason some of this stuff might have happened but I do you know I don't even know why he would tell me that but yeah so I think that he was able to be manipulated because of these vulnerabilities compromised daughter and a mistress for the next 30 Years I interview the mistress I didn't put it in the book you know I didn't think it was necessary I guess now I'm telling it but it actually got reported after he died cuz the Mistress of told a few other people I'd known about her for years and I knew he had a daughter who was you know at the time of Vince's death she was in her thirties I think are you the mistress I didn't put it in the book you know I didn't think it was necessary I guess now I'm telling it but it actually got reported after he died cuz the mistress it told a few other people I'd known about her for years and I knew he had a daughter who was you know at the time of Vince's death she was in her thirties I think</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so these groups were trying to incite violence now we get to the motive of of of the official Narrative of the Manson Murders are the tate-labianca murders which is what the prosecutor vincible EOC presented at trial which was the famous Helter Skelter mode of Manson believed that there was going to be a race war and he wanted to incite this race war because he had convinced his followers that through messages he received from the Beatles White Album from there lyrics from Biblical Old Testament prophecies that he had been told that he was going to be the savior of the world and once a race war started he would hide his family in a bottomless pit in the desert and when the race war ended with the blacks winning the blacks would be frame for promoters they would the Manson family would emerge and repopulate the planet with their perfect top Offspring and dominates the blacks but whether or not it was the motive for the murders is I raised serious questions about the mansard would discuss it in that way that there was going to be a race war and that they would emerge and then their offspring yeah yeah except for the fact that I was questioned so the way Julio C was able to convicted Manson Manson wasn't at the Tate house when the murders happened he had in the official story dispatched Susan Atkins Patricia krenwinkel Leslie Kasabian and tex Watson to the house Palmer House of Terry Melcher they didn't know who live there but just to kill everybody and has mansinthe allegedly said leave something witchy he wanted it to look like blacks had killed these all he did was they were wealthy beautiful whites and he wanted to ignite the race war because of the Panthers got blame for these motors then the police will crack down and then they Revolt the revolution would happen they would be it would spread across the whole world and then when it was over and the blacks had prevailed they were too dumb Manson believed to be able to run the world that's when he will come out with his followers of their hole in the desert and take over the planet now Julio C said in interviews that I didn't have until after he and I stopped speaking which is when he started threatening me with lawsuits and other things in the in the 2006-7 I discovered two or three interviews he gave in the early seventies where he was asked if he believed that Manson really believe this craziness and Lucy Lucy said I don't think Charlie believes in it he got his followers to but he never believed in that he was too smart he was a con man what the interviewers didn't ask him in the follow-up was well if he didn't believe it why did he send his followers to kill these people the first night at the Tate house II night and was valassis the upper middle class the labiancas then you know what was the motive and that's one of my biggest regrets is that I slept and they were kind of obscure when was a pan house interview the other was original newspaper but that I didn't have them I thought I had done all the research I thought I read every interview he'd ever given but I didn't have it at hand to say all right then. I get that cuz I don't think Manson believe it either then what was the motive for the murders why were they sent there to kill and that's what the book Explorer so do you think bugliosi was operating with the knowledge that Manson was apart of these programs that's the big question yet he invited me to his house and Pasadena April of 99 we spent Lily 6 hours together he was so kind and generous time I thought I scored I had the prosecutor hadn't given interviews of he always gave interviews about this but he hadn't for a number of years agree to do it for whatever reason and during the course of that interview you know I arrived at his house went to Kitchen his wife gave me Italian cookies with coffee and lemonade then he and I went out to lunch in the valley somewhere he showed me some of the sites connected to the murders then we went back to the house and cocktail Sunset and towards the end of the six hours I did realize that even though he was talking Non-Stop and I'm recording everything he hadn't given me anything new or different I mean I just finished Helter Skelter I read it for the first time so I never been interested in the case till I got the assignment so I took what we call the Hail Mary pass in journalism which is you ask someone if there's anything they could tell you off the Record not for attribution that will help them to get something fresh cuz I was still searching for a go to the first month of reporting and then kind of thought a minute and then goes turn it off turn it off so I turned off the recorder and he did I could tell he was debating but then he told me something which I'm not sure if I don't think I reveal it to the last chapter is off the record with salacious pretty shocking in the larger picture and it doesn't change anything really but it showed me that he is a very count of something very important in the narrative and I took that away and I thought wow I'm going to delete it was off the Record in 2005 when I interviewed him for the second time and all things went to hell and he started threatening me and with lawsuits and writing letters to my publisher trying to get them to stop the book he wrote about what he told me and he claimed that I had dragged it out of him and embellished it and all this but once he put that in the letter the lawyers at the Publishers that was not on the record anymore because these documents will all be in a Civil Trial when he soon as you what you said he was about to do not off the Record by the police the first day after the murders they found it hidden up in a loft videotape videotaping home video taking was relatively new at that point not a lot of people had cameras but Roman Polanski did and in Helter Skelter Vince says in the book that the police took the tape viewed it and it was just Sharon and Roman making love and returned it to The Loft Roman was in London at the time of the murders he came back immediately and then about a week later he went up to the house and one of the first things he did was he when I pull off and he never even knew that they took it allegedly that that's a story found it and took it Vince told me originally off the Record that the tape wasn't of Roman and China making love it was Sharon being forced to have sex with two men against her wishes and he said Roman was the one who's making it cuz you could hear him in the in the background you know if you ready to pull you read those chapters when we did a lot of bad stuff to Sharon yeah he seem like a terrible person when you hear what he did what the reason why I can never come back to the country go well okay it makes sense it makes once I have that that's kind of the first rabbit hole I went down cuz I'm like well if this was different in the official narrative what else might they have changed so Vince and I were talking on the phone about every week for two months he was so accessible so I'll be interviewing people and one of the first things after that that I found was the perjuries by Terry Melcher on the stand I found I got access to two separate files and found that Melcher Doris Day Saint record producer youngboy wonder who lived in the house with his girlfriend candy Bergen on Cielo up until January 1st of 69 then moved the Malibu and Roman and Sharon moved into the house and February melchior was the part of the motor for why the house is picked and again this is getting into the weeds but it's hard to talk about any of this without the sex position Manson sent his followers up there to instill fear in Melcher by killing all the occupants of his former house who were strangers to them I don't believe that that's the official narrative but melchior testified at the Grand Jury and then at the trial that he had three fleeting encounters with Manson one of these boy drummer Dennis Wilson's to there I think and then one there and then to when he went to the Spahn Ranch in April and m69 to listen to them play music with the possible possibility of recording them and he didn't think they were talented enough and told the trolley that in so many words and then again this is the official narrative that's my man some kind of spy role in one crazy cuz he been rejected by Terry Melcher so he decided it was time for Helter Skelter the race war and again a lot of these things don't add up when you back why did he kill Terry Melcher at the house in Malibu cuz he knew where he had moved to widen just go to this other place and kill strangers maybe Terry wouldn't connect it all that bottom line was Terry on the stand and then all the official Accounts at this case of which there are many nights is helter skelter but lots of books his relationship with Manson ended in May of 69 he said he never saw him again when the murders happened at his former house it never occurred to him it had anything to do with him wasn't Manson I stopped believing that a month or two in and then I found these documents showing that meltra actually had gone to see Manson twice at the Spahn Ranch after the motors and then once all the way out at Death Valley where they had the Barker Ranch where they were hiding when they were finally captured in in the fall of 69 once I could document that that changed the whole I mean it didn't change that impacted the mode of a Mauser was app witness the camp is Charlie wasn't at the Tate house Manson Hut Arbolitos he had to come victim of conspiracy and other words ordering people to go up there and kill and he had to have a reason for that house at Terry provided it by saying yes I did go out there and try to record them and then eventually the question that came out but I never had anything to do with him again I had no idea I never saw him or heard from him motivation was Revenge she was using but it didn't make any sense because Melcher saw him after the murder several times I think you could get away with anything then because the antics of the family at the trial and everybody was so horrified by what was going on nobody was looking at this critically and questioning stuff cuz everyday you know Manson and the girls are getting thrown out of the courtroom for screaming for singing for dancing for mocking the proceedings so all this stayed under the radar but once I could prove that melt relied and then two or three more than I knew that I had to question the entire narrative so fully OC started monitoring my interviewing this is all laid out in the beginning of the book so by the fall of the first year of 99 I got a call from one of my sources Rudi Altobelli with another important witness he was the man who owned the house with murders happen he was traveling he was actually in Europe with Sharon who would come back about about three weeks before to have her baby and Rudy it told me from the very beginning he was very close to Terry Dennis Wilson in the third guy Greg Jacobson Craig Jacobson was another important witness who lied throughout the whole all of us that somebody in the trial just did a narrative needed Rudy had told me that that's called him what are you telling this O'Neill no one was supposed to know about that means promised me it would never come out so at that point I knew that I was onto something even even bigger and then I got a call from Vince and he left a message on the machine saying he wanted to talk to me what's important so I called him back and he said you know I'm hearing can't remember who told me another little game of his he would never be the guy said to me or one of my friends events that someone told her that you're questioning my tactics in my choices at the trial is that true you're not time with what's going on here I go I'm looking at stuff missing you know you knew where this was going I mean I know we haven't talked at that point we hadn't talked for about 6 weeks I think you have I want you to assure me that I'll be given the opportunity to answer any of these questions because what might appear irregular to you as a lay person can be easily explained by me as well of course not definitely swing back around to you before you left and I thought this was going to be out in August and we were in like October I think it'll yeah I got an extension it's a booking that you lied that it's not a magazine so I don't know I'm still getting paid by Premera cuz I was at that point and I had no idea it was going to be a book cuz we're still in the first six seven months so at that point we stopped talking Vince and I and it wasn't until 2005 when I got my book deal that I went back to him with these questions I thought hope naively that I would get him to break down and say yes it was all the CIA operation I was Opera stupid as really freaked out by how deep you got into this he's going to hurt me like I've never been hurt before and he's going to sue me $400 hundreds of millions of dollars is crazy or when you get to the end of the book you'll see the outcome of that day and what happened when he's begging me he's saying he'll give me a quote on the cover of my book if I don't publish this stuff and and then when I wouldn't agree to anything then the lawsuit sweat started happening so I naively I didn't think it was going to break down and say I was working for someone else I had no choice friends but instead he was evasive threatening screaming denying here to recorders I had two recorders he went off the Record every two minutes so we have to turn off all the recorders and then switch not turning his attention in Turner's back I don't know you didn't turn it off wait no that's mine is yours so woman and he's screaming and cursing at me going they were already on because we couldn't keep up with all the off-the-record she's then when I got home that night so I walked out of the house 6 hours exactly almost six hours just like the first time 6 years earlier he's grabbing me by the arm of this isn't quid pro quo this isn't quid pro quo but if you don't put this ridiculous nonsense in because you know a blur from Vince Polly always refer to himself in the third person 1020 times a day mean the man Z goes you'll see that in the book when I get home that night there's messages, call me and he called me I think it's a week we can have almost every day the next morning a few days later trying to he would believe me and then he said this is going to do to my family my kids and all that went on and on and on unless you have them I know I know and then he knew he said when we finally goes at the very very last phone call which is the week and a half later he goes so you really going to go ahead and do it this then I'm going to report what I have I go if you want at this point I thought I had sold the book so he knew I had a publisher I told him who it was and he asked for Hooters name there he said because I will be sending them a letter because I will work on this letter for hours it's going to be a complete rebuttal of everything you argued all of your arguments all your points it's going to ruin you they're going to cancel your deal cuz they're not stupid so he wrote the letter they got it and I think it was June or July after February of that that year 2005 and I got a call from my editor he said you got to talk to our attorneys I hate those we have a letter from fence I go I told you it was coming it's 34 pages single-spaced with 50 pages of attachments and I've never seen anything like this so he said talk talk to the attorney so they sent me over to the attorney and he said my first question. I never met the guy before he was my first question for you O'Neill is is he suffering from dementia I was a law student during the trial and he goes I follow the trial everyday in the paper I've read Helter Skelter he was brilliant because I can't believe the person that wrote this letter wrote that book so maybe you were dealing with somebody who is impaired I said he's mentally ill and have a lot of proof of that in the book he is not the match I go he's finishing his magnum opus a 20-year effort to write a book The rebutting the critics of the information about the Kennedy assassination I was got a book coming out at or and sure enough you know he wrote I think two or three more books after that I go he's just I caught him all of his arguments don't make sense he's contradicting himself that letter goes off in the directions that it sounds like it's written by a Madman I go to going to inhibit us because I don't know where we're opening the champagne 50 pages of attachment of the first letter then about 6 months later another letter I think there were four total I quote some of them in the book it was not and unfortunately he passed away in 2015 or 16 and I get a lot of criticism by Demi to get it from her when he died I know he was sick off and on for a couple years but I've been accused by my critics of not publishing the book until he died because of these threatened I wanted him to be alive I wanted him to be accountable and have to answer to all this the reason I didn't publish it when I was going to polish it was penguin my publisher canceled my deal in 2011 date motive do to get back to the house the main motive is to ignite Helter Skelter race for the sub motive was to instill fear in Terry Melcher because he had rejected Manson so you're saying well then if it wasn't those then what was it all right if you look at the cointelpro objectives which was to to diminish the to neutralize left-wing movement and make them look horrible evil bad and this is what drugs are going to do to your kids the kind of outcome that this these murders had was to make the hippies the boogeyman I mean the biggest Boogeyman in the United States history I don't know forever but at least until the 70s came Charlie Manson and when Manson was and his family were identified as suspects the first week of December 69 I mean it was like Earth shaking because all of a sudden nobody knew who had committed the murders that the case was open from tell first of December you have photos on the front page of every paper in the world of these hippie women you know nursing children living communally who are accused of these horrible brutal slang and the argument was that end with the reporters were reporting was they had gone crazy on LSD and free love and and and the hippie ethic and that was same thing Johnson Control power trying to do their trying to damage the youth Revolution the youth targeted that house though he saying what we have to do this is when they were mostly battling the panther, trying to neutralize the Panthers and La was go after the whites the elite White's the Hollywood white or supporting the Panthers or something called a white panther party that began in La 67 or 68 Jane Fonda Warren Beatty Cass Elliot those three were actually under surveillance by the FBI they were part of this group Donald Sutherland and they were basically a support Leonard Bernstein they supported the Panthers they raise money so in this one, which I think it was the winter of 68 it's got the date said that what we have to make the whites think is that when the revolution finally happens when the blacks rise up they'll be lined up with everybody else and slaughtered so if you look at that memo that was part of their operation which was to they did it by sending letters making you know the whites carrots or if you read the book that this could have been okay I'll Circle until Pro operation to turn you know the world the nation the culture against hippies the left-wing the Black Panthers and they picked that house because it was high-profile because Sharon Tate bought it actually they were like the social Center of Hollywood it wasn't just movie people who was the music people Terry Melcher and Candice Bergen live there for two years before that was a party house everybody went in and out of their kind of represented the elite of movies Music Hollywood you know white people so that would have been a very high-profile place to hit Target Joan Didion wrote in her book The White Album that the morning she learned about the murders and she knew most of the victim she goes it occurred because I knew that the 60s attended they were over I mean there was also Altamont and I mean not a whole lot else but that was like a cultural watershed moment that the morning she learned about the murders and she knew most of the victims who goes that occurred because I knew that the sixties attended they were over I mean that was also Altamonte and I mean not a whole lot else but that was like a cultural watershed moment</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and in the middle of all this isn't do f****** this the lady who said that Biden did something to her now she's saying it was sexual assault yeah but if they're smart they're going to swap by now right now they were wrong before like that here's why they're right now and they're wrong before anybody could come at anybody with an allegation for anybody could come in any high-profile when you say believeallwomen you have to live by that you got to believe Amber Heard tip of his finger on his pictures of the finger and is the audio recordings of the doctor looking for the fingertip they're looking for the tip the can't find the tip like where's the f****** fingertip the room oh my God look at the blood and you can hear them talking and she's like violently sobbing in the background, so they decide to give her three times whatever antipsychotic medicine there aren't that she's on so she's on this this dose they decided jacket up to 3x whatever the doses but meanwhile this I've had him me to do Mustangs to leave all women that's all anybody can can approach something you know the Press with a unsubstantiated allegation but somebody's high-profile I mean I understand that women aren't just willy-nilly lying about something but the picture changes when there's somebody is a politically divisive high-profile figure where there is a huge incentive to knock that person off right Brett Cavanaugh weather is Joe Biden is a huge incentive to derail that person so I think in that instance because I do believe that like most women are not just making things up that being said when you introduce politics there's a whole nother level the whole nother letter for sure I mean man who sexually assaulted women also for sure women have lied about being sexually assaulted those two things are they they're not mutually exclusive they go hand-in-hand right people are liars the people lie about the past on April people also or delusional people are also psychotic and schizophrenic people that try to get out of jail rapist you can't believe all people right you also can't believe all men will you also can't believe all women that's right you been Casey Anthony maybe just as bad as Fulton to pressure right close to the finish line that's weird Lady Gaga thing today with him and Lady Gaga where he's talking about how no one should ever put their hand on a woman and I'm watching this with the cuz I guess Lady Gaga was sexually assaulted but who the f*** is ever going to watch that and say you know what I was going to put my hand on a woman but now I'm not going to go back to that thing looks like Hillary Hillary haircut at look at it, looks a little I was just coming out now I guess people throwing it around now but if you were thinking about hitting a woman and Joe Biden is what keeps you from doing it I guess maybe if you're a woman who's being abused it could perhaps encourage you to go to the authorities right they couldn't perhaps I mean right but I would imagine but by saying but him saying no man should ever put his hands on a woman thinks they should disagree Public Service Announcement all that kind of s*** like okay who you doing that for like who who's out there going out. Joe Biden and he's like don't rape me like the people that we have ruling us I have been exposed as like Creations Rana these people everything they say scripted you know all of them are are in the pocket of big business interests and like and and these people have been exposed so now we don't believe anything</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do all of us in the political world Joe Rogan's political leanings are like the great mystery in Franklin over Biden all these people I just don't think it's a good idea to take some and put them in one of the most propositions the world has ever known that's what I'm saying is not an endorsement of trump is it is a me saying you shouldn't have a man who's clearly clearly in the throes of dementia I mean I'm not a doctor but when you can't form sentences in public and you forget what you're talkin about and you you're you wander off into these conversations if you're not smoking pot if you're not high do not pills like what's going on well there's cognitive decline he's an older man that has mental issues and you know not to be cruel to him he's he's suffering medically this is it is the real issue and the Democrats want to sweep that under the rug and Trump is already to animal parties already dismissing him I mean that there is a recent thing that Kyle kulinski posted a video on his Twitter talking about this is what happened when you don't discuss the elephant in the room and Trump saying used to do it and ask him a question or something to bind Rodeo I didn't write that he's like that's a democratic operative he didn't read it he probably doesn't even know what's going on right now and he's going to he's going to continue to do that and it's it's such a vulnerable point and I I don't know why the Democrats thought it would be a good idea to take someone who's clearly got a problem and this is the guy we've all seen it that's not normal it's not normal to get like when he's talking about the Creator and he literally loses what he saying he's like you know the thing like the Declaration of Independence and the idea that he's going to be able to get through this and be okay on the other side to run the country for for potentially 8 years is crazy here's a better one Epstein FC's killer nobody thinks that if you have various theories are various stories that people come out and talk about with that one yeah and I just actually yesterday listen to Eric Weinstein solo podcast Jeffrey Epstein I love you listen to caught it he he talks about his kind of conspiracy view of it I wish I was there I would have been faster because Eric is too smart he's almost like to smart is one of those guys you talk to him I call you poor bastard you're burdened your burden trying to make sense of the world around Apes you know and all the trauma of an idiot like we were talking about he still also the 13 the twenty-year-old kid so you seeing hit a few run-ins with authority which makes it which makes him suspicious of authority and I think the r life experience defines that so you can see I've seen in a lot of different ways depending on how you've experienced but if you were there quite a lot of people that have met Epstein basically she took a picture with him your reputation is Tainted he was good me know how many people I don't mean to make it sound positive or negative it is what it is is the devil's going to be Charming so the other thing is he genuinely showed curiosity towards scientific ideas even out there big scientific IT specialist but maybe just look at it from the perspective of is the big Theory the big Theory right is that he's some sort of a intelligence operative right so he's an intelligence operative his job to try to infiltrate the scientific communities and there must have been a directive if he really is an intelligence operative is not like they like hey interest Big Love of science just feel free to do that in the side know what what what the f*** was he doing if he's an intelligence operative what is it that the intelligence having sex with underage girls we can't be that you know this is one reason people believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of them were true with you with the Epstein case like you were one of the first people that mean as a literal you're a professional skeptic and you looked at the evidence you like well you know what this might be a conspiracy you know I might be a conspiracy it's probably a goddamn conspiracy there's been enough of them about that one because after I posted something about the other two cameras broke or whatever somebody wrote me from that prison saying all those cameras are always breaking inconsistent with hanging and much more consistent with someone strangling you include including the actual area where he was hanging from supposedly like it is consistent with someone strangling you from behind not consistent with you hanging by your own weight after Weinstein got his is Harvey Weinstein got his conviction I thought they better have a real suicide watch on this guy play more incriminating to him though you know I think what he's got is probably hey I had sex with all these starlets and turn them into big celebrities and is I bet he probably doesn't want that out especially at this stage of the game nothing I don't think I'm going to make him look good and I think the thing with Epstein is he knew way too much about too many powerful people there's just some so many connections it could be made with that guy and that you know what to do gay people are asking questions that people like Bill Gates don't want to answer prince Andrew or any of these people they like to get you know I don't want to talk about this yeah by Gage but prince Andrew of course find out if it's true Bill Gates flu in the Lolita Express cuz that's what I was reading today there people trying to ask Bill Gates but it's so hard to know what's true and what's not true today that's the thing is there's so much data and so I mean one of the things that's really sad about the loss of respect for mainstream journalism and mainstream media is what we count can't count on them and who's regulating the independence who's regulating these websites who's regulating his people that are just you know so called independent journalist they're just tweeting things and finding things putting things up on their website says it's so hard to tell who's telling the truth and who's not do you want to see people piss in America fuc with football f*** with LSU football or Georgia football college football see what happens you think things are bad now f*** with the college football you know this is a weird time to because right before the election you know election comes in November or imagine if it was going on right now and elections like next week your boy Bernie dropped out yep Rap by Nate Bean Trump know that's your bath that's the guy it shows you how crazy the system is that they wanted him but they wanted Vidant it to to be there guy that they don't they can't admit that he's in cognitive decline all the time I speak for a living I f***** up all the time phuckable time to but we're also talking Library hours and hours and hours at a time if I had a prepared thing that I was doing like I stand up I don't fuk up in a sharp as f*** if you haven't worn those conversations they're asking you if someone wants to ask me questions about things that I understand like MMA or like comedy like if you want to ask me questions about things that I think about it and talk about all the time if you're blocked on but yeah I can talk to you and really clearly about those things and make a lot of sense he can't dad about politics and he's been a politician forever and that's your s*** he's he's and you know he's a guy who's suffering is in Decline and they going to try to win them out and whoever his VP is weather is Kamala Harris or whatever, maybe whoever it is but that's who you're voting for because of the timing of this right now we're in the s*** right where the April s*** is the worst time of the corona lot of people are dying this a slight drop off in New York people dying less today than yesterday slight drop off yesterday from the day before so things are looking pretty good California I can be hopefully everything's up and running again economy starts coming back on track Trump makes a couple of great speeches about Biden is more indecline it's not going to get better nose those two face off Trump's going to light him up like a Comedy Central roasts already dismissing him he's there he's like he's asleep Biden saying like someone said Biden said that he didn't write that was Democratic operative he probably doesn't even know what it says destroy a three-year-old is true</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I was a conspiracy not or if I was a country that was conspiring to take over the world this is not a bad way to do it I don't think that's happening right now I want to be real clear but it's kind of the same result that we're experiencing right now we're the ones being forced to shut down with who-knows-what consequences but it's also the right thing to do so we're all like whoa you know it's another one of those things about being a person the right thing to do still feels crazy since I was like all right we're just going to sit around and I guess that's what you have to do you know it's kind of in one way encouraging is so many people are willing to stay home and people aren't rebelling like f*** you this is my country I'm going to work I'll take a chance everybody's going to get it anyway f*** you weigh less people doing that when you consider that the government is controlling 320 million people pretty crazy almost everyone's complying with staying home is only a few essential businesses and we're going to have to I think really have spacesuits to leave the house and work goddamn not going to probably be like this is metal plastic thing that wash off you're sort of saying like I I look into the future to see where we're headed and I don't see a really see much out there cuz I don't know where it is but it's not anything good cuz there's nothing there and I'll see like going to the movies again seems like that's probably close to out movies were already dying anyway they've already opened up the Billy like put those right into your house between bucks perfect way better yeah I don't know that it's just that those are all the fun things we used to do so I f*** it's also once everything's in place where they can treat people effectively and they have the adequate number of ventilators then are we going to go back to the way things were or we going to have new standards and place I don't know I don't know man that they look they did an unprecedented thing they locked down the entire country to save people's lives never happened before we're in New Territory and you know it's dangerous when a moron like me is making sense when I'm one of the people talking about something like this give us your take on how we got here because this is it's been very strange obviously the president completely miscalculated what was going to happen in the way he was explaining it to the news he was kind of saying that it was just a few cases and they'll be gone and now obviously New York City shut down the entire country is separated from each other everybody is isolating at home give us your take on how we got here will let you know that the truth is we knew this was coming or something like it we had a heads-up and and even a even a heads up before last year because this is now our third major coronavirus disaster of the 21st century we had what's called * severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 that started in China terrible epidemic in Toronto and actually took the the Rolling Stones to do a concert to bring the economy back to Toronto in 2003 and then it was mayor's coronavirus infection and 2012 and this is the third one so we actually do realize that coronavirus is we're going to become a new thing and we embarked on a big rotavirus vaccine program a decade ago and each time Parker so the point is this sung fortunately is becoming me normal for the globe is terrible coronavirus epidemics and we saw this one coming up and at the end of 2019 in China and I knew we're in for trouble because that's what coronavirus is do weather to was this the other two SARS and Mayors now we called this new Once ours too so the reserves one than mares and stars to so both stars 1 and mirrors made you so sick and that's such a high case fatality rate that anybody who got it was almost immediately hospitalized and basically out of the community that the difference with this one ironically is it is it's pretty lethal it's about five to ten times more lethal than regular hello seasonal flu but also there's a big group of people who don't get very sick at all and so you have this Serta Perfect mix where it's not the most lethal infection we've ever seen it's not the most transmissible infection we've ever see but it's high enough in both categories that are combined in this very toxic waste so what you have is you have a group of people who are getting very sick or in the Intensive Care Unit like older people those with diabetes and high tension even a group of younger people who are getting it very sick and then a larger group who only getting mildly sick who could still walk around the community and be out and about and stores and restaurants and infecting everybody and so this is what caused the problem it's a it's highly transmissible news on big group of people walking around spreading it and a smaller subset but a big sub said we're getting very sick and even dying in intensive care units what's playing on in New York City right now. What it whatever is stopping people from funding medical research I hope they open up the floodgates now I hope they realize you need more of these guys and then you a lot more money and they need to be way ahead of this s*** we have because this is one pandemic there are multiple different scenarios of how this happens again sure will there was another guy that died recently on a bus that they are identified as having a completely different bars in China but he got a virus that specifically hasn't jump from human-to-human it's only jump from rats to humans in the way it jumps from rats to humans is by ingesting animal feces or animal urine you know animal fluids somehow or Another live bat fluid in his body in and was dying on this bus and they pull the guy off and then you test positive for a totally different coronavirus it's killing him you think would happen I can imagine some guy gets Corona and he's got it f****** bad systems are shutting down this is it he's going to die and he wants to have sex again but he doesn't want to get anybody sick as dogs I think I cracked it and what if it's only his dogs but if everybody has to come to his ass in front of his dog we tried f****** a bunch of different dogs is there's no way to recreate this thing as we f*** Marty Marty but I thought Marty now we're all going to have to f*** Marty people everyday outside to Marty's house killing people to come too many times for Marta needs a break does it help if he blows you have put peanut butter on my deck see what happens no no no everybody's like the pounds or empty every dogs oh my God realize that freedom is itself an export and one of the great dangers is the China has been exporting the benefits of freedom from the United States into an authoritarian system so that they get the benefits of Both Worlds they get the benefits of our middle finger which I think is the secret of American innovation and they get the benefits of authoritarianism where they can do things that we can't because they can order people to do the unconscionable so my feeling is I'm on team civil liberties and team civil liberties have to be somewhat nationalistic more militaristic more command-and-control like who would you take orders from so in a lot of fields I take orders from you you're the big dog in the space you know and to the extent that you wanted to coordinate something I would use my channel I would subordinate to you and I would want sometimes people to subordinate to me if I have if I was taking a lead on something important when we have this fear of leadership because we're all so individualistic that we never want to take a note like whenever I'm training a new assistant or something one of my best practices is can I get your coffee you know it's very important to show that the ability to ask to serve somebody else in the ability to lead art I have to be a follower to be a leader in a liter to be a follower you can't you shouldn't be one of the other we need right now a more war we need more of a war footing we need for President we need we need War Senators we need people of this mentality because the nap is coming to an end and I do think Nancy Pelosi needs to resign and Bill de Blasio needs to resign I think that this Administration you know made some good moves and fumbled the ball and I believe that past administrations made some good moves and fumbled the ball and the imperative is to stop back propagating what you want to have what you want us to do like defeat prisoner's dilemma and come up with a lie that would cause us to act selfishly ration like if you tell me that a mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled then the ideas I okay so I guess I won't use the mask yeah because you lied to me in the idea that that's what you're trying to do to get you to do what I want like if you tell me that the mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled then the ideas I O Okay so I guess I won't use the mask yeah because you lied to me in the idea that that's what you're trying to do your fingers trying to say what would need to be true to get you to do what I want</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> who's originated the Surgeon General right now at Redfield I don't know I'm sure he's a competent physician I also think that there's a whole thing about pretending that masks don't work masks don't work in the general population please don't buy them or Healthcare people need them that is nonsense it's deadly nonsense deadly physician killing nonsense everyone I mean what we have is a situation in which we knew that the mask and personal protective equipment supplies are wildly off to say nothing of ventilators in ICU beds and now what do we do about it so we have rules like please don't bring masks to work because it's the patients or please don't wear homemade masks because they might actually be more germ-filled virus felt so you're back propagating what you wish to be true to get the action that you're looking for what we have is a prisoner's dilemma for everybody runs and buys up masks who like the people we need to be protected most of the heroes were actually dealing with covid patience and taking huge amounts of viral load so there's no question in my mind that those those are the people that is a society if you would level with us like there's a speech to give which would go like this my fellow Americans as Readiness are I am forced to Tender my resignation effective Friday this week I have failed to heed many of the warnings in our academic literature because our reserves are severely depleted imperative that we not suffer further loss of life and therefore I am forced to make an unusual request having failed you I'm asking everyone who stockpiled masks for personal use to think about doing something sacrificial for the good of us all our heroes are currently exposed to the coronavirus and taking huge amounts of viral load and I'm asking you to donate any unused masks that you have to this population as we are desperately trying to reach how much are stocks please continue to shelter-in-place and recognize that the benefit to you is minor in the benefit to us all as major and this will be following your heroic impulse to bring us back together as a nation this is it if that's where we are then it's time to revolt revolt I'll let her know what we need people to visit civil Civil Disobedience to put our Healthcare people I have not been off my property for weeks the reason I'm here in part is to do what little I can and it's very little to support the people who we who are literal heroes are life-and-death putting this out themselves In Harm's Way idea for Hospital administrators abusing our physicians and nurses makes me apoplectic with rage the fact these people are told that they can't talk to the press and they write to me in there their family and the children write to me my mother was asked to do this my Uncle Works in a prison he's not allowed to wear a mask is not allowed to bring a mask I send a message Baba blah blah blah for us to remember that we have the ability to turn over government this is we are so unprepared as a nation and we've been sold out for so long by our self-appointed leadership class who nobody wants that we either remember who we are and how this game is played at me this is like this is a pre-war footing and this can easily lead to war the transmission mechanism is you have everybody stay indoors because you're worried about deaths of accountability which is you know I don't think they're worried about the number of deaths I think they're worried about debts that the result from triage and that would result in career-ending action this is what you would say on the phone that you think that's really what's bothering them yes and then but if y'all have to stay home while they replenish our supplies then the economy goes into recession recession can become depression depressions the darn conflict in our armed conflict leads to war that would be a transmission mechanism from these stupid masks something that nobody can handle and my here's the thing we are coming up on Passover and we Jews have a tradition that I wish everybody had which is that we read one stupid story every goddamn year just a drill it into your head to make sure it's always fresh and this is when it's time to leave when it's time to change don't wait for the bread to rise this is what I say to every Jewish person like are you sitting around waiting for the bread to rise because they all know the story which is you eat the goddamn that's because the people who waited for the bread to rise are no longer with us their descendants are no longer with us and it is time to revolt this leadership class is unworkable to reason that you and I both came to the word Tulsa instantly. I don't think you took much deliberation is because Tulsi would know what to do when she's also the least encumbered she's at least burdened by everybody everybody in the system hates me yeah you know in the whole point where she would put heads on Pikes this is the moment for heads on Pikes and its importance of Vengeance thing the importances what is the cost to you killing people by failing to heed the academic literature if if a supply was was depleted and you didn't replenish it what is the cost to you there's lessons in how other countries have of you this and how they chose to act particular South Korea South Korea acted quicker smaller population than us but a much more impact the virus they shut things down very quickly yeah yeah and making sure that they visited anybody was known I mean they had a different system and it is people like you and me who loved our civil liberties I believe it in part Singapore's Draconian Society lives off of things that only we can do to our freedom so you have to realize that freedom is itself an export and one of the great dangers is the China has been exporting the benefits of freedom from the United States into an authoritarian system so that they get the benefits of Both Worlds they get the benefits of our middle finger which I think is the secret of American innovation and they get the benefits of authoritarianism where they can do things that we can't because they can order people to do the unconscionable so my feeling is I'm on team civil liberties and team civil liberties has to be somewhat nationalistic more militaristic more command-and-control like who would you take orders from so in a lot of field I take orders from you you're the big dog in the space you know and to the extent that you wanted to coordinate something I would use my channel I would subordinate to you and I would want sometimes people to subordinate to me if I have if I was taking a lead on something important we have this fear of leadership because we're all so individualistic that we never want to take an order like whenever I'm training a new assistant or something one of my best practices is can I get your coffee you know it's very important to show that the ability to ask to serve somebody else in the ability to lead art I have to be a follower to be a leader in a liter to be a follower you can't you shouldn't be one of the other I need right now a more war we need more of a war footing we need a war President we need we need War Senators we need people of this mentality because the nap is coming to an end and I do think Nancy Pelosi needs to resign and Bill de Blasio needs to resign I think that this Administration you know made some good moves and fumbled the ball and I believe that past administrations made some good moves and fumbled the ball and the imperative stop back propagating what you want with what you want us to do like defeat a prisoner's dilemma and come up with a lie that would cause us to act selfishly rash look like if you tell me that a mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled then the ideas I go okay so I guess I won't use the mask because you lied to me to get you to do what I want what he saying so if I say for example let's imagine that I don't want to put seatbelts in cars okay and I say you know Joe a seat belt could trap you should your car go into the water off of a bridge you could infect die from the seatbelt because you become entangled it would not be able to save yourself with this map thing but that masks actually can contain are viruses and they can pull. Can kill you but you believe that that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to say is a related rate problem let's talk about everybody gets sick and dies from contaminated masks everybody gets sick and dies from a false feeling of safety let's just go through a huge list of every bad thing or in terms of I don't breathe in either aerosolizer droplets whatever blah blah blah The Chew are real but you're focusing on like the seatbelt deaths of entanglement because you actually have a covert agenda and like and you're going to think I don't know exactly but if I had to speculate we're terrified of triage deaths deaths that occurred simply because we didn't have enough resources that was mandated to be stockpiled or talked about in the literature that's one thing that is what is liability which is all we were following the surgeon general's recommendation at the time now somebody suddenly found you know I like all the masks in the world I think that the Surgeon General would suddenly said the science would become conclusive because there would no longer be a worried about liability you just get those masks that meetball you'd get the mask to the people who need them and then you stopped transmission slow transitions transmissions by there's also a lot of just figuring it out as they go along there is figuring this out as it goes along as regards The Mask I believe that everybody knows that masks save lives on balance they know that the people who need the most have very weird rules there's this whole thing that the States versus the federal government there's this issue about price gouging and price mechanisms there all sorts of things stopping the mask problem from being sorted out one of which is the masks that are produced in China in the fact that we may have sent masks and personal protective equipment to China so there's a huge issue of accountability and responsibility and that we're back propagating our response how much we quarantine and how much we locked down what are we saying about about what the why the positions are being told not to wear masks when they're seeing patients A Deadly nonsense structural nonsense and it people like you and me don't call this out using like these crazy channel that we have then the narrative just stands until partially what we're doing is a parallel sentence making operation to the standard media which is Twitter said we will now be removing tweets if you contradict official authoritative Health sources so that's just what I did surgeon general's line sense-making operation to the standard media which is Twitter said we will not be removing tweets if you contradict official authoritative Health sources so that's just what I did surgeon general's lying cdc's line who is lying come at me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I have not been off of my property more or less in two weeks so it's crazy to see another human being the dogs get close to each other go back like let's say the end of July everyone announces we got this thing lockdown we have a viable treatment it's no different than the flu and get you this chloroquine with the Z pack or whatever the current treatment is tongues were almost like just acquaintances I don't think that's a good idea still cold and cooties and all that but I think I think everybody's losing their s*** they definitely are I've been talking to a lot of friends that are on the extremely cautious I'd say that and you know they're not going anywhere and they're wearing gloves and masks when they step outside their house to go do some in the backyard and they put the gloves and mask down and they spray it with Lysol and come inside and it's not healthy and it is also healthy I mean the idea that we have not been tested in so long it's good to remember also that the stuff is live and real and it is always been live and real and you know if it was possible to live without the stuff that would be one thing but the 75-year nap that we've been in since 1945 is itself the greatest threat to all of us in our preparedness is just a wonderful indicator where you actually get to see this is the koala your experts this is the quality of your leadership this is what they look like when put under stress that's true right that is a good that's a good thing and I'm impressed with the medical community I'm impressed with the people that are recognizing that this is a huge problem not so impressed with the administration of all these hospitals that have them prepared and terms of like masks and ventilators and a lot of these other things not so impressed with politicians but also it just seems like everyone you said was in this nap State and hadn't really been tested and really globally no one has been tested since the pandemic of 1918 like this right 68 which I had I had the Hong Kong flu and 57 we're sort of the best parallels to this you got the Hong Kong flu and I had the Hong Kong flu and was sick as a dog I was like three two from 68 to 70 remember it oh yeah and I was in San Francisco my Grandma had to come up from LA to care for me it was it was bad there's like one of my earliest memories and 1657 I think are the best comprable to this before we go back to 1918 and almost nobody remembers these things because very weird many people that never heard of The Conch conch flu when I started talking vaguely remembered it until you just said it one of my 52-54 remember the Hong Kong flu but I do you know what I mean like I don't remember it personally know you as a health geek are up on these sorts of things that so you understand the ways in which you know for example you can never flew where the I guess the cytokine storm you know is you're either the threat from your immune system is like bigger than the virus itself or all of these various things that happened but I think that this let's call it the big nap the big nap is itself the greatest threat to us in this is this is bad but it is also a shot across our bow and it ain't this what was happening in my mind when I was on here talking with the twin nuclei problem of selling Adam we didn't stop history is not like we're past Atomic were like we figured that out we just we just hit the pause button for a little while we hit snooze and the fear is also that nefarious play will take this opportunity to a road civil civil rights to Road civil liberties and then China to gain power in the US market to gobble up a lot of stocks why everything is down and try to increase their stake in our economy and try to push you know his hands lovingly around her throat because our Elite have been moving into greater and greater States of China dependence right and so with the BDSM community refers to his breath play and I don't like it I run plays like he kind of like half choke somebody how do you know that not that huge hierarchy rules and my claim is is the China is they Supply so much of our stuff we moved all of our manufacturing base into these crazy supply chain and we are completely dependent on a strategic rival and inner China is very careful if you remember when they when they hosted the Olympics to have these amazingly impressive displays that are always friendly what they're really saying is we have our s*** together and you don't and our system was hackable it was open as long for example if you have a company that has Duty twitch shareholders that the directors of the company must do whatever whatever is in the best interest of the shareholders and everything else doesn't matter then you can have a situation where a director has to move things to China because that is in the best interests of the shareholders even if it's absolutely not in the best interest of the United States this is what Ralph Gomery who used to head this phone Foundation once said in an address I was at at the National Academy of Sciences he just said as a director I am incentivized to do exactly the wrong thing for the United States of America so I'm going to put one hat on and tell you as an American we must not move all of this over to China and then I'm going to put my directors hat on I'm going to vote to move everything over to China because I have no choice and so you know Essence the smart good people all 11 of them we're always fighting this thing about you cannot become to China dependent and it's during the big nap there was no way to make this argument convincing you couldn't say look we have a serious strategic Problem by your gate continuing moves to bring China in is the solution to every equation we can't balance and that that is really the problem is that there wasn't any ability to say we are way too dependent on a strategic rival you saw this at the beginning of the pandemic everyone was afraid of what I don't want to be. Is that a phobic I don't appear like Chicken Little until all of our friend the nutcases the marginal weirdos the supposed grifters and gadflies are the people who most got this one right and early and all the respectable people like Nancy Pelosi telling people please go to Chinatown to celebrate the Chinese New Year Bill de Blasio of New York City despite Coronavirus get out there let you know. Leave your lives don't don't let this thing hold you back these people need to resign Nancy Pelosi should resign is one thing to say we don't have enough information about this it's another thing to say take the information that's coming in disregarded and get back in there and keep fueling the economy this is exactly our leadership class there probably think about this in short-term you can Onyx be the long-term implications of us off shelter play nobody can compute the consequences of not one person in the world knows what happens when you run this experiment the made-in-america argument was always like sort of frivolous almost xenophobic like why do you want things made in America what do you care do you not do not like people from other countries do not want to buy things from other countries it was like this made of it made in America thing was like people to disregarded it in a lot of ways but when you realize that all of our medical supplies like Soma Tomar Electronics so much of all of the stuff that you need to kind of keep things exactly the way they are it's cheaper to make it over there because they will like what we saw at Foxconn but they put Nets around the building to keep people from jumping off and eat the weirdest things people trying to argue that the suicide rate at Foxconn was essentially the same as a suicide rate in the general population talking about that's where they work there's Nets around where they work is so many people where they work jump off the building to end their life because their life sucks that bad that they kill themselves at work so rare it is to kill yourself at work probably pretty f****** rare you know, that is where you have to put Nets around the building and look we're getting really tired of people going to the roof and jumping off cuz it's the easiest way to kill yourself they're going to get more creative yeah the problem is we are all hooked up to this or cheap product profits when we can't figure out how to innovate enough to actually create the juice in her own system and therefore we have to rationalize so we've gotten into this idea of every year we have to have a newer better piece of electronically if you had to go the rest your life with an iPhone 11 how much would you suffer not that much although I would say that many of us are not that excited about the next phone that would that that itself is an antiquated rabbit what I'm saying is like to why can't they make it so that you can just fix this I mean like who the f*** fixes their phone you don't fix your phone you bring it into going back to like the questionnaire I think you not depression-era thinking it's like why can't things be sustainable the plants obsolescence in the need to update so that you never a problem if you need growth to power your system then in a weird way it makes sense not to build the optimal phone because if you were to build the optimal phone and then people stop renewing everything your system stay in your system weirdly breaks down so it makes sense that the levels of the phone that you wouldn't want to do that but weirdly in aggregate if you can't start innovate if you can't figure out a restart innovation in a big way now you're stuck with either having to learn to live in steady-state which none of us Americans have no program for living study state we need growth that was the whole point of the embedded growth obligation idea that it's suffused throughout every institution every Pension Plan assumes growth right all right so now we have this problem where we don't have the growth and we need the growth and then in a weird way the planned obsolescence is like fake growth it means that we're going to re-buy our phone even as if they were now highly Innovative so there's like a weird way in which we become dependent on nonsense where we don't have the growth and we need the growth and then in a weird way the planned obsolescence is like fake growth it means that we're going to Bree by our phones even as if they were now highly Innovative so there's like a weird way in which we become dependent on nonsense</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> 2004 have there been plans implemented to clean up and also restore waterways and all the different absolutely absolutely in now there's like a whole they realize this is an issue until there's a there's precedent there's very much so and and that largely came from what we saw you know in those early years the 2004 first stop on down there on Dexter Canyon Creek and then what we had on Ciara's all my partner was shot 2005 about then we started also see the bear poison Cindy's grows like the carbofuran bottles and just to give a background this stuff is so deadly it was made as an insecticide rodenticide just to kill anything that you put on any type of Agricultural Product and it was made originally back and I think like the 50s for legitimate Agriculture and then when they found out how toxic it was NEPA Bandit from you sore even possessions felony to have in the country and use it anywhere without special licenses through legitimate channels Ali banat like 15 years ago cuz I was so nasty but because it does keep everything off the marijuana plants I mean nothing can even get near it without dying almost instantly they still get in third world countries they can get it in Mexico and it gets smuggled across the border with the groups that the drug trafficking groups because it's so effective regardless how poison it is and we were starting to see more and more of that stuff as we were starting to grab more of a specialty to do in this job more you know thoroughly and safely and get into the cleanup of this is one of them I brought this up with Dan Crenshaw the other day and I talked about you and because he's against federally making marijuana federally legal and I said one of the problems with it being illegal is des and I was explaining these grow-ops at for the rest of the country where marijuana is illegal by the vast majority it like what was the number that you said the percentage that was his grown in California that's illegally sold through the rest of the country 70% marijuana population or marijuana product that you're buying if you live in in place like South Dakota went wherever I don't even know it's legal in South Dakota where is the illegal they're buying it from here exactly and it's because one of the reasons because our state laws say that won't first while we're close to Mexico so the cartel members can come up really quickly drive and then the other problem is that our state laws when we made marijuana legal recreationally here weeks severely lower the penalty for any legal grow-op became a misdemeanor correct that was the that was the thing you know when we started the the Department's special team that the spec ops marijuana enforcement team that had more goes into part of my job is being the co-founder of that and a team leader was Outreach so I was speaking to legislative groups before we legalize under prop 64 than the tide or medicinal marijuana laws that that came about that same time and I was talking to conservation groups that you and I would be I'll be part of preservation animal rights groups high school kids new assemblies right watch out you know if you're using weed make sure you're not using this stuff cuz it's so nasty things like that and my whole point was if we're going to regulate guys we see a common let's just regulates Mark let's not lessen any penalties for the trespass grow that the cartels are doing our public lands of private lands and also the other game groups and there's there's other groups you know that to a smaller extent but unfortunately when we did regulate and all that was passed two years ago they did Watertown so public land cultivation went to like you said it a felony to a misdemeanor and if you're at juvenal cultivator on public-private land in one of these juvenile you know cartel members and there's a lot of young ones learning if it's an infraction and that took a lot of emphasis away from that part of the problem and left us out there basically alone with a couple other agencies to fight it for the average person that would sound before you knew about the cartel that would sound like a good idea at will hey if marijuana is legal was probably had a big deal exactly the other problem is these people that are buying this marijuana in the rest of country it's highly likely that they're going to have some of that pesticide on it right and how bad is that stuff is that stuff ever killed someone from smoking this it legal marijuana we don't know if it's killed anybody directly because by the time it gets distributed throughout the country does dissipate a little bit but it's still highly toxic to put it in perspective about three years ago we had two Federal officers back he's not even in California in a public land grow that had all that toxic on it so they have cartel grows out there they do they do they actually Crow we have them in about 20-25 or 27 other states to a much lesser extent and something we need to look at is California I mean we're one of only six Mediterranean climates in the whole globe so we are great weed growing stages like our wine industry man we got great great weather for it so we can grow outdoor indoors I mean February almost December right and that's why it's growing here and that's why the black market Dothan you know the private land communities in the cartels are everywhere across the country with this stuff but they'll go wherever they can until you know diversify the network so we do have it in other states to a much lesser extent and it's something we need to remember is even though about half the country has these grows in mm2 to a lesser extent than California the same groups are under the same Enterprise they're doing human trafficking doing gun-running you know to fuel the fight down to Mexico methamphetamine production and now the new synthetic fentanyl that's just killing thousands especially on the East Coast are coming from these group so it's all one enterprising of course we focus on the Cannabis issue because that's what the factor while Lancer waterways it's right at the Hub so yeah it is it's it's Nationwide it's not a California problem and we may be really really careful even though we're talking about a team in California game wardens we're trying to tell when they the Cannabis issue because that's what the factor while answering waterways it's right at the Hub so yeah it is 6/8 Nationwide it's not a California problem and we may be really really careful even though we're talking about a team in California game wardens we're trying to tell a nationwide story because the nation needs to know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> first time I went to Japan with house paint until we go home and literally take one set of clothes out of a bag thrown in another bag and leave so we got to Japan and on this particular trip I brought my girlfriend at that time and I think Danny didn't leave his own homie or whatever but I'll be brought a bunch of guests and it really gets through customs and as I'm getting through customs the guy reaches into his one jacket I have any closes hand out and there's this I'm not going to but he's like what is that and I was like what can you speak English cuz he said it in Japanese so I said okay okay what is that was like my brain just was like well f*** man just stand looks like weed so it looks like weed you know I just f****** owned it that's just a little right f****** taping the f****** finger like I have like my my lady everything at the time everybody got the strip search they never strip-searched me they searched everything I had all my bags everything right they tested one nug of weed whatever I end up after several hours the record label paid off whatever their to pay off we got into the country and we're able to do our tour and the point in the story there was a f****** hate my guts the whole f****** Bunch when we get to the hotel I'm unpacking my back trying to figure out how the whole f****** thing happened and looking at the jacket and I reach into the pocket that was as nothing in there I think that's crazy I reach into the other pocket of the jacket I pull out a f****** ounce of f****** weed they never looked in the other pocket of the jacket but at the last tour like had enough left over just throw it in the pocket not thinking about it on one side for a long time but I got it I called the whole I called everybody that smoked in the crew down to the room after that and I was like your check it out man I really didn't mean this to happen but I probably had more good ass f****** weed in Japan than anybody at the time stop and think of that moment that moment if they didn't go in that one pocket and it went the other pocket first and they found that giant bag of weed we wouldn't be having this conversation we probably wouldn't know I don't think so that's a lot of weed who knows though Mouse paint this was like when the only story like it was like Paul McCartney is banned for life because he got caught with some weed that's that was like that when I don't know if it still exists but there was a point where he was banned for life cuz he got caught with weed over there working yeah that's a problem what's the number one problems number one problem with laws against things like we'd like as long as you can buy some Wiz Kids part of the number one problem a lot of it too is why these prisons are private eyes and they don't want to let a lot of these guys go home and get money for the amount of f****** people in their prisons this whole leg urban legend that I mean it's very believable about this letter that went around like a bunch of people in the in the in the hip hop music industry got not don't know maybe it was within the last decade where they describe like this guy claimed to be a member of the Elite Class of like Executives of the music business in there in the mid-90s and whatnot and there was a time when the private prison industry kind came and got involved in our lungs fast and then kind of help direct like things like rap music and then you remember these to be like public I don't know if you have big are you a fan of music you were at the time of Clans and Public Enemy lose all these proactive like you know counters to like the party drug dealer guys or whatever you're there was another side to it that we existed and was successful and flourished you know amongst it you know and that disappeared that begin like they're this letter that went around was I kind of claiming this guy was part of this thing and he left a meeting when they just got through the whole conspiracy thing I could go but it's like totally believable guys with director music and a f****** media in a certain direction to encourage f****** basically a cycle of f****** prison</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> article in the Atlantic about tracking you with cell phones and tracking you in comparison to trusted people that tested negative like that that that could be the way that we can release people from quarantine and this is because if you have to have a health app on their phone that's really do have to keep the app up-to-date there's one on every iPhone already yeah but I think this is a different kind of it's not you know it's a different kind of thing that like you have to have like you have to be certified that you tested clean for covid-19 it's on your phone Isabel certificate just accepted that people can be sick and we prefer Freedom over a hundred percent safety we've always accepted but my point is we've always accepted that and if we decide to keep going further down that rabbit-hole where we make someone carry device we can track their location you have to have a travel weird man up to what have you been partying all night and go to the airport then like I see you have cancer like no no I just did Coke slippery road if you tell people they have to have a phone everywhere they go right now you don't you can have a driver's license and or a passport and you can get on a plane and you're fine you don't have to have a phone you don't have to have a phone right now and I'm not saying you shouldn't have a phone but I'm saying if someone's going to tell you that you have to have a phone everywhere you go things are going to get slippery but what it was going to be able to track you 100% what if it's just like that's what you scanned and make sure you're healthy but that's the problem is this, but think about all Google has done and is not a knock on Google but all Google has done with basically just the information that they give two companies of what your activities are right this is the reason why when you're talking about things needs Google add pop-up why why is that why when you look up something you find those ads and everything was trying to tell you things figure out the modern what you're looking at you try to figure out what makes you tick why would they do that with this to why wouldn't you do that with this to why wouldn't I give if you could track people you could try out who's going to pay for that software and all that stuff would you rather and while they're doing their light you know everything they do what's this app on them but they can't leave behind the checks their health a group that has more power over an individual rather than another individual is not like the thing about having a massive group that can tell one person that they can or can't do something is it can be abused if everyone's even it can never abuse if we all follow the same rules and same laws then okay we all agree that you we all have the same amount of control and power over each other's lives but as soon as you have more control than the person who you're monitoring then things can get weird it's just natural people are weird they they control people they like controlling people they like abusing power a lot of people that have power abused power so if you give the power of constant surveillance and exchange for the freedom to be able to go everywhere you want in the relieving of quarantine we just want to know your Healthy no big deal like okay well let you out more likely what's more likely is a crazy thing happens and people automatically take advantage when they find an opportunity especially the more SoCal tickets at f****** conspiracy I take advantage of things that happen that's more likely what's more likely is a crazy thing happens and people automatically take advantage when they find an opportunity especially the more predatory amongst us</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I want you say it stand up in podcasting really yeah well podcast things right now its emerging as a different Beast see before people joke about it they will we doing like Howard Stern's to make fun of it I wanted you out your window what are you doing and you know what he was coming from you got to think he's a Pioneer and radio and traditional radio and he made his bones radio and he carved his path and radio then I'll send this thing comes along with anybody can do it the threat the threat but it's also see in a way I understand his perspective because in his day when he made it he had to compete against all these other Killers Arts you got all these other morning guys all over the country and then when he goes it's indicate so he'll invade Chicago he's invading Los Angeles trying to take over taking over but there was only a few slots right so you couldn't couldn't listen to his show later listen to it then so everyone's competing during these slots so you have the slot that is 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. that's drive time baby even now he doesn't know podcast and like I remember I used to listen to Howard for a long time and it probably like maybe a year ago they brought up something cuz you s*** on podcasting is to podcasters even make money and one of the guys got on there and I forget his Cruz name I think Joe Rogan if you like Snot long time listener first-time caller well doesn't matter what bum me out and again I'm a huge Howard Stern fan I think you and I think maybe I forget to send it to me by sense to you when Howard Stern it released that to his employees has like a a yearly like meeting with his employees someone recorded it damn it makes you feel so sick f*** did you realize how Hollywood Deuce by the idea of what first of all you need friends you need really good friends that are like you that are in your world I think one of them's is separates us all of us as comics from rest of Hollywood is like goddamn were glued to each other yes we're gluten we should on each other we laugh it would complement each other we love each other and call each other with each other different thing and no one that but also it's not a doggy dog know I know everybody is running out of that room telling everybody that murdered it and when is he Bill Burr Go on stage the main room and crush it you're coming out and saying it and I'm coming out and saying it and count saying it we're all excited like God damn that was awesome at holy s*** about telling people you see a love for the art and a love for each other did the camaraderie like the the wanting people to be good you realize like he doesn't have to just be about you and they didn't I don't think they I think that's what you were talking about competition earlier talking about Jordan and Tyson in the Balkans yes I think one guy like commit suicide news I guess I felt bad for that you know you don't like that that time that's what I had to do well that's what he did right whether he had to do it or not that's what he did what you know doing it it did work and you felt like you had to do and look he's also we have to be everything you have to look into you got to look at it with perspective and in my head would Howard Stern's always going to represent is that guy who paved the way like without him you got to realize there was nothing like Howard Stern before Howard Stern do it didn't exist you had on IMS was kind of risque and then Here Comes this really tall long-haired rock and roll type do doesn't give a f*** and you just want to have pornstars on my girls are riding vibrators and people farting songs in the microphones is madness and he's getting sued by the government man so that the government that their come huge judgements against the company that owns if he keeps going and he keeps Goin podcast all are you know Patrice used to say like Patrice you say about other Comics that like David tell Dave Attell got a lot of babies and what a man is that there's a lot of other Comics that would imitate David tell out of the fact that they were fans and they were insecure and if they're not plagiarist they just weren't good yet when I was young man I sounded I used to sound exactly like Richard jeni really heard myself on stage when I've been doing an open I caught myself doing like a bad Richard jeni impression with my material when I was like 21 or something 222 like, terrible it was such a Richard jeni fan at the time that is like mimicking him onstage purpose myself and a lot of mannerisms like Brian or delete anybody was he created this radio cab he created this chaos we had these these people this wack Packers were out of their f****** mind and he would interview them and and and talk to all these nuts f****** people that was the first one then remember yet but if he wasn't like oh how's your movie but we f****** and then he made it possible people to talk the way we talk and then Opie and Anthony were the next important phase because when Opie and Anthony where where hang where is Howard is The Man Behind the switchboard and Howard is in control of isn't is it is Universe with Opie and Anthony people just show up like I'd be on the air and it would be like four or five other Comics there and we would we would love it and Jim Norton download all the time whatever he's a very interesting. I loved his love of transexuals and he's honest and raw where were the first loose hang you know so I can get it would kind of be orchestrating a little bit we're like keeping everybody making sure you know keep an eye on everything making sure it didn't get out of hand and then Anthony is this very he's a guy who grew up doing construction and that's how I literally how it got in the radio but is also very intelligent very inquisitive since he's got like a regular guy sensibility but he's also very f****** smart and then he would have all these comics and then Norton was great, can South would be there in maybe Colin Quinn and Bill Burr and me and shaffir and all this madness man was nothing like that really know made podcast become what they are because like those guys Comics just hang out and talk no one ever like Comics just hang out and run the show before opening Anthony so the big steps to podcast and where Howard Stern is most important and then after how it's turned these are Howard Stern's babies Howard Stern's babies are like Opie and Anthony were Howard Stern's babies but they became their own thing just like a comic would imitate David Tao when he's a young guy up and then as he gets older he finds his own speed in this a lot of comics right now that are like top-level guys that I bet if you watch them 10-15 years ago they would sound a lot like someone else and then Opie and Anthony open up the door to podcast and cuz they made comics where they could just hang and then everyone's got their own style like Ron funches has his own style Erik Griffin has his own style you and Brian have your own style Theo's got his completely stopped all of us have these different thinks the girls got his style Christina pazsitzky have their Style Spartanburg yes the world is more Bountiful than it was back then it's not like Burt and Burr or competing against Bert was one run by one production company but Burton Barr will run by a different they're both going to be at noon and you have to listen to one of the other and Burton and it's f****** argument you now they're going to take us out of noon and that's that's that was what they had to do with it was a totally different Dynamic now it's a totally it's like we were trapped in these tunnels fighting for air and pop and we got to the top of the all the air you want is free are free are you can just put up a podcast video put up put up a makeup video makeup sketch fighting for Erin pop we got to the top of the tunnel in this all the are you want it's free are you can just put up a podcast video put up put up a make a video make a sketch and then it might get seen by a million people</div>

Imagine that having all these fights that you have to make and having all this pressure on you and you're also like a famous guy like Dana is only two president Family Dollars in the you get used to that you can use the help you do you do compensated well for it a man who doesn't give a f*** he's nuts did everyone Logan just f****** $5 as long as any other disease where we understood it better I would be way more confident you understand numbers though we do but we don't understand Michael Yo okay Michael you almost died almost. But he did it but he was in the hospital for a week but he's fine okay okay people who are less robust than Michael Yo to die so we got to figure out like what the f*** this virus is how is it get treated what's the most effective way and then then then it makes sense that we're a little bit more loose with our regulations 1% Michael Yo he's in this shape compared to the UFC fighter he's f****** Adele you know I'm saying like he's not in shape compared to Tony Ferguson works out alot you really does again computer Tony Ferguson that's fine anything you can do like that in the forest Island that's what I've been cool about this UFC thing if it really did go to f*** Island not anymore remote situation if it's a small island if you could control the whole island test everybody 100 how much money is the UFC and be spending on these private job how much money are they going to be making with the reality show about moving the UFC to the island cuz I'm watching that s*** f*** Tiger King I watching Dana White's with his crazy or screaming and running around trying to figure out a way to product Island international waters and that's what I do like bro that's one episode like this I'm hoping I'm hoping they obviously I'm hoping the current treatment is the one that works but two if that's not the one that works maybe they find something just as good I think we got a lot accomplished people that don't think it's a good idea but I'm not interested in putting myself at risk but my real concern was how do I know if I contracted it and then I bring it back how am I going to know and then I'll be honest to myself like I really wouldn't know so the only way I would be able to do it is to do it and then be in quarantine until I get tested it worth it packed it and then I'll bring it back how am I going to know and then I'll be honest to myself like I really wouldn't know so the only way I would be able to do it is to do it and then be in quarantine until I get tested that ain't worth it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's all very promising you know it's it's really interesting to because it would become such a hot political topic you know there's so many people that are angry at Trump but they were angry at Trump back when he was closing the travel from China which turned out to be a great idea and you know Donald Trump Jr tweeted today a compilation of CNN and all these other different networks giving out bad information way back in January information saying this is going to be fine don't worry Dana it's not as deadly as the flu each worry about the flu you know don't change your plans don't do anything so a lot of people got this wrong and but so many people are trying to make this a political point right now and it's really it's so so useless it's it that you know about pointing fingers and everything at this point in time they need to concentrate on getting mask equipment keeping people healthy if they can and then Edge people on how to keep your immune system strong and lets you know it's try to let's try to get people to understand the consequences of not taking care of your body it has to be the worst job in the world president no matter what you do everyone's going to have two people going to hate you advantage of the of the pandemic to increase their power and civil liberties you know in hungry and and and turkey and Israel China of course Putin in Russia gets lumped in there like in Yahoo so you're something like this I mean you just clamp down on all travel until he would have been totally accused of being an autocrat he's you know he wants to be a dictator look what he's doing okay so he doesn't do that and then he's accused of not doing enough when it looks like we should have done more and then he said well I'm not going to tell all the governor's what to do and then I'm going to honor states rights for now and of course he gets hammered for that it's like you know but that's actually that's not what an autocrat would do in Minecraft would say yeah I'm telling everybody what to do in a drop all the polarisation politically rally around the present even if you hate him and Senators voted for the Warren at univ for the invasion of Afghanistan and including Iraq including Hillary right so maybe we ought to do that I know people just can't stand Trump and then he's at the idea like saying something nice or supportive or not being critical seems hard to do but maybe this is way worse than 9/11 2001 it seems like you just keeps ramping up and Trump is such a naturally polarizing figure that it's gotten another the left vs right has gotten so extreme right now it's almost impossible for rational discourse and this is one of the reasons why it's a good time now to talk about your book giving the devil his due to graph of the people that self-identify as Centrist vs. now which more polarized she had this two-hump camel here and that's from 2019 94 2004 and then close to today when did is that a trump shift that little hoe no no no no about 2,000 it will really under Obama by 2008 the polarisation got worse and worst far-left far-right young strong Republican strong the Democrat whatever and said that that middle ground has been is been drinking the centuries have been drinking in the polls have been increasing some more more people are polarized conservative talk radio and television or media but but in general I think we've just been more polarized in the sense of not just saying while I disagree with you I think you're wrong but that you're evil your more polarized in the sense of not just saying while I disagree with you I think you're wrong but that you're evil you're you're you're immoral you know this is the worst thing that's ever happened to us and so on this kind of ramping up of the cat catastrophism do you know is not healthy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> identified though just a moment ago was that if people identify with their beliefs that is the specific say political platforms like an immigration abortion civil rights whatever secondary to the deeper core moral values that people hold I defined myself as a liberal and if I mess up as a Conservative Republican whatever and this but you don't need abortion thing I think you're wrong and here's what the impulses well but if I give if I gave up on that one then I'm going to lose all these other ones and then I have given up my identity rights out like when I get to debate creationist intelligent design theaters and so on you know I could tell that if I give people a choice like you have to choose between Jesus and Darwin for your life or not picking Darwin okay because it is sort of belief in their dogmas about Jesus that is their core beans who cares about Darwin and you know whoever the scientist was but if I say keep these as keep your whole religion I don't care what you believe what the science is really good on this and here's why you should follow the facts and you don't have to give up anything for it so I thought okay I'll listen Conservative then climate change is just a proxy for something else like I believe in free markets and free enterprise and I'm pro-business and those guys over there you know they want to attack that now unfortunately allegory success with his film and books and so forth then affiliated climate-science with a left-wing liberal cause there for conservatives have to go against it even though he knows how that much about climate science has become something else that you identify yourself is so we have to take that out of the formula like you keep your worldview that you define yourself as don't give up that but just follow the facts on these specific issues if you're right Wing you used most absolutely certain my skepticism about climate change right so when somebody publicly signals where they stand on say climate change what they're really saying is luck I'm I am publicly declaring my commitment to my team bet that's right in and saw a lot of cognitive science studies of reasoning shows that we we generally don't reason toward finding the truth but defending positions that are part of our team ideology or so Collective whole and in this case we've been talking about left and right but you know there's there's a religious idea or economic ideologies and so on that are part of that is that that's fine Defender team but you know what I try to do in the book has dissed entangle the specific issues let's just take them one by one like why can't I be personally against abortion I don't want to do that but I and I recognized say Ben Shapiro's Arguments for the rights of the fetus but I also think we have conflicting moral values are the rights of a woman and and the history of the way women have been treated and Men of always tried to Lord it order over women's reproductive choices historical this is always lead to bad things like infanticide and and back alley abortions and so on are on one side or the other I recognize and acknowledge your argument a really good band or whoever is a pro-lifer but I still hold this position I think there's a lot of progress that can be made socially to kind of reduce the tension when you say I acknowledge your position I understand it and Steel Man in the argument and then the person on the other side feels like I think that's a that is the best topic when it comes to that because it's when you get to a particular we get to a late-term abortions boy that's a very hard thing to defend morally and ethically and it's also one of things about the abortion topic is that it's so uniquely human in that it's such a messy topic it's not does not like here's a clear one don't murder people right don't guess it'll have to be yeah that's clean that's that's that's a clean subject abortion is not that clean like when is it okay is it okay when the fetus is not a fetus when it's just a bundle of cells most people like you when when do we decide will that such a messy subject and it's such a human subject and I like you I am on the side of pro-choice and I think that it is the woman's choice to decide whether or not she wants to keep the baby but I also recognize at a certain point in time that choice becomes very different the choice becomes very different when is a 6 month old fetus like what is what are we saying there if you if you are just I am pro-choice. Okay are you pro-choice up until the day of birth like when do you back it off when do you back it off and it it is a subject that people do not want to breach they don't want to touch and particular particular people on the left when it comes to deciding when it's okay when it's not okay because they feel like this is angling towards and elimination of a woman's right to choose and it angles towards this is very difficult conversation where are you you recognize that there is a difference between someone who's 7 months pregnant and someone who's 7 days pregnant there's a very very big difference and if we can't acknowledge that then we are being tribal we're being ideologic where's are sticking to our position because we feel like if we concede that this is a complex issue then we open up the door to possibly losing a woman's right to choose and losing these Reproductive Rights yeah I think part of the problem is that we tend to dichotomize most moral issues is right or wrong good or evil and in the problem is it the law has to draw the line somewhere we have to have a law and to get along teenage is this instead of that or the driving age is this the point of which you can have abortion is right here but most most of life is much more on a spectrum a Continuum so here I make the distinction in the book between binary thinking and continuous thinking most moral issues are on a continuum everybody know know where do you draw the line and another Messi human subject yep yep but if you think of it's like well it's a Continuum instead of a binary choice and you know whatever answer it's not just right or wrong good or evil that there's different places to set the the dial so something and hear the comparative method of looking at what different countries do is experiment thinking of those experiments like Japan has a very tight sweat it way down here they let almost nobody in Australia is a little looser but but the tighter than us and so on it kind of look at the consequences of letting just many people in or that many people and see what it does with all countries are different summer more diverse summer more homogeneous you have to account for that and I do not instead of binary thinking continuous thinking abortion you just articulated a perfectly I mean 7 days I'll come on you know it's just a bundle of cells Creed's thoughts on the Nugget place but we have to have a line somewhere so the lies to do that but that been forces us into that binary thinking which is not helpful between these two sides and I think that's so much of what people subscribe to when they do choose an ideology once they choose an ideology they they have this conglomeration of ID did they adopt and they adopt in order to be accepted by the tribe and its this is also a very unique aspect of human communication and civilization that we we have to adhere to the principles in the ideologies of that tribe so you just take on all these thoughts and it's one of the real problems with only having two choices in this country when it comes to politics and it comes to just styles of life you know and there's so many people that take great Relish in switching teams 2 is like I was a liberal my whole life then one day I woke up and realize I was being a moron and now and now I'm a pro-second Amendment Pro Trump Maga make America great keep America great it's interesting cuz those are sometimes the most the most passionate supporters of the new side whether they are there are newly liberal or newly conservative or you know some of the people that are the most interesting to talk to her people that used to be vegan carnivore with almost every style of living you can find a country style the people find appealing noticed people that used to be atheist to become Muslims and they they they they wear you know the hijab and they fully adhered to the Koran really really interesting because I've spent a lot of time watching religious Scholars online talk and watching them preach and watching it since something and as a person who is very agnostic when I watch that it's appealing to me there's a certain aspect of the confidence that they have when they're talking about what God wants or what you know what Allah has in store for you when you die or what you should do because it's written in this particular religious text the confidence that they have describe these things is very alluring even to me it's not like I'm going to join but I'm sitting there in front of my computer and I'm recognizing oh I see the appeal here but I see it I see how this works on people and I find it incredibly fascinating and I think it has two it has to have some sort of an evolutionary reason there's some sort of reason beside some sort of an evolutionary benefit that adhering and being accepting of the morals and the ethics in the ideology of the tribe is that that's how you stay alive that's how you find other like-minded people to stick with you</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> mr. Sherman how are you sir I'm fine thank you I'm still breathing good to see you again we were saying before we get started at the last time we saw each other was we went to dinner about six weeks ago and you're thinking that that might be the end of that kind of stuff that was my last time I've been in a restaurant actually and we made quit shaking hands and hugging to the extent that we used to although I don't think we'll ever ever go all the way to the say the Japanese model of social distancing but modifications like that the change of remote say meetings and education I mean I'm in the studio here in Santa Barbara where I've been recording lectures for my Chapman University class cups is in 101 and I just upload them and share them with the students and and then they watch him and then I said Wednesday take the quiz they send them back now that's not a complete replacement of a brick-and-mortar building with a small class seminar discussion say but but does not adequately replace a lot of traditional education that you don't really need to be in a classroom for do you think this is preparing us for the ultimate where we embrace the symbiotic relationship that we have with computers and become one with the machine and it seems like electronic community happening slowly already and this is kind of a jump starting it I mean already tech companies like Zoomer having to going to ramp up their game because you know the systems are crashing could pretty much everybody's doing Zoom meetings now theaters anymore and I love watching a movie on a big screen but you know that the screens we have at home now big television screens super high-def you know why not just watch movies at all so I don't think we're going to have much of a choice I was reading an article this morning but AMC Theaters might they might have to go under because of the really not good these companies are accustomed to having a certain amount of money coming in every month and I never no one anticipated anything like this or all businesses going to shut down gyms I mean how many gyms are going to go under how many yoga studios mini I mean it's a strange and trying time for people who have small businesses for sure that one of my cycling buddies owns the La Canada theater complex and of course rents out the the space two different retailers including the the theater the theater managers and he was telling me that they normally pay $93,000 a month in rent 7 and 1/2 million dollars a year or something so it's it all balances out but they just told him we're not going to make our rent this month so he has to go to his mortgage company or the bank that we gets pays off his mortgage and so I can't pay you this month because these guys can't pay me in case I multiply that by you know 10 million yeah well of course the government can't just print money and definitely then we're going to get huge inflation and then in that could be catastrophic compared to what we're doing to save people's lives dollar amount you can put on a human life there for total social isolation no matter what does the economy is what we're going to do now well it but at some point you know that you know there's a economic calculation like how many people are going to die saying the next year if we never open the economy we will but what point do you do that supply chain toilet paper stand and the idea of putting a dollar figure on a human life is repulsive to most of us I think intuitive laid in this context but in fact we do it all the time you know in terms of like an automobile company has to pay off the family of somebody who died in their car well there are people who do those calculations like what's the value of a human life and about 10 million dollars the family's got paid off I think it's $250,000 a person X the 3,000 something and you know it sounds so cold like who does those calculations well statisticians do that sort of thing and and attorneys and accountants work on that and judges and juries have to face it and you know that's kind of a normal part of other aspects of life that we're not used to thinking about most of us don't think about it but that's the kind of calculation going to have to do for what we're in now singing and attorneys and accountants work on that and judges and juries have to face it and you know that's kind of a normal part of other aspects of life that we're not used to thinking about most of us don't think about it but you know it's on point that's the kind of calculation going to have to do for what we're in now</div>

Cultural appropriation Tuesday is Taco Tuesday yeah that's cultural appropriation you know that the Mexican Community is being appropriated by these whites eating tacos like we're in Southern California where is there no tacos I mean this is it's like you know what today is and then he shows his talk Taco Tuesday and I was okay with you is he allowed to do it I mean the whole thing is preposterous it's delicious food you know it's not like we're saying white people created it or anything like that is so ridiculous in so many ways but one of the most ridiculous ways it is is that it prevents people from enjoying some amazing aspects of the diverse cultures that we all coexist with especially here in America this is such a illegitimate Melting Pot I think it's amazing that you can go to all these different places and that you know there's a guy I'm trying to remember his name Rick Bayless I believe his name is and he's a famous Mexican chef but he's not Mexican but he cooks Mexican food and he loves Mexican Cuisine he takes all these trips to Mexico to learn with the Mexican Masters and he has a famous restaurant in Chicago where he has a full authentic Mexican menu and people are furious at him because he already is this white guy selling Mexican food like what do you expect him to do like you have to be born a certain patch of dirt to enjoy a style of food and don't you think that he is actually boosting the signal and letting people know that there's some amazing things that come out of Mexico this is an homage to Mexican Cuisine he's not trying to claim it but you know hey this was invented Chicago you know this is not really Mexico PCS saying this is from Mexico we talked openly about the various parts of the country of Mexico where this style of cooking came from and and you knowing how it emanates and it is from the traditional ingredients and he cooks them in traditional ways and it's fantastic like really widely praised restaurant with amazing food and this guy gets hit on for it it's it's crazy cuz it used to be like in the 19th century there was this idea of kind of a pure European culture and other cultures Were Somehow not as good and they Define culture in a very specific way and then back again they're saying no no there's a pure correct culture that only the people born there can you adopt those cultural features that's the complete opposite of what liberals used to RGS the fact that we didn't have as many real problems as we used to and when you talk about Yale with Nick christakis I think this is thing that kids do when they're coming of age they're separated from their parents and they want establish that so many of these older people are wrong about the way life is never wrong we're going to show them what's right we have a new way of living we have a new way of thinking and we want this campus to be safe we want safe spaces and and a lot of it is about in control of their environment and enforcing their ideology and creating something that's in a lot of ways is very ego-driven because they're they're trying to show that they're making a change in the environment around them and they have good intentions while they're doing it it's just their brains haven't fully formed yet and they don't have a lot of life experience and this pattern this pattern shows itself over and over and over again it's a constantly repeating pattern constantly repeating pattern for these kids go away to college and become self-righteous and then try to impose their viewpoints on the older people it's very very comments and it has this these psychological building blocks to add that you can kind of see why they're doing this</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Trinity College Boy by Meister wrote that great book on evil when she actually went and interviewed serial killers and rapists in prison and said you why'd you do it and discover that they all had this perspective like well this is why I did it I had a crappy childhood or you know how I felt it you know that it was totally justified that guy dismay or she cheated on me or they all had justifications behind their argument if the perpetrator is just pure evil he did it because he enjoys suffering at the suffering of other people now there are some Psychopaths that do that but they're very small and number very tiny percentage of the population most people in prison that are killers they did it for moralistic reasons you know he took my parking spot so I slept with my girlfriend until I had to do something and defend my honor and one thing led to another and here I am in prison they almost moralistic reasoning so the problem is not that we don't have enough morality that actually we have too much morality too much moralizing about other people that are harming us so go back to the Free Speech issue at the moment you say we're going to create a category called hate speech okay what goes in that Ben Brightwell state supreme court to uphold this conviction of this guy named shank he was head of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia in 1918 he was Distributing Flyers to draft age men telling them that the conscription is equivalent of slavery because the 14th amendment protects your right to bodily autonomy and when the government says we're drafting you in the military and we're sending you to Europe this case for the European Great War we now on your body for the next four years okay so this is what so here's the famous lines from Oliver Wendell Holmes Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Schenck versus United States that we're all familiar with the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic the question in every case is whether the word used are used in such circumstances that are such a nature as to create a clear and present danger but they will bring about the substitution of evils that Congress has a white right to prevent it is a question of proximity and degree so clear and present danger and cause violence or something like that so that's going to be at the time I clear and present danger protesters of the draft and their argument their argument is pretty You can disagree with insano I think in times of national crisis we have to abolish set aside the Fourteenth Amendment and can script young men into the army and send them up toward potentially die that's alright to do it to protect our nation but we should be able to debate that but the moment that happened in 1919 then category creep or category expansion happened where more more things got put into the bin of clear and present danger Community or whatever so that category just got bigger and bigger and then go back to why liberals used to defend free speech and now it's more conservative doing it and Liberals are in favor of censorship begins with this idea of something like in the sixties where we began to become sensitive to the words we use to describe other people so the n word yeah yeah those are all hate speech to the bins starts getting larger and larger then all the sudden you end up with these list of microaggressions I reprint one in the book from UCLA University California system in 2014 issues this long list of things you can't say like where are you from or wow you're good at math to someone who's not Asian or why you speak English so well these are now considered hate speech feelings of being hurt and that is a form of clear danger to the sort of Serenity of our community and I'll send this category is now Hughes where are you from really on that list all the time because she's from Germany and she speaks perfect English has no accent and people go wow I can't believe you speak English so well or well I can't believe you're not from America or something like that and instead of being a Eli paid attention in school</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> talk to you about Michaels there's an article today in the Atlantic which is really interesting it's about technology it's contact tracking technology and this there's a real concern about this stuff first of all the idea is great that if you did this free America from quarantine this is always the risk right the risk is just give up a little bit of your civil liberties give up a little bit of your freedom and we're going to keep you safe and you know what brings you to the old Benjamin Franklin quote you know he who would give up Liberty for Freedom deserves neither neither liberty for safety stocked up that quote but this is very interesting because they're using it in South Korea and then using it in Singapore and the title of the article in the Atlantic is the technology that could free America from quarantine until today and they bring up this conundrum it mean nobody wants to give up civil liberties and civil he's lost her rarely regained and this is the real concern here that if you do allow people to track who you're in contact with and make sure they're okay your testing negative and you're in contact with people that also test negative so you're okay you're okay to travel now like this is this is a very weird thing and it gets very gray area how do you feel about this sort of thing I like privacy and that I do have a right to not be tracked and you know that you can't have cameras in my home or my yard and it's on in general I think across-the-board that's a good principal and Anna follows the Constitution I think there are times I think it is you know we do have a constitution we do have states rights we do have courts that litigate these sorts of things I could see a reasonable measure being taken for let's say we're going to do the following for 6 months until we see what happens with this pandemic and then once that's over then we're going to revert back now let's say the governor or the other presidents has one night going back well then you have courts then we can you sue the state are you sue the federal government for violations of civil liberties and then you can get them back what happened to NSA when Edward Snowden revealed how much tracking is actually going on I mean that's never been yeah yeah I know emails right yes and you know these started abortion so supposedly when Obama became president is like Xena the transparent president so we're going to stop doing that well. That's not the case we wouldn't have known that without. Snowden or the or the Pentagon papers and you know it's good to know what Mutual favorite subjects of conspiracy theories you know we didn't know about a lot of the things Kennedy was doing and Johnson all the way back to Eisenhower line about the Vietnam War for example until the Pentagon papers came out and then in the 90s that church committee on conspiracies from the 70s a lot of those documents were released and there was that that business about the operation Northwoods Kennedy Administration that people brought to him this idea of a false flag operation over Cuba make it look like the Russians were harassing our aircraft are airports as an excuse to invading Cuba or assassinating Castro and so it's like you know like when you had Alex Jones talks about false flag operations and most of us Skeptics doll that's a bunch of nonsense less than a year later right then all the shenanigans of American intelligence agents manipulating elections in South American but he's our son of a b**** anyway how to support the fascist dictator rather than the Communist dictators like what are we doing doing that anyway well that's what we do it's like wait a minute does the public know about this did Congress approve this know okay so you know this is one reason people believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of them were true</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so you know this is one reason people believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of them are true not all of them with you with the Epstein case like you were one of the first people that mean as a literal you're a professional skeptic and you looked at some of the evidence you like well you know what this might be a conspiracy been enough of them I'm still not sure about that one because after I posted something about the other two cameras broke or whatever somebody wrote me from that prison saying all those cameras are always breaking in a way that Michael Batten the famous autopsy doctor says is completely inconsistent with hanging and much more consistent with someone strangling you include including the actual area where he was hanging from supposedly like it is consistent with someone's trying you from behind not consistent with you hanging by your own weight after Weinstein got his is Harvey Weinstein got his conviction I thought oh boy but they better have a real suicide watch on this guy cuz I had sex with all these starlets and turn them into big celebrities and Cindy I bet he probably doesn't want that out especially this stage of the game nothing I don't think anything he's got going to make him look good and I think the thing with Epstein is he knew way too much about too many powerful people there's just some so many connections it could be made with that guy and that you know to this day people are asking questions that people like Bill Gates don't want to answer prince Andrew or any of these people they like to get you know I don't want to talk about this the gates by prince Andrew of course I flew on the Lolita Express that's the thing is there's so much data and so I mean one of the things that's really sad about the loss of respect for mainstream journalism and mainstream media is what we count can't count on them and who is regulating the independence who's regulating these websites who's regulating these people that are just you know so-called independent journalist they're just tweeting things and finding thinking of putting things up on their website since it's so hard to tell who's telling the truth and who's not and when I was giving the devil his due I had that this was kind of a challenge to me because I feel like there's so much fake news real fake news and bogus theories and in my areas of medicine and cancer cure and I feel like well but I'm a free speech fundamentalist I really believe you have people that short of just lying about somebody or giving away the nuclear codes or something like that thousand flowers bloom and just see what you know what sunlight on all of them and see which ones rise to the top because they're supported by evidence there's a risk to that that is to say no people will take bad information and I'll go shoot up a pizzeria or something that is to say that theory is that 5G is causing people to feel ill to take you out and that the government made up of the corporation's made up the story about the coronavirus as a distraction from 5G stupid and only five countries have 5G Towers why the f*** would you dummies why the f*** is you idiots think that 5G towers are causing covid-19 it's oh yeah you know that was accused with four G in 3-g and you know it is cell phones back in the late 90s and early 2000 there was a scare about you're holding the phone up to your own we all started doing that and that this is may be causing brain tumors and Jay from the cell phone itself or even these 5G Towers is not strong enough to break chemical bonds like DNA to cause mutations in cells to them become cancerous is not a physical mechanism A&amp;B the counter examples that you always have to what about the countries that don't have 5G different options in our Focus tends to be on the one cell so I always use this uristix for my class teaching 2 by 2 Matrix we have for ourselves so I did this with this there's this documentary film coming out about horror films that are haunted or cursed horror films that occur so like the which is the one where the actors died in the helicopter Act of The Twilight Zone The Movie and The Exorcist and the other films were bet you do bad things happen to the actors that are in horror films okay the problem with that is your only focusing on one cell that is horror films that are cursed what then there's horror films that are not cursed nothing bad happened to the actors in those and then there's non horror films regular films which bad things happened to the actors and then none films that are not cursed right someone we just focus on the one so it's easy to find examples that fit it but something like The Shining which is a super horror scary film you're nothing bad happened to the actors and or just take some other film like The Godfather with whatever that's not nothing bad happened you're just bet you just plucking out anecdotes do that cuz they love to believe in spiritual connections and they love to believe in Clairvoyance and they love to believe in haunted things I'm Jamie pull up the article in The Sciences Bill Gates breaks silence on Epstein admitting he made a mistake in judgment by meeting with the pedo Tycoon it says so story about it who knows but he is he is quoted in there yeah I don't know why I know that mean they're so I know some scientists and scientist because he had a lot of money and I can find your lab help help find your lab to the tune of millions of dollars and it's hard to resist that and then maybe you go down that road a little bit and then you start hearing these rumors about his personal life and he was like yeah but the money is good for the lab and what is it was a bad thing and it but it's too late you already went down that road so that when I say it's hard to judge people after the fact in hindsight bias and we look back and go how could anybody I've ever had any association with them it's like yeah but that's the stuff now that maybe not everybody knew the extent of it back years ago</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> shows that when you know somebody say who's gay you're less likely to be homophobic just the exposure to them and so the effect of them up to pass laws to get people to change like to abolish slavery in the United States we needed a war and some 150,000 people died about that and you know sometimes you have to send federal troops like that to desegregate Alabama schools that were segregated and remember the governor you know segregation now segregation tomorrow segregation forever and to make sure you do it sometimes you have to do that most of the change happens from the bottom up of just oppressed peoples saying you know what stop that don't do that I don't like it when you say that and it began with the n-word and just kept expanding where we ended up to today where you have this Big Ben of your microaggressions and so on but there was a logic to it like I'm just saying it's hurtful to do that and most of the effects have been good they've been positive just you know when Ellen comes out on her TV show that. Just a little thing there or when South Park yo makes fun of all different religions you know that perspective on things humor is good television scripts movie scripts the way characters talked you can pinpoint to the decade when a novel was written based on the words that are used to describe Jews blacks and women and but no one said they were going to pass laws to say you can't use these words describe choose by some women we all just change the way we talk about other people in a way that's more liberal that's more all-encompassing that's more egalitarian in that sense and and it's not clear how exactly what happened just incrementally a little bit by bit you know it's just trying to figure out when a word starting to be used it's like it's really hard to 911 or days that I remember in the late nineties there was a couple atheist that wanted to quit using the word atheist atheist and call us the brights we are the brights so that never took off you. Bye-bye trying to change language by Fiat from the top down okay here's the new real we're all going to use this word that doesn't work it's just expanding our consciousness-expanding tomorrow's feared it just including more people in your honorary circle of friends and family members are honorary family members or people that you will treat with respect that that has been happening just tiny bits everyday a little bit here and there and over the decades UCI your people that you will treat with respect that that has been happening just tiny bits everyday a little bit here and there and over the decades you see it when you look back at the numbers like The Thinker does but but it's hard to pinpoint the day that that happened</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah it weird to bring a strange strange moment in history as really is something you got to look at like you said something to me when I asked you last week how you're doing you said you just you're just trying to accept and I think that's the key if you can accept it then you can be proactive about it you can be creative about it you can just take whatever life force you have and and you know look at what what what are the possibilities here don't have any expectations that gets Shattered by reality except what it is or this is a new thing now it stay alive be nice to each other and do your best and try to get through this and hopefully at the other end when science and medicine has gotten a handle on this hopefully we can go back to normal life they'll be wonderful but right now we can't so it is what it is if you just want to run around screaming and hollering and freaking out about it and it's not good what would makes me are concerned than anything is what is life going to be like once the economy rolls back again how many people going to be out of work how many business can be shuttered how many you know how how f***** up is it going to be that gives me the most fear of the unknown because I know that a certain amount of people going to get sick in a certain large percentage of going to get better and unfortunately some people are going to die and all that's awful but I kind of see that that makes sense my mind I kind of see a disease people that that all makes sense what doesn't make sense is an economy that stops and then restarts again I've never seen that so for that I'm like what is that like it is I just know model to base it on because our economy today is so much different than it was you know even 10 years ago the international economy it is it's a it's a digital economy there's so much of it that we don't we don't know how it's going to I was going to play out you know and I know that a lot more people are going to stop going I think that businesses are saying oh we don't need offices for 100% of our people and parking spots know we'll just have 50% of people work from home like we just did for the last 3 months at work that would be very cost-effective for people that don't want to have gigantic offices and then also how freed how much Freedom it is if you you can work from home I mean for a lot of people if that's possible that would definitely be preferable Hellyeah I can tell you from writing on TV shows over the years has been some that I've written from home you know what I'm like a consultant that's just handing them I do so much more work when I have to actually hand it in through an email that when I'm sitting in a writers room with 12 other people throwing out of line once an hour on meeting f****** Sushi I mean I work my ass off because I got it yes that's a good point think about that in terms of creation of material one thing I've been guilty of over the last month I've been written Jax yet I might have a couple ideas I wrote down but I really have been riding when I haven't been doing stand-up and I decided what I wanted to do is I want to know what my take on this is the best way I can figure out what my take on it is is just have a natural take on it like actually go through this and and find out what it is first how long it's going to last what what are you what are your thoughts on this and at the beginning I didn't know my thoughts on at work because my thoughts on or stay safe make sure family stay safe friend stay safe you know do whatever you're supposed to do and let's find out how long is going to take what are the experts say talk to some experts what it what's the prognosis look like keeps getting pushed back now it's June have the same June things going to restart June like f*** was that like what is that like for people that are Check to Check 3 months April May June when when is it when is it go back 3 months from now and it's already been a month you know what went what day do june what am I doing 14 you got more cases then what do we do when we do we ever say f*** it was just go back to work what is that like what kind of drunken Wild West parties go back to work and start going back to bars and a different I'll be out in a bar in a nightclub how many people can be pregnant when is this all goes back this going to be a giant loads but we need to make s*** in the way that doesn't destroy the environment and one of the ways they are able to make s*** in other countries is then on the same regulations environmental regulations as they do here that's always been the big problem with shipping stuff overseas they also don't have the same regulations like when the Foxconn Scandal came out and they found out there was gnats around the building to keep people from play where we met, we have the person who makes them makes good living you know the back of the old days when these two have like great cars were made in Detroit they're all made in Detroit and Detroit was his huge City Detroit was one of the richest cities in the country cuz everything got shipped overseas or everything got shipped to two different places the unions are a great Theory they have work well in a lot of ways but they also have huge problems and if there's got to be a way to get unions back in place that can guarantee people health coverage and retirement without making a cost of doing business so high that it hurts the industry I don't know jackshit about finances so I don't know whether not receiving comments on that but it would be nice if he worked it out make s*** in America where we don't have to worry about things going down and let's let's learn from this to learn from this and start making medicine over here why is all the medicine made in China what do we need to balance out we need to balance out for some sort of apocalyptic event we got to be prepared what's necessary and what's luxury and we're getting we're keeping it simple and they're going to come out of it having a better gauge of what each of us needs individually as a country military out of the population don't know ventilators yeah yeah there's a lot of possibles out there that was the things that we wish we were shipping stuff overseas they just destroyed something today that like we were sending metal medical equipment to other countries oh we got stupid about Thailand we were actually shipping stuff to Thailand right now and then it was some kind of mix-up in the government's apologizing about it now</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you think Ferguson and khabib will go down something happens this weekend just in case she's a monster Justin gaethje is a monster he's a monster cetera find individual he is mean in a sport that violent it's an inherently violent sport he stands out as the most violent I mean you watched his knockout of Edson Barboza you watch out that m*********** attacks people he's there's a reckless abandon to his his calculated wildness that is a terrifying he's something special and he's better all the time the question is how much has he been training you taking a fight on very short notice to taken Define essentially two weeks notice also might be kind of weird to train now and is Coronavirus times training Partners I don't know who I respect very much said that Fighters shouldn't be fighting because I don't know what you said they shouldn't be fighting but he said if they do definitely felt it wasn't fair the fighters because they they don't have a full camp and not going to be able to show who they really are. It's a really good point this is you know awhile situation where there's a guy who's going to fight for the interim title he gets to call let me that's also how Nate Diaz beat Conor McGregor and their first fight remember that that was 11 days out they call Nate Diaz he's eating tacos f****** drinking tequila in Mexico and probably doing triathlons but out of shape like you were I would get but for Justin gaethje really depends entirely on how much time you spend in the gym now he's the plan right he's trying to be the UFC lightweight champion so he's probably not getting too out of shape and he probably knew that in this case there is a potential that one of those guys could drop out because they already made that fight for f****** times and it fell apart this is the fifth time it's falling apart which is nuts crazy so it might be the Justin gaethje knew that this was a possibility that he could be called in as a replacement he might be in full Camp mode we really don't know we have to talk to him, turn you all along with probably getting ready but I'd love to see him fight and there's a lot of guys that have been through a full camper there paid for a full camp and they're paid to make weight this is something that's happened several times in the UFC's history we're guys show up because they're their 222 fight and step in if something falls apart especially if you have a guy who made maybe struggles with weight cutting and you might fall apart and get pulled from fight or someone is may be injured or sick and I like a little nervous with this fine we're getting super fights every week we're getting super fights every week do you think on the island</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> here's a better one Epstein FC's killer that's one nobody thinks that that got hung himself no one how about that guy so if you have various theories are various stories that people come out and talk about with that one yeah and I just actually yesterday listen to Eric Weinstein solopod guessing Jeffrey Epstein I would have been faster in the city because Eric is too smart he's almost like to smart is one of those guys you talk to him I call you poor bastard you're burdened your burden trying to make sense of the world around Apes it Alex and all the trauma of in the yet like we were talking about he still also the 13 the twenty-year-old kid so you seeing he had a few run-ins with authority which makes it which makes him suspicious of authority and I think the r life experience Define that so you can see I've seen in a lot of different ways depending on how you've experienced if you were there tainted a lot of people's reputations basically if you took a picture with them your reputation is Tainted I do think that he was an exceptionally Charming person so he was good Amino the devil's going to be Charming so and the other thing is he genuinely showed curiosity towards scientific ideas even out there big scientifically especially if you ever thought about that intelligence operative intelligence operative part of his job to try to infiltrate the scientific communities and there must have been a directive if he really is an intelligence operative is not like they like hey interest belgians having sex with underage girls you can't be that or the idea of that Erik Bush's Fault by the way I'm talking to him on the podcast I do tomorrow which is why I'm talking about him a lot of preparing for like a three-hour conversation Eric Weinstein which will kill most you have to call people out in their b******* which is very hard to do with their Quest then I checked out ten minutes is that theory I'm so far behind I try to keep up but recognize and I'm not going through and then go back and then listen to it again I hate putting stuff into words simply allergic to saying simple stuff because it's not Bute Woody so he always liked drenches everything in humor and wit and thus like beautiful language was initiated when he's describing complex things he describes him to people that understand complex things. But that's also me this is a criticism is he almost he hates explaining the basics of something hit he just skips ahead right even for the initiated nice to go to the basics. Explain like what are the ground we're standing on skips right into the depth of things which is beautiful but sometimes requires you to listen fall thing is a mess up on the part of the intelligent so they didn't know they didn't know and I know that he felt like he get me remember when this was all started out when he started out doing that it was all before social media right so he probably thought that he had this incredible amount of power because of the fact that he was connected and by the intelligence Community if he was he probably thought he could get away with it makes you wonder you thought that he had this incredible amount of power because of the fact that he was connected by the intelligence Community if he was he probably thought he could get away with it makes me wonder all the horrible things that happened in this world before social media before the spread of information was crazy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> LOL X you might be wondering why what I'm wearing on my face I'm not wondering no no coronavirus time everybody so I'm assuming that's what you wearing on your face scientific study of how effective bras aren't filtering around that have put together a survey paper showing that masks work it started as a movement called Max fall #in the Czech Republic that's essentially one of the critical components of stopping the spread of coronavirus is everybody has to wear masks and the Sciences to fold so I mean I need to break this part but cuz there's an audio if you can't get it so much better nice so the before-and-after so you probably shouldn't be wearing a mask when you do podcast definitely not but everywhere else yes that's homemade masks work so there's a shortage of n95 respirator masks which should be exclusively used as PPE personal protective equipment by healthcare workers okay there's also a shortage of surgical masks which are these non-woven fabric masks that work very well for the thing I'm talking about but because there's a shortage of them we should not be buying them and should be saving them for healthcare workers and then open question was whether homemade masks like the one I just described work to stop as a filtration mechanism this is a confusing thing for the individual Centric society that we live in masks are the most what are they actually effective for what they're effective for is to prevent me if I'm infected asymptomatic from spreading the infection to you so that's where the movement of masks for all started which is your mask protect me my mask protects you and that year there is is not I'm not protecting I'm not creating a wall from the Restless I am contributing to the opposite of the bigger aggregate picture of it by not allowing infection to spread so masks is masks allow you to reduce that transmission rate to 1 to blow one so how long you to decrease the transmission rate while also long people to be in public before businesses I know boo Han is back up in business again but there's a lot of criticism about that and they're also saying they're seeing new cases I think the question I think you can be sooner than we think if we do the following things so one I'd hate to linger on this I'd love to talk to you about it but I'll make fun of you right back but just like fanny packs are exceptionally functional to carry on the things you need masks will be massive acquired slow the spread of this infection and would like one of the things start getting Governor's so politicians to wear them at our President Trump to wear them well this is the Boris Johnson and he was talking about you openly now he's in intensive care if he dies that will be the biggest wake-up call for everyone mean I hope he doesn't die but God damn people told me over there I don't know his policies I don't know I don't know I haven't been anyone in a long time I don't know how I feel about him but f*** people some people hate him that I would like saying things like they're hoping he dies he suffers and dies I've read oil the guy wrote woke Tatiana McGrath yeah is he but it was actually his own personal account he published some of the tweets of people have written about you don't have to put it up there I don't want up these people signal but it's just so heartless so yeah that's masks but testing really masks besides like washing hands masks testing and contact tracing so I don't know what it's like an open question what does it take to do that will you can't like that there's a strange effect to it at any other factors as a as an individualistic Society you wearing a mask not to protect yourself but but to protect others and that's the weird thing for us to do the truth that the that this is a nice positive as me wearing a mask says I care about not getting it's a really powerful social signal for when you're hanging hang out with people I think it's going on though I don't think people were just a large percentage of people is my assumption that are wearing that mask that are not wearing it because they think they're going to protect other people they're worried about getting it and I don't think who in the CDC this is where I I hate what they're doing with which is sort of there's truth and that there is ideas of how the truth will be misinterpreted by the public and so you shouldn't tell people the truth so there's a kind of sense like The Who and cdcf said that masks don't work for example or they said that we should be wearing Masters you say them for the healthcare workers at the beginning of the year World Health Organization set on the podcast yesterday it's terrifying stuff and you know and obviously newspapers were going off of that information and they were printing misleading stuff as well and the president didn't know no one know what's at the whole thing is very weird if you're if you're going based on what they were saying it didn't look like it's going to be nearly as bad as it is and then everyone has had to make adjustments I'm actually one I'm so freaked out about the loss of life and the loss of jobs and how people getting SIDS it's it's really weird that everything about it is weird it's weird In Our Lifetime to be a part of something that's just affecting the entire world like this but I've got a lot of messages from friends that are quarantined with their families and like we've never been closer and that we realize that we're in this together because we realize that you know during these crazy times you you realize what is important love that's Lord you were talkin about love and community and friendship make my neighbors have one so nice that one's way even now and everyone's like saying hi and you know talking from Over the side of the yard and how's everything you guys are right and anything we're right here there's a lot of this like comfort and warmth that you know I think I experienced a little bit of that post 9/11 where people get shocked they get shook up and then they realize what matters you know about masks it feels like you're protecting yourself from like you're removing yourself to me there's that look and we're going to wait for me dirty people get away from me so that a germaphobe kind of idea that's not what they are supposed to represent but that I'm sitting here on the science that says we have to all wear them and then thinking like how is that going to change interactions you're removing yourself with me there's a look and I can't wait for me dirty people get away from me so the germaphobe kind of idea that's not what they are supposed to represent but that I'm sitting here on the sign that says we're after all wear them and then thinking like how's that going to change interactions</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the virus thing just made me think they got something to my dad a lot about my by my grandfather and just brought it and made it so real to me cuz I studied the World War II a lot especially the Holocaust and all that but they like the fact that just learning about my grandfather just made it so real to me it kind of connected everything together plus there's a book I recommend people read is by Albert Camus the plague that he wrote right after what is I don't know if you know if he is he's like an existentialist philosopher existentialists believe that you know you have to live like life is absurd Life Is Life is suffering and there's no meaning to it all you just have to live the moment and take take each moment as it comes and live it to the fullest kind of kind of idea so he described this town that got overtaken by the plague in the book The Bike and that kind of similar to bubonic plague basically similar characteristics and writes about how everybody's reacts in different ways the main character is a doctor who basically sees the the absurdity of the suffering around him that there's no meaning to it all the sad thing about the virus like with the Nazis and with Wars there's an enemy you can kind of Trace back and understand what was happening with the virus it just seems like you can't come I know where it breaks the spine of the way we think of regular life like some people try to cling on to regular life as if nothing is happening which by the way it's kind of like what a lot of our society is doing right now we're not yet we haven't really felt the pain yet and hopefully won't but there's this kind of dumb the Calm before the storm kind of. And then some people become like more religious they start to search for the bigot meaning of life the material possessions and then the doctor represents the idea that no matter what he he gives themselves fully to his to his craft of helping other human beings and overall there's a story that this idea that suffering is just part of life and the only way there's a natural Temptation when this cruelty and suffering all around you to isolate yourself at 2 to withdraw from life because anything you do in life is going to lead to suffering you know dating like if you get married is going to lead to suffering because eventually you going to lose to the people you love so there's a natural desire to withdraw but in fact what she found the doctrine what he saw around him is that love and compassion like giving yourself fully to the love of other human beings until Community is the only way to what that kind of stuff right but to me it's a really profound story about like about love being the right response in a time of Crisis cell crisis in a crisis that hits everybody that you want to kind of hide from it but it actually were more suffering happens so it's a kind of profound book that Rihanna that I recommend people read most people have read like in Hemet High School for this book called The Stranger but that one in particular seems so connected to an allegory for World War so the plague in that case is the Nazis that it just hits out of nowhere and his book is really popular in 1947 he wrote it World War II I wait to talk about these at the virus that first infects the rats and then affects the week or humans and affects everybody it was the connection and then allegory analogy to the the Nazis and so I saw the connection between now and and the Nazis of course the scale there was World War II was much more intense and and finally just how like fragile this whole damn thing is like that my grandfather had probably is your percentage chance of living you know like most people died most soldiers died in the early years of 19th 1941 when the Nazis basically Stalin was using Russian soldiers and just human beings as human Shields the actress through bodies at the problem so the fact that my dad my grandfather survived his crazy like and I do all these things I'm here talking to you wearing a stupid I like all of that is connected to like he somehow survived all those look really affects me doing research you know I hope compact billions people one day you know think that those like a little Ripple effects on how fortunate I am to be part of that I need is just all seem to be connected to me call those look real Ripple effects me doing research you know I hope to impact like billions people one day you know think that those like a little Ripple effects on how fortunate I am to be part of that I need is just all seem to be connected to me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> she gotten a little before that it was Elon about about I think you said that the Tesla said something bad about Tesla not being good about tycoons about Porsche tycan cine lens that is very unimpressed with them but as you reminded me with me and somebody replied with a meme of not a meme a real video of Bill Gates jumping over a chair and they said I don't know I find him impressive and you can't he'll answer yeah that's pretty impressive Tech CEOs of major companies that have the I can be silly like that but you don't use it you don't mean I don't mean it in a positive way sweater with a collared shirt underneath a nerd as somebody as an ideal of a man you're an idiot like I was never like that about a lot of things now you're saying that but about is that science is not admired and ways cuz I've seen the alternative inspiration Soviet Union the way people admire scientists the way they admire great athletes great great creators of all kinds and nerd sometimes diminishes that and in ways that it it seems like a peculiar cork of a human being is just like it's a bit connected to like you know going to Comic Con conventions kind of Nerd VS dork dork dork is rarely positive dorf is good if it's. Self-deprecating car Salvador cost to f****** dork but it's very rare that dork is positive Wars nerd is often positive nerd is like guys science nerd heavy heavy like that's a fun way of saying someone's really smart about a certain thing but but I don't think the way around that is to eliminate words or even using certain words I think the way around that is just appreciate people that are really great at science that's the way around that it's not the words don't really matter its perceptions that matter and I don't I don't think necessarily that science has a bad perception it just doesn't have a glamorous enough perception how many people can name Oscar winners that are just really good at lying there's really good Pretenders but how many people can name Nobel Prize winners in science is very few right exactly and I guess the thing I was also speaking to and definitely keep using the word it doesn't preventing words is what to do with week that I always hated as a person who loves fighting like I like the appreciate like am I like the fact that people complimenting sort of the the pursuit of your scientific curiosity that is great but I just never liked it's good to think I've experienced in this country is nerd as an image is seen as weakness I could get to get picked on and I was and always annoyed me because give me intelligence and annoy me annoy me like lean into it like most people I know are kind of like don't work out much and it and it kind of lean into that idea those people workout is like I don't want to get into their thing those people suck they were always mean to me something like that you kind of create a narrative where like Jiu-Jitsu or fighting is like a brute thing just like you talked about with Greek statues having small penises barbarians with their big penises have a big penis dislike the same thing you don't want a guy with a woman or a guy you don't want a woman who's hot and smart you know it sounds like when people think of really beautiful women they automatically assume that woman's dumb and off of times that is not the case sometimes people just have awesome bone structure and if they you know stimulated themselves mentally if they pursued things that they had an interest in certain scientific or you know esoteric ideas and you things that they had an interest in certain scientific or you know esoteric ideas and you underestimated them you would be Bill really humiliated for super smart but super hot girl put you in your place let you know not only am I hot but tomorrow you stupid</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> CNN article that was wondering how long it's been around there were saying see if you can find this was covid-19 around Inhumans longer than is currently believed they think it might have existed for months. Years before it broke loose and became a pandemic mutate because it didn't read the article yeah where'd you learn that CNM Library news folks it's the news leading scientist tell CNN that it's what they listen to CNN but they they have perception that other people don't agree with just like everybody else but it may have existed in humans many months even years before it grew into a deadly pandemic CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports Bellacino's not doing a good job I decide I think the entire will they doing bad the incentives like they're they're choking out the investigative deep investigative journalism this is exactly you said that the clickbait like like look at the title look at the I think they're trying to stay alive but yeah but that's that's a problem I think it is a problem but I think in the defense of particulate online journalism trying to stay alive I don't think it's good time for journalism now I'm bleeding but I from what I understand the only thing that keeps New York Times functional is the podcast the podcast that broadcast it's huge and that the podcast runs a lot of money but that's not that means they need to innovate they needs to be they need to because of the cast we need the f****** York Times though the problem they need to figure out a way to make money off of it but we need we need the top of the food chain journalism right and that's what the x is always we need them so when someone is someone's done something for the times as not-so-good or flawed yeah okay but still not there. That one person that one article whatever it is is not the X the X stands for something right with the New York Times as supposed to stand for what what it always did when I was a kid and now to a lot of people still it's the cream-of-the-crop it's the very best journalism it's the very best is the ones that have the deepest inside the ones that nail It and Weep free of bias but there's by humans you know this is the problem CNN is the problem with any new source but we still need new sources but it's run by humans they need High salaries and there's a huge amount of people involved in making that system that is a CNN so there's several mechanisms acquired first like this podcast here podcast in general require very few people to run now that there's an infrastructure to communicate with a lot of people and then the Wikipedia model like Wikipedia is thousands of contributors that creates extremely strong factual information that's not like this is very little money required to run Wikipedia incredibly so so that there are some out there that are online though that are thriving because of the problems with Legacy Media it's an opportunity it represents YouTube temples of fantastic journalists he's he's really objective you might disagree with them or you might not find his perspective to be in the line with yours but that guy is he holds those journalistic ethics at the highest level to the highest standard with him it's everything and when you read his take on or see him make it take on things he is giving you the most honest objective take on it possible and really hard to get that from a network first of all through the hard to get what he does for a network because you're going to get these giant chunks where he'll heal he can talk about something for as long as it takes to describe what the issue is where is CNN has a segment man that's taking his f****** 7 minutes while you better be done by 7 minutes Trump is bad coronavirus deadly and holyshit Chris Cuomo's got it let's go to Chris he's in his basement and then see Christmas basement with Sanjay Gupta and they're holding up chest x-rays you know they think they have their segments man segments are b******* it's dumb you have these standards that you've created a long f****** time ago and this is the biggest handicap that Legacy Media has other than their inability to be free like a guy like Tim pool is there not independent they can't be free like he is you have too many working pieces too many producers too many people there telling you what the directions say this people that bring you the segments you're a talking head is a lot of s*** going on there man lot of s*** going on there but you have to innovate and make more you need to Aspire to it and not be polluted by other influences but I can see people like I think I'm objective but I have very different views than Tim pool on some things and not others actively so you looking at a thing of Jack till you're being honest about what what it says but you also have preconceived notions of what each individual aspect of that certain thing means and what's good what's bad that's where the subjective aspect of objectivity comes in when you look at certain things that happened there certain ways you can look at something and not have a bias but look at something and you have a preconceived idea of what aspects of it should or should not be tolerated and maybe times it takes someone else to come along so kill why do you hold these beliefs is yet you're absolutely right but the problem is that based on your skill set and your momentum in history you might look at a very particular aspect objectively and not see the bigger picture for sure like Tim pool has revealed and his focus on certain aspects of problems in the system and he continues to focus on them maybe not seeing the bigger picture that's impossible for anyone to see the bigger picture I think like I tend to I-10 to see in a lot of things the beauty of things and it does focus on the positive I focusing on and also the other thing is choosing the ways you talk about it so Louise you reveal that objectivity B+ and B- he can be very cold and fact-based you can be very flamboyant and very kind of excited that use a lot of visual with all those kinds of things in all of that changes the way the message is carried the void that's been created by this distrust and Legacy Media especially now. I don't know if you been paying attention but like YouTube there's so many people like my brother is not like put the camera themselves right and say their opinions that's crazy. It's over million I think it's kind of a lockdown Chronicles I think it's it's a symbol of where we're going right it's your you're becoming but when I do this thing I'm doing this thing for 5 days a week and I'm becoming more connected with people in some weird way that no one ever thought it was ever going to happen before where there's people that listen to my voice right now in their ear while they're running right a lot not a small amount if you could see the actual number of people right now with earbuds in running listening to this podcast ubill at whoa that's kind of crazy they hard you're running into the next Dimension that's what this is and it seems like it wasn't it seems like go on the internet then somewhere along the line came this weird thing that's what it is Now podcast for a weird thing especially one that reaches the numbers of people that this one reaches and for that to be in my hands is a weird position and I'm you know why what's happening 100-count f****** strange this is I didn't anticipate this I always anticipated this being some weirdo Fringe thing that very few people would connect with which line ever tried to censor it at all I tried to do a vast majority of it completely High out of my mind and hang out with fun fun people just talk s*** and have a good time and not have a different perspective some people have a public voice and a private voice. Try to have the same voice just be me just just do that Dad so I tell people when they say what was Joe like behind the scenes that be awesome if you're totally different almost like a super dick behind the scenes yeah yeah that be a bummer or like a totally different person like you put on that mini skirt and this is just one step that we didn't think was a step it's a podcast I thought it was just like a radio show that you doing the internet but it's not into the way humans are going and this is just one step that we didn't think was a step it's a podcast I thought it was just like a radio show that you doing the internet but it's not for some reason it's more involved and more entangled and more intense and then and then also it has an impact right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Healthcare in this is a healthcare issue obviously is so complicated and there's so many levels to it but it means I think one of them that we really have to dress is died in obesity there's a giant problem with diet and obesity in this country healthy food eating eating the proper food and you don't have a friend who said that they were talking about people who do drugs and people who drink and you know maybe they should access to those same Healthcare and maybe that's a good incentive to stop people from drinking and doing drugs and I said yeah what about people do fat what are people who are fat but you're going to use the same logic with them because you can't sat Jame so can you tell hate hate that so you can't get the same Healthcare that a healthy person does well if you get a healthy person who likes to drink and they did run and they did a job but they do like to drink and occasionally smoke a cigarette what are they fear than someone who's morbidly obese yes they are so why would we have a problem is people who don't self-care with a giant problem with that people who don't take the necessary steps personally now is this because of education is it because of ignorance is it because of a lack of awareness of the consequences of an unhealthy diet or eating poor Foods or consuming large amounts of alcohol or tobacco product I don't know what it is but that is a massive part of our Healthcare System is people who are not doing the proper things to their own body in terms of eating nutritious Foods hopefully they can afford in terms of exercise which is free for everybody and there's a lot of things you can do there free to take care of your body chapter 7 in my book I forgot I got to talk about my book and you know part of the part of the deal when we when we are founders wrote out the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and in and built the framework for this free society that we live in where government's role is to protect your rights as fundamentally the government's role you have god-given rights and these are life liberty property effectively speaking life liberty and property Kristen wrote The Pursuit of Happiness and they choose these words really carefully now part of the exchange there is is a necessity for citizens to live with a sense of Duty and to live as a citizen that this idea of citizenship and to do what is right to do what is good it's hard for me to imagine that people are just so uneducated that they don't know that they're unhealthy you know I think I think problem and you're getting it that problem I don't know if that's true I don't think it's that they don't care I think they have no discipline I don't think it's that they don't care there's there's a difference if they'd never been taught to push themselves there's a lot of people it's just so easy to guess that's one of the reasons why I love the title of your book fortitude is what people need and also they need to understand that there's a great value and doing difficult things and this what's it what chapters that is it what do something hard for you will listen man that's like you're a Navy SEAL on you you know it you got it you live it this is what we need we need more people who understand that I know it's hard to get up I know it's hard to do things I know it it's hard for me to but I still do want and you should do them to me it should be something that we encourage everyone to do and that we we all talk and then we all praise each other for and we all get excited about accomplishing these things and taking care of your physical body taking care of your meat vehicle if everybody just did that we would have his health care cost this country will be radically decreased about the fact that they took care of themselves and then had discipline to not overeat and had discipline to to try to choose a foods and to make a meal plan write things down made it can be done this we're not talking about breathing underwater we're talking about things that can be done by the average person like the notion of personal responsibility is talked about enough as it it's almost all the time immoral and I'm feeling and uncaring when we say you know when this whole I go to tell everybody to be pulled ourselves up by their bootstraps and whatever in like not that we use that term but but the point is is that actually important I don't think conservatives have done a good enough job over time explaining why it's so important and personal responsibility troll our own destiny it's if you're constantly in victimhood if you're constantly being told that that you can't control your own destiny that's fundamentally disempowering that's a terrible psychological states and what exact question is do you do you have or things that happen to you or are they within your control or outside your controller it's something like that in Germany the answer was was overwhelmingly things are happening to them outside of their control right like like you understand what I'm saying 3% of people said yes versus in Germany was like 50 or 60% believe we are in control of our own destiny we tend to overwhelmingly say more than European countries that if we work hard and and and play by the rules and do what's right that we will get ahead that we will find that opportunity and I think if you could immigrate right now what's your number one destination will it's the US of a like overwhelmingly the second place is Canada and Germany at like 6% of respondents the USA is like 21% of respondents the second place isn't even close and so for all of the left-wing like anger and and always saying prevalent for all this for all of that commentary it's it just it's just isn't true and so in any of the reason that use crisis language Okay the reason they tell you're going to die in 10 years climate change the reason they're always telling you that corporations are taking advantage of you in the 1% is just all of this policies put into place and you can't justify you can't justify revolutionising the whole system unless you convince people that the system is so bad and so corrupt that it needs to be revolutionized and created is undermining of this notion of personal responsibility if you're going to convince them that they need you to save them to me do you know each to each to their need each to their ability what you're telling people is that they don't have to work that hard but they deserve they have rights to all of these other services from other people it's their right we should distribute out accordingly everybody's perfectly equal what that does is it removes agency from people and it's truly a disempowering thing and we seen this throughout the throughout history because they just want to work hard and move up and they're just so excited about this meritocracy that we've that we've that we've built into our into our culture 8-bit about how communist Cubans come to America in the moment they step foot on soil they become Republicans it's really hilarious that it's true and they do appreciate that that aspect of this country I think you said earlier is that we live in the best time ever in history and I agree with that the consequences of it being such a great time or it's far easier to get by because it's far easier to get by people look for things to be more difficult than they actually are they look for things to be more stacked against them than they actually are they look for more of a woe-is-me standpoint when you find people that actually have a real difficult life they look for things to be hard they find hard things everywhere they look and often times you find those people that have a real struggle that it's a great documentary called Happy People by Werner Herzog it's about people live in Siberia and it is a brutal difficult existence in extreme cold but these people are overwhelmingly happy and it is really crazy documentary because their physical and their struggle just existence just to survive is so difficult that they found the sort of perfect vibration of existence where they're in the wilderness they're out there trapping and hunting and fishing and and farming and in and Gathering up enough food to survive in the extreme Winters and it's it it really shows you that human beings need difficult tasks we need things to be tough to do and we need to we go out there and do them to have a feeling of satisfaction and have a feeling of personal responsibility and the fact that you've actually done the things that you needed to do in order to survive it's built into us cuz I wouldn't wish that upon anybody I'm not saying you need to get blown up in the face and lose an eye to have the sort of Spiritual Awakening and how good it feels to go through something hard but you should you should have bitchily move into a a self-imposed suffering you're about to say something that have gone through as military or First Responders really difficult physical tasks to get to where you you are just that alone creates character creates a different kind of person and the type of people that gravitate towards those Endeavors those dishes they're special people they are but I didn't write this book for them and for everybody and Glisan seals have our hard thing and it's buds underwater demolition / SEAL training at 6 months of hell and it is it pushes you beyond limits you you ever thought you had hell week especially when you're done with that when you when you come away from hell week there really is the sort of Spiritual Awakening that you have higher confidence you feel prepared for anything even in the some of the worst situations you can think to yourself well it's not quite hell week is it much more perspective relaxing in perspective quite a bit also chapter 2 is is called perspective from Darkness Highpoint the stock doubt that too many of us have have gotten so comfortable we we removed suffering from our life to such an extraordinary degree and that's not a bad thing that's an element of the modern times that we live in and I'm happy we live there but the reality in my life I'm complaining because when I'm at 30,000 ft flying through the air to Wi-Fi isn't as fast as I'd like it to be like so we have very different complaints and it's good to every once in awhile just think you know what I have a pretty damn good and to remind yourself of that again to do something hard chapter is it's one of the Deep dive into the psychological literature which I just enjoy doing there's a or the Bible with all of these all of these texts these these ancient pieces of wisdom that have been around for a very long time they all talk about this bill talk about the value of suffering the value of enduring an Archer how this build character and it's actually quite literally makes you stronger and do something with a metaphysical sense in a psychological sense and a physical what hardship actually does but physically and metaphysically like those real real benefits to this but you have to do with Joe Rogan's wife because their true life experiences to bolster those those lessons but it just has to be harder than what you did yesterday and maybe it's physical you feel tougher the rest of the day there's you like you know what I just sat and 10 minutes of icy cold water I didn't do that the day before but I did it today and now I feel a little bit more like a badass like you know what I feel like it's small things it's this self-imposed suffering is so important for a lot something and I'm just saying you have to find that in and make it habitual can't just be warrants either the seals can gets off to we we all know that if you know we know who those guys are and because they stopped stopped listening from the value of self-imposed you have to find that in and make it habitual can't just be warrants either cuz he gets off to we we all know that if you know we know who those guys are and it's because they stopped that they stopped listening from the to the lessons from buds into the value of self-imposed suffering</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so what's your take on what we're going through right now Dan for everybody in the future this is day it's basically a month into like extreme coronavirus lockdown for the country at all started sort of in the beginning of March now here we are in the first week of April and everybody stir-crazy and weirded out by this including me and I'm sure you as well what would it what is your take on this wow weekend where everything all of a sudden shift that it was the March 14th weekend I remember that weekend cuz it was my birthday and I remember how everybody was basically still going out to bars and restaurants and then all of the sudden everything changed I think the entire Paradigm chain and a long time how we got there might my general take on it we we are in a what I would call a tactical Retreat so many is a military term there to describe what we are doing we all of the sudden ran into a hail of gunfire okay like I think about this in military terms of gunfire we're not really sure what hit us we have a basic idea we know who they are we know the General Lee what the enemy is but we weren't quite sure how to combat it talk to anybody don't don't touch anybody to maintain that social distancing lock things down as a slow the spread in allow our backup are far help Public Health System to catch up at a certain point we have to come out of that tactical pause we have to come out of that Retreat and start engaging in the enemy a little bit and we do that slowly we do it carefully and so I think that's the I like to look at it that way into a risk mitigation strategy and we're ramping up our production of things like ventilators of PPE testing capability in order to do that there's some talk of when this is going to end and I don't know how you even make that distinction how how does one make a decision and it seems like one of those things were once it starts once you lock a country down and tell people stay away stay home. work don't do anything unless it's very Central at grocery stores hospitals media there's a certain things are allowed to be done right now when is that end and how does one decide when that ends from the public health perspective I hear them say certain things like after 14 days of a downward Trend in cases than we can start reopening AR is less than 1 then you can start reopening so are being less than one man very contagious person they infect less than one other person right now that numbers are at just over to okay so there's there's an obvious spread that occurs using those as our standards I would like to see a fuse other standards as well such as are we at a point where were testing and we have enough ventilators and little bit space and PPE to actually fight the virus alongside reopening our society because we cannot indefinitely walk down those costs are enormous and 401ks in our jobs can't do much needed surgeries procedures because you know what's called an elective surgery is going to be kind of agraria it's a lot of stuff isn't getting done from public health side into account elective surgery is going to be kind of agraria a lot of stuff isn't getting done from the public health side jobs there's divorce rate for suicide we have to really take all of this into account as we as we talked about 1 to reopen Society</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I feel it resilience is almost like a muscle it's something that you can build and it's also something they can get soft and I think that I look I love Comfort don't get me wrong but I don't appreciate it unless I've done something difficult you know if you look at like all the different things I do and say all you real productive and it's nice dude I also like to watch TV I like to put my feet up I like to kick back like to have a beer I like to relax but I don't like to relax if I'm not doing s*** I know me and I get mad at me if I'm not doing anything I don't like me when I'm not productive but when I am productive I also can enjoy to relax I enjoy relaxation and I don't enjoy it unless I've learned it and I think that's what people need to do these you need to earn their comfort of Shame I already know all this because it's true all right now I'm I'm I'm trying to give these lessons out in the clear and coherent kind of fun way but these things are just rude you feel bad when you don't act the way you envision yourself to be but you have this hero archetype I talked about your architect for you have this idea of like what you think is the right way to be you're trying to live up to that all time we often fail make your own if you've seen how how successful people are in your like I want to be like that maybe doing comedy or fighting or whatever it is I feel like they have a way of doing something that maybe I should mendicancy built this overtime and you know when you you know only you know really when you when you don't meet that standard we don't meet that standard there should be a degree of shame that you feel this is a problem I viewed in society anymore it's almost the opposite and it went when you do when you don't feel bad shame you can't feel a sense of Duty to be that citizen that we talked about earlier and I find this to be a big problem that you know what the small stuff like examples in the book like you should feel shame when you're that person who doesn't put the shopping cart in a little shopping cart section parking lot but like why won't you just want to just put it away and worse and if you don't put it away because you're in a rush you know because your kid is screaming and if you have a good reason not to put it away but the question to ask yourself is did you feel bad about it right did you feel bad about it and if you didn't feel bad about it what the hell is wrong with you this makes him mad at us like a damn easy to do just just put it back b**** just walk it over there put it in the little stall and you feel better like look I did it I seen what I do I bring all the way the fuk back to the supermarket, I put it back in the front steps take much time and I feel like I did something even if it's just a trick the grocery store doesn't even have to put those little sections out in the parking lot they could just tell you to put it walk it all the way back on the door. The reason why I like the little stalls is cuz of people that do have kids if there's a mom and she's got a baby with her gray give her an out a way out or hire some kid to gather those things up while people are walking out with them fine but if you're just a guy and you know you're shy for yourself and you don't put your car back f*** you you knowing that sense of shame that you're talkin about that there really is important people need to feel shame if you've come up short like that because you can do better you can do better and you should want to do better the way to get back the way to get ahead in life is to do everything that way the way you do everything is the way you do anything the way you do anything is the way you do everything with me that's really what it is if you just do the right do it the way you're supposed to do it you can do it and you'll feel better if you were supposed to get a workout in today like to sleep in and get your ass up and do it and you'll feel better when it's done you like damn I did it I can do this tomorrow to you can and its momentum and just developing that momentum it's a skill it's like everything else it's like learning how to be polite it's like learning how to be cordial learning how to be a nice person these are learn things you can't except that you're a piece of s*** and this is just the way you are no just look at yourself as if you were another person judging you like as if you are a person who's like a life coach judging you what would you tell you to do the psychology behind it but the problem is his like we've I feel like we've removed shame in our culture 2 to a huge extent to wear towards the most celebrated to you know to do these wrong things and one part I do bring up the example of of of how we view you know assistants on government assistance and there's the movie Cinderella Man where Russell Crowe plays the whatever the name is a boxer but we also believe that you shouldn't take it if you don't need it that seems like a pretty good good piece of in a civic duty to live by and experience leaving the Navy where we were actually encouraged to get on Social Security disability insurance as I was leaving the Navy so I was in a classroom full of the only one with a visible injury or is obvious as to why I'm being medically retired and they're all getting medically retired and by Nature getting medically retired from the military Insurance even though every single person in their walk right out of that classroom is perfectly capable of working was so frightening to me that it was that it is so ingrained in our new culture that it said it was actually in the curriculum at a government classroom and in this kind of stuff is cheered on being the sort of hoaxes that we've seen her why did jussie Smollett feel that he had to say that to Maga guys in Chicago what was enough what the underlying psychology behind that was because we change the definition of right and wrong and I and I see a need to get us back to some traditional definitions before we all lose our freaking Minds a very good point I think what you're saying is absolutely correct I think victimhood should be if you are an actual victim me and I feel for you it's terrible but if you're not a victim and you're playing up victim but it's disgusting it's one of the gross things that you see in our culture especially when we're talking about how easy Society is now when you have a person who is affluent and successful and famous like jussie Smollett who does that and you like Jesus Christ man I boarded you missed the point that's why it's so foul for us when we see someone who's just trying to be for their own personal gain their trying to game the system and make it out like victim of the grossest things that you can see in a successful culture and its people out there that wheelie are injured like yourself from combat this people out there that really are sick people out there that are really victimized by violent crime and to fake it it's such a it's such a disgusting insult to people that actually are injured real victims in victimhood culture capable of work yet I'm kind of blind and like I can't see even out of my good eye but I can work I'm not shown that I can work why would I take that but that wouldn't be just so that wouldn't I think I would go against their classical definition of of what is fair and just and yet in our current culture I do I don't believe that anybody would call me after that and I should be called out if I had taken that money I really believe that I do I don't believe that anybody would call me after that and I should be called out if I had taken that money I really believe that just because I was already getting benefits right as a result but</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah we you and I privately had this conversation through text messages about the way reporters are using this moment to criticize Trump with with in Ridiculous Ways and one of them was this questioning of whether or not he should describe these drugs that have some promised which many doctors are describing hydroxychloroquine with the Z Pack and zinc apparently combination that keeps getting brought up and there's a doctor that has been using this to some reported success in New York City but what drives me crazy is that these are rare opportunities that someone has to talk to the president and they're using it to chastise him for bringing up drugs that do show promise and hope he's not telling people to go take it he's not advocating it he's not pretending that he's some sort of the medical professional he's just talking about some things that show Pro in the medical community you know what what is your take on all this cuz this is it's a it's a it's a weird situation that he finds himself in with the Press is very strange and antagonistic position we think we should be worth it mean to be a good American a good citizen the Press believes it is their duty to only be adversarial to to politicians mostly conservative politicians they don't treat them across the same way but educated Sapulpa full context full understanding of what's going on not press briefing room and actually asked legitimate questions that would inform the American public but but they don't they play he's got you again the last questions like what do you want to say to people who are upset with you right now and I think they're failing us miserably and then there's the opportunism that occurs like if you're writing an APA if you're a journalist writing an op-ed what's an opinion journalist especially but you always do that in direct questioning with the president just to try and play this gacha game it's not helpful helpful and it's not informing anybody in the least you know you mentioned that the president talking favorably about the floor clean or hydroxychloroquine and you remember the the couple that ingested that out in Arizona because spayed or something like that might be misspeaking bowl cleaner fish tank cleaner weather in Mass it'll actually work but but to express optimism over it to two after each other in the worst of ways and a new ability to do that I mean this what is with these new tools that people have to social media and through making these viral video clips which is what each reporter is hoping is there going to accomplished by being combative with the president and trying to catch him on something they're hoping that they're going to create this viral video that's going to accelerate their career it's very self-aggrandizing it's and it's disturbing that there's there's not someone who stands out what does the sort of press junkets that doesn't do that actually right about that exact point in my book like this what we've begun to do is reward this sort of overly passionate emotional Behavior so we've replaced sophisticated reasoning with outrage we grew up this way and there's there's like fictional characters like the Jedi hero archetype or Superman or or like or like real characters like Rosa Parks that we actually look up to and we identify and in our in our current outrage my culture like we see somebody who plays the victim and we cheer them on reality what we used to do is he somebody who overcame adversity who was the true hero in the wee cheer them on when we totally reverse that you actually get more points if yours more snarky if you're meaner if you're if you're if you're playing this kind of cheap shot game and like it in my book this example of like these these this group of Veterans Day they were waiting for me I knew something was off because we never wear the gold letters that say veteran on it don't I thought that was strange and it turns out they were just getting their own video camera ready to record and then they start calling me and like just go nuts like they lose their minds talking about Trump in the news play and I kind of engage with them and some funny ways but they were extremely emotional I'm either voice is starting to crack it was about you or to you how could you how could you how could you betray the country by supporting the president of me things like that mostly sloganeering like this call me while walking my boo that the scenario and then they like and then there's this whole deal where I have to get the elevator because that's how I get to the books like I leave my my office on the fourth floor and Cannon I take the elevator down the basement I walk across my route and that you think that you that you have to use as much emotion as possible and it's been express your anger in in the most exceptional of ways otherwise it's not worth listening to but we haven't stopped as a culture and we have to stop rewarding and that's what I thought. Rewarding that kind of behavior actually control good for you but you talked about them and that's what they wanted that means there's so many groups out there that I don't even know if they have an endgame that the endgame seems to just get attention and you know and Shine the Light on these atrocities or whatever whatever they feel like is in Frosty</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> China yeah so I just mentioned that one that story that just came out which is what they actually prevented PPE from being delivered outside of China so together we are our company's 3 and they produce that there should have been exported out they prevented that there was a study that showed that if they had if they had actually been honest and given us through the world three weeks extra notice 95% of the spread could have been contained okay 5 million people all over the world the reason this became so bad in Italy and Iran is because of the belt and Road initiative these are major Hotspots for China's Economic Development and the belt and Road initiative so the World Health Organization better can't even be transmitted human-to-human contact on January 30th World Health Organization said something along the lines of there's no reason to be shutting down travel or limiting travel so they're directly controlled by the Chinese government the World Health Organization it should also be worth noting I forgot the guy's name who but he's from Ethiopia Ethiopia is one of these countries that is huge as a huge investments from the Bell Road initiative until I mean we'd to be calling for a complete complete change out leadership of the WHL yeah he shut his connection off and then he said China doing a great job let's move on and you know like what very weird so deeply corrupt I so deeply and I mean point where there was the progressive left in the Chinese just repeated it latched onto it but this whole notion that it's racist to call the virus the Chinese virus was it was such an utterly absurd thing that we were focused on as a country when it just doesn't matter reading that quite a bit in February so they're doing things like that then they claim that perhaps it was the US Army that had started the virus in Wuhan they haven't let International inspectors go in and investigate the origins of this virus that we can better understand it they said there's going to be there already is quite a few things that were looking at it as what we can do to one rebalance or supply chain but we need a better industrial policy on bring a lot of important manufacturing back home and can be more competitive than that sense is there any evidence that this was a man-made virus you know this is the big conspiracy theory that they would have a level four bioweapons lab in Wuhan viruses like this anyway yeah we just we just don't know the answers and I don't you know especially my position I don't want to I don't want to assume to the need to manufacture things in America and I think both I think he's received skepticism from both the left and the right on that for different reasons mostly come to write because you know we we we have we have really good here very closely to the free trade where where the more free trade the better where where somebody else can make it cheaper than then we should just have them make it all right is comparative advantage and that's true in theory it is true but but we can't ignore the consequences and I think we have ignored those consequences for a little too long like what what happens when you when you close down that factory your t-shirts are cheaper per unit which is the really big deal for the margins but it's like a psychological benefits of these manufacturing jobs as well you're creating something people like that people like to feel like they're producing something and that they have meaningful work that pays pretty decent and so there's consequences and there's consequences to the efficiency big big Dire Straits right now we risk we risk the possibility that we lose energy into between Russia and Saudi Arabia now hopefully I think administration's Melodies and diplomatic pressure and figured that out but no but balance right now maybe yes and maybe we do need to look at changing our supply chains maybe that means some things are just slightly more expensive maybe that's what it means but for for a lot of element for a lot of items we have to be looking at the consequences of allowing us to have things manufactured over there what kind of karma do we take on for when you look at Foxconn those buildings were they made got your iPhone live net surrounding to keep people from jumping off a how many people have to jump before you put Nets up and like what what what has to happen there where you were your your life suck so hard to make an iPhone and how much would it cost to make those here is it worth it for us and you know is there some the real value in that the label used to love to look for made-in-america there that's that's not really that much anymore I think it would be wise for all of us to invest in that ID again in the problem is is like we we hold ourselves to those standards of good labor conditions and good environmental standards and we but we punish ourselves and was out of business completely until we punish ourselves out of business sometimes the energy sector whatever it is because we we we we simultaneously make ourselves less competitive while also forcing our people to compete against people who are who work their employees so hard but they have to build nests around for office they throw themselves off of it one that we just accept because we want an iPhone and I mean apples one of those profitable countries the company's rather the world ever known made is a spectacularly profitable company and it like there's a hole in government policy and and they do but I'd like to do more the reason they don't is because when they put out that job application nobody will show up early is not enough people and so-and-so what the what does that tell you it it tell you that we we're not educating people in the skills that are necessary to engage in these jobs is a lot of technical skills that we are not teaching because education policy Federal Loan program student loans why are we promoting things and Majors that actually get us to a higher-paying job why why should the taxpayer be on the hook for a major that is guaranteed not to pay anything once you graduate like what you going to do with that degree in whatever who knows you're not useful for the economy that that we want and so what kind of incentives need to shift is my is my point to encourage more that so that Apple when they do look at a place to build a new Factory they can be they can be confident that people actually show up to work there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> quotes out there from media and from from from pundits from Twitter users am I in my my fear that it continues to be said okay you know and it prevents us from having a reasonable debate because we we truly need to have that reasonable debate the other the other thing of frustrates me about these kind of bad faith argument is that the people saying them made the same claims them self like a February 1st Washington Post headline in the coronavirus okay February 1st coronavirus is scary but the flu is deadlier in more widespread day February 3rd Washington Post why we should be wary of an aggressive government response to coronavirus the same papers are now destroying the present all you didn't act early enough you didn't do anything it's if you have the blood blood of people on your hand but like that's amazing who says it's not safe to travel to China so this is falling President Trump's extremely at the time of very bold move to restrict travel from China and of course all of these papers and prominent people are now saying something different I go through a timeline to buy look at because it ended my continue to accuse everybody how this is this is a good one on the same day that that Trump implemented the restriction on travel this was January 27th okay and then January 31st asare the prettiest the 31st the Trump Administration implemented the restriction on travel January 31st and also declared a public health emergency on that same day promoted a bill call Dino bandak you could limit the president's ability to impose travel restrictions that's interesting and then act like this when you remember this too and I pointed this out at the time because you know a lot of people were not talking about coronavirus in February and on February 28th which is a few days before February 28th already been spent by HHS by CDC that needed to be reimbursed so the Trump administration's or even dealing with this matter like a congress we need more money we need more supplemental funding he got slammed cuz this was earlier in the week we actually voted didn't know and I I just want I just want to point these things out because it's important to give each other to Grace to be like hey not everybody knew what was happening it wasn't until early March that it was exploding as a virus Tintin in Tehran and Italy and in South Korea he's things happened and it wasn't clear that there should be massive massive lockdowns play hindsight and enacting a holier-than-thou and point fingers but if it's highly disingenuous and I and I built this whole time light out to show it from grace and and solve these problems together because it will be very easy to blame each other for the deaths of Americans no matter what the decision is it will be easy because the counterfactual is impossible to prove it's so easy that political opportunism is so easy is is what worries me the most and like we have to have this conversation so about reopening society and when to do it and we have to have the conversations about this political opportunism and shaming it and and calling it for what it is and then really being honest with those quotes in the Washington Post a New York Times USA Today and letting people know know we didn't know what this was we didn't see it coming and when it was coming we were real confused as to what the consequence going to be and we're also not getting on his data out of China right China is just a day or not honest about the body count they're not honest about any of it we don't really know what happened over there the version that we're getting is got holes in it it yeah let's talk about that I did find a quote that I told you I had the wrestler victims of Trump's stupidity and narcissism prominent Washington Post this is from a prominent Washington Post columnist I'm not choosing random Twitter users you know New York Times President Trump was so focused on fabricating threats involving Central American Caravan that he was oblivious to the real threats so</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so maybe discuss is is the balance that that needs to be talked about in this is where I would have taken the conversation from earlier about the media old people please take care of yourself stay home that provide assistance to get you food or do whatever they can to get to you but people that are high they want them to go out and live their lives they don't want the restaurants to shut down the pub to shut down this is a disease that you know it's ravage people of all nationalities and the old age and demographic groups but they're their ideas take care of your health be careful but let's get Society back on its feet again and they're widely criticized by that I would love to hear what you think that's a good strategy or not but there's three different strategies okay and there's a Harvard white paper that that delineates these pretty well I spoke with one of the professors from the center of Ethics that that was an author of this and you can describe these three strategies in the following way jump to the third one the third one would just be surrender okay let it happen will deal with it as we go but we're not keeping anybody at home that's effectively what Sweden is doing the second option would be sort of a mix of the two which I think will end up being the American option or better will should be where we have a defined. Where we remain in place but then we we confront the enemy and like I said we're in a tactical Retreat right now but I need to be prepared to do it Sweden took on the third approach which is like the basically they they think they can deal with it and we're going to see now their cases are jumping up pretty dramatically I don't know how much they'll continue jumping up the swedes are also very good at culturally following the rules Americans don't like a lot of rules I sweeten the swedes will stop at a red light at 2 a.m. cultural differences I think their social cohesion or ability to follow rules I like the Koreans is it different than our culture where we are we are just way more individualistic and we're going to do whatever the hell we want we want to flamethrower in our office organizer flamethrower at our office like don't tell me I can't have it right yeah it's always better lets you want to start a fire without the situation is move to that rather quickly now we need to be careful about how we do it but I'm very very concerned about these indefinite extension of the timeline to stay in place I think I think we have to start having reasonable conversations about the cost of that in the cost a lot more than just dollar sign the cost or hell of a lot more than just people's 401K is tanking the costs are actually people's lives also whether it's mental health or suicides are divorced or Applebee's all these procedures that we're just putting freezer so like and I have a lot of problem with this place is like Houston or hospitals are not overwhelmed 50% capacity prone to this giant City with enormous density the most it's the densest city in the country by far is also the most likely place that a lot of international Travelers were coming in and out of New Orleans will they had Mardi Gras these numbers in the wrong ways and not taking enough into the account into the fact that it we just we have very different lifestyles in different parts of the country and also take into account that we can Target certain Solutions once you slowed the spread by doing what we're doing again I'm not against doing what we're doing I just think we need to stick to the timelines and maybe make those time on sooner than later and then come out and fight what does fighting mean while we're in wait we're basically we're ramping up production of protective gear or ramping up production of ventilators again our system is as amazing we are producing we're going to be do the numbers before or talk about socialized medicine like one of the benefits of our system is we are actually way better prepared than people realize now we have a big lack of PPE there's a lot of reasons for that I can go into one reason is that China was stopping for from 3 a.m. for the rest of the world uses a lot of it in China are preventing those experts who they want before the supplies then they act like the good guy and go around the world giving it out and then trying to ask if we're going to have to really look at the door supply chains in our relationship with China after this but that's one of the reasons we didn't have the proper amount of PPE president is everybody's micromanaging boss and that's just not how our system works nor should it and there has to be some level of accountability of the local and state-level to again I just got the phone with some of the doctors here at the Texas Medical Center and I'm like how are you guys on PPE and they're like we have so much PP what I've noticed and all the finger-pointing and in a lot of it's just political opportunism I don't know if you if you like if you do put these people at school lie detector test I wonder if they really think it would be the president's fault that this happened like I don't I don't think they could pass a lie detector test and I think it's I think it's a lot of political Pediatrics but in any case it's away from the right way to look at power levels like California wants to try a single-payer healthcare system let's see it work in California or smaller say and then let's let's Skate City and then let's go it's it's it's it's a matter of the scale matters to a huge extent and socialism works if you got maybe like 50 or 60 people cuz you can hold each other accountable there's a little bit easier to maintenance when you scale things out of dramatically changes things we have to remember that as it pertains to dealing with the pandemic and dealing with public policy as well into a system where were simultaneously combating the pandemic but also reopening our economy we have to have that in the natural reaction from disingenuous people is well how many lies is it worth to save a job and I'm like okay that's not the right question also misses the point you know we we live in a world where we take risks and then we have to take those risks and then mitigate those risks accordingly and we can better mitigate risk and we better understand what we're dealing with and when we're better prepared and those are the two things we have to do over the next month new beds where they might be needed any more generators anymore PPE so that's preparedness side and on the other side it's just like you know like you'd explain in Sweden with cheap sick and vulnerable people away let's target are our efforts a little bit better listen to him or vertical approach as opposed to horizontal approach that's a terrible way to think about it I mean I I can moralize this situation so I could save 30000 live this year because I'm not going to let anybody drive and I am a better person than you because you have the blood of 30,000 people on your hands cuz you won't people driving yeah that's where it's not at all know you're you're absolutely right and I'm worried about that when we do go back I'm worried about that finger-pointing I really am because I think it's just going to muddy the waters and I'm also worried about it being used as political opportunism</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> remind everybody of this with their start to the drug price discussion that bill that hr3 bill it won't become law because it wouldn't hurt get bought out by the bigger companies that support system works and it's a very dynamic system it's it's it's why we RV by far the number one innovator in the world know what our country innovate like we do I don't do the research like we do if we implemented the price controls that are inherent and medicare-for-all or hr3 there wouldn't be anybody else in the world doing what we do should we have Medicare for all doesn't coronavirus prove that everybody should have free healthcare and again what I would have to remind everybody is is that if we had medicare-for-all what we're basically talking about our price controls because Medicare already pays below average payment for for anything before whatever service were over for whatever doctor visit 60 70% on the dollar right now what was the Medicare senior program at 65 and make sure that their basic needs are covered in terms of sickness illness injury and such and we could argue that we could we could even debate the merits of Medicare on its face would be available for everybody if Medicare for all was available for everybody what you're saying is it was essentially you you would fix prices on on everything in terms of medical treatments and and that would be a problem because of what will soap Sherman said that your podcast could could only take $100 for at and I was just the price fixed for now on what incentive would you have to really expand your audience what would you have to keep going or expand the business you wouldn't be able to it's similar under any industry it wants you to fix that price on you're going to reduce the supply that goes in I can only get $100 for add the reason why you would say that the sting shouldn't cost too much for someone who's injured or sick it's cuz we want to take care of each other as a community and the ideas that Health Care should be something that we we provide so many services to people that we we we are united right the United States of America we're supposed to be a gigantic community and one of the great things that we could do for each other is to make sure that if someone's sick or injured and something's wrong that we can take care of that like everybody do their share and we would like everybody to chip in so that this is possible but there's a big difference between that and fixing the price on an ad no but not economically there's no difference morally there is write instead of just an economic issue the reason I don't describe is it it's not in your right it is both a moral and a Mexican guy that is fundamentally true it is fundamentally another country we have overwhelmingly per capita more ICU beds in this country than any other Western Country overwhelmingly per capita we have more ventilator than any of these other people were all girl freaking out right now and in our ICU beds on a per-capita basis our system has way way more than the UK than Italy in Spain to Germany all of them like like orders of magnitude for also we're the ones who Innovative in the vast majority of research and development new drugs that come out that comes from this country so these are these are facts that we can escape if we do price controls and medicare-for-all is fundamentally a system of price controls if we do that economically speaking we absolutely will reduce Supply we still want to help people to do that good parts of our healthcare system which is quality and Innovation if we undercut those things were the last country doing this for the last country in the world truly doing Innovation either the world is left out the drive is there a way to do both is there a way to provide Healthcare to everyone but also encourage this Innovation and current profit so you encourage these companies to do all these great things you're describing and and and May in this incredibly high level of healthcare that we have right now that that's certainly the goal right in and that that should be the goal in this is why I think there's there's got to be room for compromise on the health-care debate because you can't compromise with the other party if the girls aren't the same difficult it is to get to that point while also ensuring that we maintain quality and Innovation so well I'm working on personally is is the primary care side of things because her primary care doctor is your bet your first point of contact in healthcare and the system that I think works best for that has direct Primary Care subscription fee of about $75 a month and they have full access to you so it's like less than a cell phone bill this already exists this model is prevalent it's growing I would like to see a girl much faster to how do you do that when we can't subsidize lower-income people in order to do that how we do that is very complicated what are healthcare costs like like you and me we can still afford that just like we afford any other monthly cost and you have access to preventive medicine you have access to telemedicine you actually have a doctor-patient relationship that makes it a lot easier to start solving the rest of the problem making our insurance Market more competitive companies that came out to be a lot cheaper than we originally thought it would in the early 2000s went when this thing was created this was a republican plan because Foundation that I think we have to adhere to and the other thing I pushed back on a little bit is is the healthcare is a right statement and I push back against that obligation to serve you not exactly no I mean wait wait we have public services that I would distinguish those public services from something like Direct Care and it doesn't change the mission of the military right thing away from them but these nonrival economics term for the sort of non rival attribute of these things it is different right because it's only a select number of doctors and we were burned out more price controls reduce supply and supply reductions in other countries girls don't get the same amount of money they're not going to rest in that extra I see you better not going to buy those extra ventilator they're not going to hire those other doctors eye doctor doesn't want to be a doctor because they don't make them out of money that they thought they would make their doing extra work because there's more people who now have access to them but there's less of them so wait lines are huge and they're seeing multiple more patients a day doctor burnout increases quite a bit quick answers to why why why that happens but that's our human rights issue it did we we kind of moved around with that The Vig either different than the fire department or the police department or well it's not a right either actually those but the fire department's not necessarily A a right as we would be the same if it's provided for everyone from a practical standpoint just because it's much easier again you cannot hundred thousand people more to your city and the fire department would have marginally more more work to do you know compared to like a doctor for instance it does that make sense like you just it doesn't that that nonrival attributes matter it matters quite a bit so what you're saying is because competition is necessary with medical Innovation and also like doctors profit off of being exceptional so you you they have incentive to be an exceptional no know what I'm saying is if you have if you have 10 doctors that's better serving the community every time that doctor is serving somebody that means somebody else can't see them signal that we need more doctors they're understaffed would be yes but I'm saying that's how it's different from a fire department which is sort of lying and wait for a fire to occur it would be a signal for there to be more doctors which is why the free-market price price points are so important because the only way to signal that is to actually there that demand raises prices when the government tries to do that is a socialist that they would say never works never ever work the Government Camp Spell omniscient as to know every single price signal and and anticipate every single piece of demand and production that is therefore required until they know it's not just health care that this is a problem it's every aspect of society so if I can go back to what you were saying earlier you said hey let's make the the government take care of everything was take money from the wealthy people and pour it into the government that the government will then have sources take care of these issues and you you're just looking at the first step of the problem you're not looking at the secondary or tertiary once you do Implement that first step is that we're saying hundred percent what I'm saying socialism doesn't believe in incentive doesn't believe that we need incentive to do things there's there's there's this utopian believe from the hardcore of philanthropic manner no matter what right now maybe for a few people if you altruistic people would be the ones you know doing all the work while everybody else is like pretending to work which isn't happening the Soviet Union you pretend to pay us we'll pretend to work right that was the saying from the Soviet Union these policies then we're not thinking through them correctly and I understand a lot of democratic socialism and I'm like yeah but it but it has very socialistic Tendencies effects of removing human incentive of forcing somebody's services and because you're calling it a right which means that you now have a right to somebody else's services I've been proven not to work and I and I and I think we and I think we have to understand that as we try to move towards the mutual goal of getting everybody access to healthcare department is in the fire department in a lot of ways a socialist Institution specific emergency service as a as a public good they come in and help you there's not a financial incentive for them to do so right but I've been a practical level on a practical level though imagine the scaling that has to occur if you're if you're doing that with medic with medical care they were talking about over what you're talking about socialism overall not just overall not just involving medicine talking about socialism in general and I'm saying isn't the fire department and example of socialism that works example of socialism and the people have these as a basic part of our society and our civilization this is an important discussion to have because oftentimes even Democrats aren't really talking about socialism doesn't call it socialism about Democratic socialism and you make some very clear distinctions between the two of them which I think you could apply to things like the fire department or the police department policies because he does talk about putting government control on corporate boards Elizabeth Warren talk about the same things now we really are talk about nationalizing thanks Industries on wage controls that you really are talking about more of an actual socialism what is a public good we've never in our economics we've never defined these things as socialist institutions and social institution effectively means your production and you're you're forcing everybody into a centralized planning State you're you're you're telling people what they will learn and what you will pay them how much they can sell the fire department is really not that again that is better than a public service it has a defined and has a defined budget of the definer roll beaches with Piers ago we're probably more of a free-market than we do in many ways when we look at their regulatory standards are quite liberal when we look at the corporate tax rate as it's very low they don't have a minimum wage and in many cases until they're not what they do have is a very Jen welfare state and and that's a different than again and even that is different than socialism as a giant welfare state now I'm still against that many ways I think there's consequences to that giant welfare state that that they now have to suffer with as a result and if you've noticed India used to be much more deeply socialist countries on the lot of them have just maintained their big welfare states which they are having trouble paying for just like we're having trouble paying for our big welfare state which is mostly based in Social Security Medicaid and Medicare when you say public good right this is what you feel that the fire department is it's a public good right what do you think that this is possible to implement something like that with in regards to Medical Care the discussion definition straight we're just saying okay we just want another public good in a more accurate way of describing it I think healthcare 30-something trillion dollars never over 10 years so about about three and a half trillion per year so that's basically doubling our budget just every year that's in addition to what we already spent additional federal spending some some some people try to massage those numbers and say all but that's actually cheaper than what we have now if you had it all together that is false that is that is completely false and that's not a controversial study everybody basically agrees Elizabeth Warren's plan was 50 something trillion dollars that's adding what we already spend to the new spending I would have to occur so what does that mean in practice it means doubling or tripling your taxes okay let's say they actually want to do that then you have the second and third order consequences which is okay what are you getting for this what is this new Utopia that we really live in where Healthcare is free and then I go back to okay in order to meet that price point of the the three and a half trillion a year that's that's by the way assuming that we continue using Medicare prices which is what all the plans do assumed by the way we're doing that were drastically cutting prices that we pay doctors and hospitals if we do that we drastically cut our supply of doctors and hospitals and we and we and we cut off and choke off the Innovative capacity that we do have so we're losing those quality the quality point it is too costly until rather do is actually Target the source of the problem make it easier to get insurance cuz right now I mean it's for so many Americans that insurance is just too expensive if you have it through your employer it's usually pretty good people to be happy with that but for the most part it's too expensive which is why I go back to my direct Primary Care idea because once you hit once you saw the primary care issue you mix all the insurance much easier you can do it then you can still protect people we like things like Iris pools at the state level or reinsurance programs you can make this you can continue to make improvements to the system that make it affordable for people people a fax just the thing weather in yours my question in the whole thing like Insurance still have to pay for it then it's too you're still paying someone still paying for all this health care if the insurance companies are making any profit cuz they're paying for all the healthcare then what happens then do we fund the insurance companies how does all this stuff get even doubt people can afford Healthcare so we get insurance insurance takes care of healthcare how did the insurance companies make any money then just like anybody else but they're also that they're there also what we found is especially with our experiments with Medicare insurance companies against each other and they lower cost I'm one side is driving up costs you know because the doctor wants to keep doing more tests or whatever it is or where patient wants to do more things the insurance company's job is just hold on a second why are you doing this what what is the reason for this was the outcome that we expect from this so that naturally drives that's natural assuming that the government will somehow be better if that then insurance company insurance companies are great that all everybody doesn't seem to like them but I also don't want the government doing it I don't want to be in a case like in Great Britain where where the government will say you know what your grandad's not on the ventilator anymore we're done with that or your baby can't get that care these stories and we don't have that issue in America certain things they might but they still good but the car still happens the hospital has to eat that care a lot and there's there's different funding mechanisms that reimburse them but no that doesn't that's not the way it happens over there any more there's no choice but that's that that is that is the decision and then that's what they have to deal with and so it's it is different but don't they have some private healthcare over there as well I think it might have elements of it but but but not for basic care I said you can eat for four other kinds of healthcare that aren't but not for basic care I said you can eat for four other kinds of healthcare that aren't really out</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it worries me a great deal with weekly changed a few definitions like what it means to be a victim I think we change that definition overwhelmingly and we change the definition of justice also an injustice and what an injustice actually is we forgetting how to do we forgotten how to distinguish between discrimination and disparities like just because you don't have the same thing occurred there the real problem and it's it's made to be very difficult as it may debate with my colleagues the Democratic party is very difficult because every disparity is assumed to be originating from some kind of Injustice you know every time somebody is welder than somebody else the Assumption nowadays is that will it still be gotten money and that there's some kind of Injustice that occurred there is no renegotiating through this thing it was actually looking pretty good Nancy Pelosi comes then says he'll no blowing up the whole thing and we're going to protect workers and damn you know not these damn corporations okay so basically the same bill anyway that's a long story operation attached to it and we forgotten how to ask ourselves why is that did they do something evil what would it what exactly is evil about these entities you know that they employ lots of people who create lots of wealth and in this particular case or not do anything wrong worries me a great deal it worries me a great deal that's what I think that's what leads to be sort of topics of socialism is one of the bad aspects of the ideals of socialism is this inclination to think that when there is an inequality that than inequality is because of either corrupt corruption or greed there's also in equality of effort people do not put in the same effort and when you put in more effort you're more focused more discipline do more work you should be rewarded and there's people that don't like that idea they don't like that idea cuz they're f****** lazy and they're weak and that's a fact and there's people in this world that are weak and there's it's it's a unpopular thing to say because we want to say that no there there economically disenfranchised and there was the some people are yes some people are and there's also some people that work like a motherfuker and those people get by and they get ahead and those people should be rewarded for their effort one of the problems that I have with people that have spouse socialist ideals is that they don't want this competition aspect of our culture and our society to exist where you putting more work you get more reward that's my whole life that is my whole life I mean that did every everything that I've ever done I realized oh all you have to do is work harder than everybody else do is put in more time all you have to do is be more obsessed more focused and you can get by you can get ahead the people that don't like that or the people that don't like competition that they don't understand it it makes you feel bad when you lose everyone should get a trophy every once you get a participation trophy that is a giant problem with our culture and this inequality yeah there is income inequality some of it is corruption some of it is bad some of it is in equality of effort and that needs to be addressed as well and it's not like you can of his blanket thing that all the people that run corporations are greedy and all the money that they have acquired is because of ill-gotten gains it's just not true it's not true and it's it's anti-American frankly first one's personal responsibility one of the detail on that has mental toughness whatever the whole book about so it's important you said it exactly how I described it when I get speeches on this which is we need mental toughness because otherwise how do we survive in a free Society where we have to compete cuz the only alternative to a bunch of people is that we do live in a society where competition Society can't function very well actually do anything and you have to be mentally tough to deal with that and I think the American Spirit named Eric our history as a culture is a really really tough bunch of people to remind people of that celebrate you for it people tell their victim of stories are cheered but where's the part where you overcame it I thought that was the story were supposed to cheer competition with cruelty and I think that's that's foolish as well and yeah it feels bad to lose but that's just because it feels great to win there's it's a it's a Pecan Valley thing and you have to understand that and look every competition that I've ever had any anything that we have ever competed in Lost has old me beyond measure it is what gets you by it's what makes you better one of the reasons why I understand this is because of martial arts in martial arts you have to train with the best people you can and it's it's f****** sucks you get your ass kicked it's part of the but that's what makes you better you need those people you love those people they become your brother's is very very very important the bonds that are formed in Jiu-Jitsu gyms and kickboxing gyms and martial arts gyms with the people you train them mini train with is an intensity to those Bond that's almost Indescribable to anybody that hasn't experienced it I mean I'm sure it's not as tight as people have gone through combat together but there's something there's something in those people they they fuel you they help you and they help you by trying to kick your ass they help you by trying to be better than you they help you by trying to be the man that they want to be the best they can be and you think about those motherfuker you go to the gym you go goddamnit Mike is here and you get fired up for that person that you know is going to kick your ass and they provide you with fuel people that are better than you provide you with fuel competition provide you with fuel it doesn't mean you have to be mean it doesn't mean it's cruel it doesn't mean it's insensitive it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that it just means that competition is good competition is good for you it's good it shows you your better abilities it shows you delete that you you can aspire to Greatness you can Inspire to be better than you are you can do this and you can do this by looking at people who also do it they are your fuel inspiration is fuel nobody gets inspired by jussie Smollett putting a f****** fake noose around his neck and walking into a hotel still holding a Subway sandwich nobody's inspired by that maybe your Inspire to never be that guy and that but it's a week inspiration you're inspired by greatness you're inspired by great people stories does autobiographies in documentaries and stories of them putting in that work anyway. That's why there's so many people that you know they're their Instagram existence is essentially just all they doing is just providing inspiration to people like David Goggins that f****** got everyday means that guy's fueling millions of people just by being a badass just doing just life is hard motherfuker stay hard and just getting out and running everyday just by doing that I don't know him some help him who is who's filming these he's got a lot of money I mean he sold the s*** out of that book so it makes it fantastic book and I can't recommend it enough and you can't hurt me it's called and the audio version is even better because the audio version actually get somebody else to read it but then he comes in between and discusses each and every chapter so it's like the audiobook and a podcast together you know he he lives in incredible life and he's that guy is an amazing source of fuel for people but isn't amazing source of fuel because of his own competition with himself and he's a guy that talked really openly about being weak at certain points in his life and being fat lazy and that he got through that isn't had that he wasn't born this f****** Warrior that came out of the womb running a hundred miles from being a slob and he's real open about and he's even open about his own weakness currently he's like sometimes I stare at my f****** shoes for 1/2 hour run my shitt I don't want to do this but they don't go out and do it and while he's doing it he'll yell you know that people like that are fuel and there's certain people that don't like people like that cuz they make them feel bad they look at themselves to go God damn it I don't work as hard as that guy I don't have that kind of mental toughness and then the needs to try to find something wrong with it but it's it's because they're not willing to look at themselves objectively they're not willing God damn it I don't work as hard as that guy I don't have that kind of mental toughness and then the needs to try to find something wrong with it but it's it's because they're they're not willing to look at themselves objectively they're not willing to try to be the best person that they can be</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> concerns I think classical liberals and it is that how you would describe yourself I don't know what all of us political world Joe Rogan's political leanings are like the great mystery I just don't think it's a good idea to take someone who's struggling with dementia and put them in one of the most stressful positions the world has ever known that's what I'm saying is not an endorsement of trump is it is a nice saying you shouldn't have a man who's clearly clearly in the throes of dementia I mean there's I'm not a doctor but when you can't form sentences in public and you forget what you're talkin about and you you're you wander off into these conversations if you're not can pot and you're not high if you're not pills like what's going on well there's cognitive decline he's an older man that has mental issues and you know not to be cruel to him he's he's suffering medically this is what is the real issue and the Democrats want to sweep that under the rug and Trump is already too and Emma parties already dismissing him I mean that there is a recent thing that Kyle kulinski posted a video on his Twitter talking about this is what happened when don't discuss the elephant in the room and Trump saying used to do it during a press conference and they asked him a question was something to Biden Rodeo I didn't write that he's like that's a democratic operative he didn't read it he probably doesn't even know what's going on right now and he's going to he's going to continue to do that and it's it's such a vulnerable point and I I don't know why the Democrats thought it would be a good idea to take someone who's clearly got a problem and this is what do you mean the guy we've all seen it it's not normal it's not normal to forget like when he's talking about the Creator and he literally loses what he saying he's like do you know the thing struggling the guy struggling he's tired this is extremely stressful process to run for president and the idea that he's going to be able to get through this and be okay on the other side to run the country for for potentially 8 years his crazy looking at the coronavirus in particular in the handling of it and this is obviously the subject of hot debate continue in and politicians including Pelosi who continue to repeat that Trump has the deaths of thousands on his hands on my I think that's a horrible horrible overstatement I mean to say the least it's just fundamentally not true just recently acknowledged that he now agrees with Trump's decision to close down travel from China in January and a podcast no I don't know where I go to a timeline of what actually happened right like with what's actually look into this debate and in an objective way of who knew what and wet because you can criticize people for sure and what we all knew at certain times saying that was repeating Chinese claims in mid-January that this virus couldn't even be transmitted in human-to-human contact you know and Trump was ripped apart for that Biden ripped him apart for that by a couple weeks ago those are those are certainly issues and I need to go into it but it's that can talk I mean anyone who's not in in severe cognitive decline mean pick a person should I vote for Hillary vote for him literally the poor guy shouldn't be in the position he's in I don't understand why they're doing that I mean anyone else could have been Tulsi gabbard Amy Klobuchar Pete buttigieg pick a person they all would have been a better choice and this is crazy and I don't know what their strategy is I don't know why they decided to do this it makes no sense to me it's very very confusing I mean anyone else could have been Tulsi gabbard Amy Klobuchar Pete buttigieg pick a person they all would have been a better choice than this is crazy and I don't know what their strategy is I don't know why they decided to do this it makes no sense to me it's very very confusing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> true it's true why should I should Joy have boundary shouldn't and we have this is what I'm really into I'm really into like people having a big stake in community and I think when you look out for other people that's when you have the biggest steak in community and I think that's one of the things were missing today we're missing week and we can do it around neighborhoods like we're talking about like you know your neighbors it's really nice but I think we could do it in the expanse of way as long as we didn't give in to the temptation to be shity two people that we don't know and I treat everybody is if we're all a part of a community I think that can be done and I think the best way to sort of enhance that kind of thinking is to make decisions that are for the downtrodden make decisions that are for the working class in the people to struggling and people they're just trying to put food on the table and keep a home heated that everyone that's in that experience there because they're lazy or because don't work hard or because they think that they just said but it is but it's it's all so that they don't know they have an experience with those people experience and if they think about every person alive you there's not much difference this is our unsurmountable positive thinking broke one of the problems that we all have our perception really look at things people also deserve attention exactly they need a hug or just so scared will Java raising their kids to the point of broken cats and those kids need to find some way back to the garden and that's the reality of scale that the factors 350 million people just in America is that the real numbers at North America the right way like you have to have no room for douchebaggery no room for density possible level of guidance and of understanding of the consequences of not behaving that way and the benefits of behaving like somehow or another it's a weakness if your if you show if you show any sort of sympathy or Compassion or or try to have some understanding from people are downtrodden or poor people look at you like you're weak but now you're looking at the wrong way you're looking at you feel uncomfortable about it because it makes you feel weird because it's too many variables and it'd be better if you just nailed down to 1 or 0 is a lazy or the good hard-working people it's a good hard-working people who figured out the delays they don't it's not how many of us the idea that like no one should get help that's so crazy I was on welfare when I was a kid it's important it's important for people to keep them fed like gives people a chance like that doesn't mean that people make sure that the government has our confidence we feel like we can throw them our money they're going to do the right thing with it and we're going to help communities where to help that's what everybody's worried about for good reason it's just who the f*** knows who's taking your money they don't give you an accounting cheat they don't show you what they're spending on you just keep it up and like all these are the people that are taking care of us and then you can also take care of yourself and each other and measure neighbors and recognize your community and an kind of bill from the ground-up know who your your local representatives are you know for fucksake like your kids and their schools in like all that stuff like that is a very powerful tool and even I mean those are official titles and official designations and all that stuff is awesome to but it's also just know who the f*** is around you and liking in and be nice to each other and figure it out together we're all acting like every buddy is not going to help you and everybody's not going to understand you and then that one that gets fed to a scale of this impossible number 350 billion people 350 million people doesn't make sense to us it's so hard for us to ever understand what it's like trying to like do what's best for 350 million people and if there's ever a conspiracy to keep people stupid that's a conspiracy make that seem like it's normal make that seem like a month everybody shouldn't you really can affect things and you really should pay attention is to make life better for everybody when you're really really really really rich let's say You're really really really really really rich what if you just really really really real you are contributing in a dynamic way to A system that helped you get really really really really rich see The Balancing Act is not wanting to get to a place where you stifle people's need to do well because they need to have some sort of motivation some people do you want me to have motivation stop this idea they're going to come steal your money so I can know what you are going to help you're going to have to steal any money you're going to help people that can't help themselves but there's people you might have got lucky might have got a good parents and in a good situation good neighborhood good school you did well when you get Boston words like socialism and libertarianism and all these different f****** labels that carry all this weight behind them and we just say like what's your intentions is your intentions to make the community a better place for everybody and make people happy make sure we will have food and make sure people are loved and make sure people are in a wart that's what we should do as a community that's the thing that's the thing these f****** labels with his liberal Republican you f****** cook you know you goddamn hippie all these different labels of people is so easy to dismiss people with these labels and they have such an agenda plays on that part of the human psyche that wants to be a part of a team that attack opposing ideas and it becomes a f****** tribal thing it's so hard to sort out what's right and what's wrong you know but I think we're in a weird space where no one at the wheel I think that's the first time there's no the government doesn't have a hold of Wheels mastery this thing is you know you said the word love and like music and art and you know things that are cohesive in communal environments and helping people come together like in terms of like feeling like like what what can I contribute like how can I help because this feels like an epidemic this this disbandment you know amongst us and all the sphere everybody so scared I am in a in and out of it I go in and out of my fear is fleeting you know it it's things that are a little superficial at times but at the end of the day like this the love thing that the energy that you could make fun of me I don't give a f*** you know like the fact is like we all need it you know will want it and we all deserve it so what what are going to do with that you know like we can sit here and dissect politics and agendas and this guy this guy and socialism all his stuff but we all need to feel that thing and it is love and is very very very powerful and it comes in many forms and it has you know different hats and I think that right now like like I'm sure that you feel it at a show right when you play music for people you know I'm sure you feel it all the time with your podcasting with your shows and with the Outreach that you have and you don't forgive me I don't want to assume you know it and I feel it it in all the varying degrees of the shows that I play and things in like at the end of the day this stuff it like where we're at is a scary place but there's like this thing is just like kind of one thing and it's it is the love thing and that has like a bunch of different adjectives around it and verbs that are like recognizing each other and seeing each other and saying hey we're different but we're the same and we're okay like let's keep moving you know the thing that saves me from all this like deep depths of fear is that. There's really nothing else I have to say like cuz it's a weird that we're living in but that's the thing that's it it is weird world and people can tip left or right or people tip good or bad one way or another depending upon how you approach them sure and this is a thing that a lot of us get wrong you run into someone there a dick your dick back and turns into a fight you like the other guy was a f****** dick yes but sometimes when some was a dick and you're not a dick they stop being a dick that's right we didn't like we used to defuse a situation where energy gets heated and some reason I don't know I don't know if I should retell the story but like you know you its accountability to like you know when you mess up okay to be wrong I smoking made a mistake I'm so sorry we're really helps your education as a person as a as a girlfriend or boyfriend a lover a father or Son you learn when you fuk up you learn you learn like God damn I was wrong I guess that's a valuable lesson cuz it's humiliating there's some when you're hanging onto righteousness like this like and ability to say that you were wrong that is a f****** burden it's not just a burden it's so foolish Pursuit like you should relish every opportunity to apologize and say you're wrong as a showing of strength does if you think you're strong you think you're strong and you know you're wrong and you don't tell the truth will then you are a fool you're you're missing out on an opportunity for you to be strong show the strong the show that you made a mistake I've made a lot of mistakes I make them all the time I'm a f****** dummy all right I do my best but but there's a lot of mistakes you talk to me about it and you want to have a discussion about it I'm not one of those people that I don't think there's any value in pretending you didn't make a mistake I think there's a real send it. The rules were written were written by people who really hadn't had a good grass for the territory yet they didn't really understand what they're saying they should have taught people that school they should have taught people like that in junior high school high school for sure it should have said your your failures those feelings that you feel like they teach about history and math know how your failures are a very valuable fuel you have that feeling you get when a girl dumps you what a feeling that when you crash your car or the feeling that you get when you f****** ruin something you say something wrong when something comes out of your mouth when you anything you did wrong you flunk out of a class that negative feeling is a boost to the next orbit it supposed to blast you into the next level of understanding what you were doing wrong and how to improve in your life and how to go forward with better habits and if you don't experience that pain that feeling that embarrassment then you don't really know how valuable it is to stay on your grind and people say it all the time it resumes of people that stay on your grind like yeah but it's not okay to be human speaking we can't just be like accountable and strong at the same time meaning is that why the like monkey brain enough that's like you have to be all that s*** like ancient instinct when they would it look if we barely had enough food to keep our babies alive and our friends alive and our parents alive barely had enough food we saw someone slacking holyshit do you want to f****** kill them if you saw them someone that was sneaking food taking too much food I saw someone that wasn't putting in their work and you were just slightly shy of being comfortable and you knew this f****** lazy motherfuker they just did their work we would all be fine but they don't do it we do they dated claim their foot hurt or they claimed it back hurts they go back to the cave nobody wants to kill him that's what the f*** that's for it's a resource balance relationships like that against like welfare people that need exactly exactly attaching ultimatums or ultimate rather like this is the ultimate truth to any sort of circumstance in a general sense like to pretend that f****** Let's Pretend Yuba City of x amount of people you have a million people that are on some sort of assistance with his food stamps or welfare or whatever the pretend they're all one saying is crazy to pretend it's all one story is crazy one set of circumstances once that's not that's not the question should be like there's no billionaires or sign up for food stamps right do millionaires they're trying to get welfare money right it's only when you're desperate so the question is like how do we engineer Society so that even the most desperate people never hit that spot never hit a spot where they need assistance the most desperate people are always taken care of but they don't have to worry about it and then what motivation is is just following your dreams what you enjoy doing whether it's nothing like playing music or writing books or whatever it is whatever it is finding that thing but that that motivation for doing that thing should be above all above the idea that you have to survive by doing some shity job to make a living to pay for your bills and just robbed you of your your your time and resources it should be like a f*** face recognize that people have a lot of resources need a job will give you the money you don't need a job but understand this m*********** you give it a gift you give it to give the Beethoven ever had Hendrix never had nobody had it you got you got money enough to live no go but understand you got lucky live 80 years everything over there tomorrow to look at the way we distribute money as being like we think about it right now as being this is the way we've always we just have to look at the way we distribute money as being like we think about it right now as being this is the way we've always done it this way we're going to do it but money didn't even exist</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> who led back to where did music come from you know sometimes I wonder if like the people that came up with these things and obviously you can go to school and learn a trade or you know become a master of your craft for engineering but like sometimes I wonder if it's just like some weird other dimensional source that comes out of nowhere I think we should think of ideas as a life on this trying to propagate cuz everything that you see came from an idea everything every invention ever eat everything every song that you've ever written and sang every book it's ever been all that Stan every book ever written came from an idea and then boom it's a real thing like imagine if ideas because we don't know where they're coming from something's giving you a yes like a chant like it was a Channel of sorts that creates things has a very narrative feel like it's coming out of nowhere like I just have to be there to get it you know if you spend a lot of time on it and you're working at it and you're passionate about and you're focused it's it's almost like a music even if it's not real men still real cuz it's it's there's an accuracy to the like if you pretended there was some God that was bestowing upon you these Amazing Ideas if you focused on it and if you eat you let the correct life and live the right path then it would give you these gifts if you focused on your art form and that that would be like if someone told you that there was a God doing out or creativity and you don't know where it came from and idea I will come to you I think it's equal not equal parts but it's you know when you put in the effort to like keep the muscle Flex like the creative one where you're writing regularly or you're practicing regularly and then you also kind of let it you know sort of come in its live podcast man Theory and he said it was almost like he was I don't know why this was what he said but he was a gingerbread man and there was a big hole in the top of his head and there was all this s*** falling into this hole from somewhere and every once in a while about 10% of it with light lead us the rim inside of the gingerbread jar and that was him and the rest was other stuff Morty Rick and Morty so much if you do live and then you put all that together and you know we were talked about the war of Art also about like I think everything is a weird thing that we call that you know we call procrastination and he calls it resistance in the book it's really interesting because you realize like what is is weird thing the tries to keep people from being their basket stuff there's like a weird confusion and stress about it that keeps you from focusing on what you really need to do to be a true professional and he's related out of the book in a way that makes you go like 40 years old figured out what he'd been doing wrong changed his Direction and then became like super successful as a writer really respected as a writer and this book is one of the most interesting things because you know like his history that he kind of figured out how to get out of his own way out and put in the work to grow and evolve Kohl's of like a habitat you know what I'm going to do this I'm going to procrastinate in this it's a powerful force you know and then that can grow into so many things you know your self-doubt and now I'm not ready I can't do that I'm not ready yet can't play that show or whatever you know example but has a wrestling match wrestling match between like creating stuff and and being disciplined putting in a lot of lot of work or slacking off and feeling like oh my God I got to get back to work again and then being really excited to work hard and get going again and some people fall too far into one way or the other and there's like a weird balance in there that you don't have to be scared Melody is a big part of of you know giving an honest thing to a crowd when you're playing music or comedy you know I think that sorry I feel like I'm talking too much. listen to in a knock against Conservatory students and things like that but I found that people that are really really smart in the musical education element and and you know again I got a lot of friends and I hope I'm not stepping on any toes but it's almost like harder for them to Vibe out because they're so smart and they're they're almost mathematical with their playing where is like Gary like let's just f****** Raw let's hang out and like find the thing where I think sometimes I felt like when I played with people that I know I'm going to get so much s*** for this I'm so I'm like kind of embarrassing I know the map frontwards and backwards but if you can't feel it when you're playing live and playing with other people then there's a huge missing element that's what I want to say I am not I don't want to but I think that you almost have more of an obstacle when you are you have that kind of intelligence with music because it's upstairs go to say but I kind of simplified like this I think of it like a radio like back in the day when you tune a radio he try and dialing whatever station and you get that Clear Channel sometimes you have to move yourself sometimes you have to just like I'm in that place to receive that inspiration for that that thought or or that Melody whatever that is I'm not Cloud myself with doubt or this isn't that what this person's doing or whatever I'm just I'm here in this with everybody but I'm like I I'm going to dial this until the noise goes away a little bit louder that clears thing and whatever you were talking about with the gingerbread thing are so consumed with giving what they know there their they're not taking the time to sit back and listen like just shut the fuk up for a minute and listen to this beautiful inspiration that comes out of nowhere just like listen to yourself when you show up to a place gives you everything that they know is it where the collective here or you need to like to now and like look at things from a don't get to like the way you're describing your ability shut the f****** and look at the world and draw inspiration for the world is that something that came to you in time or is it something that you always kind of intuitively knew I just I think it goes back to like sitting around smoking weed with my friends and just like not getting caught up with the b******* best type of an artist to be this is like just who listen to my so who am I listen to myself I feel like listening to the sounds</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Unifour example and this is something I think would be kind of interesting to talk about everybody is losing their mind at the moment in the space that you and I sort of Cohen habit of ideas and trying to figure out how do we remain saying and plugged in and open-hearted and open to new things but also rigorous and fair all of these weird pressures of the ideas behind the intellectual dark web this this concept of having a bunch of people that have different ideologies but yet she common theme of wanting to have real honest communication and honest conversations and try to figure out instead of looking at things from an ideological perspective look at things from an honest objective Point end in try to see the way other people because it wouldn't hearted man. Not trying to destroy each other and effectively trying to become the adults in the room as we watch the kids run right right and not always achieving then because I refuse to actually say what it was or who was there's a lot of pressure to codify if I knew that if I codified it it would. You have one but if I don't get one you have what are the clubhouse we just don't tell the members where it is because the IDW that doesn't mention me on my ass yeah yeah I think it's pressure you know and I think I want two things that we're all recognizing from whether it's the internet and the or just celebrity in general which I think it's part of the culprit is especially if you're reading comment and articles written about you which I do not recommend if you are doing that don't do that if you're doing that you are subject to a massive amount of pressure it's a lot of pressure and sometimes people they applied sometimes that pressure can help you like if it's a good friend or someone who you trust and it's done with intellectual honesty and they just really really think that there is maybe a flaw in your thinking or maybe this could help you or maybe this is an issue and then you realize that and yourself correct that's great but there's a lot of people that are bending to the will of the masses and they also are responding to the pressure of the master I don't know is whether I recently read my comments is because I want to know what Russians think you listen to me Joe here we go let's go down the rabbit hole together for sure and we went we talked about this recently let me just say this before you go in that we knew something was going on years ago I used to have a message board and on my message board on my website it became problematic for legal reasons we were putting a bunch of illegal s*** up there and I was kind of responsible for them to issue came up earlier how many coming to get in real trouble we had an influx and by an influx I mean thousands and thousands of Russian emails signing up for my message board I mean thousands with really similar email address right and they would post and pretend they're from f****** Cleveland or post and be mad that we don't have enough Nazis on or whatever the f*** it would be you know it would just be but we just same thing that the IRA was do internet research agency was doing with Facebook and Google and we were seeing this like 4 or 5 years ago that this stuff was kind of happening where they were recognizing that the disease large portals of discussion and so they're trying to manipulate the discussion and turn certain discussions toxic and certain and you know and come up with Preposterous conspiracy theories and attack people for nonsensical reasons will this is the thing I keep seeing the same message modified a hundred different ways for a bunch of accounts that have suspicious similarity not one of these accounts usually is followed by anyone I care about and then they have a few high-value accounts with blurry photographs of a person that like I think somebody's like putting real money into that account to create a fake person which is dog doggedly follows you and is constantly trying to talk to you in your ear that account but how do you know that that's what that is and how do you know it's not just some personal time get to any of it really is really interested in Eric Weinstein was a couple times I've tried to like talk to the person it's nothing vanishes like you're so disgusting would never talk to you goodbye on the other hand there was this huge number of jokes about Ben Shapiro and a booster seat that were also play different versions of the Joker and all of the accounts were like a strikingly similar I was thinking I could imagine a little bit of this but it's way too many and this is part of what I believe I believe that we are in a new world in which a lot of the Grassroots stuff is is AstroTurf and if you start to listen to it you start to get pushed I start to watch certain tactics I make models of the tactic you like one of the tactics is Tosh Eric I once thought that you had a lot of integrity and now I know that X know if you don't if you don't address this situation I'm done following you goodbye but I believe that I believe that there are sophisticated players were engaged in trying to either boost our signal or start to alter the sea somebody will be up somebody will be down and then there's like really weird Dynamics I think that there's a very strange thing going on not with Dave Rubin but with the crowd of people that is just trying to eat Dave Rubin and Rudman blind him and confuse him and this guy Sam Cedar who sings Russian I hope he is but I do think that is his I think he has a it's following I don't think this is inauthentic that just loves to dark harass what dunk drag I hate this language the disconsolate shitt on them and they also think it's cute to take anything that he says and interpreted in the worst possible way possible and not think of it as him just being a guy who's trying to talk about things on the Fly and maybe isn't even prepared about the subject at hand like Mustangs it comes up on this show you know when we were talking before we were going to go in there when talk about my yeah you don't know what the f*** is going to come up and you might have a piss poorly formed idea of what a subjective where they just feel like okay we got a wounded antelope I pick him off and you know I think there was probably a move to do Shapiro and there was a. Where you were seemingly in the crosshairs but you're hard to kill and you know I have no doubt that was in the crosshairs that's the benefit of not paying attention and this is something that I've been pretty rigorous about over the last six months while the years you Sam Harris and Dave Rubin have all given me versions of this advice and I worry about it because I'm not large enough yet that I've been the target of a steady campaign but what happens is you see people's feedback loops interrupted and in part to course-correct you kind of want to know cuz I would like to harsh with that guy went on with Jordan Peterson on Dave show I was more aggressive because I think I'd seen Jordan and Brett on your show together and I come from an ethnic family be interrupting each other that's normal and Jordan is an interrupter in though what I found is that I probably was in tooting that I had to be more forceful a lot of the comments that wow Eric I haven't really seen you this aggressive was it there three of you on a conversation it started off Dave Jordan in myself and then Ben Shapiro came in for an hour and I think Sam Harris might have been scheduled to come in and over there's an issue always more than one person there's a reason why do one-on-ones almost even when I had Bob Lazar with Jeremy Corbell just just having a third person that wants to chime in like oftentimes interrupts the flow of conversation like in that case it was because I wanted a lock in on Bob Lazar I wanted to get all my feed but I'm going to find out who's this guy full of s*** what I want I want to lock in with them but it works it can be magical and wax when it doesn't you know it's a little bit like jazz guys if that group is meant to be then they don't trip over each other solos they're trying to come up with something with three great friends I have this issue I mean it's really great stuff with multiple people on your show when it doesn't you know it's a little bit like jazz guys if that group is meant to be then they don't trip over each other solos they're trying to come up with something with three great friends I have this issue I mean it just in great stuff with multiple people on your show doesn't work</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> tour the Vatican I had a really great guy that was really cool took my family through this thing and he was he was professor and he was really happy that I was so curious about things so I don't want an apple and a small like what's going on with that and he was like that's a really important question and he's like back then the thought was that bigger penises were brutish and that they were that these you know you got to realize these are people that were fending off barbarians and the idea was that their gods would be beautifully proportioned but they would have these small sort of less dangerous penises. Peni Lil Dex all of them might these guys like if you looked at these guys like just the way they're built the reality is most of them would have Hogs right these are heavily muscled Stickman with a lot of testosterone they would have big dicks most likely that's the reason why protecting you from said barbarians is it true that the castrati of Italy were sought after as lovers they could still perform really yeah but then you didn't need to worry about pregnancy how could they they could get erect yet but they will never Castor that doesn't make any sense that wrong I think that's why they would do that they would have Unix operating formed on the castrati but I believe that there was a way in which they were sought after as lovers convention away plural for penis that's the right way to say it talks about a cox-2 how do you say that to Montes Montes Qui Qui they would have inspired a taste for Gamora and people whose taste is the least depraved what and when Casanova fell in love with a castrato who conveniently turned out to be a woman and drag he asked her to dress as a castrato in bed. I'm done check please to in quotes in soft Unix Place their blissed and shun the scrubbing bearded kissed yeah they wanted someone who eats a lot of p**** Affairs were idolized and safe but bed-hopping could be risky for the castrati one was assassinated by his Lover's Furious family and another who wrote to the pope requesting permission to marry on the basis of that his castration had been ineffective received a reply let him be castrated better the pope said no you can't get married we're going to cut your nuts off better banjo better job all mouth and no trousers castrati had more fun than you could think hello Guardian Samantha Singer who wishes he'd had the chop it's an adventure has been around for a long time. Now the last castrato was recorded see if there's actually require we play absolutely ridiculous selected area is is that right yeah Alessandro morichetti Morissette more SG Morris G Alessandro moreschi the last castrato Christ the complete Vatican recordings what they do that man's mouth while they had in there the right yeah Alessandro morichetti Morissette more SG Morris G Alessandro moreschi the last castrato Christ the complete Vatican recordings what they do that man's mouth while they had in there</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and today's podcast today's podcast so first of all you can reach it now I finally got a website just Eric Weinstein. Org and I told you that we have to leave this planet and that because we can't all be as far as the best beaches in the United States and by the way you pointed at the gods but for the wisdom and that became a meme so I gave these lectures best quotes ever isn't it don't know which one he's probably but it's so right it's like every now and then so we can get the whole thing in a sentence we now God's but for the wisdom so that's why we have to get off this planet diversify because too many people have god-like powers Donald Trump commands a tremendous amount of Godlike power thanks for physics Community was ratings so so the best hope that I can come up with and it's a slim one is his if we could figure out what goes beyond Einstein's theory the einsteinian speed limit might be bendable or breakable because we would be in a framework that was larger than Einstein people off interpret this is what they call ftlr faster-than-light travel but that's not what I mean necessarily what I mean is that the underlying source code gives us opportunities that we don't normally have so seven years ago I tried it released I tried giving these lectures at Oxford which is probably the university that is spiritually closest to what I care about what you think about geometry and physics in the in a relationship that kept the face with a Faith with that tradition through people like Rodger Penrose and Michael attia and I released this theory of geometric Unity rather I released the video of the lecture that introduces this Theory so this was the first time since 1983-84 that I talked in public but when I started this program when I was 18 19 something like that and I just released the video today on our YouTube channel it is the video of you giving this discussion was introduced by professor Marcus du sautoy who has Richard Dawkins old job is the Simoni Professor for the public understanding of Science and he met me in a bar and you got me a little drunk I said okay what are you really working on and I told him and the first it sounded crazy and then he started thinking about it and he ask me more questions and you brought me over to Oxford you got me an appointment had me talk to their experts and then he decided that he wanted me to give these when he called the special Simoni lectures they are an attempt to go beyond Einstein to look for a unified theory of physics between the two major branches that have resisted unification and that's usually in the modern era confused with the idea of quantizing gravity but the Quant the quantum gravity imperative is a it's a political program that comes out of what would have been the quantum field Theory Community before it became the string theory community ideas we have to take Einstein to make him submit to the will of bore and I don't think it's exactly like that then I don't think they got it wildly wrong and they synchronize themselves and took the field off the cliff and they weren't able to ship a product they couldn't deliver on any of this promised so when I saw that they were about to go off a cliff I switch Fields as an undergraduate into mathematics and I use mathematics as a stalking horse to study the same sort of underlying structures but not to get sick the politics of physics and I had this Theory which I cannot talk about for the first time in like 37 years or whatever it is and like today's the first day that I'm sort of free because I've kept this to myself so if you want to ask any question about geometric Unity but why why did you keep this to yourself cuz I don't trust these people I know there was some people that doesn't matter if it's not them your system that believes in pure review it believes in for citations you have to be at a university have to get an endorsement to use their preprint server it's too few resources too many sharp elbows there's a logic to that Preserve making about it I'll find out that I'm wrong version of the theory alright first time ever do you know that start off with escher's drawing hands so do you Jamie do you have a picture for that the key problem that we have in a fundamental theory that people don't think about is not why is there some rather than nothing I don't think we can answer that it's why is there so much that is that is Rich out of almost nothing and so this issue shows that if you had a piece of paper could you will into being the hands holding pens using ink to draw each other right that problem is akin to the problem that we face in a fundamental theory if you had the canvas how would the canvas bring all of the richness that you see around you in to be and what I did was I said okay we have to go below Einstein to we have four degrees of freedom but they're not yet space and time is Proto space time but before and then I said okay that those four degrees of freedom are like the stands in stadium in the stands somehow need to build the pitch and the pitch is a 14 dimensional space so if let's imagine that you had. I've got four objects here so it's four degrees of freedom chords by the four objects that we need a ruler to measure how much of each of these four objects we have that would be for additional variables and then you have angles does lengthen angles what Einstein gave us in space-time so the angle between any two objects of the same as the reverse of the angle so then you can count it up in there 6 angles to be had so there's four degrees of freedom plus four rulers + 6 protractors just 14 so there's a 14 dimensional auxiliary space and in my estimation you and I are in some ways potentially having this conversation in a 14 dimensional world that we perceive back in the stands rather than on the pitch as a four-dimensional conversation that is we're in the three-dimensional room going for so I called this The Observers and The Observers is two spaces rather than Einsteins one space stop y14 Dimensions because I'm saying that the fields that is the stuff is dancing not mostly on the four dimensions that we think we perceive but it's also dancing on the rulers and the protractors so in other words I have XY and Z I need ruler next rest of the wise directions AZ to measure things and I need a watch which would be like a ruler in the time direct so those four rulers are in fact in play as well and they're the protractors because Like A Spacetime is 4 degrees of freedom plus rulers and protractors I'm saying work over the space of all rulers and all pro tractors as part of where these particles and field can dance so the rulers and the protractors are part of the system the choice of particular rulers in particular protractors so by choosing particular rulers in particular protractors Einstein is grabbing a tiny filament of the space of all possible rulers and protractors sew-in in effect space-time has recovered as the act of The Observers contemplating itself that's a little bit poetic but I mean that the choice of a space-time metric inside of the space of all metrics is a section of a 14 dimensional bundle over a Ford wellspace now that's the first sort of mind-bending weird thing is that this is not happening in one place it's happening in two places in X and Y the stands and the pitch the things that are happening in the stands and the things that are happening in the pitch so you know what when a guy is like trying to make a free throw and everybody's waving their giant noodles trying to get him to miss there's an interaction between what's happening in the stands and what's happening on the floor and at The Observers is the bundling of spaces and saying hey you you're confused as to what's going on here some fields are happening in the stands some fields are happening on the floor and their Everything feels as if it's happening in the stands cuz that's where you're sitting in some weird way then you got this really crazy stuff which I think one aspect of it is everybody in theoretical physics is looking to figure out whether there were three or more Generations that is copies of matter everything in this Next Generation 1 all made up of up quarks down quarks in electron so that works and down quarks give you protons and neutrons and electrons give you the sort of interesting personality of the various chemical elements are also neutrinos but they're streaming through us I'm not going to count them and that's all Generation 1 of matter so everything in that thing that is like plastic Lego then there's another Lego set made out of wood and then there's another Lego set made out of like lead you know and we don't see those other two Lego sets and except if we're doing great energetic experiments so there were three copies of matter and everybody was trying to figure out three or more and I thought maybe it's two or fewer until one of the aspects of this theory is that the third generation of matter is an impostor it looks like this generation of matter in terms of its particle personalities but if you actually to heat up the system it would unify with a bunch of particles nobody's ever seen before and so their predictions for what does new part of Breezewood be there's also a fourth pseudo generation of what would be called spin 3/2 matter is not prohibited but has never been seen as a fundamental so it makes predictions for the particle properties of new spin half a new spin 3 has particles it attempts to say that there are sectors of matter that I think decoupled that the universe is not in fact Left Right asymmetric which would be called chirality and if you think about week 4 so if you have a new Neutron on a table little to K and I think something like 17 minutes on average half life when it decays there's an asymmetry in that decay called beta Decay and that was found by a woman ramp Madam Lu from Columbia and the cobalt-60 experiment so in the 50s this this gal Madam woo should have won a Nobel Prize discovered that when cobalt-60 decay do beta Decay the electrons come spin out one side and not the other meaning that the universe is like Marilyn Monroe or Cindy Crawford having a birthmark that lets you tell the left from the right so this is like the ultimate experimental badass who never got recognized fully she did an experiment based on work of Yang and Lee that for the first time showed that the Universe had a preference of one of its leftover it's right if you I don't believe that preferences fundamental I believe that there's another copy of matter that so the analogy I give is that if you think you look at your three fingers in the center of your hand your middle finger which is my favorite is obviously symmetrical bad self your digit ratio 2 and 4 is pretty close but is determined by the amount of testosterone you're exposed to In Utero and then your thumb and your pinky are wildly off but you could try to make it symmetric and say while you you know I think he's like a lame from which it isn't if you're just looking at your hand you're trying to figure out why is my hand asymmetrical but you don't realize that you got another hand and it's thumb to thumb thumb to pinky that is the symmetry so when you going to place your fingertips together you see that if you didn't know if you're like all oversexed out and you can only see part of your body you think about other world is asymmetric while my belief is that it in week gravitational situations this other matter couples so you only see one hand or the other and we're we're all in one handed so what I'm starting to do is that I'm terrified of talking about the stuff I don't have the right credentials not a physicist I've been out of this game for forever so I often say the wrong things and break rules and who knows what and I haven't really talked about it this is like really a very lonesome I've been completely alone on this project what do you think the end result of this project potentially could be cuz you're saying we could get off this planet what do you like what are you talking about in terms of the actual implementation of this this theory of yours so Jamie if you could bring up my answer to the final Edge question which is what is the last question John Brockman asked when the final year that he conducted the annual Edge question and that is the annual Edge question yes he would ask 200 people many of them physicists and biologists or mathematicians you'd ask question and then write an essay and then every year he publishes a book if I did that for 10 years finally got tired of it and he said okay this is my final year we've exhausted this what is the last question so this is the question that I asked so does something unprecedented happen when we finally learn our own source code and nobody picked up on this but that's not my concern is which is what happens when the universe finally contemplates itself when we are the first Uber always worried about the AI becoming self-aware I'll ask Ina it okay we are the AI and we're about to become self aware if we can figure out what around source code is so we are skyknit so you're talkin about the source code of reality itself and that are percent are limited perception reality are giving us a distorted view of what the landscape actually is where I'm trying to make sure I was somewhat holding this back because I'm afraid of what it unlocks and now that I know that we're willing to elect Donald Trump not store masks play footsie with China be Putin's b**** all of the stuff to hell with this we're going to Miss Manners this planet into Armageddon if we don't get some grown-ups into the room and so I don't know that I'm a grown up but I'm willing to Vie for leadership by putting something up having it investigated and seeing where it goes what is your number one fear about this this source code being I don't know the lack of a better term mastered well the last time we gained some serious insight into the way nuclei worked that with a little bit of geometry from Stanislaus William and Edward Teller give us the the namesake of the bikini that was a terrifying moment we change everything changed in 1900 that was 54 the namesake of the bikini a Bikini Atoll was an island in the Pacific where we blew up a hydrogen device is that that and set those insane images where you can see the water going a mile high into the sky gorgeous until you went to your question what if what so it's still expensive to create Fusion devices so we don't know of any individuals who owned the ability to create Fusion devices your call at some point somebody made a functioning nuclear reactor out of discarded smoke detectors and ran and got like 500 smoke detectors took out the radioactive element created a reactor probably kid who couldn't get into Harvard so we have a situation in which we don't know when he ordinary humans will gain Limitless destructive power going to try to imagine the Columbine kids weaponizing viruses or something like that so one of the great dangers is that great power I can't tell what the power would be at the theory is correct it might give us the ability Escape Escape though why do we have to escape this is so confused about like cuz even 21 talks about going to Mars I'm convinced that we don't have the ability to store this place why we were a thousand years so Genghis Khan was doing a better job Genghis Khan was doing a better job because he didn't have Limitless power just try to imagine it try to imagine a full-on nuclear interchange and then we're having this conversation afterwards so you you're concerned that nuclear war is not to possible but inevitable it certainly inevitable given them long enough time series is not possible but inevitable it certainly inevitable given them long enough time series because all these weapons simply will become cheaper there's no countermeasure that we it's too easy to destroy things relative to building</div>

Have you seen penis fencing in flatworms penis fencing with flatworms so this is like in terms of why do people who like social engineering not like biology flatworms have two different life cycles a male and a female life cycle and they don't know when they encounter each other and romance called whether or not they will be male or female and it's decided by a violent contest so they've got two plural penis to stab each other and whoever penetrates the other succeeds in what might be termed a traumatic insemination and the loser is assigned the feminine gender right so the idea is but it's more costly to Bear the young than it is to pierce the opponent so female is given to the loser whoa so they just do battle until someone f**** the other one right and that person becomes a check now bed bugs bed bugs have no vaginal opening hey there a female can bear young is a female attacks her thorax and breaks it open in an act which is definitely called traumatic insemination so you know you have a situation in which violent rape is the only method by which females can leave young so what they do to you they are the the feminists worst nightmare species you and I talked about the natural world they blow up like balloons I think so if you see one that's flat it hasn't really gorged ish anyways we had them under control I believe due to DDT and butter on my of 10 nightmare species bedbugs and flatworms for the twin traumatic insemination I would be way up at the top so it's like so they they literally puncture through the thorax with another we go Christ yeah if there is a good Lord boy does he or she have a lot to answer for why did you make bedbugs and why'd you make it like that imagine what kind of natural selection takes place where the only way that you can reproduce is through violent rape what's interesting there's a different system which I think is fascinating which is there's a conserved quantity in dung beetles where they have weaponry on their heads in the form of antlers for fighting the males and it turns out that there's an inverse relationship so there's some research it's allocated between the copulatory equipment and the Weaponry that the that the that the that the dung beetle has if they have a lot of weapons out there goes the Sean Connery monster truck. If you don't have it going on you got to go get yourself so what happens is that the size of the copulatory apparatus maybe the engine of speciation that when a male's equipment no longer fits the female that maybe the Q that some dung be some dung beetles will speciate because they can't reproduce effectively and we don't know why the conserved quantity would be spread between fighting equipment which is used only to displace Rivals and the size of the package</div>

You do this by being on particular committees rotating directorships who pays the cost I I don't know how the who seems to be sew in meshed with China and I I don't want to apine about these things because I want to keep my voice but it spoke volumes to watch that guy do that do that little dance to avoid entire life looks like that interview dority and it might be critique is is that this is the generic expectation across almost all institutions now they are all serving bizarre goals because growth is what gave us our independence and when we became less Innovative and we Innovation dried up and we couldn't grow our way in to do things the number of people who could use their middle finger effectively and say I'm steering this this organization to do right thing and this is my bed and I'm working to go forward those people as a class were removed if you think about like what do you do with Churchill when there is in the World War II in we don't know when there's an emergency there's a guy named Jai prakash Narayan in India is very important he was one of the sort of founding father Modern India and after India Indian independence was achieved lots of the people have been founding fathers went to the next phase where they became like they enrich themselves they did standard political things to eat to gain power in the system he was the one guy who sort of stayed true to the Revolutionary spirit and bizarrely when Indira Gandhi created a state of emergency which was a disaster in India the people said we'll who can we turn to in a dark time and ugly I guess prakash me light so there's this phrase like in the darkness there is one light jaiprakash jayprakash I prakash they turned to the one guy who become the patron saint of lost causes because he never broke Faith with the Revolutionary spirit and he said he gets called up once but he's incredibly important because everybody knows in a dark time who they can trust right that's a very important parallel to where we are who are the break glass in case of emergency people yeah when you when you watch the people that are talking in these presidential addresses there's none of those I don't see any break glass me this fauci guy is obviously an expert and diseases and he's a doctor and he's trying to do his best to lay out the ground rules of what we need to do and what this looks like over the next couple of months but there's like Jocko willink you don't like I was not telling you don't worry you don't have to change your routine you can get up at 9:30 just a little bit a little bit discipline equals Freedom I'm up at 4:30 what are you doing in bed it's time for discipline while because he's a military guy and military people don't have any room for bulshit fuckyourfeelings get up at 4:30 that's that's how they feel that's what I'm pretty sells those you can just do a little bit and that's great that's great you guys are enforcing mediocrity can grab both ends and that's what I'm trying to get out which is which we have a situation where we know you have two trainers and one of them is doing the don't worry the other ones like you're going to be sore you're going to be miserable this isn't going to be fun which do you choose some people go with the former yeah Claudia you're going to be sore you're going to be miserable this isn't going to be fun which do you choose some people will go with the former yeah they like to stay fat out there okay</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> episodes of might have my pocket as I watched it off of this one episode OU brother no I did not listen that one okay I've only listen to five or six if you listen to it episode 19 which is the bread episode I think that's been the most important one in except for the one released today that sounds like for the One release today well free about his prediction that all the laboratory mice that we use from the major supplier which of the Jackson laboratory in Bar Harbor Maine may have been compromised by their breeding protocols which allowed the telomere is to radically elongate and that we thought these mice were representative of all mice and that they had radically elongated telomere at the end of their chromosomes which appear to mediate the level of mitosis that can happen during histologic repair so if you imagine that your cells can divide a certain number of times if if there isn't the counter that stops the number of Divisions everything can become tumors and since you have like 30 trillion or a hundred trillion cells in your body that means every cell almost can kill you so it appears that the reason we may die from senescence that is aging is that that's our anticancer mechanism so if you eliminate like infect Steve's like viruses and insult from Munich being hit by a car the two things that you have in the end is either you die from immortality which is cancer which were cells can divide an infinite number of times or you die from the recursion limit which is how many times the cell to divide called in biology the hayflick limit and Brett predicted from first principles that what we thought about my switches that they have radically elongated telomere is it was only true for Batory animals because all the laboratory animals in which we test things like drugs have been broken they've been broken because of selective breeding yep because the breeding rotations privileged much younger mice and removed all sort of threats from the environment and so because telomere is are not protein-coding sequences of nucleotides that repeat as a counter rather than coding for a translation in the ribosome into amino acid sequence what you have is that the body can mutate if you will until use the Jackson Laboratories concept of this very rapidly because it's not building something structural just a question of do we have 17 on the end or a hundred and seventy on the end because the exacting nucleic acid has multiple ways in which it can participate in regulating the body's responses sewing fat the breeding protocols constituted a novel system of selective pressures that destroy the efficacy of all of our laboratory animals potentially so not be predicted from first principles he said I bet if you test wild-type mice rather than laboratory mice you'll find that their telomeres are not long as you believe in this was actually carried out by Carol greider who did not acknowledge the prediction she didn't acknowledge you should listen to the shop it's it's it's no cuz it's it's it's the Nobel Laureate on the other side of this so we're taking some risk over there over there at the portal that's really interesting so the consequences of this could be grave could be that so much of the studies that are predicated on these mice tests are there useless but called at the Jackson laboratory and ask them when did you have you had any changes in your breeding are you missing we don't even count the number of telomere telomere like when I say do you have a history of when you change the breeding Protocols are you aware of these articles and she said like what I said you know these articles of Carol greider how do you spell glider like the Plain City Grider like the Nobel Laureate and how do you spell greider and sew in the next to me while we don't remember if we've changed the protocol I said you're producing laboratory animals I would imagine you would have a documented history of every change in the time series of how these animals were prepared why don't know if there's anyone around from it are you kidding were you absent the day they taught science who are you or if true I can't even we've been at for 20 years we've been trying to get an answer as 20 years no one will break the story I mean this episode which is almost impossible to listen to because at the beginning of the episode I'm absolutely insufferable to Brett because he won't tell the story he's afraid to tell his own life story story because in academics the idea of some punk kid alleging that they predicted in Nutella call to a Nobel Laureate that if they would test wild-type mice the telomeres would be radically along radically shorter than the elongated telomeres of the Laboratory test and then the person refuses to acknowledge that such a prediction was made even though we have emails from the lab that so she refuses to acknowledge it or she cannot find a single I've been over the literature there is no anywhere of I live this was bread in real-time sorry I I know the events were happening we have communications with that lab since there is I cannot find any acknowledgment from the Johns Hopkins University laboratory that this interaction ever took place and that because he called and wrote and did not write an email he did not have a paper trail of that now there's consequential consequential emails that show the interaction between the labs but how many times have you ever heard anyone predict a molecular result from first principles and evolutionary theory this is what Brett was supposed to be famous for and then you know he he became like this obscure professor at some ridiculous college and then this thing happen to him but that's not his origin story his origin story is that he is the badass biology it was able to make this prediction for first principles and may have advanced the theory of why we have to die balance between deaths from immortality that is tumors and deaths from recursion limits that is telomere mediated hyflux pay for equipment so if anything has been done since this information has gotten out the world went crazy for the episode and there was silence everywhere inside of what all the Gated institutional narrative because to technology they really have to throw out how much research we don't know I don't know but it puts the question out how much research is compromised by the laboratory breeding protocols and breeding rotations from a single point of failure the Jackson laboratory in Bar Harbor Maine wow episode 19 or you will just say Eric is the biggest dick I've ever heard in my life but it's all to push this Brett to actually talk you should have mac on the show to talk but it's it's killing adamant Beretta simply wrong it's a it's a result and a story that needs to be told if they're another side of the story we need to hear the other side of the story and my goal is to have Carol greider so you know what this interaction did happen and I probably could have handled this better because she has work that she's done which is beyond question some of the most important work that has nothing to do with anything bread is done but it does not give that laboratory the scientific right to deny the existence of this interaction the importance of the internet and because their potential Downstream consequences in Pharmaceuticals we need to have an answer and every answer is interested if the laboratory mice having radical radical elongated telomeres is not a problem in some way that's fascinating how could you have an animal that has this huge adaptation to the laboratory not affect that would be interesting if it does affect thing that's fascinating Tesla that have anything to do with Helen Mirren what do but if it doesn't have to do like for example let's say you have a really toxic substance right and it causes a lot of seldat that requires histological repair if you have a huge long telomeres you're going to have an ability to metabolize that toxicity very much better you'll be able to take the insult to comes from this and so these mice are probably preternatural Adidas towards radical histological repair that's why they remain youthful and young and if you test something that might be in a few doing toxicology studies it could be that the telomere is even though you're not testing the teal and mirrors what you're actually doing is picking up that these broken mice are like the world Champs of repair but they suck it cancer they all died of cancer all of them almost essentially all the mice elongated of cancer because their trick for one special thing which is the best it repair of death and clear away all of the noise there two ways that that nature can't figure out an escape from either you dive in mortality which is that you think all your cells wanted want to live forever you know and that's a huge death huge danger or we caught a resource lately can computers or they died the only thing nature can figure out to do is to say you only get a finite number of cell divisions up front now that there's some adjustments to the theory but if you only got it like if you if you look at the moles on my face with your people love to comment on comment section they probably started as a runaway Reptar replicative process that arrested at the border of the mole in order to keep them from killing me right we have sell the Grove all the we have sell the Grove all the time but then what happens is that there's some means of making sure that if the process doesn't take down the entire organism but think about 30 trillion assassins as the cells in your body all of which might kill you at any moment like terrifying</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> they get rid of mosquitoes there will always be and I think that is a possibility that something they've talked about doing is engineering some new kind of mosquito that like doesn't breed or some mosquito that kills other mosquitoes or or something along those lines if they've had a couple of different things that they try to figure out how to do but the problem is you don't want to do that you know you let that cat out of the bag mosquitoes and the cats reading the lizards who knows what kind of s*** could go down to get rid of mosquitoes but they do the dirty blood give you a malaria disease that but that's about all these pandemics is like you know coronavirus is actually kind of a p**** and it's it's easy to kill there's other viruses with your much tougher but as a very thin membrane is it's a fatty membrane that goes over it and you know foam from soap make sure when you wash your hands the corona Psalms the new strain of coronavirus not previously seen in humans or other strains of cannabis are very common and usually only calls mild symptoms like the common cold yeah what we just talking about we're talking about washing hands Coronavirus and it scared me way more than that lets me and it's scary for sure don't get me wrong but there's is chronic wasting disease that they found in Deer and it's 100% fatal and it's a prion disease the same same kind of disease is mad cow disease was and the same as mad cow disease made the jump to humans then it became very dangerous and people to the some people to this day like they can't give blood cuz they were alive eating cheeseburgers during the madcap of days maybe they release that a long time they couldn't give blood cuz they had to be that you stole these prions in your system you could they took the surgical instruments that they used on patients who died of mad cow disease and they ran the surgical instruments through these sanitization machines the center process sanitizing process 3 * 3 * 1000 degree temperature couldn't kill it three times still had living prions on the surgical equipment yeah I know we got to do is soap It up sing Happy Birthday twice the sun nothing in comparison to something that could happen to us if chronic wasting disease ever made the leap from dear to Hummus my friend Doug Duren and Bryan what's his name again Planet Wildlife expert explained all of it to us like what what it is how it's happened how it's spread it spreading from deer and do the end is horrific we watched a video of one of them where they're wasting away and is spitting so this this this this fluids coming out their body is contaminated in the deer will come along and eat the leaves that have that prion on it and take it in then you'll get it'll get chronic wasting disease it'll rot away and spitting out the stuff and other deer eating it's horrific and it's 100% fatal so think about what we've got that your immune system you know for the vast majority of the people is going to fight off tragic the people that don't not to mention that at all that's not what I'm saying but there's a giant difference between something that Idris Elba gets and shows no weaknesses shows no symptoms rather or Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson get it and they get over it it's rough but they get over and they survived versus prions The Chill hundred percent of all the deer that they in fact they're all dead and they weigh the way suite at nothing it's ugly wow I know this guy was selling the warning Bell he was like the Visa made the jump to mice and they prions have made the jump from animals to people this is totally possible this this can't happen yeah and it's like right now it's like this like silent thing that they're just keeping an eye on and it's spreading across the country and people don't know like just places where people stopped eating deer meat and there's a checkpoint we have to bring the deer in like Wisconsin or my friend Doug they bring the deer and have to test them before you can eat this dinner chronic wasting that came from a deer that has CWD but it's never made the jump to people so have the sausage you're eating the prions they just don't affect your brain yet about 7,000 to 15,000 animals infected with CWD are eaten each year and that number to rise by 20% annually according to the alliance for public Wildlife which osterholm cited in his testimony scientists can't say for sure that CWD will crossover infect humans But as time goes on and more infected meat is consumed the likelihood increases said it's like a throw at the genetic roulette table he said f*** that yeah but if that gets into the cows what if that gets into your cheeseburger this is maybe with the whole vegan movements about maybe trying to protect us from an ultimate attack what if that's the only people that survive I really thin and I know the self-righteous all the guys would have to have man buns have to get a velcro man bun and put it on just to get through security meat eaters would like get a velcro man bun and put it on just to get through security</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> he brought up that I wanted to discuss is the damage that this virus does to the lungs and two to the heart as well what they're scarring on on people's lungs of the talk about that and what if anything can be done to try to heal those people post infection well so what happens is in the virus gains entry into the deep passages of the lungs know the the all the airway spaces and then it if you ever see a cartoon a schematic drawing of a coronavirus it looks like a little ball with spikes sticking out of it and those spikes are called the S protein and actually the vaccine that we're making interferes with The Binding of a part of that as protein called the receptor binding domain for binding into the receptor so it's uses those spikes the tip of the spikes to get entry to bind to The receptors and in the long which is actually a an enzyme called an acetylcholinesterase in the lung cells so the first thing that happens is a large amount of viruses getting into the lungs and that triggers What's called the innate immune system eating your natural first-line body of defense and its signal something called toll-like receptors which caused a lot of inflammation and so you're seeing a big inflammatory response to the to the virus of the two components post all the inflammatory response and that's one of the reasons why you know what I heard about hydroxychloroquine I have some enthusiasm cuz it may be suppressed inflammatory component whether it clinically has the ability to make a difference I think the jury's still out yet but so you got those two things going on other thing that's happening besides inflammation in a condition known as a RDS acute respiratory distress syndrome where there's so much information and scarring that it becomes difficult to oxygenate the lungs and people go into shock because of this a RDS syndrome so that's why a lot of people are dying the other thing that happened so that we don't really understand a lot of reports XIV and Med archive is m e d r XIV Spotify Cold Spring Harbor laboratory the scientist have been great about sharing information they're putting all their stuff up on these preprint server they're not peer-reviewed yet but just that we get information into the hands of the scientist anybody could look at them but one of the other things were seeing with that is a lot of heart entry weather people are having heart attacks because they're intubated in the ICU and under stress and and they're in shock so they're not perfusing hardcore and we know that the old SARS virus ours one had the ability to go into the heart tissue and cause what's called myocarditis actual infection of the heart so it's really the heart and lungs that that are getting knocked out there's also some evidence that the virus can go into the intestinal tract as well and so that I could actually be a router transmission hammered is this direct damage from the virus and inflammatory component to the heart and lung infection particularly like damage to the lungs immune response to the virus so you can have an increased number of a virus particle potentially be so people are definitely looking into steroids other I am time inflammatory drugs but you know those who survive this and fortunately most do you know you'll find it there. Probably tell you they've been hacking and coughing for a long time afterwards in a lot of that is viral pneumonia is it stopped with the virus is all that scarring is is it takes the body a long time to remodel all the scar tissue and then before the coughing stop so we can anticipate that happening as well epidemic to know what's going on is it it's just really too early for so many of these things the treatment secures the dealing with the immune system's finding out which people are genetically more predisposed to make a contribution figure scientist has just been an amazing everyone's you're putting aside their Rico putting all their stuff up on bioarchive met archiving and then and the major journals are doing incredible things also Expediting publication of paper so you know the the flagship journals like New England Journal of Medicine Lancet Jama they're all putting that stuff out there as fast as they can you know as ensuring quality inn and Anna level of peer review r+ family journals Public Library science so good stories that are happening around this definitely the data sharing the journals not conducting business the stuff that their publishing could be life-saving and responding to a Public Health crisis I think that that's the nice part of the story the data sharing the journals not conducting business as usual recognizing that their the stuff that their publishing could be life-saving and responding to a Public Health crisis I think that that's the nice part of the story</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is it one of the things that's come up about this is people are now aware people like myself are aware of the the number of people that die every year in the United States from the flu which is staggering it's a lot more than I ever thought before you know what do you know the numbers like what would between 12 and fifty thousand people die every year of influenza and the vast majority of those by the way you're not vaccinated so even in years where there's not a good match between the flu vaccine in the flu and could still reduce your likelihood of hospitalization and and deaths that's important message to get out the numbers here unfortunately looking worse so you from being hospitalized because it is partially protective so if you imagine a virus that has all of these different pieces to it and and the end and all the antibodies each reacting to a different piece of the virus and a perfect match all of the antibodies Target the virus and then in a less than perfect match only some of the antibodies Target the virus and therefore it's partially protective and can have whatever partial effect and so now the numbers of them of Americans were dying or all over the map so if you if you believe the number saying that they're between 4 and 10 times the number of Americans forget about Mary Florida 10 times the regular flu thousand from flu the minimum that's going to die from covid-19 is around 50,000 and at the high end times 10 could be between 500,000 so that's where you're hearing those numbers from the White House Press Conference today saying maybe a hundred to two hundred thousand Americans could die I think it's probably I like the institute for health metrics numbers that just came out they say 84,000 Americans will die in that peak season going from by April May May and June and then but we don't know what will happen again in the out here so the point is a lot of Americans are going to die I'm hoping it doesn't get as high as 200,000 and again the modelers are really looking at this that those numbers that I gave sophisticated those numbers I gave you that estimate was a certain simplistic version but there's much more sophisticated models but again their models based on assumptions about the new virus pathogen it's hard to get all the assumptions right but the point is I many more people will die of this virus than even in a bad flu season</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I'm hoping so much of what comes out of this is a wake-up call so much of the new-found understanding and appreciation for the science behind dealing with these diseases appreciation of healthcare workers and First Responders mean if there's any bright lining to this that's what I'm really hoping for is it people wake up and recognize the good work that people like you have been doing and also you know that this is what we live in strange times and these things can happen again and we need to be prepared we need to put a lot of emphasis in effort and thought to that as a whole is a whole society but that's right I think you know maybe this will help us reassess some of our values and and you know appreciate some of the some of the things that the healthcare professions especially you're doing and how you're seeing people volunteered you know you know do said the hell with then I'm just going to put on my n95 mask and my PPE and dive in and helping that's really moving and safety equipment for healthcare workers and how did this ever happen while we just we didn't get ready for the surgeon time I think you know I'm holding back trying to throw stones at this agency or this person or this group because we don't really know what happened I think it's going to be really important that Congress after this and to conduct an investigation not from the standpoint of Prosecuting people or or calling them out but just say hey what the hell went wrong here and how do we avoid this again I mean the problems with the testing and not having all the protective equipment now we're getting geared up and mobilizing industry but could we have done better especially in that window. When things were collapsing in Wuhan and the other cities in central China when we knew this was going to be bad and we know this could become your one of the great pandemic threats in a wide how could we have better use those six weeks in order to get ready in one month than we do and hand and now is not the time to do it because worrying about you know Congressional hearings and that sort of thing but when all this is said and done and it has to be that have to be done in the right Spirit not again we have to figure out a way to stop these partisan lines to say there was is a country we've got to figure out how to work together I know that sounds pollyannish but you know Washington University I work with Congress a lot to get legislation passed around neglected tropical diseases and I was a different Washington then I mean I would go you know to Sam brownback's prayer breakfast Sam Brownback governor of Kansas before we center from Kansas very conservative Republican senator walk across the hall and go talk to Center to Leahy's people from vermonters or Sherrod Brown's people and we all knew we had to go across the aisle to work together and it's just not happening anymore and it's tearing apart our country so I hope the other thing that we get out of this is figuring out a way that Republican start talking to Democrats again and Democrats talk to Republicans again and figure that out as well sing anymore and it's tearing apart our country so I hope the other thing that we get out of this is figuring out a way that Republicans start talking to Democrats again and Democrats talk to Republicans again and figure that out as well</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> pecan Sweden and Sweden the way they're handling this which is essentially they're giving people the freedom to go to restaurants and bars and they're shutting some things down but there was quite a bit more open than the rest of the world and subsequently there they're experiencing a spike in cases ships would come into the Barber on Croatian and coming from Asia Minor and they were fearful they're bringing plague and they kept the ships for 40 days that's the word for the word quarantine came from and that's what we've got right now so we know social distancing is probably Our Only Hope and and there's a few pieces of evidence for that I miss real serious social distancing my colleague I'm doing a lot of analysis and modeling in one of the things he's shown is that it when he looks at the cities in China for instance where they did social distancing another aggressive measures and some of them were pretty aggressively couldn't even do an in the United States but they showed that the longer you allow transmission to go on before you intervene with social distancing another things the worst the surgeon the worst the epidemic and therefore us about Natalie the worst immortality so Francis in Wuhan where he estimates I think I forget the exact spot about six weeks or transmission going out before you intervene then it was lights out it was a massive Surge and hospital system getting overwhelmed in a lot of healthcare workers getting sick and and I want to come back to that point after we finish this as opposed to in southern China and other places in China where you intervened after a week then you got in there was a difference mm patients in your eyes used across the city versus 20 that's how the dramatic a different so that's a lesson we need to learn for the u.s. is that's the only thing we have and to really push hard on the social distancing and I think it's especially important in the cities because it looks to me like what we're seeing so far in the u.s. is more of an urban Suburban vs. rural / we're seeing the big surges and ICU patients cities in rural areas although dr. fauci Africa's last night of the other night said don't ignore the rural areas either because we don't know what's going to happen there so social distancing is absolutely Paramount and unfortunately what's happening because things got so f***** up with the testing that we've not we've sumped unfortunately Bop and found out that transmission is going out for several weeks only one a lot of ICU patients started hitting the door so this is what happened in New Orleans it's probably happening is Detroit the mayor of Atlanta just said you know all of a sudden we've had all of these people show up in in the eye and the ICU so that's a another lesson learned we really not only doing the the diagnostic testing but the social distancing is really important and I've been on calls with the leadership of people in Houston because you know you're right it's it's it's hurting the economy in so many ways but you know if you want to prevent Houston from replicating the New Orleans experience I've been saying to the to the mayor and everyone else in Houston this is unfortunately what we're going to have to do in the models are showing that the Pacific Oregon Institute in Washington Seattle Washington and it's looking at the things to look at the I'm not only epidemic diseases but also chronic non-communicable diseases diabetes heart disease and mental health issues but they've been you know all hands on deck at this epidemic and they've just put it out on their website it's Health Data. Organ you go to The Cove in 19th sign and what they're showing is that they anticipate the peak of this epidemic in the US is going to hit about the middle of April so we're not even at the peak yet this is going to continue to go up and in some places like in Texas is going to be delayed it's probably going to be around around May 2nd and I think California was was around there as well so their number say it's going to be the next two months that are going to be the crunch-time when it's going to start really going up and then as we move into later in May will start to go down and maybe really bought him out by by June of course again what I've been saying is you know the President yesterday or the day before said okay I understand I said Easter now we're going to go to April 30th and my point is well April 30th things are still going to be peeking in parts of the country let's use April 30th as a time to reassess and then make a decision whether we go another month let's go a month at a time for now until we know where this is heading now we're going to go to April 30th and my point is well April 30th things are still going to be peeking in parts of the country let's use April 30th as a time to reassess and then make a decision whether we go another month let's go a month at a time for now until we know where this is heading</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> given that I think a lot of us don't believe in anything that happened before Google bright imagine kids today imagine trying to describe the kids today what it was like to grow up without the internet or not being able to reach people you have to make extensive plans and backup plans will it if you're not there at this time I used to have to yell when I was in high school my family got an answering machine house if this is incredible and you would you would leave like stupid music like to let everybody know you were cool like you have some cool music at cage Joe not here right now but if you leave a message I'll get back to you probably like the late eighties really yeah I actually call people like that I've been doing that more lately yeah I call a lot of people now I just feel like it's just it's better that the texting thing to problem is if it's very interesting how we separated ourselves into this electronic communication world where I will during the day be in communication almost constantly with a stream of people the only two stops it is a pause podcast is my rest for three hours I'm not talking to anybody other than you so all those texts that come through I'll get the end of the podcast I'll go and look at my phone WD-40 text sometimes cuz this is man that's if I had to make 40 phone calls that mean it would be impossible to manage it would be constantly becoming and you never really be able to say anything so we're we're feeding into this weird Loop where we just have these short form things tomorrow sure what time how about 9 I can do 7 okay let's do it you never mean to like these weird little bursts of information to oversee a member this program California and is it called the Californication guess I wasn't sure what the right so there's this scene where he's having some really hot intergenerational sex and this gal says like LOL and it killed it it out loud she said it and she says LOL and he who's the total interest that there's no amount of of heat in the moment that can compensate for the fact that she's using like verbal emojis yeah but he's just mocking himself over 50 it's intrinsically ironic but you know in terms of this weird thing about islands of time one of the things that we do is we have Shabbat dinner and every Friday no matter how atheist and militant people are against any kind of organized religion they will leave us alone if we say we're going into Shabbat and so there's this thing about like people will pester me in all sorts of situations but if I invoke something that is vaguely religious even Sam Harris probably wouldn't call me during that period of time. I find that very interesting I could you could you create a religion that was simply there to make sure that you had some time off line yeah I know if I text Ben Shapiro I'm not getting a text back on Saturday ever is dark yep the people I mean on one hand I think it's probably a really good idea to just take a break from all that electronic s*** and just connect with humans and in a very old school type of way I think it's probably very good for connect with yourself I had this experience I actually lived in Jerusalem for two years and we landed in this Orthodox Run Hotel and on Friday night everything shutdown you don't like the text and I then moved into a an ultra-orthodox neighbor neighborhood bread in the on the boundary of the place with the secular in the Orthodox mad what was really fascinating to me as I started telling people you know you'd never think that it's great not to be able to find a restaurant or a nightclub but it's amazing that it's this is enforced down time in about a month in somebody said oh you're in the wrong place of course you can go out on Friday I used to go to that of the Russian compound and that everything's hopping and you can go dancing and drinking and all these things after I knew that I went dancing and drinking and I was much less happy than believing that somehow Israel actually shut down on Friday night and so very weirdly I appreciated the constraint as soon as I knew you could break the constraint I was less happy and I would never actually a band anymore in that like it would provide you some Freedom by having restrictions but it does give you some Freedom like okay like now we have to think about all these other things so now we have the freedom to just be alone now we have the freedom to be relaxed now we have the freedom to just talk to human beings you know what the constraints and it's like totally that's like this motherfukers up at 4:30 in the morning throwing heavy weights around and grunting and acting like a Savage running goes out to the beach and he earns the sunrise every morning goes out and takes photos you know takes a photo of his f****** watch for 30 hit the gym like a Savage and then takes a photo sometimes of the sunrise are in the sunrise and like to but you would think God is like a prison till like force yourself into that but no no freedom in that because he knows decisions 4:30 is going to do you just you just go do it and that way if you look at the guy's a f****** tank why is your tank cuz he's always up at 4:30 f****** throwing weights around it just doesn't need never stops never never takes never takes a self-indulgent time to lay in bed and beat off and pick his nose and in the f****** check his text messages this right now and thinking maybe I do a little bit I think I remember reading his inner dialogue about going to a birthday party and breaking down and having a scoop of ice cream or something or slice of pie and it's like they are the drama of there it was Temptation eventually I became weak do you have the drama of there it was Temptation eventually I became weak yeah I don't fuk with that I just do it so I'm going to parties eat that cake I mean that's feel like I do enough I'm alright</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how long can we go I mean what what if you take economics out of it what would you think if there was no concern whatsoever about economic loss in the damage to the economy what would you recommend in terms of just clearly just purely from a medical perspective so although not entirely true because we can make weekend in Acton or intervention so hopefully by the summer this is not going to be a huge problem but but we don't know and then we also don't know if this thing's coming back so what did the out-years look like is this does the even if it goes down this summer does it does it come back up again in the fall does it come back up again early next why would that happen why would it come back why would it want me to go away and then come back in the fall well is a few things that are happening one all the social distancing potentially could interrupt the transmission we use the number called the reproductive number which describes the number of people that get infected if a single individual has it so the number right now is between 2 and 4 depending on whose numbers you look at the ideas you bring up a little one by the social distancing there's also the question seasonality to this virus and again the Skylark lipstick has done some studies to show that they're there seems the virus infection doesn't seem to be as severe in areas that have higher temperatures in Greater humidity that's a bit of a soft call but maybe there's going to be some seasonality to this as well and then and so let's use an example of another seasonal virus influenza it speaks of course enter Then goes down in the summer months and never really disappears but it it it it goes down but then in the southern hemisphere is the opposite so in the southern hemisphere Peak flu season is our summer there winter in places like Australia and then in the tropics it's about the same all year round so we don't really understand seasonality potentially the virus could show it starts showing a pattern like that and then the question I ordered some kind of seasonality these are all scenarios that never being looked at so princes are our vaccine if it's used and goes you know go through all the clinical testing hurdles probably is not going to be used for this 2020 epidemic if it's used it all it's going to be used in the out years if this virus starts to come back on a regular basis are vaccine if it's used in ghost you know go through all the clinical testing hurdles probably is not going to be used for this 2020 epidemic if it's used it all it's going to be used in the out years if this virus starts to come back on a regular basis</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let's talk about treatments that are being considered we know that zpacks or one of them and chloroquine can explain that and what went horribly wrong with the couple that took the wrong kind of chloroquine and turned out to be a koi pond cleaner certain things ready now so and then and then we can talk about what I want and then I'll let me give you the framework that answer your chloroquine question so the highest bar there is in terms of financial investment required in time to show a safeties of vaccine so that's what that's what we're doing and other groups are doing next tear down that's going to be in 18 months away according to dr. fauci could be longer than that next tear down small molecule drug new drugs that have never been discovered before it still takes a while maybe not as hire bars vaccine in terms of time the next tear down is repurposing existing medicines that we already know are relatively safe and then showing that those drugs also work against the coronavirus and that's going to be the chloroquine category and I'll get to your question and then the nearest one's the one that we could do now fluorescent antibody therapy which I've been pushing very hard on because I think we can actually have it going that right now so let's do the let's do the chloroquine hydroxychloroquine that's one of the repurposed ones that's not the lowest hanging fruit with the next lowest paying through this is a medicine that use for malaria it's an anti-malarial drug spin around for decades and check the World Health Organization was going to head in the 90s he's proposed in elimination strategy for malaria to treat everybody with chloroquine until we have chloroquine resistance in that derailed that but it didn't in some parts of the world that still works as an anti-malarial drug is also used as an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of lupus and other autoimmune diseases you can make a bucket of it it's cheap we know the safety profile we know can cause arrhythmias and some patient other toxicities but it is generally has a pretty profile we know that the truck and block the replication of the virus in the test tube so in Hibbets the virus in the end will be called in vitro in the test tube II we know this drug reduces inflammation and that's nice because one of the things you get with covid-19 pneumonia is not only get the virus infection in the lawn you got a lot of inflammation so checks a couple of boxes and attracted to look at it and then and then a colleague of mine is a fascinating guy I really appreciate his work as a scientist it was a very serious scientist in Marseille in France and Didier Raul and he's must have published two or three dozen papers in the journal that I found to call plus neglected tropical diseases serious scientist on all sorts of intracellular bacteria that kind of thing covid patience and what he did was he combined hydroxychloroquine with the Z-Pak Azithromycin drug and found found that there's an effect the promise was a very tiny study and so people put those three things together and all of a sudden said we've got the miracle cure I'm not sure that's going to turn out to be really need to do large studies to show that it really works and the reason I'm holding back is you know nothing to do with doctor Professor you know really important scientist that's a small study we were there about a decade ago with influenza that this hydroxychloroquine also inhibited the influenza virus in the test tube but then it didn't pan out in Clinton larger clinical studies so I think we have to be really careful and don't be too quick to to say okay this is this is going to be a time when we're not even close to that yet but we'll know are clinical trials looking at that medicine therapy and it was known for over a hundred years and it was really scaled up during the 1918 influenza pandemic pandemic that killed hundreds tens of millions of people it was shown that if you took individuals had one who had recovered from the disease who he got infected they survived than antibodies in their blood you could remove their blood in some cases give them back their red cells and take the plasma component and use that as a therapy to treat patients and and in fact during the 2003 SARS epidemic the first star starts one there's been a number of studies showing that it worked it actually you could treat patients for it especially if you gave it early on in the course of the infection if you waited too long then it didn't have nearly the same benefit be given orally on the course of infection it could prevent more serious infection and even death because you're actually giving back antibodies antibodies won't last forever but enough to help you survive the infection so a good friend and colleague for a longtime Arturo Sandoval brilliant Professor microbiology at Johns Hopkins you know started talking to me about you know Peter maybe we should be doing this for covid-19 and and as the number started going up I said I called him I said luck Tortura I'm going on CNN tomorrow I think this is an opportunity to tell people about this so I you know help amplify what he was doing paper I wouldn't with a colleague on different Johns Hopkins at least have her own angle her name for Bosque Albert Einstein and I talked to him about this race specific issues to get people to care about about certain things and I and I used it for this purpose and now his colleagues are doing together with the FDA so there's a branch of the Food and Drug Administration called sieber the center for biologics evaluation research which is this a man in a lot of bad things about the FDA all these brilliant scientist vaccines and biologic with Peter marks and he's teamed up with with Arturo to get Network together going over at least 120 academic Health Centers so that they're identifying patients who recovered taking their blood giving them back the red cells collecting the plasma so that when people come in sick they can give treatment in they'll have some clinical trial results I hope in the next few weeks but I'm really optimistic about that 144 saving lives First Responders that's prevented from getting sick cuz you're here I mean I don't know the percentage. First Responders on York and that's why they turned the Empire State Building into a siren last night and into a Johan are all of the all of the First Responders have gotten sick we know this was going to happen maybe this could help them so I think that's going to be really important as well that they're they're having some good results with that are people currently using that in the United States are doctors prescribing that was seated off label use meaning that is not an improved indication but they're going ahead and use it and you know I just maybe it'll turn out to be a good treatment but the evidence is is not strong the there's a study in Shanghai that suggested it didn't work so we really need Well Control trial you really need to spend on the dose because maybe it's a dosing they maybe if you give too high or too low a dose not going to work how you pair it with the Zithromax so it's going to take a little bit of time to work out in this is the frustration that people have you seen my God we have this terrible pandemic now we need to get these new therapies and vaccines are very quickly it's the hardest thing to do it's the hardest thing to do is to accelerate new technologies for a new virus we've never seen before while the epidemic is Raging while the pandemic is Raising its we don't have a lot of track record doing this we did it once with ebola if you remember in 2014 there was a terrible Ebola epidemic in West Africa affected 33,000 people eleven thousand people died that was in Guinea Liberian Sierra Leone and there was some initial vaccine trials started by that looks pretty promising Dad license to technology from the Canadiens the script in Manitoba a public health Canada and it looks promising but as the tribes got underway what happened was there was an international response to put in a health system because it turns out he bowl is not very transmissible you just have to have some healthcare infrastructure make certain that you're not directly handling the the corpse of someone who has recently died from from Ebola virus infection India and we even send in the hundred first Airborne Division we said in the The Screaming Eagle switch made a big impact on helping to let you know save West Africa from this infection so the WHIO came in there was there was a Doctors Without Borders Africa and so the vaccine never really got fully tested but then five years later when there was the terrible epidemic a Democratic Republic of Congo that's when the vaccine really came into widespread use and it's probably one of the most important Public Health stories never told which was under conditions of terrible conflict and War and political strife and civil Civil War they vaccinated 200,000 people with this vaccine and it largely help eliminate Ebola from Democratic Republic of Congo in that in that during those hostilities last last year and essentially saved I think it's help to stabilize the whole African continent so it's an amazing story and it was this multilateral effort that involved also US government we really should help stabilize sub-Saharan Africa will look at the time frame 2014 first epidemic the 2019 that's fine that's 5 years that's a more realistic time frame for a vaccine just to give people a sense of perspective</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> talk about Germany because I found that really fascinating when I was reading on Germany and their low mortality rate the tribute that too is that the well diagnosis covid-19 of died Which is higher than just about anywhere else I think what's happened there is when the health system gets so overwhelmed that so many so that another words of transmission goes on for a long time and you haven't picked it up and then all the sudden people start showing up in the ICU then it's too late then you start having massive numbers of people coming to the ICU the hospital can't take care of everybody they can intubate everyone they can't give everyone to the highest quality Care possible snowfall to the doctors and nurses their Heroes but the fact that they're completely overwhelmed with patient that's when we're tality starts to to Really rise so we saw this and parts of Wuhan and we saw this in Italy and that was a big worry about New York that the same thing would happen to New York hold that thought for a second in Germany so far getting it and the fact that the hospital system was getting ready and they've got that infrastructure in place to manage that surged although they're worried not to that it it may start going up in OverWatch people not large numbers of people getting infected number one or overwhelm the health system just like in Italy so there is sew-in in New Orleans right now the case fatality rate is between 4 and 5 but there's another Factor go on in New Orleans lots of people living in extreme poverty and poverty is very linked to diabetes and hypertension and we know diabetes and hypertension is a big risk factor for death so this is getting hit twice systems getting overwhelmed I think you have a lot of African Americans living in poverty was underlined diabetes and hypertension and that's causing that to the Skyrocket so you know I was just on the phone today with the leadership of Houston and saying you know you know we have a similar demographic to New Orleans and we're sister cities after Katrina and a linked at the hip and and you know there are sister city we love them but you know we have to recognize that even if we hit can handle the surge Medical Center we still have that demographic of African-Americans Hispanics with underlying diabetes and hypertension I'm really worried we're going to see high mortality in Texas Princeton Chinese older Chinese men and really high mortality rates and here's something very interesting smoking actually upregulates the receptor in the lungs that the buyer signs to so it seems to make more copies of the receptor for the virus to bind to so that may worsen the disease so I think you're right I think smoking is a factor the one question that we don't know is what is vaping do does is vaping also could that be linked somehow to the young and all the young adults that we're seeing in the United States who are getting hospitalized and their lives are being saved because they're being intubated and put on the vent but is there a vaping connection again new question we don't know it's something that's going to have to be looked up one of the reasons one of many reasons why I'm so thankful for you for coming on the podcast and and trying to educate us on this thing with my 20-year science partner dr. Maryland up Itachi we're trying that we've we develop vaccines including coronavirus vaccine or try to get those out the door in clinical trials in between I'm going on Fox News MSNBC and CNN that's not an easy need needle to thread either going and Fox News Ms MSNBC and CNN that's been really interesting but I love the opportunity and and I'm trying to get accurate information explaining trying to get accurate information also explaining the science behind but sometimes you hear something that doesn't sound right and it sometimes takes a couple of minutes to to explain that and and those three cable news networks have been great about giving me some time to to explain the thinking behind it which they ordinarily wouldn't do</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let's look going taking it from the top let's let's discuss give us your take on how we got here because this is It's been a very strange obviously the president completely miscalculated what was going to happen in the way he was explaining to the news he was kind of saying that it was just a few cases and they'll be gone and now obviously New York City shut down the entire country is separated from each other everybody is isolating at home give us your take on how we got here will let you know that the truth is we knew this was coming or something like it we had a heads-up and then didn't even even a heads up before last year because this is now our third major coronavirus disaster of the 21st century we had what's called star severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 that started in China and caused the terrible epidemic in Toronto and actually took the the roll songs to do a concert to bring the economy back to Toronto in 2003 and then it was mayor's coronavirus infection in 2012 and this is the third one so we actually you realize that's coronavirus is we're going to be coming me sing and we embarked on a big run a virus vaccine program a decade ago and each time that cause devastating Hospital epidemic affected healthcare worker so the point is this sung fortunately is becoming for the globe is terrible coronavirus epidemics and we saw this one coming up in the end of 2019 in China and I knew we were in for trouble because that's what coronavirus is do that we were going to be in trouble because Cars 2 so the massage one then there's than stars to so both stars 1 and mirrors made you so sick and that such a high case-fatality rate that anybody who got it was almost immediately hospitalized and basically out of the community that the difference with this one ironically is it is it's pretty lethal it's about five to ten times more lethal than regular flu seasonal flu but also there's a big group of people who get very sick at all and so you have this should have perfect mix where it's not the most lethal infection we've ever seen if not the most transmissible infection we've ever seen but it's high enough and both categories that are combined in this very toxic waste so what you have is you have a group of people who are getting very sick or in the Intensive Care Unit like older people those with diabetes and hypertension even a group of younger people who are getting it very sick set a larger group who only getting mildly sick who can still walk around the community and be out in about and stores and restaurants and infecting everybody and so this is what caused the problem it's a it's highly transmissible has a big group of people walking around spreading it and a smaller subset but a big sub said we're getting very sick and even dying in the Intensive Care Unit in New York City right now for asymptomatic we don't we really don't there's a rough correlation page so younger people seem to do better and actually kids seem to do really well with this infection they don't they do get with it with one exception that I'll tell you about the minute most kids don't get very sick at all but they're helping with the community spread and we don't quite know why I also it but something is very important one of the reasons why I really want you to come on and talk to you about Coke is there's this Buzz out there in the community that it's only old people that are getting sick and dying and going to ice use but in fact the Centers for Disease Control came up with this very chilling document a few weeks ago showing that about a third of the very sick people in the hospital are under the age of 40 or 44 so between 20 and 40 for young adults are getting very sick and that word has not gotten out adequate because when in fact disinfection first appeared in central China it was all about older individuals over the age of 70 those with diabetes and hypertension and we didn't hear about the young adults but then for reasons that we don't understand we saw this big group in Italy and France Spain of younger adults and we're seeing that play out in the US and I know it on the people who you know listen to you and watch you that's a big group between that age of 20 and 44 and they really need to hear that they are for severe illness despite what they might have heard previously and then flew back got sick and here's what's really maybe you could help me with this he said he was feeling terrible and then took Advil and it got exponentially worse is that coincidental do you think I mean there's has been talks of avoiding ibuprofen Michael's 45 years old very healthy very robust guy so when he was I mean he was in the hospital for a week and his words were I almost died and he was really really concerned what what about what about an ibuprofen so there's been a lot of buzz on the internet about ibuprofen and then the World Health Organization came out with a statement saying those are rumors so there's not a lot of evidence to say that you get worse with ibuprofen probably he was just one of those young adults that's going to get very sick and that's what this virus does it has the ability to get deep into the pulmonary system in your lungs binds to receptors on the cells of your lungs and causes a terrible pneumonia and on top of it you get a big inflammatory response so it really so severe pneumonia ability to breathe and that's why so many people who are getting really sick of this virus have to go on respirators so is that there's a rumor that you shouldn't take Ibuprofen but is that unfounded are you advising people take Ibuprofen do you think they should just avoid it just in case and where did this rumor start from and what what is the concern as I've done and then you've got the problem you know some people how to say don't take Aspirin because if this is a respiratory virus infection there could be a severe reaction with with aspirin as well so for now today I might look like the biggest idiot in the world tomorrow or next week and that's because this is a brand-new virus and we've never seen before right so we're on a steep learning curve so we're learning new things about this virus every day so that's why you know how many things are going to say today might sound like I'm waffling or hedging it's it's because I am where we were learning so much that's new about this virus so it's really important that everybody be really Mindful and pay attention to real health information that dad from accurate sources because things move things change as we learn more about this is a virus that we didn't even know existed about 4 months ago and we've learned about an incredible. I'm the Chinese put up a lot of information on these preprint server is about what the virus is what the sequence is the genetic code with the receptor binds to when we had the original salt that we call this new Once ours to the covid-19 so the covid-19 the virus is called stars to SARS coronavirus to when we had the original Stars won how much so much for learning right now I'm so glad you brought that up cuz that is really important for people to understand people that maybe haven't looked into the complications that are involved in trying to recognize treatments and cures for a virus that it is it's you everyone's learning and and things can change depending on does not just the passage and it's also what we called the host the person to so the fact you know that the virus affected young adults in Europe in the u.s. in a way that did not necessarily occur in China is important and so we are kiwi and then who knows what happens when the virus goes into Latin America or India are sub-Saharan Africa just waiting for well that's one of the issues that people are having in terms of blood type there's there's all this talk of certain blood types may be more susceptible to the virus protector Lee blood type a Twitter I think a week or so ago there's dozens of different pathogens with including viruses and bacteria that behave differently depending I mean there's a whole I put one up on Twitter I think a week or so ago there's dozens of different pathogens with including viruses and bacteria that behave differently depending on a person's blood type so host genetics influence quite a bit</div>

Supposed to double your right hand or left hand I don't like that right like I like a hose off of it to Eastside industrial strength around if you had that s*** on your eyebrow hairs but your eyebrow hairs how much rubbing this one left one the right what the f*** dude look at that I like that you tried out that warm water on your but I guess it's a smaller little thing that I remembered say don't think you have to worry though the day is a bidet on their side the room to look if you see they're over there that's a good day so there was a bit dicey that's what I'm talking about I was super confused sing the pokes out in the middle and that's kind of what I was talking about and some of them are a little bit higher than others but they're these weird little I don't know what kind of ships are these people take a little earlier</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the guy that they just arrested for selling the coronavirus pill that is supposedly kills the coronavirus he reminds me of that old bodybuilding guy with it Dan or whatever that used to sell fake chloroquine there's no studies right there's no definitive test but they're still letting people try is that what's going on with that take so that the couple that died took the wrong shed picture of trump is getting in the way of the accuracy of some people's reporting of the news and that's a perfect example like resorting to clickbait and saying that they heard it from Trump but he does now he said what he was talking about a different kind of chloroquine there's more than one different kind of it right right but if they just said real simply that these people die please be careful there is more than one different kind of chloroquine and Queen hasn't been shown definitively to work yet and it's not necessarily safe to take if they said that they would be great but instead they had to say the president told people to take it that's not what he said what he said is that there's hope and we're hoping that this could be a cure or this could be a treatment what he said but that's what everybody's saying like if you go and read articles about that when doctors were talking about potential treatment there's a bunch of different ones there's IV vitamins is chloroquine there's this corquin which is like an old-school malaria medication and then zpacks for talked about what is that called Death from Mathis in how do you say that time for talking about what doctors are talking about because legitimate people are talking about that combination of things but just cuz you hate Trump you can't distort this and make it seem like Trump did something irresponsible by talking about this hopeful disease medication and these people took the wrong version of it and died but this a cautionary tale it's not a chance to s*** on Trump but everything's a chance to s*** on Trump it's so exhausting it's just it's it's f****** weird let me see movie ratings but he's gotten a lot better at handling confrontational conversations with reporters you know I was watching this one yesterday and this reporter was asking a question about a few things but she asked about people dying because of the economy failing and him talking about like an is there anyone that could speak to he says it's in this playing a game the game is she knows there's no real data that shows if they do that this will happen if the economy crashes the way they anticipated crashing all these people are out of work for an extended. Of time x amount of people kill themselves but we for sure know that economic despair is is a reason why some people go into depression depression is a reason why some people kill themselves these are all facts that we all know like maybe you can't pull that out of your ass you're standing in front of a Podium and you're addressing vehicle and they're calling you out on this and what you was saying correctly is we can't put money ahead of people's lives so the correct Thing by most people's account is for at least some. Of time separating everybody maintaining this this distance and putting a stop to the the number of viruses remember people to get infected he saying is there's also a factor that we have to consider that all these people out of work could lead to suicide and could lead to drug addiction and he's right and you know he's right we all know he's right that's not that's irrefutable When people's lives fall apart through the unexpected circumstances some people are hanging on by a f****** thread and that comes along and it doesn't matter that does happen if people we all know that to be true just cuz you hate Trump you can't pretend that this isn't going to be rough people or you can't pretend at him saying that this can cause a loss of life to I think the problem might have been he might have said maybe more life there's no evidence that that's true there's no evidence that it might cause more loss of life I think also we grew up always listening when a stressful time when the president came on you feel comforted like his tone of voice how he how he acted you're just like a a a book</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this virus I've been saying this about all viruses that diseases are demons you know and we we just if we were losing like have you seen the numbers to this is something that my friend Steve who's a doctor sent me and this is a f****** create a series of crazy statistics but the crazy statistics about how many people died like it puts it into perspective all life lost is valuable all I've lost is a try I'm not saying anything other than that but what I'm just I'm not diminishing anyone's loss of life or what I am saying is I was stunned when I saw the actual numbers so 2017 to 2-2-2018 h2n 3 pandemic killed sixty-one thousand Americans did you know that I didn't know that did you do that 17 to 2018 hospitalized 3453 in estimated affected was 894700 people buy that flu that's crazy overall death rate was 7.5 with a peak in January 2018 of 10.8 again I'm a moron not a doctor reading you a text message maybe I shouldn't be doing that maybe someone should look into this 2009 pandemic know this is the one that Burt said he had the H1 N1 that killed 80 3300 Americans death rates range from 4% to 33% for Pediatric 0 to 22% for 18 and 6402 4% for those over 65 man this is crazy u.s. case is 68274000 hospitalized 12469 deaths in the u.s. I'm just going over all these different ones that happened flu the year 2020 cases reported 45:9 Hospital hospitalizations 4 and fifteen thousand deaths 48,000 that's for the 2020 flu this flu season there's so many people that died of the flu but obviously this when you see healthcare workers freaking out you know this is different so what is different about it that's yeah it's all the same time it's new it's a new virus people don't then I have immunity for it they don't really know how to cure it and attacks the respiratory system and it seems to have a real quick turnaround from I'm not feeling so good to I'm dead you know it's happens very quickly for some people shockingly so some of these seems to affect different people in different ways but there's a lot going on with this one that has smart people going we need to f****** stay home for a bit just everybody chill no large Gatherings she'll get the flu shot every year I mean like I feel like I get the flu almost every year but I sleep well and I've been able to shake it off but it's a good move it's probably I probably should get the flu shot and if I got the flu again maybe I'd like f*** man I should have got the flu shot let me get the flu shot but mean whether it's diet or whether it's some all that s*** I'm on all the different vitamins and hormones and the fact that I'm in the f****** sauna for 25 minutes everyday but I rarely get sick if you make you would get it more just because you're around like you know Jim's and saunas in my places where there's a lot of sweating play cooties I've gotten in the gym it scare me is staph a couple of times that scares me to get ringworm times I got that twice at least maybe three times which is not that bad you put Lamisil on it stay out the mat for a little bit and then the products are start using prevented or save me from that company called defense soap good bacteria it just coats your body with this soap and it's all like natural it it it kills the bad bacteria but it doesn't kill good bacteria I don't understand how that works both people have known that forever the tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil good for infections and preventing infection chords yeah I've been I've been lucky with diseases knock on wood but it's you know this is a weird one if you're if you're compromised you know people that have lung issues or people that have had like even vaping yeah I think cigarettes and vaping and that also affects so many people like that list that I read off is that right I should I read right we think it seems like those numbers correct numbers again so what did I say was start off with the first one the first one was Michael you apparently put out a video today. JD he's back okay let's look at this one the 2017 to 2018 H2 N3 virus pandemic killed 61,000 American that up the hardest part with that right now is those numbers have been accumulated over a year plus and we only have had a month forever today 61000 people now the other one was the big one at the end the flu for this year for 2020 cases reported 45 million hospitalizations 415000 deaths 48,000 cuz it happens every right you know it's like the sky monster of the sky monster never appeared before and then one day the first tornado hit and tore apart Nashville we be like what in the f*** is God's mad at us right that's how I used to feel back in this just one person's case I remember last week I read someone that got tested for the flu and I tested positive and then weeks later got tested for the covid-19 and then tested positive for that but they weren't tested for the time they're tested for the flu because they don't have a test tested positive for the flu maybe that never had a covid-19 test could be available good bacon I'm testing positive is it mean could they ride that got some hand sanitizer before the Green in San Diego and Tom Green was the first person that I knew that was kind of like panicking a little that he just bought a crate of Lysol many Lysol and he was spraying the microphone down on stage and like and I was like he's taking a little overboard literally like a week later everyone's doing that f*** it's a bit spooky dude who was it that had a friend was it Tom Papa was friend was warning him long in advance no wasn't Tom Papa it was Bert Kreischer Bert Kreischer at a friend who's warning him Wayne Advance listen and you need to isolate need to get your family and he was like like what in this is apparently in February he's like this lady's crazy now and then he texted her like the beginning of March one of those on and Poppin he's like you're right my point about us showing those numbers is not to diminish the impact of this current pandemic it was just to highlight the fact that we live in a warzone we Livin of a virus Warzone that takes out thousands of people every year in this country and I don't most of us are really keeping our eye on that you know what you hear about deaths by the flu and the Never Say Never shocking death by some new thing for some reason even if it's the same number of deaths or less even right so far less freaked us the f*** out it's like it's happening more everyday like this that guy died of flu a total of 19543 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by flu serve – net sites between October 2019 and March 21-2024 t1100 72.1% were associated with influenza A virus what's 14000 what I say whoops I want my dyslectic influenza okay 5335 27.3% with influenza B that's true to write if you get an influenza A shot and its influenza B you might catch it anyway that's annoying so that's a lot of people so we got 19505 thousand 304,000 14100 my theory is Warren sucking your thumb your supposed to suck your thumb your whole life and it was supposed to keep your immune system strong so that it was vital to the hospital station rate was 67.3% 467.3 per 100,000 population Which is higher than all recent Seasons except for the 2017-2018 season rates in children 0 to 4 years old in adults 18-49 are now the highest CDC has on record for these age groups of pass the rate reported during the 2009 H1 N1 pandemic hospitalization rates for school-age children are higher than any recent regular-season but lower than rates during the pandemic when they killed all those people they didn't shut anything down he had the H1 N1 he did yeah you did yeah he has never in his life and it was 2009 when it was all going down and he said he couldn't sleep you so uncomfortable in just constant pain and aching should never never felt sick or ever in his life and that killed a lot of people I got a flu like that before 5 years ago or something like that can get you they can get you I hope another thing that comes out of here is people take their f****** immune system more seriously support your immune system you know I mean it just makes a bit just a little shift in the number of people that get healthy little ship the number number of people to start taking vitamins and exercising and you know just do something man's something put a heavy backpack on go for a walk do something listen to podcast system you know I mean it just makes a bit just a little shift in the number of people that get healthy little ship the number number of people to start taking vitamins and exercising and you know just do something man's something put a heavy backpack on go for a walk do something listen to podcast</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> well that's the other things going on with people's the fear man when you have a hard time dealing with anxiety you have apprehension you just fearful of the future and fearful to disease some people have anxiety before this this can accelerate everything that's going to be real hard for just for mental health the people sit going to be people they're going to have a really hard time also accepting this is just something that happened to them it says something that they did wrong you know when something goes bad and you did something wrong account like I made a bad decision and I should have done that way I f***** up and we should have had that meeting and then you know you might know why your business fell apart but if it falls apart now but you didn't even do anything wrong and the government gets to tell you they have to sit back now if you were conspiracy theorist it's so many of them you would think will be the best way to gain more control the people the best way first Vault accelerate the spare and accelerate unemployment you do all the things that are just going to happen from what naturally happens in a diseased people are willing to give up certain civil liberties if they if they think they can get more safety and it's true we should stay home it's true it will be better for everybody it's true that we need to take precautions it's true that we need to self isolate all those things but it's also true that you're giving a certain amount of power to the government to lock things down and control you they giving people tickets in New York they catch them walking around again $500 tickets they're doing another place just to I'm sure and that's where it gets weird man because it's who are these people these people that are telling you can't go anywhere they're just the government they're just people there people telling people that they can't go somewhere which is fine if we need to do that like right now but what if it just sort of stays that way what if it stays that way to a lesser extent what they saw you know how it going to stop coronavirus from really taking place I want to know where you going I want to know where you going I want to know I want when you go through each state we're going to have checkpoints going to pull you over its give you height and police day so if you've been tested for the coronavirus and you put a f****** thing on your forehead what if what if this thing really does start coming back the way it 4 people tested negative and then they later tested positive is that happens here and we going to keep this lockdown thing going on with if it's something that we all have it comes back like when Jon Jones had those steroids in his system in the Pica grams and it just kept flashing back and with us with this stuff what we test positive for Coronavirus every couple years but if it's like herpes but if you keep it for life what for assuming we got rid of it we can just accept martial law we just make sense tanks in the streets except it's a question so if you were a nut right now you would be f****** going crazy because you would be saying all the pieces are in place for like a hostile takeover and they're in place because they really truly are the best ways to save people's lives like it's all so smart thing to do but if you are conspiracy theorists you said this is exactly what I would do if I wanted to take over and that's why we have to be really careful of we got to be careful of Summer walking that very fine balance of protecting people from a disease is Invisible Killer and preserving our freedom and preserving rights all those things are very important we don't just give that up cuz it's it's not the way to go it's just not we have to figure out our way through this disease and then we have to figure out some way to return to normalcy and that's got to happen we can't just stay like this where no one works anymore we can't just not ever take risks we can't just not go out so once this does get rolling again it's going to be real interesting to see how much if any control the government retains how much of that if any restrictions get get imposed how much of these restrictions we just absorbing to become new or new things I got a normal thing rather we're just go to the airport you have to take a temperature test and go to the airport they want to test you or would I have to start wearing suits like Star Wars breathing apparatus and everyone that works at the grocery store is going to be robots you know and pathogen that you get to the hotel and unzip you can enjoy New York City from your balcony look so pretty out there with all the murderous viruses swarming around killing people with the virus get together made bars tornadoes start just throwing people against walls or virus babies make it fly through the air like we seen why can't a virus tornado to slam you into a wall viruses accelerate billions of times and they've they form colonies and they become intelligent and they realized they move quick enough they can actually like they could knock you off your feet and they go down your throat like a demon just what we're reading about the H1 N1 all these other flus a kill so many countless thousands of people that can be counted them pretty accurate way to double-check just think about that the sheer numbers of people that died from those things if those were demons instead of diseases how freaky would that be if we're really look we're going to lose a certain amount of people every year to Demons little cut still little Godzilla just running up into your window and killing your grandma then a virus the silent thing choke you to death I need to know I've been thinking that all the world needs to get to come together is like that alien invasion he figured it out what if this did come from space like this takeover of the World by another Nation what better way to do it than that but if North Korea was behind all this resources likely that's beside the point I don't think it was intentional things like this happen people do take advantage of opportunity and you got to be real careful who gets the better hand and they take advantage of it's just it's an underground weird for people they know where it came from they think they've isolated that this thing did come from this Market in Wuhan they know it's just it's the way things like this can play out there's a bunch of these is almost just like someone starting a conspiracy it's not it doesn't have to be done like it just actually naturally this in the same people that would benefit from a conspiracy or who would Engage The Conspiracy to defraud people are f***** people over in the first place was going to jump in and take advantage of the quickest That's What's So Scary About It totalitarian ideas Thrive when people are scared they want someone to take over the reins they want someone to take over will block the streets No More Travel going to block this you can't go to work and I'm going to be poor and broke it scared I'm not saying what I am saying do something to really take over civilization it would be this way that's how you would do it you would do diseases I'm not saying they're doing that I don't think they are I think this is just a horrible natural disaster really clear on that but we might come out of this different than we went in that's real just tanks driving down the road in California thanks getting supplies or something like what he sent me a video from his phone of Tanks rolling down New York City armed Humvees and tanks freaky like military vehicles and Camo we hiding your New York City from with some camo is that even when they use them in cities they Camelot like to let you know they might hide in the bushes to b**** the drive to the city's to lock everybody down to had those murdered out matte black paint job that it would be a little more intimidating me pieces of pizza slices and stuff and you're not in the military have an eye on you anyway what are you doing right military style Hummer around like please check that guy's house you know please please read his Facebook please you just got to give up a microchip they put a microchip in your hand and your fine and it's also doubles as a Corona tester so you make sure that you had never get mistaken for someone Corona just have to scan you how you going to the bathroom to have your hand please with peace and harmony I mean really I'm trying not to sound like a conspiracy nut cuz I'm not accusing anyone of creating conspiracy what I am saying is if if I was a conspiracy not or if I was a country that was conspiring to take over the world this is not a bad way to do it I don't think that's happening right now I want to be real clear but it's kind of the same result that were experiencing right now we're ones being forced to shut down with who-knows-what consequences it's also the right thing to do so we're all like whoa you know it's another one of those things about being a person or the right thing to do still feels crazy still feels like encouraging is so many people are willing to stay home and people aren't rebelling like f*** you this is my country I'm going to work I'll take a chance he's going to get it anyway f*** you people doing that when you consider that the government is controlling 320 million people pretty crazy almost everyone's complying with staying home is only a few essential businesses and we're going to have to think really have spacesuits to leave the house and work Scooby a mess are you worried Jamie I've never seen you this word everything I look into the future to see where we're headed and I don't see a really see much out there cuz I don't know where it is but it's not anything good cuz there's nothing like going to the movies again seems like that's probably close to out movies were already dying anyway house for twenty bucks perfect way better sweet so when are movie theaters open again all right what's next concerts sporting events I don't know once everything's in place where they can treat people effectively and they have the adequate number of ventilators then are we going to go back to the way things were or we going to have new standards in place I don't know man that they look they did an unprecedented thing they lock down the entire country to save people's lives never happened before we're in New Territory and you know it's dangerous when a moron like me is making sense but when I'm one of the people talking about something like this when he was living in France and I don't know who is writing to I'll try to find the right now but he's talking about how they stocked up on a bunch of alcohol and people were being told it's almost like you're told not to go anywhere but some people don't believe it. He was talking about a writer friend of his who wasn't taking it seriously and like it was like real people Ryan and everyone's just like what's going on you got to read the newspaper like f*** what happened it's fake what a good way to end what happened it's fake how they get you I just saw that this was going viral during the pandemic and why people have been falling for it and son of a b**** what a good way to end</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you know you look at I don't know if you've been paying attention to what these Senators did but there's some Senators they had a behind-closed-doors meeting about the coronavirus in China and what it means United States and you know the various impacts and they went out sold their stock immediately and then they were talking about how under control the government had it and how we're prepared and how it's going to be fine and meanwhile they knew they knew so they had two faces that a public face and they're given to us to try to keep us calm and then they had a private face which realize that the stock market was going to take a huge loss until they sold everything and made amends profits based on the information that they found out he's closed-door meetings about the coronavirus how are they supposed to know about legal supposed to do using that works like if you like what is the point of playing the stock market if you don't know things and if you do know things would you no more because you know the guy was a president tells you something about something to do and you're not supposed to trade then because of that information like alright okay I'm sure there's a logic to it don't run it by me but if that's what is it with the Senators do if they knew that the coronavirus is going to wreck our economy if they knew that it was coming like a f****** storm of hail that no one could stop if they knew and then they bailed out and made demands profits that seem so shady that they didn't advise but you're supposed to be a leader right if you're in a position of an elected representative you're supposed to be acting in the position of a leader and if your way to lead is tell people one thing but act in a completely different direction tell people everything's going to be fine but then start selling your stock prophet and you don't tell other people to do it because you're worried that maybe that information is going to cause some ripple effect is going to destroy the economy even before the coronavirus hits just had a panic and fear in people going to act wrong but you acted in a different way than the way you were talking you acted like this s*** was going to be real you act like there's going to be a real problem and then the question is like how much of a problem did they think was going to be maybe they dump the stock that. I was going to be a little problem would that be okay but if they found I was going to be huge comments not well that seems weird to me too like I don't know what the should the rules be with information in the stock market stock market is gross like it's what the whole things grow this f****** Madness so I saw an article where the photographer who took that photo was like he was like oh it's so sad that people are using his image that way because you know he pass play in and I thought it was kind of offensive that he was being used to prank or whatever and he said you know I saw the people started selling merch what this guy's face on it and he goes I just wish because I own the photograph and I'm not trying to come after you when I just wish they would share proceeds of that merch with the family so I saw that and I was like oh I want to do that so I launched a shirt with that guy's face on it that says wash your hands and then and then I go I go I want to give the proceeds to this Man's family so because of that article I reached out to people I was able to get in touch with the photographer the guy who took that picture and then I found I got in touch with his the the the models fiance who you know anyways I contacted her I found her I've learned a little bit about this guy in that photo and I'm giving them the proceeds from the shirt sales all of them all the profits will go to them and I also found that when he when he died like the family wasn't prepared like financially for anything so they had set up a GoFundMe for his funeral and Tombstone and all that so I'm going to blast it out but I talk to him either they're happy with it so that's my breaking news important news not really as big I didn't get into that with her mommy said that it's photoshopped I've heard that as well show me the original black dick I didn't even know this was a thing I think so how many dead husband LOL yeah so anyways yeah oh well bucks you can get more than that they make much money but we've never been in a situation where everybody scared of one disease it's so strange man it's so strange I don't think I'd be able to get past that and just do a show right now I'm 90% sure they're going to cancel it mean that the stuff that they're coming up with for treatment one of them is a malarial disease and old malaria disease or some other different treatments that hold hope and but there's so many old man that we could get infected if you got to show 12013 thousand people whatever it is how the f*** are you going to make sure those people are okay is that your responsibility do you say, at your own risk you know I mean what have you get it when you're there or what are we doing what are we doing you know I mean the whole thing's crazy hopefully unless this is the first thing that falls and then all those other things fall into place we talked about natural disasters appreciate piece we can appreciate freedom and appreciate being a roam around do whatever you want go out at 3 at night you going to be going to appreciate it you can appreciate being able to go to a diner and have breakfast with your friend at 2 in the morning laugh un appreciate it cars in the street everybody acting normal going to mean more to you now it's like the sun after I need a means more feels better has more of an impact and I think we've gone through a long stretch in this country where everything was static everything was doing fairly well we're on an upward Trend no real tragedy National nationally to change the way we live our life other than September 11th so we got like September 11th and then all these years of war of course crime of course always a but we're basically business as usual for most folks not anymore call the wake-up call that you have a finite amount of time in this life and this life the way you're experiencing it right now it's just how it is right now there's a million different factors that are in Play constantly and you've been real lucky they've out of the stretch of peace and Harmony but that s*** could change at any moment it really could and we got to use this time to be nicer to each other little use this time to to realize that we got we got a little confused we got crazy you know everybody trying to acquire things and everybody's trying to tell you to move their way up the corporate ladder like hey there's there's a f****** end of this ride okay this ride comes to a stop someday and he doesn't matter how much s*** you've acquired it doesn't matter you know how far you got up this ladder you know what what position of prominence you have in the community and how you're respected by the business World nobody gives a f*** when your dad it's not you're going to die we are together right now experiencing this thing in like really distracted way the thing comes into focus when you're forced into a situation like like we are now where you literally or nervous about your survival then nothing comes into focus and he only brought in tools to make tools and the big tools like that he made all of them self and amazing at home and stuff that you would know he would

This virus doesn't give a f*** and if you don't respect it people are going to die and there's people like the lieutenant governor I think is who he is of Texas who is like we should take a risk with older people just to get the economy back in line people like whoa what are you saying you think they're kind of you should we should get the economy back in line and bite do any kind of some old people going to have to die you're ready to sacrifice people for money older people would rather die than let covid-19 harm US economy Texas official said older people would rather die that's what he says Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick okay yeah and you know you saying that he's in that high-risk category himself cuz he's 70 you notice these politicians are terrified that this is going to lead to an economic disaster and their names going to be stuck on it you know I think they were terrified at first that they had they had to act that a close things down they didn't have a plan and now they realize like oh my God this might have to stay locked down for a long time what happens you, yeah you didn't have a plan so they locked down and now they're like listen this could last a long time we got to take we got to start the Rumblings now I'm getting this ball rolling again because if it's go 6-7 months and no one's working no one can go outside their house or six seven months like this is crazy what we won't have any money and China going to take over Tucker Carlson at his whole piece he did that I saw there was actually pretty accurate and where he's talking about what what could be possible do you like he was talking about how the NBA what did you see that whole segment where the NBA they had said something about China and then then you see all these people that were praised in China and saying positive things about China what was this what was the reason behind that Jamie your MBA guy the GM for the Houston Rockets tweeted like support for Hong Kong that's right that's right and then trying to get pissed at that until then they started tweeting nice things about China and they started at the time of that happened that there was like an NBA teams in China doing games and then just come back and then they start asking all them what they thought about this and then like the bronze started supporting China I think and then everyone jumped on them and money over people I think you mean that they face consequences for supporting Hong Kong yeah well would talk across from the saying in this piece was that imagine if that's the the whole country like understand that like a China's the ruler of the world of China becomes the ruler of the world not the United States because of something like this like this is all really possible like the idea that the United States is the ruler of the world so it has to stay the ruler of the world forever no natural disasters disease f****** asteroid impact has a bunch of different things that could shift the balance of power in the world ROM used to run everything right do you know that there's a European England UK English to run to have the f****** planet there's a lot of different countries that were on top of the world that are no longer on top of the world and we would be in a real sticky situation if we had to live under the same military dictatorship the China does and the idea that we would never have to live under that we we can't wear America but that's ridiculous because we're human beings and other human beings are stuck in a circumstance where they're living under a dictatorship so there's no difference between culture and the place where they live that that ships things change with natural disaster with disease with failure of the economy with war with all these different factors things change and our perception much like our perception of our society itself it's always going to be like this and also this disease comes along and shut everything down you like whoa that's a wake-up call need to recognize that this is kind of fragile is fragile if those things happen natural disaster disease wore anything catastrophic happen if the balance of power completely ship and who knows whose control the survivors are under who knows who knows how this is all real touch-and-go right now this is real touch-and-go this is Uncharted Territory where we have slipped into a place where no

		<div class="paragraph"> so why we should tell everybody what we learned today I'm revising my thinking about this virus because of Michael Yo Michael Yo caught it as healthy as f*** he's he's not he's not in a high-risk group like he's not he doesn't have any pre-existing conditions he's in shape and he got it and he got pneumonia too and he said it was a double combination and he thought he was going to die and he was in the hospital for over a and 4 days ago he said he thought he was going to die that's f****** terrifying cuz Michael Yo is healthy he's not some eighty-year-old man I talked to my friend dr. Peter attia he's a physician and he gets into the swim from Maui yes others Get Wrecked and he said I still think most people blow 55 sale through it I've had two patients get it shity cold and loss of a sense of smell and taste would probably return soon but still a small fraction of these folks get hurt I know it. Taking care of a 28 year old fitness instructor on a ventilator in New York City today why you said maybe some genetic predisposition we know blood types matters a is the worst Bo is best based on antibodies he said I'm O+ he said but I don't think that explains more than some of it maybe s*** like vaping he said still too soon to tell he is a straight-up no-nonsense no bulshit guy and I listen to everything he says so when guys like him are concerned concerned and he's concerned he's weird is he's nothing but he said it's weird that it seems that people spend more time with this get it worse is like it's not like you don't like like doctors and hospitals with prolonged exposure to get it really bad nurses in the hospital with prolonged exposure seem to get it really bad where some people get it and they don't get it bad it's weird it's a very very strange disease according to doctors and I think we're still trying to figure this out you know it's just wow it's it's one of those things where everyone sort of absorbing the information as it comes in and you got to be open to adjusting your opinions my opinions were I really was concerned with old people and I was concerned with sick people now after Michael yeah okay this is not that straightforward there might be some some other crazy factors here is like for some people yeah like Idris Elba who looks fantastic you know fine but maybe other people are going to have a real hard time with it like Michael Yo Sky that's Pokemon I mean your podcast with the foster home chicken little chicken little that scared the f*** out of me and let's go to bed that f****** podcast crazyman osterholm is he predicted this s*** literally specifically as to where was going to come from he was very inside the drink a lot the smoke overweight the drink a lot the smoke who's my one from take care of himself the worst it's you is me</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Joker when the old set it'll probably retired now that we're awful at least a week's man when I mean that it's probably going to be several months before easily could be longer it could be you know maybe they find medication that even though there's not a vaccine there's some hope for a few different kinds of medication one of them is malaria drug and there's enough one that shows promise is well and they think that it might be possible that people could catch this and you'd give them to medication it would wipe it out there's also there was some speculation about Tamiflu but I don't think there's any conclusive evidence that shows a Tamiflu helps it but there is some these antimalarial medications I think that they think has promised but what concerns me is it seems to be so different with different people that's what's weird about this makes it now for everybody's the unknown like we're in the unknown like now we've never been in this situation before as a culture we're at we're on lockdown in the whole world scared of a disease not not in our lifetimes mean not since like the Spanish flu and back then there wasn't as much Transportation there wasn't as much distribution of information to people probably wanted as we're as we are now you know of all the various cases all around them all the time cuz you know we're here in about cases and Italy and f****** Australia everywhere we're hearing about cases all over the planet I think that was the case back during the Spanish food days I think it's probably harder to understand what was happening right because you probably only got the newspaper in the radio back that and everybody has those are the masters of information whatever they said that was it but now you get all sorts of conflicting information from nothing and then I've read doctors that were terrified is like whoa nuts and then you know you look at I don't know if you've been paying attention to what these Senators did but there's some Senators they had a behind-closed-doors meeting about the coronavirus in China and what it means United States and you know the various impact and they went out sold their stock and mediately they were talking about how under control the government had it and how we're prepared and how it's going to be fine meanwhile they knew they knew so they had to face is that a public face that they're given to us to try to keep us calm and then they had a private face which realized the stock market was going to take a huge loss and so they sold everything and made amends profits based on the information that they found out he's closed-door meetings about the coronavirus how are they supposed to hit that legal to do how does that work do you understand how that works I'll give you have allowed you to make money wasn't that like whatever was trying to do like if you like what is the point of playing the stock market if you don't know things and if you do know things would you no more because you know the guy was the president tells you something about something to do and you're not supposed to trade then because of that information like alright okay I'm sure there's a logic to it I'm a moron don't run it by me but if that's what is it with the Senators do if they knew that the coronavirus is economy if they knew that it was coming down like a f****** storm of hail that no one could stop if they knew and then they bailed out and made amends profits that seem so shady to seem so shady that they didn't advise people you're supposed to be a leader right if you're in a position of an elected representative you're supposed to be acting in the position of a leader and if you are way to lead is tell people one thing with act in a completely different direction tell people everything's going to be fine but then start selling your stock at a profit and you don't tell other people to do it because you're worried the Navy that information is going to cause some ripple effect is going to destroy the economy even before the coronavirus hits just had a panic and fear in people going to act wrong but you acted in a different way than the way you were talking you acted like this s*** was going to be real you act like there's going to be a real problem and then the questions like how much of a problem did they think it was going to be maybe they dumped the stock that I was going to be a little problem would that be okay nobody but they found I was going to be a huge problem and it's not well that seems weird to me too like I don't know what should the rules be with information in the stock market stock market is gross like the whole thing's gross like what do we base our economy on this f****** Madness the stock markets crashed in a way that was you're going like it's based on I know that it's for commercial businesses their loans going to come up and it's going to be tough for them but at some point you're like I wish you could just put it on freeze and go hey let's come back in like 2 months let's start where we were let's make sure everyone was fed like that's the ultimate real because if it supposed to be about confidence and things rising and falling this is like the ultimate expression of that there's no confidence you can't work like crazy and there's so many industries that are happening and it's only jobs and unemployment the lowest rate is haven't been ever in history people then all the sudden it's not anymore or course is going to crash so it's going to crash this is the crash this is the big one is the big one of our lifetime maybe the biggest one ever because she could go on for a long ass time this is scary to could you think of all those people just like who are paycheck-to-paycheck you know with waiting tables or teaching a spin class or whatever it is that's where my brain goes like yeah that does let me know that's all I do all day to spend like McDonald's or like say there's a way to buy a bunch of Happy Meals I can send you a neighborhood you can do that with certain restaurants you can support restaurants with buffet restaurants in Vegas guytanno's is in Henderson and Eastman Calabasas we should go to him way back in the day but they are they're doing a lot of takeout and then they're also raising money for their employers which is very nice and I think the store doing something like that we're all going to donate for the waitstaff you know cuz the wait staff is completely shut out of locked and they were doing you no good business down there and tell those folks I'm sure they have bills like serious f****** bills and it's just piling up and there's no business you know I mean they went from having a great place we can go and you can count on x amount of money per week to all sudden gone and no one saw coming that's never happened ever you can't blame them for not being prepared but you know they're part of our comedy family man we got to we got to take care of them but at the store we should set up something for the Improv too and we should also you know just figure out a way to you know it's like find out who's hurting like who's in trouble because specially in our community a Comics that we know little people do proud because there's a lot of comics in our community we are Headliners with you and making you know x amount per week and you know you got to pay your own flight and all that jazz you getting by but you not killing it and then you have you probably have a f****** apartment across two grand a month or more you know I mean New York City those guys just f****** apartments in New York City are ridiculous</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> isn't it also partly because the discussion is out there and the discussion is a very attractive the discussion of one of the reasons why you haven't gotten by in this world is because of inequality and because of some sort of systemic racism systemic sexism or systemic homophobia transphobia and it becomes when you give people an option to find an excuse they gravitate towards all these pieces are in place as much as many many moving parts right and I think all these little pieces are in place where we also have these massive Echo Chambers because of social media we have these people that you know they find ideologically similar human beings and they bounce off of each other friend somebody who's indeterminate between male and female physiological so okay let's imagine that they have karyotype XY profile and that the developmental process did not produce an ambiguous genitalia okay is that a hermaphrodite pretty terrific and I look at all the forms it's a male female and I just you know my heart sinks like we're not even in trans here we're talking about somebody whose biological card that they were Del could have been you could have been me and through no no choices at all this person is being shoehorned into a paradigm which puts them in an increased risk of suicide and it breaks my heart we should change it we should break the male-female dichotomy absolutely now I have a different feeling about trans but if we solve the issue of intersex which is not pressuring just accepting that some tiny percentage of the population which is not vanishingly small just large is neither mostly male and female terms of genotype phenotype concordance we will do most of the work necessary to take care of our trans folks were suffering to might not trans is a much more Rich world because they're a million different issues taking place in trans and they're all conflated no part of it because of Developmental biology part of it because gender really in some sense is socially constructed in a way that like when people say mathematics is socially constructed I have to reject it you don't give this example of like jolts and lungis from Scotland and India are skirts but they're not female in those places so you have to learn about male and female relative to the codification in your Society in the issues of water are what are obligations to recognize hey this is really a female mind in a male body versus this is a regular mind in a regular body but needs instruction all these things are conflated and I was really hoping that we if you know if we used intersects at the test case to break the the the binary because the binary is an impression there's no question in my mind about it was it an impression because it was imagine that I say I have persistent mullerian duct syndrome so I'm phenotypically on the outside male and I go to my doctor and says hey you got a uterus what is okay that's an exotic situation maybe I want to identify male dinner because the outside equipment looks male it's a it's a it's a weird situation maybe the idea of it as being a present for a friend of mine who is in either situation yet oppressive like what is it oppressive if people are just recognized like most people recognize as being able to walk there is no category called disabled in a wheelchair sounds like to me like it's one thing to recognize that not everybody is in the standard category but it's another thing to hard-code like hard-code where you talking about job or female other or prefer not to say we have to let me Define lotion or female emotionally emotionally I think this is oppression oppression yeah I'm at the interests of defining people simply because for the most part yet dealing with males and females and it's for the most part they're just trying to figure out what's what for their statistical but you know this is fun I'm glad you're asking me these questions because you have to be on the other side of this issue and this is really where my heart is I care about these people and I know that in every single conservative Society in the world there are accommodations made for the failure of simple binaries to accommodate the population there's no Society this we have to recognize that every single population produces gender sexual ambiguity but isn't that also to get around the idea of homosexuality being a grievous crime cuz like I believe in Iran it's illegal to have homosexual activity but you can have gender reassignment so if your a game and you can choose to become a female that's true but there's also a thriving Gacy Tehran you know do they have to recognize and they're all sorts of music you know that there was a situation in India where I'm going to have more experience where you would sell those two people are confirmed Bachelors now that they're so dedicated to their professions that there's no room for family and they live together right so like traditional societies have everybody accommodates homosexuality and failures of simple gender binaries and do I always bring up the example of Turkish lira Turkish doesn't hard-code the third person singular pronoun as male or female it just has one pronoun for both so thank you for giving me the opportunity to know where my heart actually has been this entire time which is I believe this is impressive and I don't think that expresses that many people but I believe that it's an important oppression that we have to realize that we hard-coated in that ice was generated a lot of the feeling before we get to trans you can simply say from the position of intersex that the world is a richer place than male and female people so it took 6 versus XYZ for the most part for the most part it is so try to deal with but that is important to me like people who are outside of the Norms I think it probably a larger percentage of those people are going to be more interesting people because they're forged in the fire so it's not just a case that you know do you want to chase a couple of edge cases everybody was a really different experience is more important to me than everyone with the standard experience I think we have to keep take care of the standard case but I'm absolutely interested in outliers and edge cases so it's not just a case that you know do you want to chase a couple of edge cases everybody was a really different experience is more important to me than everyone with the standard experience I think we have to keep take care of the standard case but I'm absolutely interested in outliers and edge cases</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think our problem in this country there's this many problems with one of our problems is the loudest voices on the fringes and this is one of the things that I want to discuss with you is what's going on in Portland and I think what's going on in Portland is the loudest voices on the fringes that the people on the right and on the far right and recognizes recognizing as emblematic of the left they think it defines the left and I don't think it does I think it is it's a symptom of its it's a symptom of first of all terrible government of of of someone who's allowing this to flourish inside of the mayor of Portland who seems to be supporting this in some sort of a weird way and and ideologically believes that antifa just because of a name stands for anti-fascist if you had no name which you would have is a bunch of Hood wearing mask wearing violent thugs were eating people who disagree with them and cuz that's what we saw with that Andy how do you say his name go is it Higgins ending no no and it's angio is silent until somebody what you saw from that video yet anyone could support that of with a person who's just talking they didn't mean what I've seen of him but they've tried to describe that he supports neo-nazis that he supports the proud boys I've seen none of this do you know evidence to this but I've seen the narrative try it out over and over again as a justification for violence against him when the left supports bullying in the worst possible form be ganging up on someone punching them hitting them with the sticks crowbars all this crazy s*** thinking that it's okay to throw milkshakes at people thinking this is fine this is nothing if you think this is a horrible precedent to set and it's a terrible it's the terrible move if you're playing a game it's a terrible first move because things only escalate they don't DS but no one says wow you beat the s*** out of andino's and Mysteries right like what the hell is going on what the hell do you allowing people to wear masks and carry backpacks with weapons and there's a natural human inclination when someone gets hit to jump in and hit him too so if you see it all the time watch Worldstar go to worldstarhiphop.com and watch someone gets hit a bunch of people just jump in and hit them it happens at trucks Austin f****** high schools it happens people get brain damage people die each other all the time people who get permanent injury when you're seeing in Portland there was one of them where an old guy got hit in the head with a f****** crowbar for a some math kid because the old guy apparently disagreed with a all disagree on things I don't someone's decide guesses at the old guy is not exactly is portrayed I would leave that the old guy may have been there with a telescoping baton know that he was hitting people we will take this I think this is so worthwhile but like a let's do it right okay because I think this is so mysterious what the hell people doing supporting Andino being beaten up on video so it stay stay with him because that's the the best clearest example of someone who's a tiny little gay man he's tiny mean he represents so many different maligned populations right sectional Publican I thought he was left-of-center I've been told I'm a f****** alt right guy glad it's very confusing all right he's also diminutive in physical form as he's not he's not threatening physically right and they've chosen this guy as an example and one of the more disturbing things are how many people saw the video and we're justifying it saying things like get another hobby these and the Ant fascist will not stand for you know your your your bigotry in your hate like what are you talkin to you think it's okay to punch this guy like the fact that you guys all piled on and punched him in there I've been thinking a lot about it I have a model I'm happy to hear yours because there is a mystery we both agree to beat the beginning that you would imagine that that video would have shocked people into flying so many people sort of excusing it is really shocking well it ain't given that he's also clearly intersection you wouldn't predict this from first principles know you wouldn't do it looked at it on paper you definitely would especially if you allowed him to self-identify as left-of-center okay so here's how I think the model goes unless you want to give yours first the first thing we have to understand is that there's a Division I want to live this at Super carefully the first division is between the what you're calling the loudest voices and I'm going to call the most courageous the most willing to accept loss the voice is most willing to accept loss most of the left does not want to be dragged to the extreme left to hear this thing that why are you focusing on a fringe and the answer is because The Fringe is running the show in my pants what do you mean by willing to accept loss if you go in antifa vs. proud boys melee you're willing your ear you accept that your may get clock with a bike lock. I don't think that'll wreck on I don't think that's correct I think you're dealing with people that have no concept of real violence no experience of real loud if you seen yes there have you seen the image of the guy who looks like he's never worked a day in his f****** life looks like he's never been outside and I think these people are playing a shocking game you are willing so you think you're going to get into a Wylie Coyote versus the Roadrunner kind of a thing we're both of them always survive to the next cartoon oh how anyone's willing to do that but they're willing to do that and they're willing to do that because they're delusional delusion boarded and they're delusional perspective by the giant numbers of them they all had to get and then to wear masks which further emphasizes this illusion at their Bartow game assume that you are not even in a physical situation you're willing to be very loud on social media about very simplistic perspectives yes and you're willing to become a pariah at some level because are you though I think mostly your supported do I need are more support I'm not necessarily your going to trigger so many times on this explanation that I probably just need a little place in the table to start building this up and then you can tear the hell okay the first believe it is at the belief that I have is at the fringes are much more running the show then the people who claim that this is a small number of people believe that the fringes are scary going to go places the rest of us aren't I agree with you on both sides left and right so I spend a lot of time focused on the fringes because the fringes become terrifying and the middle is become cowardly the whole principle of that the whole idea will you thing was about creating a non cowardly for the could actually potentially hold the center because people are actually fairly courageous you would have to say my brother is fairly courageous Ben Shapiro Andino Sam Harris these are people that stood up to death threats you know I have a guy is threatening me everyday of my life in a coming through the internet in my family you have to have some courage in order to be part of this thing and that's part of my irritation when people come after it so there is a cowardly Center in a very terrifying Fringe in the fridge is going around the whole thing left and right the next thing is that people are secretly weirdly sympathetic but they're violent the violent Fringe to their extreme rather than making common cause across the center so for example you imagine that you run a laundromat and you're being visited by a member of organized crime every week they comes into the laundromat and he kind of plays with your stuff and he says I would be if anything happened your business and shakes you down there say oh you know I noticed that you have a daughter I would love to date her breath will go out sometime you hate this guy then some sort of Vineland Village vigilante element its operating extrajudicial e after you've gone to the police over and over again break this guy's knee caps you're weirdly sympathetic with the Vigilante because you're being terrified by a group that is not being taken care of I think that this is in part why some elements of the left there should be more responsible to have institutional positions that have platforms that they can broadcast a weirdly sympathetic to antifa and why Country Club Republicans are weirdly sympathetic to some of these far-right groups is that they view them as this is the dangerous group that's kind of taken care of the problem that I can't stand up to so you bizarre cowardly sympathy from the center who won't actually stand up and say I have more in common with a country club Republican like in my case I feel myself as a progressive released a liberal I have more in common with a country-club republican than somebody who's got a bike lock who's looking for trouble in a street demonstration trying to smash up a Starbucks right I don't want the help from my left the group that wants to play this out using the sort of proxy groups to handle the problems saying look we're going to we're going to sound an air horn before one of these things so that all reasonable people can get the hell out of the way and if you don't respond then your collateral damage and that's on you that's how they see this I think that's another words I think Andino is the guy doesn't listen to the air horn Bret Weinstein doesn't listen to the air horn Peterson Sam Harris don't listen to the air horn not that I didn't does very accurate description of these Fringe people doing the work of the people that are more reasonable but are happy to have these bad people do do their work to fight this battle for them because they think that ultimately it's for good yeah I need my organized crime group to get rid of your organize yes right so the idea that the Law and Order people like I know you don't want anybody nicecream group and I'm going to actually stand up to the Mob and I'm actually not going to pay you your goddamn protection money because I'm in a laundromat in this is the United States of American f*** off that's that's the view that I represent I don't want thank you Auntie if I don't need your help yeah you know what I actually a much more afraid of the far-right in the reason I concentrate my negative energy on the far left is what he trying to do trying to get the genie out of the bottle on the far right that is the danger that you want to see more tiki torches it's not tiki torches that you need to worry about its armed people who come and they not that I bring him by Chloe pushing ordinary human beings to the extremes yeah right and the thing that I get is that like I believe that the Republican party and I just I never got a chance to say the stuff I have never gotten along with Republican party I just don't like it if you would hit the thing that wants to exclude me from the country clubs I have an older model the group that wanted to put in condo developments in Yosemite Valley because they couldn't figure out why we would want to preserve the national parks they're the ones that laughed about the clubbing the baby seals hahaha these people emotional Cadence and we always had this thing where the Democrats will we have most of the smart people in a tiny fraction of time we have seen this giant evapo live intelligence if not actually threw a lack of Courage the people who represent responsible left-wing

care of that we take our responsibilities but not our guilt as the reason for trying to make a better world the believe in structural oppression but don't believe in the extent claimed you know who

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that's a dirty little secret. This is one of the things that bothers me so much about you being so misrepresented when I read things about you with there was a the article that we're just talking about the alt-right sage without the rage they called you and you're not even remotely alt-right in fact you were deleting Target of anti-Semitic abused for all of 2016 where you legitimately battling the alt-right talking about how evil I think their ideology is how evil I think white supremacy is meant personal like people, cuz typically not the favorites of the alt right and then beyond that I mean I think their ideology is legitimately a devastatingly awful Twist on what western civilization is supposed to be reviewed my new book and my new book has several sections and they're dedicated and then the interview they did with me about alt right stuff at all but they just assume I'm on the fence right that must mean that I'm all right it's like no you stupid that you're spouting at you thought these things I've been doing this for legitimately more than half my life I'm 35 and I start around 17 and I started writing a syndicated column at that point and winter 17 you think a lot of dumb stuff and then surely get older and you educate yourself and you spend a lot of time reading a lot of time studying hopefully you have some cogent arguments after 20 years of doing anything but it did the demonization is pretty astonishing knew we had Anton Andrew Yang he's the only Democratic candidate has agreed to go on but I do we did a full hour on Ubi a perfectly nice it was perfectly coherent and and and conciliatory and get people will suggest that everything I do is about destroying people on the other side because of all the Ben Shapiro destroys videos and certain groups of people were that's their stick they're like their goons right they just go after people online for attention yes this is a stick this is not you and this is what bothers me so much and I know that you said some things in the past like particular about Arabs and like when you were a younger man that you said I should have said that that's exactly right was a tweet that was part of a tweet thread which are specifically contrasting Israel and Hamas leadership and saying that the Israeli government likes to build leadership would prefer that their citizens live in sewage and bumping but that was a bad we obviously my entire history on Muslim relations is 1A I supported the ability of ilhan Omar to wear hijab on the on the floor opposed president finally proposed Muslim ban in the last three weeks I've had on Moschino eyes I've had on contact Med I had on yesterday before Muslim like he's our conversations that have to be had but to take this is one thing that bugs me so much and I actually go through all this look it up this time and look up all the things that I think I've done wrong and I apologize for something I'll say no more. I'm fine with your contacts but I hope that people try to do this is the problem you're not doing with honest people when people try to categorize you is all right or they're they're trying to put you into this category of Internet goon there quote tweet just taking some little tiny Praise You said seven years ago and trying to save this is you this is you now it's so that's such a disingenuous thing to do I hate it and I hate it across the aisle by the way you want to get rid of this person I've heard this person you're going to bring up something from 10 years ago and they're going to try and Club them into submission with it because if you actually ask them their opinion about it they might have a more nuanced view on what they said maybe they apologized and they maybe they think I don't remember saying that I felt the same way by the way I really do about about the stuff I said the same thing about the governor of Virginia who is excoriated for having this terrible racist photo on his yearbook page back in medical school in 1987 this is evidence of his career and he ended up doing what everyone now does which is you just don't apologize for anything you just trying to pass it off as a nothing is actually getting worse because are you say I apologize I was wrong and what why did you do in the first place because you're a bad person apologies are not accepted and then number two is you Brazen it out you do the Trump you know I never did anything wrong ever I've never been perfect to come around you and then nothing ever get the clan opportunity number three is Barack Obama did witches you come out preemptively and you try to remember all the bad stuff you do okay so you did cocaine when he was in high school that's that's cool what is it comes out during the campaign problem the problem is right now even if you preemptively come out and say I did something wrong like for example Liam Neeson talkin about years ago when he had a racist thought that he didn't act on us. This is now we're going to try and ruin your career for something that you admit was bad that you did 30 years ago we're going to try and run you over that if you apologize for something to eat at 30 years ago what you would have preferred I forgotten cuz his embarrassing and stupid then we say you're bad until all you're left with is like the most Shameless people in the world who are in the public space at the incentive structure is to be deeply Shameless to just stay and the culture of of going after people for things CNN finding anything to categorize them as someone who's a viable Target this is what I've seen thrust your way it's like there's nothing wrong with being conservative there's something wrong with wanting everyone to think the way you think though this is the difference like you will you wait what I like that you do is you debate your points you state your positions you have a philosophy and what I don't like is when people try to pretend that that philosophy is some some somehow hateful or somehow regressive or something that you condemn people for their thoughts you just you don't this is what I did not want to see with you I appreciate that and I appreciate the accuracy I think that's true I mean I've come out against virtually every Twitter ban including people who have personally targeted me I've come out against that have come out against virtually every what are your thoughts about this idea of deplatforming and you know this is something that we were just discussing before the podcast where the CEO of YouTube and carrots Kara Swisher they were talking about removing you from YouTube and I thought it was the CEO of YouTube it was actually Carro said I would if I could now being doxxed meaning just thinks differently from the down the line Democratic party platform you're not like them aligned with Hillary in order to make evidence-based point about discrimination and disparity and this makes him an enemy of people like Ezra Klein inbox.com say that your feet are for white supremacy right that they can't actually get you on what you say you know some members of your audience do things that that are really bad is it going dude I have 1 million two people were members of my own and have 5 million Facebook followers I've 2 million on some of those people are going to be crazy video switch what is a normal Jamie like a normal video that we get how many comments to get 10,000 pedophiles who are watching videos of children doing things and they were commenting stuff in the gymnastics commenting in the end like communicating with each other through the comments and it was sort of discovered that there was this connection that they were doing this and many many videos and YouTube rightly Panic they look really should have stopped this so the response I guess was we just have to make people responsible for their comments so is that all yeah good idea through it all right on one side of the aisle to take an example of congressional baseball shooting happened a couple of years ago guy happens to be a Bernie fan is that Bernie Sanders is false in a couple years ago guy happens to be a Bernie fan is that Bernie Sanders this fall.</div>

But it's the Chiefs Kansas City Chiefs are like what other Native American names has been a ton of them right still around I don't know the status of nem you know as far as NFL International Teams Syracuse Syracuse University had a derogatory mascot that they changed some years back because of the tribes they're there now in the state of New York fought for that turn orange orange visiting to Royals and a Ford Focus could run from the energy in the charged particles in the air what sing did like 15 miles an hour on a flat Test Track Running on are charged particles in the air has a charged particles as the entire 15 miles an hour could be a real speed wow around for the sniffing around and see this trippy scientist guy in his lab coat in this s***** little booth was like 6 by 10 ft booth and you know how to show where people like 200 by 60 foot the development for rail cars for semis for cars like an on and on and on as I get the biggest problem is stopping it once it gets going because the Troy deal structure meant that the compression cycle from you know 12 to 2 of that first cylinder was such that when the combustion occurred and it propelled the next piston into the next combustion cycle and kept going so getting that power out of the simple crank was a challenge and then how to stop the damn thing was like the bigger challenge did run on like horse piss ionic charge particles diesel gas at the spark plugs and I have to try to reach out to him website going to look at the Night Before Dawn that gobbled up 5 years later another Kick-Ass 2 a man was he a bitter man so I can never again cuz they bought it and they shelled it I'm never selling anything again f*** them I'm licensing to specific channels of application and that's it his new product so what do you think happened if your conspiracy theorist you think someone bought him out and just bought a small independent business owner real real estate deepest part of like sound like it's calling Mommy group so it's like a connection of online of all these mommies and unlike all over LA and what they do is they post people post s*** they need so like one of the moms just had two kids they don't have any wet wipes and so then all the other moms and then maybe transcend money for a second and figure out ways to set up in their Community like what do you need what do I have and then start some form of like trade or just giving people you know there was someone he set up a toilet paper Exchange old people who say they're Dickie to ship mad at you no it's not it's not good but I'm saying we can get a positive out of this through the people that make it through we can get a positive out of this in the positive is communities important to really important and it seems like it wasn't important cuz it seems like everything set up so you didn't have to engage with people it's not the right way to do it it's not good for anybody now that kind of life is not good in the Detachment that we had me that's why why do you think people have road rage on the highway you know when they are blocked in a little box separated from people in a way that they believe but they wouldn't have it in person it was just a piece of metal and glass separating from these people visit the other added factor of the heightened senses because of driving fast. I got to make quick movements so dumb things people do for elevated and turn even the more dumb yeah because of the world the beach because the sonars messing up their ability to communicate with each other it's like there's this kind of technological sonar that is completely made of disconnected from the earth essentially like our Earth connection has been replaced by a technological connectnow technology having exactly the same thing you have witches they want to be happy you know she's feeling the connection between people when you're with someone I know I don't know if you ever done that but just like the next time you're around anybody that you're like buying ship from or that you don't normally just kind of go by feel like that cannot even feel it there's an energetic connection that you can feel their that's easy to overlook the week is another good example start Sunday in the evening and ends Friday in the afternoon and you give out hours of sleep on Wednesday that's it it's horrendous to go through and it's pretty entertaining as an instructor cuz you can totally f*** with the students cuz they're off their rocker by Tuesday afternoon but almost all of the attrition occurs from Sunday night until I'd say Tuesday morning and beyond that you're probably going to make it through cuz you've invested so much but device that I was given when I went through was don't look at hell week as a 5-day pipeline just make it to your next meal they have to feed you every 6 hours so if stack 6 hours on 6 hours and 6 hours and just focus on getting to the next meal doesn't matter how much I'm in pain doesn't matter how cold am I can just get to the next meal or get a reprieve a mental reset and I can continue on that's that in combination with some you know the mental toughness is how you approach and set your goals and then resilience in my definition of resilience would be the ability to get bent and come back stronger than you were before how you do that is by bending yourself as often as possible which you do all the time by running Sprints or you don't mean that you're doing that stuff you're mentally tough because of that and if you can apply that resilience to approaching setting an approaching your goals from digestible perspectives you can accomplish insane amount so that's really what I mean it's a physical test or just testing the mind can the individual ignore the big and focus on the small can you do the stuff that you need to do and not get overwhelmed regardless if your exhausted hungry cold and it is it's not a complex training program that there's the ocean there's the beach there's some telephone poles or some boats and then later on WE introduce scuba gear and towards the tail end of it that you know some Demolition and pistol and rifle hungry cold it is it's not a complex training program that there's the ocean there's the beach there's some telephone poles or some boats and then later on WE introduce scuba gear and towards the tail end of it that you know some Demolition and pistol and rifle</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> no I was listening to a podcast I didn't know that you were involved in the rescue of Jessica Lynch it was the second target that we hit and the first invasion of Iraq that's crazy it was an odd series of events you know we went over there I had just finished the selection process for the East Coast command and they actually there are the best way to describe it there are multiple squadrons inside of that command that's what they're all have the same skillset but you need multiple so want to be unemployment while another one is training and the other one is resting you want to get into a mental rotation cycle so at the end of selection acts number of people get partitioned off each one of those and it takes time to get up to speed because the selection tactics in the way that you trainer they're good but you get better as you were working with the guys have more experience specifically The Real World experience and so they pulled us out of selection about a month early and see over to augment the Karzai detail in Afghanistan at the very tail end I mean nothing happened with a skating you know you're determined to that point and it's one of the worst missions because you can't is very reactive security detail stuff you can't really do anything until somebody else does something so you already behind the power curve to my least favorite Mission said I think but we came back from that and then the until started kicking off for Iraq and they sent it over to Saudi Arabia and we were there for probably somewhere between seven to ten days that's where I watch Bush give the speech no snob Hussain has any was 24 hours to comply or turn himself in whatever it was and we had already taken a look at we knew before going over there that there were two or three objectives that we were going to look at we had already basically planned missions that we were going to do while we're in Virginia Beach we were planning for stuff and Iraq's we continue the planning in Saudi Arabia in the number one hit was the number one chembio Target in Iraq so to do that you have to get all the s*** on this is called mopp gear mission-oriented protective posture so I can chemical chembio suit gas mask which compounds a lot of stuff you have all your normal shift on anyway like those guys carrying quickie saws in a hazmat suit with a gas mask on breathing through a blower on their back over working the blower and it's amazing how close to Suffocation of actually come inside of a gas mask it's the worst feeling ever but that you're sucking so hard for hair that the math is like stink bugs you're not supposed to be physically exerting yourself while you wearing that thing there's a there's a canister on the side how much weight do you carry it around in those days was probably bodyweight + 8200 lb and it turned down after that because the actual amount of real-world experience at that time was low and a drastically increased so you like you know I think I need the pocket and then you would need it for months so I need to get rid of this goddamn pocket because it carries sweat and oh yeah there's gear that I wore towards the end was substantially different than the you that I Ward towards the beginning I trimmed I mean I think I probably had 10 magazines on me like that first started I think the last appointment they do cherry 441 in the gun and no pistol things changed over time but the ability to move cuz then I would need less food and I would need less water not actually be mobile but on this target so is it for our helicopter ride in we're sitting there we have all of our mop your own but not our masks and we're doing a mid-air Refuel on a C-130 so yet a 47cc know the big double propeller Sobe the rotor blades on top of helicopter they're hooked up next to a C-130 in-flight refueling missile goes underneath the C-130 is like see you boys later bombs out and it like the C-130 bailed when the but so you're just sitting there waiting for 3 and 1/2 you know 3 and 3/4 hours in about 10 minutes out you start getting your gas mask and stuff long to get a stuff that drape and you know night vision goggles to repair your field of view sucks Terrible's weird which is why you've noticed when people who are actually using them they will all constantly have movement in their head because they're increasing their field of view and up and down and that's when you can Orient them to a good offset to your I now imagine putting a gas mask in between your eye and the lens of the night vision goggle figure taken already limited field of view and putting it into a so distraught the first combat Target I've ever been on so and you're 18 years 2525 you still going to graduate and then you know continue on and I was in like a third or fourth 47 that went in so you finally get all of your stuff on you know you have a blower on your back so there's ways that you can help the canister if you just have the canister on your mask it's a lot like breathing through a few straws shove in your mouth if you maintain a loan of heart rate and you're totally chill you're fine but as your heart rate goes up in your demand you know for oxygen goes up your really limited so they have no you can put on your back the blower to battery power blower that will basically push air into the mask and it gives you I would say more buffer space it's like almost like a positive pressure and if you're not doing much is actually really nice it's just Jammin Eridan face and it works well unless you put your weapon swing over the top of that to which is exactly what I did it was terrible so we come in number one can buy or Target in Iraq and we had looked at it from the perspective of like air conditioning specialists and when the owl from Architects to what we could encounter on the ground Potential Threat satellite imagery of historical stuff and we get there and by the time I even got on the ground there was already a firefight going on the helicopter that I was in head 27 rounds come to the helicopter not a single person with her guys are like reaching out to like scratch their ass and like around come through and dismiss everybody Jesus Christ the door gunner standing next to me got shot right in the head in about a minute out that was my first exposure to combat just over and helicopter lands and you go and by the time I got to the front door of that structure I was probably as close to being unconscious do this fixation is I often m coming down and instantaneously we could tell that it was agricultural school like the intelligence was so horribly and Incredibly off when I came to that I just ripped my mask off at some point I would have rather died from whatever horrendous disease could have been in there then suffocate and then you know we cleared through it and I knocked my night vision goggles off with a sledgehammer and go back to the shitshow so we get back from that the next morning we wake up and remember having a cup of coffee with a buddy of mine has like a man I don't think we're going to get out of this if things keep going like they did last night and shortly after that a few days after that we got word that Jessica had been captured so we forward staged and went up to Nigeria and the information that we had going into the hospital is that it was a FedEx hotbed like 50 to 500 people was the expected amount of resistance so we can have and we can fit 27 people in the helicopter so that's what we launched in the back of our head and force me to meet any resistance inside of the structure and it actually was kind of business-as-usual looking back like there was nothing exciting about that Target whatsoever people in the modern-day if they were to action that Target now with the experience if they have that you wouldn't even register on the radar Scopes amount of the little little amount of resistance that was encountered outside of the discs would be another day at the office of that and then there was a lot of dispute about that was accurate there was a member she actually tell you cleared up a lot of it she was not responsible for a lot of the things that were said because he was deep into the repatriation process into I mean her she's f***** up to this day when I sat down I thought I could sit across the table she had never sat down and talked to somebody who was there it was when did you meet her I went out again it was one of the earlier episodes I told my side of the story and we were able to like Salem gaps and we sat across the table just like this and she still wears a brace she came and gave me a huge hug and I didn't know what to expect them to her physically but my understanding the vast majority of her injuries came from when her Humvee wrecked I do not believe she was buckled her strapped in so she got just pounded and she would not treated well you know it's guys are going to get the same mind you're going to get raped if you're a male or a female really oh yeah for sure and he captured oh yeah for sure if you're male or female you're not going to have a good go of it for sure and again I'm not an exact expert on what happened specifically with her but from my understanding she experienced that as well as medical issues but when we she was in bad shape when we pulled her out of the hospital for sure but then so then I remember there were two people with us that were carrying video cameras and there was a little bit of footage that was taken from that like when she was in the hospital bed in the hospital and a lot the rest of it was from the cameras on the helicopters and some of the sensors overhead but the narrative from that not a word was said by anybody that was there actually getting that objective or from her and I think my hypothesis is you know we were month into that wore a lot of that war was based on we need to go rid this country in this dictator of there wmds we hadn't found any from PR perspective wise it wasn't probably going as well as they wanted it to do and they wanted to have a PR Victory but this stuff that was said the stuff that made the news all this stuff that got blown out of proportion none of that came from the people that were actually there all the layers on top of it I remember I remember some of the first sports they were saying that she was going to be the first female Medal of Honor recipient that she had fought until she had her you know she expanded her last round and then was finally overtaken and you talked to her and she or she never even loaded weapon or weapons Jam Chichi never said that she fought and then I remember people talking about you never said any of that I mean it takes time understand the details of what happened she was not in a headspace to give a debrief you know she was literally being flown probably did Germany for her first round of countless surgeries and she's going to need to spend time with a therapist and a counselor I would assume she what I'm saying before but they're going to let you know they're going to do it robust medical treatment and that's really not the time to dive into the details of her exact actions and we left the next morning and flew into Baghdad like 3 days later like it was just another day on the job off and running it was cool because it was the first rescue uspw since World War II and so the rescue of her was she was rescued from the hospital and so they had abused her and then taking her to a hospital I get a little grainy on the details of what happened in between the wreck in only picked her up because there are conflicting narratives there are there are I know what the correct word would be stories or there are reports they attempted to put her into an ambulance and bring her back to US forces but at the same time the fedayeen were using ambulances is basically military fighting Vehicles so they said that when they try to do that the ambulance was shot at which makes sense if there was a a trend of people using an ambulance as a military vehicle that would make sense and they would get turned around so they might have tried to bring her back you know that hospital was being used as a setting staging point because there I mean they're not dumb people they understand we're not going to likely bomb hospitals or relay structures so use them to their military Advantage Wow Wow in this is your second your second real how crazy that mean that story was a giant story in the media about the war and people trying to sort out what was true versus what was the you know the publicity narrative I would say on average take 90% of what you that story was a giant story in the media about the war and people trying to sort out what was true versus what was the you know the publicity narrative I would say on average take 90% of what you hear off the top 90%</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> seems like that's one of those things are once you get through and once you get through buds once you get through hell week once you get through all the difficult physical tasks and it you actually become a seal how many people maintain that sort of Goggins Jocko level of discipline and keep training constantly and how many people do the bare minimum it's hard to say there are people who slip what are the requirements once you once you've gone through all that s*** is very few when I was in in 2013 though I left last day of June to 2013 so if it is changed since then I don't know nothing about it but you know the Navy it obviously it's a Navy SEAL to you're governed by the United States Navy they make you do a PRT of physical Readiness test which is running pull-ups push-ups sit-ups and a swim I think because we're seals and your wife could meet the standards my eleven-year-old daughter could probably meet they're not crazy I'm saying to the bar if you trip over the bar at that point like you know your hamstrings not work her it just you suck but there are varying levels there are people who are very like the individuals that you're talking about and then there are others that will let it slip and I slip a percentage Point overtime and there's some you know obese disgustingly overweight seals not many bring in between so it's hard for me to give you like exact numbers on that I would say more guys Trend towards the Jocko Goggins realm because it's a very self-critique and community in most ways it's like working inside of a piranha tank and if there's a drop of blood there just delete you now we're very hard on each other for sure how much how many of them are involved in martial arts gym hard to say because I know it has drastically changed since I was in the amount of so I was before I sat down with Henry Gracie yesterday we were just talking about a lot about his interaction with law enforcement and how they got started and it was with the Rodney King riots actually didn't know that but that's when they started interfacing with law enforcement he had his dad the generation before him they started sitting on a panel you know talking about I think it's actually combatives with the hand on hand type stuff with it yes but that's where it started it's grown since then when I went through. I don't remember much discussion of martial arts at all there was Prisoner handling or you know detaining people and cutting them to terminating point would be to get their hands behind their back and flex cuff that we didn't use metal handcuffs way to use tie ties you know just cuz that you can put a lot you can slide him in your gear and just easily snatch on them but I think that it has drastically changed I have been in and I think a lot of that that was driven by individuals I mean I'm sure you see it I mean I feel so stupid being late to the game to Jiu-Jitsu and I know that it is definitely want to say invading all of those communities but it might be a good term inspecting it's just it's there's a Groundswell from guys we're learning on their own so it's increasing but it was not prevalent when I was in unless you were an individual practitioner doing it on your own or had a buddy that would do with you I would have assumed that it would have been a core part of training like from the beginning just to build character and to understand what happens if you do lose your gun if you are in a situation where you don't have a weapon well there's not a lot of situations in real life that you can point back to from my community where that has happened and quite frankly ego gets into the way and you'll hear guys say things like well what do I need to bro I do need to go Hands-On with anybody this is what I got right here best really just ego and what ends up happening is I was talking with him about this yesterday and I have a much better understanding of it now you can elicit actions from people if you don't know what you're doing if you do have to go Hands-On and you're trying to detain somebody but you're asking about how much I weigh right I want to hear I had so I'm that usually would float somewhere between 2:05 to 2:15 when I was in so add 80 to 90 pounds on top of that and now I'm kneeling on your back understand weight distribution I don't understand leverage I don't understand the way that the joints move that well and you're trying to comply but I'm applying so much weight to you that it's forcing you towards a fight or flight situation and you can you can increase the deadly deadliness of these situations unintentionally and get yourself into a position where you might have to take somebody's life but I didn't deserve it was actually your fault because you drove them to that point because you were not judiciously applying the pressure that you needed to see that with police when you watch videos get cops trying to detain suspects and then they lose control situation and it's purely because they don't have an understanding of how to control person a running of tools I had a ton of empathy for law enforcement if you're out on the streets and you have verbal commands than a taser and maybe a pepper sprays in there somewhere I don't even know if they still use that but then your next resources at gun and you rapidly go through all those options I other situations occur and I'm not trying to justify them in any way whatsoever but I understand what happens when you reached the limits of your tools and you're left with what you think is a life-threatening situation breaking down what goes wrong with the police when they're trying to detain someone admitted often times two and three on one and they wind up getting killed there's there's videos of guys having a suspect on the ground and the suspect is not trained in martial arts but unfortunately the cops aren't either and they're doing this things in hitting this person and trying to control me then the guy gets out gets to his car pulls out a gun and kills them and I've watched a video like that recently so the guy who got me into can get to the sheriff and I actually just the only reason I started it because I wanted him to shut up I had known him for like a year so we're my house drunk downstairs at the bar and he was like you know we're standing there drinking you try to play me like a standing head and arm pretty like this is how I would choke you is like if you start right now you'll never top music for stripe white belt at the time that it will be out shortly after he got pulled into and started Jiu-Jitsu because of Buddy at his attitude in your life or death fight where I live up in Kalispell Sheriff's Department on shift and a response time of 20 to 30 minutes in possible for sure so this guy goes out he's in the fight for his life and like two feet of snow in the winter time and I think that's a f****** problem right if you need to call for backup if they have procedures like I guess if you check in and then we're certain. Of time like me don't people start moving their car on the right direction start coming to you if you don't check in a long what time you know the lights and siren come on so other people came he was okay and he just got his brown belt not too long as a Savage what at so what happened to him obviously I wasn't there but it was he pulled somebody over for a particular reason I don't know what it was and this is an interesting thing to that I've come to understand better developing friendships with law enforcement you know they they come up to a car and they are just they're doing a stop and it's another touchpoint for their day but somebody in a car might be in the back of their mind thinking oh my God I have a misdemeanor or felony I might be going to prison for the rest of my life so two very different headspaces as they converge in this instance I believe it a pistol that was in between the driver seat and the little center console individual win for it somehow they came out of the car and it just became a scuffle at that point and they fought until other cops arrived and they squeak dog piled on the person and ended it and it was over I believe they were at that for like 10 to 15 minutes cheese and for people who don't understand how hard it is to go that hard for 10 or 15 minutes I mean f*** if they weren't in shape and that guy was that would have been deaf so he sound Jiu-Jitsu he just got his he's awesome but he started my buddy who made that comment and then I have started they'll do defensive tactics. I've helped him out twice while just go and I'll be a role player I'll just lay there on the ground and put my hands on my chest and I have to try to cost me and it's an eye-opening experience I mean I've been at this for 18 months I'll be the first to tell you I don't know s*** I'm at the point now where I'm starting to realize how little I actually know people about now correct yeah and it's it it's like a foreign language like I can kind of see a little bit of the alphabet but don't even think for a second that I'm trying to put together words yet let alone sentences and so I'll go in and I did I was a role player for two of those and pressing I saw some of the same stuff where you can elicit responses for people like I was I was resisting but not a crazy amount and the amount of pressure that they started like applying to me grabbing fingers and pulling my fingers back it it almost to me I like I wanted to ramp it up just like anybody else would solder without that skill or without that tool in their tool belt if you run out of options and its they mean they have a dangerous job back it it almost to me I like I wanted to ramp it up just like anybody else would so there without that skill or without that tool in their tool belt you run out of options and its they mean they have a dangerous job at it as it is</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you have a hot take on this handy what's your hot take by get text messages from people saying you know give me the inside scoop as to what's happening and what I should do yeah and I don't have a good answer I have the same information sources that everybody else does my concern is protect people that are sick and people that are old my concern is that these decisions are being done by politicians and that they they want to do this so that they can be elected Cambria election that they don't want people to be upset at them for not acting and so they're making these decisions and they're not showing us exactly how they're going to get out of this like when you shutting down Los Angeles for a month did just staggering amount of people that are going to be in debt and then there's some number that we looked it up recently of the amount of people that live check to check it's crazy it's like half of America I saw I was that they cannot absorb an expense outside of the normal over $400 that's gone that's already gone so already most Americans are fuct now just with this dip and then they're talking about extending this to April 19th I just don't I don't know if they have a plan I don't know how they're going to buy their way out of this like what do you do how do you how do you help those folks I mean I'm the wrong person to ask about that but I would I would hope at least at the politician I'm sure there's an aspect always if you are a politician in the back of your mind I have to conduct myself in a way where I can get reelected like everything is probably viewed through that but I would hope at least that they're viewing it through the humanity perspective and as far as the decisions are making I don't think anybody knows what to do so they're doing something we all need to look at Idris Elba cuz that guy looks f****** great he does he's got it he's got it and he seems fine Tom Hanks he says he just kind of tired it's I can't make heads or tails of it because if you go the longer you spend on your phone I think the more or your computer I think the more confused you actually become because I don't know but to be honest who's telling the truth and who is not their stories of people saying hey I tested positive for this I don't have any symptoms hey I live in Italy three people are dead in my hallway and I got sick and I don't feel that good and then you watch people walking around in zombie apocalypse suits with you know mopp level 4 gear on not listening to you know how they look on the beach yesterday and you know the people that huge social problems that I want to be near each other and from what I can tell from what I'm reading it again it's so heads or tails you know what you basically have to be caught on her Snead's owner touches surface that one of these infected people touched word close proximity and the people on the beach walking around and hazmat suits it's a wild time because of that because there's no clear information because you sing some people look really healthy and then you seen the stories that come out of Italy Italy is Italy has one of the oldest populations they they have a lot of old people and a s*** ton of smokers those two factors a huge here because this is a respiratory disease. They also have in comparison to the rest of the world more Generations living in a single household yes I would imagine is going to be you know as there's those Generations move on you're going to have high-risk people living with people who are low-risk but mine are transmitting it crazy just got back from Disneyland how like the fact they put that he just got back from Disneyland's it's all heart string pulling stuff but then if you go deep into the story this this young man just got over a testicular cancer he had bronchitis and he had asthma so there's a lot going on that had the deck stacked against the deck stacked against immune-compromised for sure because of coming off of the testicular cancer and then I but that with asthma and bronchitis and then he gets a respiratory disease those are the people that really have to worry and I really wish there was a clear way to help them other than shutting down everything for a month I was talking to Evan Hafer this morning called out of the blue and we were having kind of a conversation about this and he brought something up that just about the you know the narrative and it to me what's happening right now is is it's interesting from a cup prospectus for one I traveled in World enough and seen people living in a variety of different living conditions that right now in my opinion at least people are getting a glimpse into what it is like to live in the non first world where when maybe even have a grocery store but if you do that you can't get everything that you want and you can't travel all you know when you always want to know you don't have the freedom of movement that you want a lot of people live their life take the virus out of the equation a lot of people live life day today and situations just like this or much worse so I think it's should be eye-opening hopefully for people that there's a thin margin between the old Xs and luxury that we have in the first world and how fast that can be removed we can start stepping down that staircase and it shows to me you know I try to view the videos you see online of people fist fighting for a toilet paper I think those are the anomaly not try not to let you in we paint the norm I don't think most people are doing that but there are people that are doing that and they're people who are going in and they're hoarding and buying it and I don't think the toilet papers are good example I can give you 15 different ways to wipe your ass without toilet paper like you're going to be okay like it do you have a garden hose maybe we can start there I'm not even as the most yeah the clothes yeah what do you want to hit me and I have had many make it cleaner I didn't really check I don't have too much time but I've had many days where I started with two socks and ended with one I've had t-shirts that became tank tops I mean there's options that you have none of those I'm recommending for anybody but what I'm saying is the toilet paper we're talking about right before we went on when people get drunk couple of the layers of their protective like this is who I want to portray myself as you and what I see are people who are super concerned about me and far less concerned about we and the conversation I was having with Devin was you know it'd be great if we were talking about you know the people who are going to get crushed and I'm not an expert by any stretch of the ones already talked about a living paycheck-to-paycheck elderly who are in the high-risk category there on Social Security fixed-income and they can't even go out right now because they don't feel comfortable getting groceries at people going to get destroyed and I would love to have a conversation about a social construct or relationship that we have where we start talking about you know what we going to do to get food and Aid to these people what am I going to do to come together and help everybody out so that assholes and Target hoarding toilet paper to me a lot of that is driven by and a lot of is driven by Panic and believe me I'm not an expert at all probably on anything in my life but one thing that I have some experience in his surviving and thriving and high-risk situations that are high stress which is kind of what's going on right now is a different type of stress in the most dangerous thing you can do is lose control your emotions or let your emotions take over your decision-making cycle which is what I see people doing and it's it's so dangerous and I think we need to start finding ways to back away from that and start talking about the we greater than me I don't think there's a toilet there's a shortage of people with common sense we're buying too much toilet paper which is freaking other people out so they're buying too much stuff which they don't actually be which is freaking up an automated system affect a fear Kaskade it's not good it's not good it's all so this is the first time we as a nation have been tested like this with it with a crisis where the country had to shut down without any experience in it so we don't know what to expect what I hope is it it gives me a little bit of flashes is the right after 9:11 because we have had time for the country shut down but was very very brief but I remember like the solidarity after 9/11 it was all about we and you had about me and I hope that it trends that direction because who knows when this is going to end I mean my kids are out of school I think for the year per day at school what is Artie you know they're actually doing a really good job, these locations you can get free meals that's assuming the kid has a way to get there because Montana's scalable write a million people in the entire State the states f****** massive it's not out of control California's 40 million f****** people in this in one spot it's so Preposterous and there's so much poverty there's so many people that were barely hanging on as it is and now they're off the cliff and they don't know what to do and there's no real protection set in place now to keep them from being evicted in leave you know I don't like unscrupulous landlords people have been looking for a reason to get released people in the first place f*** man who knows who know who knows what's going to go on what's real confusing it's real confusing and it be seen the stats like the Jamie maybe put this up on the screen because it's kind of it's it's it's really kind of crazy that this is the choice that they've made to shut everything down right now got to we got here Thursday so a day before they made that decision and the decision was made last night and went into effect in exactly the same amount of people are still out I mean there's no real law I mean it was more of a recommendation than anything but they do have to close businesses will I think they're helping the people do buy into a social contract like maybe we can care about the we over me but I just you see people not doing that one it was more of a recommendation than anything but they do have to close businesses will I think they're hoping that people do buy into a social contract like maybe we can care about the we over me but I just you see people not doing that when they're pressed and that and that gets rough</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I'm pretty good thing about a month ago actually on the mats I was climbing on a guy's back was a good lesson for me to I was sleep over the top I got both of my hands involved and he rolled and snap my head into the mat and I didn't have a Chase planted and I didn't again I don't have s*** so I'm learning is a mistake that I haven't made since then but hooks in and was kind of just getting too involved in that traffic moving in the same thing the headache for a few days afterwards wild when they they try to get out of things not that's a particularly dangerous move when someone's on your back and you decided it's kind of a dick head move really what would have been okay if I had at least one post but like I said I was I wasn't thinking about that was me standing that he turned aliens turtled ending is tricky as f*** because they can just throw themselves backwards and on concrete or that's a game over it's a death sentence mean you're bi LG thought about that afterwards because you will see people who know I'm here because I want to learn to protect myself in the street and if I had done that on the street and had my head cracked on concrete and I have been waking up in the hospital or not at all you got to kick their legs out in those situations if you have someone's back and you're standing you got to you got to mean that the options that exist that don't exist in Jiu-Jitsu one of them is you kick their f****** legs out if you have someone's back you know you actually kick their leg you don't just just jump on them with the hooks in on concrete it's just too dangerous before you get to that position you you want to yank them and do something trip them do something to to get rid of their base but someone is strong that's so dangerous cuz someone is carry on their back and just throw themselves backwards me to hardwood floor anything or even against a building or a car to the ground or standing Guillotine front position so that's another one that's really f****** dangerous man with Guillotines I say guy shoots in with for a takedown and a guy grabs a guillotine pulls back and in this guy's head is the host of the wrong OK a guy on Team Alpha Male on Urijah Faber's team when it became paralyzed for life that way yeah in training in training shooting for the takedown and the guy gets 18 and they all all their weight together falls on this guy's head and his neck compresses in his neck breaks and he loses his his ability to move the rest of his life that's a common one in fact it's not common but it's happened multiple times and I'm aware of any imagine on the street you know someone tries to take you down on the street and you elevate and go into a guillotine position they fall down and slam if I can head first in your crack it open probably too yeah it's just there's so many I mean one thing that is a good criticism about you Jitsu is the lack of takedowns and that is a a real fact in any sort of real-world situation the hope is if you're in a bar or something like that there's a scramble most things wind up on the ground that's true until you deal with a skilled opponent and if you deal with a skilled opponent who has takedown defense and then you're stuck in the situation we're all right now you're in a realm where you're a white belt and this guy's a black belt like if someone is a problem wrestler who can strike a terrible position to be in and we saw that with a lot of in the early UFC a lot of Jiu-Jitsu black belts just didn't have takedowns and then they would get involved the wrestler would easily stuff their take down and the rest was a better Striker and those guys got f***** up yet imagine. It's not good I mean the only thing a lot of guys did their back and try to pull guard and try to entice a guy into coming to their back and then they would kick off their back like those Hixson use those those tactics when he fought punakaiki by kicking out his knee hyperextending is Nephi School rugged yeah that's a common common technique you know a guy standing over you and your on your back posting up you hyperextend Disney it's just like Jude always the best at my opinion for someone who's wearing clothes you know I think every Jiu-Jitsu guy would really greatly benefit from having a good comprehensive knowledge of of Judo how deep would you go to a good thing to learn magic. Fresno Kaiser so freaky chimp strong some of the freakiest champ strong guys ever roll with what you do people cuz you know players mad they're just all everything is to constantly this they're constantly grabbing it. Everything is a human body explosive moving like sandbag training with another 200 pound person all the time or or larger women like Ronda Rousey strong that woman is freakishly strong because she her whole body was designed to you know throw bodies around through a human body made it's like weightlifting right like when are you ever weight lifting your whole body well maybe if you're squatting or maybe your bench pressing if you accept was drunk or deadlifting advisable to do that with her whole body and your whole body weight is way more difficult to control cuz it's moving and resisting and if it's no try picking up a dead body or person who's out cold it's f****** hard you going to a person your wiggle I had to pick up a dude is 195 lb and I'll pick him up and he's out cold that's hard that person also resisting you know it's like they're some of the freakiest strongest people in the world just sit down when I start with you do people that really work with you and whose technique oriented not someone who just wants you to spot all the time cuz things that happened with Jude a lot when people are just getting involved in that there is a lot of scrambling on the feet that could put your legs in a compromised position weenie blows out how much your time watching the UFC how many of the takedowns UCR Judah based it's not that often but some guys are really good at it and the guys that are really good at it comes up you know there's there's there's some guys back when Karo parisyan was fighting Caro was a great judo player who is it in the early earlier days the successful UFC was one of the better Judo guys and he would hit he would hit hip tosses and all kinds of different judo throws all the time and Rhonda of course you would do it all the time too but with Rhonda that was basically the only way she would take you down with with like upper body grab should grab shoot her moves like to grab with grab the head and then take people down with that Andy and Yu's Judo but it does happen it but it only happened you know what happens with Sky grass shoot her moves like to grab with grab the head and then take people down with that in the end used you do but it does happen it but it only happened you know what happens with skilled players but it wouldn't when it does happen it's like it's a it's a big surprise often times like whoa</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the numbers right to hospitalizations Intensive Care Unit admission case-by-case fatality percentage is reported for covid-19 by 18 covid-19 by age group so this is up until March 16th which is a couple days ago so 0 2 1923 cases 1.6 to 2.5 or hospitalized 0 ICU zerofatality so then you get 2244 that's U7 five cases 14.3 to 20.8 hospitalizations 224 ICU and 0.1 20.2 case-fatality you got to think those people pre-existing conditions just looking at those numbers 45 to 54 that's my age group 429 cases less for some weird reason 21 to 28 hospitalization 5.4 to 10.4 Isis 1.4 to 2.6 fatality again you got to thank those people pre-existing conditions and it gets all the way up to really old let's go to 85 + is Callens age that's count 844 Hospital 144 cases 31 out of 144 270 hospitals HR 31.3 to 7.3 hospitalization 62209 ICU fatalities 10 to 20 the vast majority of fatalities you looking at people between 75 and 84 which is 4.3 to 10.5 and then 85 + which is 10.4 to 20 7.3 so it's obviously not good for really old people it looks like you got a 25% fatality rate at the worst case scenario for hospitalized people that have the case but again for young healthy people it's not what it's being it's not it's not the big monster that everybody thinks it is I mean there's a people running around terrified that are young and healthy well then there's no concern is older folks Spectrum to their is the young people running around terrified and healthy and then there's the people who are mobbing beaches in Florida on spring break saying inaccurate but I would imagine the number because of the lack of testing but there's percentages are probably still the same you know I think there's probably bigger numbers yeah but kids are just going to be kids man you get 18 year olds on the beach in Florida there they're not worried about catching the covid-19 that is their brains aren't even form yet yeah my nine-year-old says they have monkey brains I'll try to explain to the 90 what are the development of the frontal lobe is and I'm like you know cuz you were just talking about I like I talk to my kids like their kids but also talk to them like they're adults I do the same thing that I I lay things out and then I explained so I lay things out like Adelaide to an adult and then I'm like your frontal lobe the part of your brain that makes the decisions and it's not fully developed you're 25 years old until you see the little nine-year-old brain spinning I go it's not really ready yet she said she's like so it's like squishy brain I go exactly 9 year old Dracula explain to my wife and then her and I had this little conversation about squishy brain and I'm like this is this with the frontal lobe is this is like when you see people that are young they're doing stupid things not even necessarily that they're stupid they're just acting it is there wild you know they're there their free their parents probably tell him what to do too much the school tells me what to do much their job tell them what to do too much and then they're out and have a couple f****** Miller High Life by the way we seen the coronavirus song yet Depot so that I so want to see it I want you to Jamie we can play it yeah I might have washed it fiber that's okay you're right but the gentleman who who made it these guys them at one of them reached out to me f***** up Reggie Baybee be2 and then there's a f****** Reggie Baybee e to_that's a fake account those comments and also I accidentally tagged the fake account at first but now I got the real f****** hoaxer who's pretending to be him the fake one is the one that has the underscore afternoon to those pieces of s*** that's the real dude Reggie baby about her mom you know which we should be and I'm concerned about my parents as well you know and more concerned that people are freaking out and it you know there's a lot of people around that have never been tested and they're not good under stress and this is a this is a very unusual stress because there's no clear answer not from the president not from the the doctors is not no one has a real clear answer of how to fix this when it can be fixed and when you hear things about like a vaccine will be available in 18 months it what will and if you continue reading that says if it is available in 18 months that would be three times faster than normal wow so that would be on the very front Leading Edge it would be possible to get in people's hands normal would be 3x that in osterholm who died was on the podcast really sparked a lot of people to take this very seriously there's excellent podcast by the way and that we are far too flippant about how we and if it's not there right in our face they don't allocate resources towards those kind of things I think are society's got a defined by its success and luxury yeah and when you live in that environment and I'm not saying it negatively at all but if you live in that environment if you never leave that environment if you don't bend yourself before the world ends of a little bit shift going to come off the rails when you get pressed itself I mean I have no over if I get the virus in how that plays itself out and I cannot control that but I can control my behavior and how I act and try to exude calm like when it comes to my kids are my family my friends and my Social Circle but yeah I wish I wish I hope that people on the other side of this because it's not going to be the end of the world but I hope on the other side gives them in it a greater understanding and appreciation in perspective of what we have how lucky we are and then just maybe to think about people what's the obesity rate in the US right now at 40% instead of allowing that access and you know luxury to Define you know how about that something you can control people in my experience to spend a lot of time energy and effort focusing on things that take not control and that is definitely one thing that I learned from my old job is that at some point you have to surrender the emotional and mental horsepower on the things that you can't control it only focus on the things that you can which is specifically yourself that you can't control what happens to you but you can control how you receive what happens to you and being scared allowing that to make the decision making process for you is what gets people in substantial trouble job sexy it can be quite terrifying and the number one rule of firefight if you get into a gunfight is to win but the first thing you need to do is you need to shoot back with overwhelming Firepower superiority and then you have to maneuver might have to pin your enemy in place when you have to maneuver but let's say that you get ambushed when you're on the receiving end of that and so you take any behind a wall and bullets are snapping over your head and you don't want to move because you're scared and you think I'm going to die so you have fear of death which is totally real and it can paralyzed people and instead of moving you sit there and other people maneuver around you that fear of death preventing you from doing the things that you had control over shooting back maneuvering coordinating with your team that fear paralyzes you and external circumstances with the Enemy that you're fighting maneuver around you and then they're going to end up killing it with the reason you didn't move is he allowed that emotion to take over your decision-making process you have to detach the two chocolate talks about it a lot and it's just reinforced consoling in training and in operations overseas and I'll be like that's if people ask what should I do when my biggest thing is just try to remain as objective as possible you see people freaking out that doesn't mean that you need to freak out and you don't know the way I've had it described me that made up a big influence on me in the way I think about things if you think about two circles like an archery target there's only two circles or the Bullet entering which is super small and then where are you when I need you with the big ring I guess it goes 10 9 8 out whatever the lowest scoring ring is that'll be the other ones you get two circles and the big circle is your circle of concern and the small circle is your circle of influence I see and the dangerous thing that I see often does people spending all their time with their energy and effort on the circle of concern what's going on in the stock market what's going on on Fox News what's going on on CNN Sharon back-and-forth things on but they're probably him have them aren't even true anyway no research put into it is there going to be enough toilet paper what do I do about this they don't have control over any of those things but that's the stuff that they're worried about and the only thing that you should spend your time energy and effort working on other things directly inside of your circle of influence and even decided that one there could be the circle of control and what do you have control over at all times the things that come out of your mouth how you behave whether or not you allow your emotions override your decision making process the way that you can whether or not you decide to work out as opposed to shoving 4000 excess calories in your face every single day you focus on those things and put your time energy and effort in there you're going to get through stressful situations just fine because you actually have more mental capacity because you're trimming off of the things you can't control the thing about things you can't control those some people or their they're thinking that this is one of those things that if you were a paranoid person and you Captain worried about the future you would have already stockpiled enough food and toilet paper and ammo and all these different things so that you were ready for this where his people they were just concentrating on day-to-day life didn't act didn't think a balance between I mean is it reasonable for everybody to have 5 years of food at their house stockpiled enough food and toilet paper and ammo and all these different things so that you were ready for this where his people that were just concentrating on day-to-day life didn't act didn't think a balance between I mean is it reasonable for everybody to have 5 years of food at their house</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you're a sociopath and then they're out there they are out there a few I went to I went through bus with a sociopath leaving on her man with my buds class is still in jail for chopping people up and then disposing of their bodies with his wife back from at least once and might have had multiple times but they would go to bars find a couple continue the after party afterwards elicit an argument some type of exchange they killed I believe as a man and woman chop them up he used to work at a grocery store chain so he knew the day the very cyclical removing of the garbage cans are they got 10% of the landfill more often so we dispose of the body bodies in multiple restore garbage dumpsters and then they eventually got caught because in the middle of the night they broke into a Hooters to steal t-shirts and got caught by the cops and I believe it was in her purse they found a Spyderco knife with like hair and like basically tissues still on the knife I think the woman's ID high-level criminal it really thought this one through yeah of course you will. Why the f*** are you breaking into Hooters screens your knife you dirty b**** but again so this is a sociopath's out there and in this is another thing that I try to tell people off in the best people that I ever was around my entire life was in The Shield community and my mortal enemies in the worst people I've ever seen on the face of the Earth was in the seal Community as well he was the honor man in my bud class which if I look back if he had he had passed more Evolutions from a statistical perspective than anybody else in the class they weren't Act viewing him through the lens of is this person honorable or does he know they weren't grading and by his Integrity but it just goes to show you that no selection process is perfect and if you can't separate an individual from an occupation or a uniform or a black belt right if you think that because you have a black belt that you're going to be an awesome person or because somebody to seal that are going to be a great person stand f***** by and it's not the norm but I'm not I'm not I don't want him as the anomaly to paint the norm but it's important for people to remember that those people are out there and again they can leverage from my back when they can leverage the fascination curiosity people wanted to give back your most common questions that I get from people as you know how can I thank people for their service and we both a just say thank you and then am I answer them as be as you know provide him an opportunity if you feel it's necessary but don't allow them don't do anything for them and don't give them any special treatment make him earn it because then you can get a true look at the individual as opposed to perhaps just a shiny object but you were focusing on before so treat them as an individual thank them but treat them as if it is as an individual and judge them based on the merits of their behavior and there were one-hundred-percent not real thin there it's their background if you have a job you know you okay I want to provide opportunities for veterans no problem provide the opportunities for veterans but treat them exactly like the person who is in the cubicle next to him if it's in that environment obviously if you hold the person that was a non veteran to a certain Stan you better hold it back into the same standard don't let him get away with anything because it doesn't help them either you know it it it helps everybody in the organization if you set the standard and make sure everybody hold it it's Insidious to an organization to set a standard and why is this guy get special treatment seal and if that person is sociopathic or they are you know there's a bell curve there's a top 10% in the the top in the bottom 10% of his net bottom 10% by holding to that standard you're going to get an objective Viewpoint of that as opposed to just being blinded by whatever baby it's interesting but only you can say that or someone in your position can say that it's very difficult for someone is a non veteran to say anything remotely close to that will help they listen then because they don't need to say that they just need to if they needed to live that they need to structure their organization with that framework so its objective not subjective dislike people look at being a CEO it's not a Harry Potter wand I have probably at familiarity and comfort with weapons and tactics more than your average person but if I'm being completely honest about my old job I could teach a monkey to do most of the things that I did I'm serious I could teach a monkey to do the things that we did is not we're not out there doing you're out there doing you know we find an individual how are we going to get there okay let's figure it out when you get there the standards we get on target everything is based on tactics and standard operating procedures are ttp's tactics techniques and procedures and everybody is trained of those standards so you know what to expect from somebody whether they're from the East Coast team or a West Coast team you can meet in the middle and we are taught to clear rooms the same way and it's just it's it's not complicated actually the blade of make us less effective and efficient would be to make it complicated the simpler that you can make it. that makes sense I mean it makes but it's also the mind of a seal like the type of person that can get through buds that's that's complicated that's complicated than just being able to control your mind you know one of the things that you said in one of the more times you talked about it was someone who's able to keep their world small Utah small exit people that applies to what's happening right now too so what you're talking about you know buds is a physical test actually I would say haven't gone back as an instructor which I learned much more about the process applying the curriculum as opposed to going through it because as a student you just like her as an instructor I can look at the entire curriculum in the story arc of where you start on day one and the product you're going to get at the end it's a physical test but we're using the body to test the mind we're stressing the body we're going to make you tired hungry hypothermic we're going to get you so exhausted the point that you're going to hallucinate and we're going to take a look at how you behave do you value we over me know one of the first things they do in buds your explain the concept of the swim buddy and you don't get to go anywhere farther than 6 feet away from another human being for that 6-month time. that is the opposite of most people's mentality and you can test it really on you yell at him you said hey you got 30 seconds to go to run out to the ocean and get wet and in the first few days they just take off and they start running because they forgot about this one but either me Centric and so you bring them back and you punish them the individual that made that choice and then also this one buddy you know to reinforce that people there are consequences to other people from your behaviors and after about two weeks you really can't separate people from their swing by so it's a and then it should have been getting point where you can instill this philosophy of we is greater than me just one of the most beautiful things I think from the seal Community if you talk to people or my experience has been as in talking to people in their most dire moments where things are getting the worst are often more concerned about the people to their left and right than they are about themself my biggest fear probably I know it was in the seal Community but to this day is that I am not going to be there when somebody needs me why was my biggest fear in the seal community that I was live up to the standard of the people to the left and right held at me and that they were going to suffer for it I was more concerned about letting them down to myself getting hurt or killed and that starts with that ethos from SEAL training but it's not a complicated course we're stressing the body to stress the mind and if you look at the people who make it through so when I went back as an instructor as a student when you're going through training if somebody next to you quit so you never see them again but there's no hey dude what the f*** are you doing like they're just gone can you continue on with your day because you just want to graduate program as an instructor you can talk to those people and you can ask really important questions my favorite question is why you said you this was your lifelong goal this is all you've ever wanted to do you left a D1 scholarship to come here because you saw no for yourself no value in higher education and he wanted to come to the zoo with me didn't you quit why time and time and time again and try would get from the students as they got over with so they were doing the opposite of keeping their world small cuz there's two ways you can look at Bud's its 180 days long and then plus or minus one or two or you can look at it as a sunrise and a sunset hundred eighty times so you can look at pie and go oh my God I have to eat this whole thing where you can look at a slice and eat the slice and not worry about the rest of the slices and keep doing that and doing that until the training process is complete hell week is another good example of start Sunday in the evening and ends Friday in the Community about 2 hours of sleep on Wednesday that's it it's horrendous to go through and it's pretty entertaining as an instructor cuz you can totally f*** with the students cuz they're off their rocker by Tuesday afternoon but almost all of the attrition occurs from Sunday night until I'd say Tuesday morning and beyond that you're probably going to make it through cuz you've invested so much but the advice that I was given when I went through was don't look at how weak as a 5-day pipeline just make it to your next meal they have to feed you ever so if I can stack 6 hours on 6 hours and 6 hours and just focus on getting to the next meal doesn't matter how much I'm in pain doesn't matter how cold am if I can just get to the next meal or get a reprieve a mental reset and I can continue on that's that in combination with some you know the mental toughness is how you approach and set your goals and then resilience in my definition of resilience will be the ability to get bent and come back when you were before the way you do that is by bending yourself as often as possible which you do all the time by running Sprints or you don't mean that you're doing that stuff you're mentally tough because of that and if you can apply that resilience to approaching setting an approaching your goals from digestible perspectives you can accomplish insane amount so that's really what I mean it's a physical test or just testing the mind can the individual ignore the big and focus on the small can you do the step that you need to do and knock it over regardless if you're tired exhausted hungry cold and that's really all it is it's not a complex training program that there's the ocean there's the beach there's some telephone poles are some boats and then later on WE introduce scuba gear and towards the tail end of it that you know some Demolition and pistol and rifle how many days can you stay awake for where it becomes dangerous to your health I don't know it's dangerous for their health in hell week is there's a huge safety Network for them you don't see it as a student because you're so just task saturated there are MD's walking around all over the place that people constantly know we're checking the temperature of the water will take core body temperature is on the students were keeping a very good eye and we're bothering them because by about Wednesday they're brain-dead I don't know how long you can stay awake without suffering from severe physical consequences of sleep in the whole week on the wall at the bus compound it pays to be a winner and the inverse of that is incredibly true it does not pay to be a loser in the seal community in for clarity loser as anything other than first place in the community that I came from the podium has one platform not the great so if you win you might get 15 minutes off of work hammering the s*** out of the rest of class Bud's hell week boat crew race MLB students running with boats on their heads and people get bald spots from it and what do you race is like a take that boat that's supposed to be in the ocean and you're going to run with on your head as a crew of seven people three people on each side and the leader in the back and the end of four miles will be done with this boat crew will break and then losing boat cruise will get remediated for my yep there you got that neck on that front right guy this later on in life will do long ones and small but still probably 150 200 pounds and then go out past the flip the boat over for no reason other than it's difficult and forces him to get wet right the boat come back in continue the race but you might get you know 15 minutes while we're meeting in the class and we know what's going to happen at 15 minutes you see people sleeping standing up you see people space down and hi-lift track in the sand sleeping they're sitting there sleeping and it's kind of just a reward he just leave me alone for 15 minutes ocean wow five days of that and it took about people in that you learn a lot and you see people push to the point where do you care about me over week and we get rid of the people who cannot prioritize we over me arrogance comes out you see the light in the the leadership as well you know the students are largely the Same by from a physiological perspective there's ones that are faster Runners and promote contractile potential like stamina or a cardiorespiratory endurance but most of them are the same percent difference between the students but these little PODS of 7 people some of them can work together and they're just crushing it in other ones you'll see the other whores in the boat so when they run their stuff on the top and you'll see he'll be out paddling and then do the see a sword fight start with people knocking each other's heads off with oars do suppressed is a human being like from all the physical tools that we have that the real person comes out and sometimes boat cruise will just hit Jake Tapper snail hate that person so much because of their they might be selfish or arrogant or they're not pulling their weight and they will just harp on that person or beat the s*** out of person eventually they'll end up quitting now when they do get in a swordfight what do you do do you kick them out if they get in sword fight should you let them sort it out. now when they do get in a swordfight what do you do do you kick them out if they get in sword fight so you let them sort it out I'm 11 sort it out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's one of the things like you really have to get into those valleys to appreciate to really hit those Peaks I think that's what's going on right now as you're saying that I'm thinking about like literally what's happening in this country and I hope that you know we get to the point where we see the sun and we do it but then we have to also not forget I think you're 100% right I think we have a really really easy in this country what you were saying about this is the reality of third world countries or places where me and you're under a military dictatorship can't get food you can't travel wherever you want to you don't have the freedom to move about whenever you want to and we're in a weird situation here today in California they put this lock down on everybody we're supposedly until April 19th you can't have a gathering more than 10 people and you're all essential businesses are supposed to be closed like a f****** good luck with that Goodluck Goodluck Goodluck with a whole month of work is crazy stuck with me that I use as like a lens of context from overseas news from Afghanistan I was in a sniper OverWatch position and I was watching a little one side of the valley there's a unit on the other side of the valley and there was a village in between and I watched an individual come out in the morning to the only water source in the valley small stream and watch him just take a s*** in the water and then the day another person came out and downstream of that took a bath in the water and later on in the day a woman came out with two kids and got their drinking water Downstream from both of those things and went back to their house and it's like okay we have it really really good really really really really good in that Village there was probably a light bulb why did you take a s*** in the river yeah I mean that's the thing about people that's the willingness to do something that you know is going to negatively impact others but you don't care because in the moment it's good for you when you see someone throwing a cigarette out the window of the car that's a perfect example that they don't want that cigarette in their car so they just saw somebody else will handle it but if you see enough of those things are in that it reframes the way that you look at what people complain about and about that day very often because it in that short period of time it's just like why don't ever really have that much to complain about what's going to go on right now for the next few months I would guess maybe the rest of yours going to be horrendous and I hope that everybody makes it out okay on the other side but the reality is people going to die and it's going to stalk and it's going to destroy families and then the economic destruction will probably be worse than the physical destruction from the death side of the house but we're still going to be okay the end of that and even as if it gets horrendous here we are doing so much better than so many other people on the face of this Earth their daily best is not going to even approach what it's going to look like at our worst as we navigate our way through this my biggest concern is not just the deaths which is a big concern not just the financial crisis which is also a big concern but it's also the government gobbling up freedoms in in exchange for the illusion of safety that's a real concern for a long yeah but it's it's also whenever there's a real crisis there's always an excuse to pass legislation that diminishes our rights made sister it's makes it easier for them makes it easier for them to do what they perceived to be their job only if people are scared it's no because they're finding the seams in people's attention span there instead of being objective they're being emotional and that clouds your vision in a cloud your judgment and when they're not paying attention because they're scared because they're online day looking at people taking pictures of the empty toilet paper aisle in the grocery store other people who might have malicious intent or moving on that men and nobody's paying attention to it yeah that's where a lot of people the more what's the best way to say I'm trying not to use the word retarded conspiratorially minded that don't think very well their first run was accurate people take advantage of moments if that's the difference that's what really happens when there's moments where they pass something like the Patriot Act of the Patriot Act to they do it it's not because they've set this up to the pass that know that use it as an opportunity because they know the people are scared and they use it as an opportunity to further diminish our rights cuz it makes it easier for them to control us and that's over that's a real concern right now it's a real concern right now and it's something people last thing you should be thinking about know it's one of the things you should be thinking about there's many things you should be thinking about right now besides your safety in your house and not spreading a disease and make sure you wash your hands and stay away from old people and maintain social distance all that stuff is important but also recognize what the f*** these career politicians and these is career lawmakers needs career people that are in in charge of controlling Mass groups of people at any laws that help you with any it said help you it makes their job more difficult they have something to be concerned with right now I didn't fear is totally natural I stink if you don't experience fear you might Trend towards the sociopathic side of the spectrum but it's totally natural should be expected but you have a choice and how you receive what is going on and you can allow the sphere to Cloud your judgment and drive your decision-making process for you can can recognize that the fear of something you know fear of death overseas fear of death overseas on what keeps you alive objective analytical thought process in doing the things that need to be done keep you alive regardless of how scared you are or fearful you are that's what keeps you alive it's okay to be scared but just don't let it just don't let it take over and control you</div>

Chomp that's not a good idea but everyone's going to go hey you could have done this the whole time that's right people money can just give people more money and if I'm not saying we should do this but give people more money support their family that's on the right start on fire they know that it's like a bribe to try to keep people from rioting until whatever the f*** is bacon past or giving people a different environment to exist in one that doesn't leave them hostile if you could just get by and then you could pursue other things would that be better for society and that was like what Andrew Yang was suggesting if this whole automation Revolution took place and everything started getting automated and no one had a job anymore. There might be something to that there might be something that now even you know they're the question is like what are what are you happy you're your taxes get used for you know you sure that's almost like you should be able to vote on that like the one thing that we don't get real Direction on right like in terms of like with with the country actually want but if we could all just individually vote on things like that like where's where's my taxes go to education and you know what to do with the rest of the money Murray's how are the salaries of politicians private jets dress rehearsal is a dress rehearsal for people going to become Preppers it is going to be amazing for the toilet paper in the street they're going to they're going to experience a banner year if it got toilet paper stock you riding high right now do you remember that I don't know if you if you had this experience but like I can remember sitting at my computer and pressing the button on Amazon where I wanted to buy something and it's like this isn't available right now it's my birthday bracelet things it didn't like suddenly just realized oh my f****** God how completely week if I become that I got accustomed to pressing this button and people with bring groceries to my house and now they don't now it's like stop and pick up some food always been there it's not there dude I have an instacart delivery today you do cuz we wanted to get stock up on food $200 worth of food guess what I got strawberries hummus and I think we got like I don't know some like eggs that's it send everybody $2,000 a month but what are they going to buy if there's like no food on the shelves like what why you think that was a temporary freak out with people stockpiled stuff and I think as long as food keeps getting delivered on a normal schedule I think that'll normal out so fragile they're so vulnerable like it's an emergency happens and everyone wants to call it once the cell phone system can handle it like it's not like you have a phone and you can call anytime you want and I have a phone I can call anytime I want and everyone in the world is a phone they can call anytime they want know if everybody does that the system is not set up to handle that make phone calls yeah he's not going to get through yeah dude I just heard on NPR that so many people requesting unemployment that it's crashed systems in several States what what happens now when there's no food on the shelves to help them text message thread with Whitney Cummings and Nick Swardson and crystalia were talking about that very thing right now I kind of do it and how to set up a fund and needs to be done for sure you know people that can help should help this is not a normal time does not a time where people are lazy this is a time where the whole world got f***** real quick right now I got to do it and how to set up a fund it needs to be done for sure you know people that can help should help this is not a normal time does not a time where people are lazy this is a time where the whole world got f***** real quick and we're going to have to come together</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but this is a good time for people to recognize the importance of community it's a terrible time for Humanity is a terrible time for us and terrible time for the people that are sick but it's a really good time for us to understand why communities important we live in this illusionary world this provided to us by the culture that we've created where you can just buy things anytime you want you don't need people to come home you watch Netflix you don't engage with anyone to get in your car you barely say hi to anybody at work or detached from each other and this is the only time ever in life we've been detach me to the number being detached by these goddamn Electronics yeah is sneaking up on us yeah electronics and cars which is also you know today it's also a creation of mechanical creation and now more than ever they're driving computers yeah man it's true like trying to watch the worst thing I'd like a Charles Manson Kaczynski and yeah it is who you know it is a little bit like kind of interesting Lee not that is so Imperial or something when you're reading it I like you all over LA and what they do they post people post s*** they need so like one of the moms just had to get if they don't have any wet wipes and so then all the other moms but we've got wet wipes and then right now they're just leaving them on the door so people come and get him so it's like I think the community thing is exactly right I need what do I have and then start some form of like trade or just giving people you know there was someone he set up a toilet paper exchange I don't know where are you then you got to help them and this is you know this is a weird time for us but it's a time for us to reset you know it's not it's not good I'm not saying it's good but I'm saying there's a we can get a positive out of this people that make through the people that make it through we can get a positive out of this in the positive is communities important is really important and it seems like it wasn't important cuz it seems like we had everything set up so you didn't have to engage with people it's not the right way to do it it's not good for anybody now that kind of life is not good in the Detachment that we had me that's why why do you think people have road rage on the highway you know when they're they're blocked in a little box operated from people in a way that they believe but they wouldn't have it in person it was just a piece of metal and glass separating from these people visit the other added factor of the heightened senses because of driving fast you realize you might have to make quick movements so dumb things people do for elevated and her even the more dumb you're you're in these boxes right it's like a weird dream with some weird s*** to each other yeah because of that we're all gummed up in that way it's like something it's like it's like a fungus that grew on the circuitry of society and start to communicate with each other sonar it is completely made us disconnected from the earth essentially like our Earth connection has been replaced by a technological connection of Technology about secondary things compared to your feet touching the ground being around when people when you're with someone I know I don't know if you ever done that but just like the next time you're around anybody that you're like buying ship from or that you don't normally just kind of go by feel like that can that you can feel it there's an energetic connection that you can feel their that's easy to overlook yeah we lost the biggest one which is through light pollution I think every night people were humbled and reminded of the Majesty of the universe when they looked up and saw the infants guy clear night half the infinite Stars just the whole Milky Way you can see the whole thing yeah you know when there's parts of the country where there's plenty of darkness and you could literally see the whole Milky Way and it makes you think like all our ancestors saw this f****** freaky s*** all the time we decided to shut off the greatest art the world has ever known because we want to be able to see better at night the greatest art and art that literally not not just his inspired science and one 2N fueled right but also as as kind of always put people in place always just just understand this is not a backdrops not a tapestry that up there is madness it's forever and you're not protected there's just a thin layer of gas between you and the universe which is infinitely your this tiny little speck of nothingness in this impossible to understand expanse of planets and stars it just goes on forever really forever and one little tiny piece of it and we're being held here with a spin and some are and there's a giant f****** Fireball in the sky to Keep Us Alive it's a million times bigger than it is almost too crazy to put in your cyst on a daily basis so we forget about it all the time it's the one of the most important things about our existence here as it were a part of the universe yeah it's not just at work in you know f****** Sherman Oaks or we're hanging out in Montana nut were right there connected in the universe and it doesn't get brought up in one of the reasons we don't see it we don't f****** freak out if you go to the country camping you f****** freak out you like me nachtmann to see him all it's it's a reset but the changes how you feel about life yeah yeah also seems like a lot of us have forgotten that we're going to die on top of all that I mean looking up at this void filled with stars but the thing you are is a temporary and that to me is I feel so lucky to be washing dishes right now I'm alive I'm healthy as f****** it with a different kind of washing dishes than a week ago when I was able to or two weeks or for the s*** started when I can order anything I f****** wanted off the internet I'm in a different world like this is the world a my house right now I don't know what this s*** is so it's like suddenly these are what you're experiencing is this kind of like what was it say in the Bible that we both loved so much fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and I think you could easily translate that to understanding your place in the universe should produce a kind of positive fear and trembling this doesn't last nothing about this last and right now everyone around the planet is getting a first-hand glimpse of that very truth right and now we know it going to and now we know it hey look this is a this is a terrible thing but relatively speaking compared to supervolcano asteroid impact compared to something solar flare something really crazy that can happen and blow out all the power which is 100% of possibility solar flares are 100% a possibility and four people did not recognize that and it just go through the life it's just because we we we look at life as if what we've experienced while we're alive is the norm but it's not it's not the norm it's just hard for you to recognize that your life is so short you life is so short that when they're measuring all the different catastrophes that have happened over the Earth with her it's proven sites of asteroid impacts are proven sites of volcano eruptions are all these different things that have happened for sure and wiped out millions of people all over the world happen over time span that's too big or head doesn't get in there or had doesn't go with what is 3013 thousand years is just some scratches on some paper in my head my stupid head and I don't know what 13,000 years means I can't I can't do it but 13,000 years ago they think and there's more and more evidence everyday that there was some big impact on Earth and who f****** knows how many of those humans have gone through who knows the scientist believe with what is it it's like 300000 + years we've been this isn't the idea Homosapien that's so short just in the time that the Earth has been here in the four point whatever billion years the earth has been here and that's so short in terms of the almost 14 billion year the known universe has been here all of its Madness every single step along the way is mad but we get stuck and he's little time. We're nothing changes and so we think that this is life so we built all these houses that only can work on electricity how many f****** people have a real fireplace in their house that live in cold places here and banning those now a hundred years Industrial Revolution The Roaring Twenties from from Den to today everyday is so dumb it's especially to say with in terms of the earth natural disasters space anomalies likes things that happened all the dad in the universe we don't know that there isn't something called like a quad treezy and ripple it happens every 16 million years is my name is Ozymandias ruler of rulers King of Kings behold my Works ye Mighty and despair all or remember me for a long time we don't know who you are it's all gone eradicated wiped out and this to me is like one of the really side effects of this thing this technology thing is we've all become completely self-obsessed self-absorbed out there making sure there are profiles are updated making you know what I mean like we have this idea of they were all the only way that we can finally see how connected we are is something motherfuker eats a bat you know what I mean really did have an effect on the programming of human beings in a few beings interacting with technology think we're internet and innocently in Iraq with a non-sentient thing but all the while this technology and you could call take the week we get confused with him to technology is like a digital clock or television or computer it is but it's also like a fishhook right like so that the Sony is innovation so he figured that out and imagine creating an ape that is aware of its environment like this is like the perfect storm but obsessed with itself nose in the back of its head that it's it's temporary but it's it's it's got a finite life-span but lives like it's going to live forever and lives in the moment there's in the moment and want to acquire things I can see who's the number one goal for the you know the uber wealthy or the Uber successful the Jeff Bezos types of characters right or the top of the food chain financially choir sings throes acquiring things which means people to make things which means there's a big consumer as well as as someone who's is making a s*** ton of money right and this also fuels Innovation cuz you have to keep up with these people going to keep giving them bigger and better things every year so it innovation of Technology 150 megapixel camera or Euro loser loser Samsung phone 7 inch screens now everyone's going crazy what is the Gold Coast to make better s*** and the go along the way I like this girl is it's working but you know be even better if we made it so they don't touch each other anymore and week maybe we could come up with a disease we can't shake hands they don't they don't come close or Ryan yeah just keep them a little further apart from each other more interested in the things more interested in the technology more more separate from each other and encourage technology that connects them with each other so through technology you find this human longing for contacted Debra Messing in their life they going to get an emulated version of it but that emulated version of is just going to keep getting better and it's going to keep getting better and it's going to get to a point where it's better than real life way better than real life cuz you like Jumanji you get to be the rock you know you get to be the like a superhero like you could you could live a magical life with no boundaries of physics and that they're going to do that people going to do that they going to give in if I was at a life-form that was trying to haunt another life-form and trick it into giving birth to me that's I would create a person I crave people we play some f****** Aunt we're like some aunt that manufacturing our successors one good thing of something like this anytime a tragedy happens people bond together afterwards it's a terrible thing that it happened but it's for the victims in the family members the victim's we all know this but it can be a good reset for Suriname going to have to get through it that's going to be the most difficult part yeah and I think there's there's going to be an opportunity for us to just assume a nicer stance towards our neighbors and towards our friends and towards our community and instead of embracing this idea like better get guns cuz they're coming maybe we can all come together for whether things are right or wrong in the news we need something to retune ourselves like right now we're tuning the guitar of our identities to these till like the most terrifying which is the news or like what people are saying and so many people become so accustomed to getting their idea what's happening in reality from the TV instead of from like how they feel inside what's going on with her engineer family that puts people incredible disadvantage because their Pond is being rippled by s*** you know I was thinking it's like one of those little prairie dogs Mizzou adorable adorable animals ever I remember when I was growing up in the old days when the news had an alert that was series some serious s*** with you you'll be what the f*** Fox News or any of the news stations to have an alert like every 4 minutes now start danger out here danger out here until we're all like even before this s*** we were huddled up a little bit now we can rationalize the huddling you know and that's what we're doing just huddling inside right now that's an incredibly vulnerable place to be I mean I'm not going to get conspiratorial here but</div>

Just been trying to figure out better ways of stab its neighbor with a spear get that thing and slowly infected with ideas ideas of a new stuff to make and then it goes out and does the work for you and then you take over the Earth the ideas of taking over the Earth just the toys the ideas now if instead of ideas you said demons I mean that's that's literally what people used to think was happening folks and I did terrible think they had bad ideas they acted on those bad ideas and ancient religions thought of those ideas like they were demons like these people were possessed there was a common thought that someone is possessed by demon swarms of idea what does he do look what he's done he's one guy that's probably had more of an impact on our perception of what the future holds in terms of Technology than any other one individual human being that is widely known of like he is a famous human like he is I mean he's doing Tesla which is the most advanced electric cars in the world are insane Denny's doing this f****** Loop thing right the hyper or the boring project was boring was in the hyperloop is doing the boring project making tunnels under LA and Vegas and going to be able to shoot through those tunnels 120 miles an hour jokes and ideas there's no Rhyme or Reason to why the what what they are is an antenna for ideas those ideas come at me like why I'm glad I thought of that and then you go to work on fracking to go to work all kinds of different crazy things that changed the world forever whoever invented Fukushima or that group of people whose ideas all coincided talk people into building a Chantix nuclear furnace you can never shut off how crazy is that that's crazy we have no way to scan human consciousness incoming IDF where was the idea was just floating in the astral plane gradually just shooting towards Hitler's is fueled by an ecosystem and fueled by nutrients right human beings are fueled by plants and fish and animals and vitamins and always everything's well these ideas are fuelled or fueled by insecurity and ego and lust and greed and jealousy and anger virtue in love and prosperity and Comfort Inn and community and all those different components of human consciousness all interactive this idea so the idea becomes like a just hitches a ride and hitches a ride with all these ideas that that already exists in your brain and then with these pre-existing structures like businesses and warehouses and all these different things that we use to make stuff and then ship it out then the idea becomes a thing and then the idea why it's up in the belly of a seagull because it fish whoops sorry your dad who did Seagal you couldn't figure out that's a bottle cap or not a fish and that this is this is how things change they don't just change because the people were blaming ourselves and it is definitely us that's doing the work but it's all coming out of ideas if we thought of ideas is a life force instead of thinking ideas like something you own something you hold even though you deserve credit for your ideas because your discipline to sit down cultivate these ideas accelerate the production of those ideas and exercise has the muscle through which those ideas come through focus and energy he deserve credit for it is not socialist way of looking at it but everybody that has an idea that's really good till tell you it's like it came out of nowhere like every great bit they've ever had a lightbulb goes off and you have the thought and it comes out of nowhere that's like most things that are really cool they kind of come out of nowhere I bet they've ever had a lightbulb goes off and you have the thought and it comes out of nowhere that's like most things that you write that are really cool that kind of came out of nowhere to sit there and then all sudden you think of things there an idea that you're wrestling you just catch him</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's a dress rehearsal for death I mean you're going to that's up to thing is is like that blink if you're an atheist what you do and I think there must be some like deep like a real blow out so I could do accession now I know a couple and those those are the most puzzling to me because the people have done like real blow-out mushroom sessions or blowout DMT sessions I always think that they would lie the door open to The Impossible because it is impossible and you experienced it's not like even if you were imagining it I couldn't imagine that so how am I imagining that I imagine something in such incredible Vivid color and in detail and her and knowledge and love and all these different things you experience in that state that state is otherworldly the fact that that is accessible at all I don't care if it's through a molecule or through a yoga session I don't care how it's accessible the fact that accessible it all leaves open to me the I don't know because I didn't know that that was a thing so once I've experienced out of my all this flat plane of existence that we take for granted that we think this is this is everything around this is the whole environment have to worry about for this might be just one f****** stage on the radio dial of experience right and up of Dimensions that are interacting with us we just don't have the senses to to TuneIn and when you can for me at least it leaves open the door for who the f*** knows who knows man I just the fact that that's a thing there's a okay so this is a trip this is very trippy so I got this book called The Tibetan yoga of dream and sleep when you think you're awake and when you're dreaming and so basically ideas there isn't much of a difference there's like right now you're dreaming this thing you call your human Incarnation is a dream and you know like when people are dying 50s are in the 30s Warehouse whatever their lifetime which means it when you're dying you're going to like spin through time to meaning that this could be you time right now spinning backwards essentially like what it's like to have nobody but still have this like this basically like your karma your identity disorder propelling you through and that's how you like it get your next Incarnation so we're just being run it's like running a simulation of a pandemic or or maybe this is the way that like an AI gets polished like maybe we're an AI That's being like polished and taught through this process of having a limited Incarnation you got to have that he's going to tell you need that to train the thing up so it takes it seriously you have to put the setting on Mortal then you got did maybe you just run a series of tests on the saying you know you start run this what is this what if we made what is it doing a pandemic and buy it I mean the sum total of all humans which is right now disconnected it's like a malfunctioning brain or not connecting did every single moment in an individual's life and in a planet the planets that wife of History could be looked at as a training or an upgrade at this could be an operating system upgrade this could be what an operating system upgrade looks like in the bio-computer that we exist in it looks like a f****** pandemic and that's what's happening right now is we're being like upgraded for some reason even though it's terrifying and obviously horrific you know we're being upgraded and when you anyway the whole point is man this thing that were in right now whether or not there's a God we just by Thinking Atheist gets to lean into the idea that when they close their eyes and breathe their last breath it stops and I just think that's a big gamble man that's I mean actually die when you get really sick you already start waking up into your next life you just wait you just like go through a weird dream like State call the Bardo where you Freak the freak out and then you're suddenly alive and another being completely oblivious to whatever your past incarnations were and not to or in right now so and then you're suddenly alive and another being completely oblivious to whatever your past incarnations were and not to Orion right now so you know I don't know if this is a great time for people to start looking at that in one and preparing for that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> play stories magic what do you mean by that so we write a great book called High magic which is called it's a fantastic book on Magic is really the wrong word for religion that guy send it now cuz of Hollywood is like you know ladies riding around on brooms and ship it it just needs to be used to be like healing women who would like deliver babies and stuff but these are roots and you can follow back this branch of or Egypt ways of connecting with the universe that are ritualistic in nature but see mysterious do us because even though like if you want to see what it looks like just look at a Catholic mass you're looking at a ceremony it's C or G I guess you'd call it that is a magical ceremony where red gets converted into the flash of a God that you eat so that they're all wearing robes magic someone in the Catholic Church might tell you this isn't Magic this is me praying to the infinite and asking for forgiveness that's magic intelligence you're hoping from your connection with the Divine intelligence to produce some change in your own psychology in your own life and maybe create good fortune or whatever it is you're praying for healing whatever it maybe that's my so magic is that and that it's I'm not saying the Catholic Catholicism would necessarily be considered a branch of Magic by one of the things he said this interview is like if the Bible is one of the most powerful magical grimoires there is I mean if you really look in it there's all kinds of bizarre stuff it doesn't seem to make it on the Christian radio why are they saying why do they refer to themselves as a plurality when God stalking it's not like if when they're saying like why do we throw Adam and Eve out of the garden it's we if we don't do something about this they will become like us we there's a plurality that's being mention there and so what is that plurality of angels The Book of Ezekiel hyper dimensional beings I have some data set they want to bring to the world quite often depending on what book you're in it some terrifying prophecy about the end of the world it's coming but sometimes it's you know some message of Hope or some message of healing so you could say magic is a non-Christian oriented method for connecting with those various entities using ritual that's now I'm not saying by the way these beings exist or don't exist but you could say if you wanted to get like a psychological you could say that we have buried inside of us bits archetypes bits of the collective that are buried deep inside of us and that their ways to connect to these little fragments of the collective mind and you know many people know that have their own method for doing that one of them to do that might be doing a ritual and infirm moment allowing yourself to imagine that you're trying to talk to an extradimensional be Aleister Crowley famously did one of these rituals and contacted a but it looks like a grey alien Aleister Crowley's in the 89s overweight girl with large breasts adjusting her halter top look like man let's cut the s*** that's we're going to look like right when you when you see people that are Harry and and and brutish you we think of them as being like closer to prehistoric man right to see a guy covered in hair he looks more like a beast and when we see people that are thinner and some more slender to become more more a gentle version of people and we associate that often times the intelligence we associate associate intelligence with Frailty right we all do that when you see some some Super Genius Guy usually their frail anytime transport yourself from one planet to the other imagine what we've done with our stupid monkey brains now imagine it was 150% larger 150% more brain and then Incorporated all sorts of f****** Electronics to let you interface with space-time around you and all kinds of other wacky ways of communicating we couldn't even possibly imagine now just like people from the 18 hundreds could never possibly imagine cell phone this is the idea is like okay we're going to go there and sit when we get there the way we understand space time is going to be different than the way we understand it now so what that means is theoretically you could connect or communicate with a being that is outside of space-time which is a future version of us right now using like various methods DMT being one of the big ones on the planet right now but also using they're a little bit more precise because of DMT it's kind of like you're not really putting a GPS coordinates necessarily some people do with intention like a shaman will do it like with intention and I can let you know excuse me can you give me another bloody Mary I can stop you always do this she gets drunk says she's leaving I'm a f****** leave you Clarence I'm going to f****** leave you son of a b**** magic is like ridiculous on one level is it absolutely sounds and is on one level on another level is at the very least a creative technique so that you can sort of summon a dream state while you're awake with the intent of causing some change in the world around you using for a lot of people would be considered a non-standard what we'll just in terms of your perception of how you view the world you can alter that pretty radically I mean from someone who has an amazingly positive action versus someone has an amazingly negative perception you look at the results right over overwhelming benefit of being a positive person overwhelming there's something to thoughts and ideas that Propel you in a good way and differ having a good architecture having a good philosophy having a good operating manual for how you view the world and how you act and behave part of that to getting up at 4 in the morning that's what that is you looking forcing your ability to sort of dictate the positive aspects of your future you're deciding to take action in your bond with the with the way you interface with current reality stuck out Christmas God damn if you want to meet me here I'll meet you here we could do some 5 a.m. sessions I mean yeah I would love that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you talk to her at the CDC. f****** interview ever of all the lights we didn't just miss it by like 5 minutes either we missed it by like 20 30 minutes at the airport and it was empty if you've never had a or provigil or Nuvigil isn't a real similar I don't remember which one I stay up all the time no that's what he go crazy that's you can use it for that like if you're a real crazy but like I know some people that use that s*** for writing the right on that chair and they feel like without it they don't feel like I have any energy sleeping for days at a time and go literally insane and somewhere in there they write really good stuff that's what you know Newsradio the Staffing Newsradio these to do that on purpose porcelain Paul Simms brilliant guy the guy who created Newsradio and he thought it would be a good idea to have a writing style fill with a bunch of psychos who were willing to play video games and stay up till 4 in the morning every night and I was like this mad Vagabond crew of writers assembled and they would play video games and just talk s*** and then they would start writing at like 2 a.m. sometimes but they would come up with these amazing script to the end scripture so ridiculous some of them were so ridiculous in this because they were Delirious whenever instead of doing drugs they were doing the drug of Stew staying awake dude this is for me I've disguised started doing this about six months ago or longer regardless of when I went to sleep I was having some insomnia and so I start I realize like s*** I'll just like wake up when I wake up and then wake me up 4 a.m. if you have insomnia that is going to cure your f****** insomnia because when night time rolls around you're exhausted but not only that 4 a.m. is like the great time for writing weird s*** still half-asleep and the stuff you write is it's like really feels like you're tripping you know especially waking up at 4 a.m. and then like eating weed I was doing that so you do eat weed first and then start writing system before the f****** apocalypse was and again I wasn't doing this every day if I did do it first because I got into David Goggins cuz I was at the gym not swear I'll drive you are there that early will know cuz it would open it I got there once before the gym open Savage no I didn't but then I went into the car and I like 30 minutes to blow and I'm f****** Stone man and I'm sitting there in the parking garage the goddamn Hollywood Equinox now let me tell you something man that area of Hollywood is already f****** weird I'm sitting there with my eyes closed kind of tripping feel like I'm half asleep half awake I look over there two dudes creeping up to my car window creeping up there and I'm like what the f*** I'm driving through the parking garage stoned definitely walking up to my car I'm like tripping like what the f*** f*** f*** I'm not going to work out until I leave I'm like what the f*** I'm going to let these two like 4 a.m. weird vampire stop me from working out so I drive back in one of them's like leaning up against a pillar like just staring at me creepy breaking right that's what it look for a m people that are out on meth and they know that this is assholes like to go to the gym and leave their s*** in their car I dare you got there you go it was terrifying but you know 4 to 5 a.m. is the funniest mix of people I'm going to write because that's when like I mean this is a new idea feel free to like that s*** again but like there's a there's an idea of Prana which is like energy in in there's more energy in the morning then there is at night so if you get up at 4 you're getting like that the purest most amount of this s*** so that's why a lot of people meditate it really early why like a lot of monks get up really early is because like it's now it's just a very it's the most psychedelic. I'm way more psychedelic then like midnight exerting some form of control over your life and usually it says go time or something along those lines discipline like my friend Jack always says discipline equals Freedom he gets up every morning for 30 photo of his watch on Instagram and usually says go time or something along those lines</div>

Convection you're being drawn into the Divine mine is it is that happens that s*** that looks like austerity when you're like further away begins to actually just be a natural way that you act you just become naturally more graceful naturally less inclined to do shity things naturally more tuned in with like the hundred fifty year old version of you you know that that he sort of naturally it's naturally more tuned in with like the hundred fifty year old version of you you know that that he sort of naturally and that just happens on its own cuz you were being infected into the Christ sucked into the Omega point the divine</div>

And discipline that you need to know to be able to study and actually Implement their technology so I think he was a genius and he was probably Visionary that way like Elon has he had an extra large magnet for ideas yeah yeah strongman I'm so glad anytime you give me weed I'm always forget how strong it is and every time I got to be careful. I think so yeah absolutely</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> all right this thing Netflix I told him I just called mint it's called The Midnight gospel the midnight gospel with Duncan Trussell in Pendleton Ward the guy who made Adventure do you know that is he was like in the group of kids who got accused of murdering someone in the woods there's a whole know oh yeah there's like a whole documentary about him I think HBO it's like basically executed he's on death row studying Zen Buddhism like Zen priest was working with him to like basically like it you know preparing for his you know soon as he was badly beaten on death row he was almost executed then he was exonerated before we start this does he get do they have to pay him the great question I think maybe part of it that they may not want to say cuz I've no idea well I know a man is going to cost you your life really didn't do it eventually that makes its way to the United States through the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn which was the order that Curly was a member of before you know when off to the Oto you had MacGregor Mathers Dion Fortune the poet WB Yeats all these people were members of the Golden Dawn that's how this current makes its way to the US and that's my last offer all right it taken place out of my minnows mouth but fine forward is send them over really really really cool to get the dick just taking a combination of your podcast and then some interstitial stuff that like that you is like scripted where people use Multiverse simulators to simulate universes so that they go inside and harvested and sell it and so my character has a malfunctioning used Multiverse simulator that isn't really working to produce technology and because it's malfunctioning every single world and it is going through some kind of Apocalypse until my character goes into his simulator and interviews people and they were in the Dying World what can happen if people are going to do podcast people are going to still have conversations so these conversations we just set them in these surreal universes where schitts melting down and you know where like Clancy meets these various people kind of learned from them within crazy as you started this whole long time ago and it's coming to fruition right when the apocalypse hits yeah I mean it's like it it's almost like it's almost like you knew someone like you had a type and then the universe was like this is a perfect time for Duncan s*** to come out and what's inside it I mean look at just look at how bizarre your show is strange and then the fact that it's a hybrid of podcast conversations and then written stuff so strange I think it is a perfect time for it and I hope I could some of the like every guess we was we chose for this they all had this like really like amazing thing to say like echoes in this episode one of the things he says you know I asked him like do you feel like you kind of like we're blessed that you ended up in solitary confinement in this when he's he says like I feel luckier than some Millennials out there right now who are like completely disconnected cuz that's the coolest thing about him as you would expect a person who's been on death row to be bitter sweetest most genuine wonderful person ever and it's like whatever went on in the situation of being on the brink of the Abyss where is about to get murdered by the state somebody didn't do something about that didn't turn him into someone who is like Shell Shocked or angry but like really turned him into like someone very compassionate and I guess grateful for his life you know not to me like it's not bitter after being on death row for something you didn't do and like getting physically assaulted wondering every day if you were going to die if what you can still maintain an attitude of service or contribution to society in some way or another than any of us can any of us can you know like any of his can I think that's from the show end of the world right now especially man cerveza contribution to society in some way or another than any of us can any of us can you know like any of his kin to me that's like I think that's I hope some of that stuff from the show end of the world right now especially man</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I would think that for a guy like you who's building cars away your building on the real challenge would be staff I think that would be the real challenge is finding people to understand what you're doing finding fellow Artisans that also understand how to build cars there really get why you doing that and I love the state of California but they do not want me here now so they don't want me business they don't want anyone in California making anything except maybe solar assisted bicycles a did the business climate in the state of California and the associated HR cost and in insurance and workman's comp and liabilities like every couple weeks there's another absurd ruling that we get an update on that like wait what is like you mean to tell me if I catch a dude smoking crack while on the clock stealing my inventory I can't fire his ass on the spot what if you do you have to give him a pay at the time of letting him go and you can't make him sign anything that indemnifies nor protects you have to put them on probation and offer therapy and resources such as of safety of policy of company good like it has gotten so bad from the building inspector came by and he's like yeah you know those those Automotive lifts in your building and like yeah yeah I have 30 days to remove all those what thank you that was pretty much my response because yeah not my problem what about the last nine years of inspectors coming in all the time so you guys have the cleanest most professional aboveboard shop Kick-Ass well done thank you so much for making my life good because the other idiots on the new inspector so the new inspector says you're not licensed I'm not zoned appropriately to be in business where I'm at despite having permits and everything for did they change the zoning I don't know what the hell happened other than this new guy seems to be a prick and wanting to show his value what's his name actually don't remember but I literally at every turn it's killing me in like I'm a piece of s*** I think at this point to the amount of cost related per employee should be going to my employees not to insurance companies and all this b******* that gets tagged on top it's like for every dollar you pay someone now there's another $0.32 that should be going to them that's going to suck force you to work on these cars oh I can fight or you going to have to have someone I allowed to lawyer up and we're fighting it but I mean literally I honestly think they'd rather have a commercial weed facility in that building kicking out a hell of lot more tax revenue than us really you think that's what they're doing it to make it challenging for you to do business so that you quit yes and just about any small business owner I know in the state of California to challenges were facing or getting to the point of making us wonder about Iran intellect for staying in the state I don't know if you lose this you know if it gets the point that we we have to owe you mean this building situation ring phones and dig through my black book to find people with the clout to get the city to go see what's going on I think so and at first it seemed like you chilled out when we went above them and then everything was good and then a week later bubble back up again we got another notice so we're in the middle of it right now but you went above his head and you got to prove verbal crazy but look at the end of the day the reality is also I'm going against what trade schools are telling young kids that are going into the field what are they telling kids they're telling kids that here if you run the scan tool you'll be you'll make 150 Grand a year as a lead tech at a BMW dealership what they're not telling these kids while sucking other money out of them with crazy you know student loans and stuff is yeah that's like the kids in the street and Brazil all wanting to grow up to be Pele there's not that many Pele so there's plenty of dude that that dealership that are making minimum wage or thereabouts or dealing with the politics of flag hours or whatever but what would I'm having a hard time with his we charge $100 an hour for our labor I can't just keep charging more and more and more its level of what we do with projects that can run thousands of hours per job the math is it almost doesn't make sense like I honestly have guys that I think should be I should be 70 80 90 100 Grand a year to do what they do cuz they're artists and they deserve it the b******* of running a business in California all of the exponential cost there added on top theevandi incentivize overtime if I give a dude overtime it UPS his tax rate and they take even more out of the overtime will his whatever happened like GDP and employment and productivity and like keeping everything rolling their D incentivizing us even to offer our employ more money with more hours it's it's tragic and I have lost several guys now that have gone to do job that they hate but like Department of Water and Power I've lost several employees at DWP cuz though they get a pension that get killer Healthcare they get 90 grand a year to pick their nose and watch other people work sucks what is this is this a Democrat thing I think it might be the ringside of democratic because I am I think they'll do whatever they want to party systems is shitshow is it is anyway I don't think it's about which party so much as I think we've empowered attorneys to such an extent that it it says it's downright sinful because it's hindering industry it's hindering Innovation there's just so many constrictions cuz everyone has their hand out no one's no one's self accountable but everyone is liable I need a policy for that when we had a we had an employee wants to us he jumped in a dumpster to stomp on everything to compress it in the dumpster it started moving across the ramp parking lot and he jumped out of it clipped his leg on the way down and shattered his arm and forth but he sued me is like well it's not in your job description did someone tell you to jump in the dumpster and stomp on it military but it's my problem like what people whatever happened to like be proud of what you do be respected be well-paid everyone's contend everyone's like inspired him engaged and I just feel like more and more there's just so much noise and liars and policies all this crap plus eilers sublets and everything else but it's it's hard to retain people when when we we know we can't pay them what they're worth in this business environment I have a really hard time with the whole crack thing catching someone stealing smoking crack and you can't fire him that seems so strange have to give him a week's worth of money on the spot on the spot I need to be square by doing that but I generally like my back and my little leather studio and sell s*** on Instagram simplify life me and my wife and my dogs dealing with that'll shitshow you want to talk about something that puts everything in perspective you know we really made a stop and sit back and go okay that doesn't f****** matter like a lot of the b******* a lot of the noise in our modern world does not matter doesn't mean f****** thing so that kind of reinvigorated but also refresh my perspective to remind myself if someone's panties are in there not because their eyes been in storage for 6 months and then plug it into the tender in the battery is dead and they want to call and yell at me about it but I really like give me your bank info I'll send you your money back what is a lot of silly people out there for sure but it's just weird when they're empowered by the government when you don't have common-sense approach to Knuckleheads you know if you got a guy smoking crack and stealing things you're not supposed to reward that kind of behavior with a week's paycheck people there for sure but it's just weird when they are empowered by the government do you know when you don't have common-sense approach to Knuckleheads you know if you got a guy smoking crack and stealing things you're not supposed to reward that kind of behavior with a week's paycheck</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> derelict programme and I was like many things to my life started just from a stupid passionate idea like I did never never considered a business model of doing it it was just okay I've got two young kids I've got two Labs I like to do this I like to do that what do I want is my next car and let you know what I'm tired of over restoring s*** cuz that's like the pissing it whatever like I don't do that guy anymore so I think I like to find something that's already f***** up I'm just going to leave it looking all f***** up so I don't even I hate putting gas in it so with the derelicts all you do is clean the windows and vacuumed it a best party on then then I just put a massive gas tank so my old 52 DeSoto station wagon was the first derelict that I build a hundred percent myself nights and weekends just because I had this stupid idea and I wanted I realize it wasn't until it was done and it got back to cover a Hotrod and one of these awards that my dumbass went a different way of doing it pretty wild array of them and have a bunch of your first one was for you in the first place most people who you know high-dollar restoration you know are quote restomods or whatever you want to call them everyone wants them to be beautiful and pristine with you no handles that the disappear you know I mean that everybody wants to shave everything down and a lot of the original character of the design that they're supposed to be celebrating in the first place so that compounded by patina which tells a more personal story of like where's this car been how to get that Ding there's like romance and mystery all wrapped into one as far as the history behind all those finishes, how big is the gas tank on this thing miles to the gallon is a full emissions equipped modern SRT8 Hemi 6.1 and it'll get six builds that is the fastest and most fuel efficient of the Hemi build I've ever done I mean I think it's probably 15 first you were Mopar trannies which Phillip Builders avoid them they suck if you add even like 5 horsepower beyond the stock motor app they completely shut themselves so the third time I'm like that's it I'm done pulled a Band-Aid off throw that thing away and put a good old GM for early 5e in there so this thing has how many miles on it now fun fun ride but you know you going all the way back to the beginning of Icon even further back to the beginning of the first brand TLC they all started with personal cars like the icon idea was just another dumb idea that was rattling in my head was literally keeping me up at night and it got to the point that I need in this happens to me often like what you know what I did my watch and then all the different products that I've designed General start with something that gets to the point that I'll lose my remaining sanity if I don't actually create it inside the concept for Icon I could see it clearly in my head I had like a full-on 3D detailed model in my head and like my version of jumping over Sheeps at night in bed with like sitting there and zooming in on an element and changing that radius and scaling this trying that and it literally got the point YouTube because so many people on YouTube are interested and unique Builds an interesting companies are doing cool things like brev ology but your company particular it's so perfect because you do all those videos and you drive around the cars with this incredible detail and that's one of the first things you got me very attracted to your company was the fact like I go look at this m*********** he's so balls deep into this s*** so contagious though when someone's like really into something particular design and production and I totally agree and then like if you're not totally into it and you're not balls deep into it then pull out and zip up and go home shut up like to know that you do something else if you're not passionate about it you suck at it when someone's like really into something particular design and production and I totally agree and then like if you're not totally into it and you're not balls deep into it then pull out and zip up and go home shut up like to know that you do something else if you're not passionate about it you you suck at it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Just One More Story well-being but they're also speaks to like what the kind of stuff that you do I mean people like things that are crafted by artisans in I mean I love that major seeing that Revival right in the last years is just growing and growing and growing and slope with each other there's something about like when I drive your Bronco first of all I really like you cuz I love the fact that I'm driving Rock and then to I feel like it's a piece of art I feel like you know how I look at it highly functioning sculptures enter send the backseat the noise coming out of that third Point shoulder seat belt retractor is so unacceptable over modern car scanner is hitting your outboard ear and I'm like the whole witch baby at the retractors pulses next time you choose to drive you sit in the backseat let Mom and drive and report back years ago I developed the concept that I called the halios and if you ever saw that so I love like design challenges I like framing things right so I was like all right let's do a revisionist history approach to car design so what if electric cars had remained predominant in the late eighteen hundreds early 1910s what if we had taken inspiration from aircraft design a couple decades prior to when the industry actually did and then what if after he did the experimental plane the H2 I think it was what is Howard Hughes at settingdown and like he couldn't get that last Starlet to to go out with him right before he lost his mind completely what if he Buckminster Fuller and Gordon. Sat down and did a napkin sketch after too many martinis what would that car look like so that was my stupid Paula questions around which I framed my design designed it to work on the at the time and P85 platform and basically they received the copy of a letter that's titled like peanut butter and chocolate that was written by elon's core engineering team begging him to allow them to support me to do the built-in like since day one support we're because there's super shity about any repurpose turkey Shore Drive Teslas and Eli never address to visit major games think honestly I think dude it rich and due to the community that grows up around him that s*** been hacked now now people can open source hack the can data chain and people are repurposing Tesla component like I used Tesla batteries but I've been using their Motors are planetaries everything else cuz again what do I tell my client when the client needs an update or a part you go to the event but yeah like TV in fact has his new setup that they just started marketing where you literally take that IRS a part where the electric motors built-in there's little access to our you pull out a little circuit board you put in another one and voila is there an app that up like crate engines where you know or do you envision to set up where because you know you know that the new Hummers now going to be an electric vehicle which is really interesting and there's going to be a weather electric vehicles are coming out from Volkswagen that are really cheap and I'll buy a bunch of different companies are jumping in Univision there being some sort of a crate engine option for people that night so I do I do and I think there should be now proof in the pudding to this point is that everyone's focusing on the do-it-yourself Market therefore also on the cheapest possible equation which leaves a lot of in my opinion a lot of safety issues completely unaddressed and they can get down so the other issue is there all for ease of installation and conversion everyone's thinking about doing kits that literally re a spud plate in the short shaft to go where the engine used to be put an electric motor to a bellhousing adapter to the stock transmission which is stupid because electric cars going through manual transmissions there's a lot of Scavenging of energy it's bad enough to go through ring and pinion doing a right angle gear displacement of power efficiency and the best TVs in my opinion or transmission list or go through planetary said you know for gear reduction like that the Merc is the to my knowledge of the first for the retrofit TV that you know I'd being the goober that I am like I was like okay we've done a couple of you build but if we're going to keep doing them like and it exists how long do it take for a little bit over four years are infinitely better than had on I'm so proud of the valley retention in my vehicles and I'm proud of our foundation of taking something that in essence a lot of people would think is at the end of its already usable life cycle and upcycling it and breathing you like so it's good to go for decades again but now with Evie stuff is moving so quickly that am I like making iPhones all the sudden sore to years it's totally worthless right is the exponential growth and Improvement it just makes like no one wants an iPhone one so look at you no internal combustion engine development Cycles what I put in today is still relevant in a decade but with with electric it's a whole new space to consider management Electronics they just at PRI and it seemed made a fair bit annoyed about coming with a full array of EV retrofit conversion system so these seem to be the first ones entering the field that are going to offer a comprehensive Suite of products and solutions but then again being that it's part of this industry you know I go girl that dudes at their trade show booth and they're like well it's something we're working on it has all these press releases and all that the kennel. I think I might I trust it will come out but when you see Elon coming out with some like that new Roadster is going to have a 600-mile range that is when things get really interesting that you noted earlier that they were going to make the platform shareable and they're going to make it available to many different manufacturers large and small and I've heard stories like that over the years from you name it from Ferriday was claiming the same thing bulshit cuz now it's it's like I don't want to see vaporware but it's it's so much of that like VC money don't worry will be profitable one day and we're worth a billion multiple of nothing today so Buy in and then it's like so many of these EV startups and retrofit companies come to the scene looking for that elusive the FedEx Fleet contract that everyone thinks going to be easy to get and none of them get it and then they all go belly-up we're not only is the tech moving forward so quickly and not only that but the likes of brown and Lee only do two Tesla it's proven the viability in the market now there's purist and traditionalists and everyone's starting to poke at it and I see exponential more interest so I think you know for the next 5 years or so it's going to be a bit tumultuous but I definitely think it's the future of hot rodding II I imagine within 5 years I imagine half of my client Bilby electric wow that's a big that's a big statement have you seen there's a 68 Porsche 911 that has a Tesla engine in it very interesting when they do stuff like that the old cars but it is so many guys springing up out of the woodwork Nationwide to various levels of price expectation range expectation Etc but I think that's a really it's it's a lovely Community to I've noticed it's much more open than the conventional Automotive Community is about sharing information and suppliers and knowledge and helping one another and it's if there's a really nice camaraderie within that Community there's like movement Motors Austin's doing really nice retrofitz and Evie West has been around forever there really the Granddaddy's on the scene and early GTV Alfa they've done all sorts of different like pretty cool diverse range of platforms and then of course the electric down in Orange County that start out doing dogsnow the bugs in the buses and now 911 and it's like there's such a large and welcoming kind cool community of people in Dead Space easy you know you look for the Tesla superchargers are all over the place to press a button on your screen and it shows you where they are at all navigate you to them when you try to get one of those you can't charge a regular car to Tesla super station can you know and there's different so there's this standard I forget the anacreon week Rich the J blah blah blah connector but there's a standard Municipal connector in the news also the new fast-charge network but it depends on where you live but for example round here it's a joke so like I have a nap when I'm driving that 49 Merc and you know I was speaking at Barrett-Jackson and they're in town for a while I was visiting and then you networked apps and you find it but when we made that one supercharger compatible because the clients can install on in his house and the system otherwise public Tesla charger it has to do a handshake and it says no you may not charge here so you can have it supercharger compatible flick I have one of the wall back there so it would work yes that's my understanding but not a public installation those have to go through a whole handshake protocol getting plates like member in the Gadda on the play so that has the one interface connector and then the other one I machine this unnecessarily groovies for the gas cap under the original fuel door on the Merc and then that's for the other style charger so do you also you can charge it with different ones charger and then there's just two different pigtail adapters you can go either way with it do you anticipate up in the range on that thing do you think that someday you'll swap the battery is out indefinitely I think the reality is any EV project I build I have to not only do I anticipate but like I've lost many client because I'll be super blunt about making managing their expectations that look you're going to spend a lot of money to have the best of the state of the that is available to us but in a year that might all be garbage do you have to understand either you're cool with this moment in time and the range in the performance it is what it is or you're a techie like most guys that are engaging in that and you're going to be hemorrhaging money then coming back every couple years for us to upgrade and evolve as the Sciences of all the electrical Network 202 single-dose Tech 26 pin connectors Aerospace connectors so one day when that powertrain is no longer relevant but your truck still has good platform value unplugged that yank it out and put in the hydrogen or the micro capacitor or whatever the hell is working at the time</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you ever conceived a possibility of coming up with something that removes carbon from the atmosphere giant issue with us right right commissions so definitely I believe negative emissions has to kind of keep the warming in in in check it's a much more difficult problem. if you think of the ocean it's it's fitting that the two dimensional problem it's the plastic on the surface and fortunately it's not even the whole ocean it's kind of concentrating in these accumulation zone so the garbage patch that's twice the size of Texas it's still 1.6 million square kilometers while the ocean is 300% of the ocean atmosphere is three-dimensional so it's just as one-dimensional increases just think it needs to be like oh it's definitely exciting for him to think about I do think that's definitely that's not a good starter problem to to work on no one talked about where they had figured out a way to make these king size Century vacuum cleaners they were going to put in the center of certain cities I believe it was in Asia maybe perhaps China they come up with this and I don't know if they implemented yeah but the idea was to have these enormous things a place that look like a skyscraper and really it was just a huge vacuum cleaner for car but here is one good smart people are are working on that problem not sure where they are in terms of the economics and sit right here this one giant for are the same way of filters for water direct air capture technology carbon engineering 10 years in the making of can capture carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere on what that thing looks like it looks like giant f****** washing machines at right like it's washing the air wow structures and how many buildings are in there you know the people can make some pretty and Saints yet why could they make some giant insane vacuum cleaner for the air that's as big as a city block of course I love it comes down to economics or our system is not very good at evaluating things that are long-term directly benefit ourselves so so definitely people tax it will find a way to make it profitable just another one of what one would look like to capture billion tons of CO2 per year a of fans and then burn it that would be a great business model just be like a green diamond I had a diamond it's actually made and it's all pressured by solar power the solar power to f****** smash it there's many many forms in which carbon exists now so I know they are supposed they are doing that now they are making commercially made diamonds diamonds made of carbon so the form as carbon atoms under a high temperature and pressure they bond together to start growing crystals that's why I Diamond such a hard material because you have each carbon atom participating in four of these very strong covalent bonds that form between carbon atom read that word out loud Colville have you ever heard that word out loud that form between carbon atoms so they know they're doing they're making diamonds with certain machines high pressure if they did that would be hilarious that would be a good thing too because they would put a dent in the actual Diamond strange Market is diamonds aren't nearly as valuable as theirs Abita beers takes these diamonds and they stockpile I'm an alien release a certain amount of them they keep the price very high but Saul engineered the profit League diamonds used to be far more rare than they are now but with the innovation in mining technology and their ability to get to Diamonds they couldn't get to before they have a lot of times it's not as valuable as it appears when you go to buy one so we can make carbon against Alex Darin chainsaw Diamond imagine like if you like a really ecologically minded rapper you wear out all your ice could come from the ocean let everybody know from Trash to Treasure yes dude that the Bucking that's that the signature the company in quotes from Trash to Treasure these things dad bullion diamonds how about that death dude you can be the first guy to do this here we go plastic versus an ocean diamond is crushing the ocean into salty diamonds that's a dope looking Diamond two deposits in a high-pressure high-temperature experiment suggesting that many of Earth diamonds formed when the mantle crushes Ancient seabed Minerals Diamond deposits in a high-pressure high-temperature experiment suggesting that many of Earth diamonds formed when the mantle crushes Ancient seabed Minerals</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I mean if you do get to do this here's another problem okay here's it is a big one for the ocean we are depleting it up Seafood a flight from you know I had how do you say his name again so hilarious right Louis Savoy us who directed The Cove on Den we were talking about the deplenishing deplenishing on the wildlife in the in the ocean and when you start looking at it on a grand scale like how much fish they're pulling out of the ocean to 3 so bring you know maybe you can come up way to replenish fish in the ocean so we can continue eating sushi while you're so of course over the past 200 years Humanity has made tremendous progress since Agricultural Revolution 10,000 years ago UNC has been kind of stagnant no progress or just very very slow progress number of people life span it was all kind of flat nothing really happened and then since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and when we learnt how to utilize science and knowledge Collective knowledge to to turn that into progress every possible metric for Humanity has improved tremendously in if you think of wealth Health violence education rights all these things that I know you that Steven Pinker on the is much more knowledgeable than I am truly at this point in time to be alive today but we have made tremendous progress by one hand measuring think the inventing Technologies and also Eventing institutions and on the other hand to collaborate effectively in large numbers which includes the corporation which is very effective way for people to work together now all that progress has always has also had negative side effects which must pronounce of course in the area of the environment where we put things into an environment that shouldn't be long there and we take too much out of its then nitrogen replenish which includes efficient on the other hand you have the plastic going into the environment Etc so how do we solve that and one hand is to say okay negative way to to phrase about the reactionary approach of saying okay we should consume less of corporations are bad Technologies bad we should all get rid of all those things and everything was great to live in harmony with nature so let's get rid of all this modernity and try and return to that pure original what I however belief that first of all let's I don't think it's a realistic thing people want to keep their iPhones and their cars and people want to move forward and at the same time I don't think it's pretty the most effective way to to solve these problems because it would be like fighting a leopard tank with the bow and arrow don't use that power to also try and solve these these these these problems as well so rather than trying to reject business rejecting on G I truly believe that we should embrace those those forces that make a human and has created this amazing Walt to also try and solve these these negative side effects as well and that's why I believe now the over cuz jumped over cuz I'm sheriff station not going to end by people all becoming vegan but rather through fake Meats I think that's the transport emissions are not going to be solved by people not flying anymore or not going anywhere anymore realistically people are going to fly more so you better event technologies that allow people to do that without harming the environment and the same thing I think it would be the Case 444 for plastic and Sandra Lee other energy uses as well. I think that's very wise way of looking at it and it's the hopeful way of looking at it it's funny that today kind of Haven it though you're you're you're dealing with the statistics and factual information like the fact that is a safer to live today there's less violent crime it's easier to get by this more technology more Innovation medical technology has improved dramatically all these things are true be still have to say it's not what we wanted to be there when I'm not saying the world even though you're don't worry about people barking at you so worried about pee with Bill terrible and parts of the world it's got terrible for the people of color it's still terrible but Transit still no one saying that there's not room for improvement but you have to say that like you even though you felt compelled you like it's still not perfect and I wonder why it's important to learn from the things that we do well and then I don't think it is. Controversial I think it's a trick that I think there's just a lot of people looking for every single opportunity to complain even if someone like you who writes an object Ali done nothing but good you say one thing like I mean Steven Pinker Took a ton of heat were saying that and even though he's talking about actual scientific statistics usual just not saying the world's perfect and everyone should shut up what he's saying is we should look at this you know from a bird's-eye view look down understand it at all though there's much work to be done wearing a great place in comparison to rest of human history and it's it's helpful to realize that progress is possible just that every there's something that's feels intuitively rights as if every step forwards would also have to equal a step backward elsewhere and I don't think that's the case there's plenty of things that you can invent that are not that cycling that we see it for something with with carbon right now that it's countries where Sweden GDP has grown a lot last 20 years carbon emissions has come down so they call that the decoupling and I think once we need the the main challenges in this century is to decouple human progress from from those negative side effects and I think the way to do that is not reactionary it's really again train Ovation and through to collaboration I agree with you and I think that a lot of times people just assume that this is the consequences of innovation if there's a pro and a con and everything because there has been so many things there have been so many things are inventions that were there are pro Anaconda but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be that way if that would be the case all the technology and everything else you would be neutral and I wouldn't it wouldn't matter what your events but it would mean that an atomic bomb is morally as neutral as an ocean cleanup system which I just don't find possible so I don't believe that inventors entrepreneurs they put certain morality into their Creations into their technology there is there is a certain use that you prescribed with the revention when you don't use nuclear bombs to wash your car right away you use it not for benign uses unless maybe you want to terraform Mars switch some people propose to do with Tommy bumps I don't know what this is but cosequin consistently develop net positive Technologies eventually get better and better if say to 60% goods and maybe has 40% downside and okay but then we can invent a solution for that 40% and maybe that's again net positive and you can't get this this Cascade of improving more people thought the way you're thinking I think the world be a better place I like the the positivity I like the optimism and what you're thinking in terms of the particular in terms of what's what's possible with Innovation but I just don't think that being against something is very productive protesting against the things that I don't agree with there so many things I don't agree with but I don't think it's very helpful are then doing that are built towards the future that I do agree with you listen man I think what you're saying is very very logical I wish more people sound like you you're a great role model for a lot of kids to use your energy in a positive direction and if it can be done very very logical I wish more people sound like you you're a great role model for a lot of kids to use your energy in a positive direction and if it can be done</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> apartment the airport when I see like like a drug-sniffing working dog but it's like a yellow lab I'm like Norco yellow lab I don't I don't I don't want to ruin the dog in his chances at retirement you could ruin it cuz I'm like what are they looking for truth but you can only teach a dog to look for one thing you know you can't Trae the Truth the truth guns and Coke residue or like what do you smell like what are you what are you training you do not train the dog smell heroin and mushrooms bring them back right scription drugs like that's more like it ravages of community and I don't think I like airplanes I think like weight being pushed through from other country but I don't know I think it's all things meth is everything it's the really f*****-up part about it is it's almost like we were talking about football that football be safer if there was no helmets it doesn't make sense to be safer if they were friends state-issued if you apply for funding for support you're going to school like alone or the States paying free to go to school you go scholarship you cannot be able to apply for a state-issued prostitute if you are a little socially awkward maybe you haven't had sex because men get weird if they haven't been made privy to the way a woman is or they haven't had sex and going to college let's get you a prostitute let's get you having sex twice a week so you're not afraid of women let's get you a little less weird let's find a prostitute well thank you for didn't have the social stigma behind it there's a lot of people that would choose it over working at Wendy's lot of people to choose what we have an issue with my body that's what's upsetting but it's also if someone is doing that maybe maybe they are a sex slave like maybe there's someone who's I think that's what to do with the puritanical idea of things that they were accusing Robert Kraft of remember Robert Kraft guy who owns the crofter craps crap on the New England Patriots what was that it was that he was participating somehow and sex trafficking and so they were accusing him of that they were that was a big part of what the police were saying what turned out that none of the girls that work there were sex traffickers there just prostitutes and the woman that did it to him she was like 40 years there was a new store where they used a buzzword yes it's very specific in terms of like the difference in the consequences that you would want someone to face whether they just went there to get your dog or they participate in sex slave so that is part of the issue but I do know that if you take away the stigma and you can normalize things very quickly weed is a great example right you could do that and even we've done this with women and bodies in the way that we look at people who are overweight and we look at people with different things like we are getting to a place where it's less of a thing I think it was prostitution look at it as like this is her choice and if there if there wasn't an exception for it any other way except when money is involved that's where I have a problem with it but it's it's it's not even that it's it's a it's a societal position because they don't want their daughter or sister or mother to be a prostitute that's it that's all or them didn't want to be a prostitute that's why they would vote on it but this the only thing that's completely legal to do like not only that but it's what cells are it is f****** selling cologne he sounded I'm a hot man if you if you get my clothes you might get some p**** and looking right at that mouth as many people as she wants for free charges then also like what the fuc when it comes to the idea of a woman taking control of her own body no taxes being paid and the idea of someone being a w**** because of our puritanical roots in this country all those things combined make it a volatile topic but at the end of the day if she's going to make money that's going to go back into your Society that's going to be put to good use of going to be tax is going to be in your community what do you care what she's doing behind closed doors that is safe and it's regulated just like we'd all of a sudden their standards now it was a way to sanitize this I think so and they didn't Australia they didn't Nevada minutes full on there you could do whatever you want they have they have brothels but I think it's also one of the things that we're conditioned to have a perspective on it's similar to the drug issue like I don't want my friends or my daughters or my mother or anyone I know to be a prostitute so we have this like this position on it I also don't want them do Coke but I don't think Coke should be illegal I don't I don't think anybody should do a lock you in a cage cuz you want to get coked up imagine if it were legal how many less people would be dying just in a drug trade yes and how many more people would be aware of how much you can do because you'd get actual Coke what would they aren't companies right if you're going to buy something from the bisco camp bisco sound Coke real coke disco flavored cocaine in Europe the way that they are with alcohol like Italy for example alcoholic freak out when you are able to do something they got to do whatever they want they can watch TV they could drink and smoke pot and f*** and they go crazy for sure. Time and then at the end of that time they can either leave the church forever or come back and most of them come back right because it's all you know also you probably so hungover out play any sports play sports I just don't live across so I made up for an aggression so there's nothing worse than an athlete that's not good but they're very Crosslake hair all over the place and f****** this face one time so hard that I wasn't allowed to sit with my team like what's a shade Beyond a red card like a black Beating Heart would you do hit a girl with a stick with my car good for you and Pat you on the head good girl pretty good so I wasn't really a part of it out of paper cross and high school and I remember to use like tell me I was crazy to fight I don't like what's to stop someone from hitting you with those sticks and what you guys are running into each other man I don't kid yourself, you doing something violent you're just doing something weird pretend are supposed to hit in your passport but boys it's like football with sticks did you like just pick it up like a baseball bat and cracked his chicken head like how you do it over your head and come down that's not okay my nickname was women allowed to be aggressive it's a thing where it's like on sportsday like you know where start deal represent you got dude just running around ripping people's heads off raping Villages and one girl takes her shirt off at a World Cup game Megan Rapinoe doesn't mean it's like wolves scandalous and I just got back from the UFC broke the rules cuz everybody was just swinging at each other would be totally different sport not I was not great and I own that what did you do cuz you just went over your head I probably just came down years ago getting concussions from lacrosse who's like a lot of violence for it and it's not a professional sport because I think it would be an exciting professional rugby should be our football that's what I think I think would be better to the athletes less concussions they had less concussions back when they're playing those little leather helmets and knee pads cuz you just couldn't do what these guys are doing you're just smashing into Smash Head as a battering ram</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you ever feel that it's almost like you're absorbing too much because you are looking at all the problems of all the people and 7 + billion around the world and all these different horrific and justices I try to focus on what I can do and what I can do is is challenge my own government and as American citizen living in this Society I think that the US Empire and the Pentagon is the source of a lot of problems around the world I look at the world as complex I mean you have to understand the issues that are going on especially with foreign policy and terms of the colonized and colonizers the oppressed and oppressors and the u.s. is role as well as other previous Empires role in shaping the world as it is today and a lot of the problems that have Arisen are because directly US foreign policy whether it be the global war on terrorism Weatherby terrorism in general I mean that no drone strikes basically caused terrorism Weatherby the environmental crises the Pentagon is actually the largest polluter World more than 140 countries that essentially every country in the world almost a bigger polluter than the top four chemical companies combined so it all kind of stems back from this notion that you know the US has the world's largest Empire that ever existed and it needs to be stopped to save humanity and so as an American citizen I look at all the problems and I understand that there is like a very common route and I can do something about this, Andrew and if you're looking at domestic the lack of healthcare the lack of Education I mean Martin Luther King called it decades ago he says you know a nation that spends more and more on military spending is facing social death I probably butchered is quote but that's essentially the spiritual death I think is what he said but I mean if that's exactly what's happening is when we're squandering all of our money bolstering up this huge Global Empire we're not taking care of our people at home are brothers and sisters at home my empathy extends as an internationalist all around the world I know I feel for my brothers and sisters in Palestine Yemen everywhere but I can only do what I can do based on what my government is doing and you know it's doing a lot it's doing a lot of horrible things and it's time for us to really acknowledge what those horrible things are because we need to reinvigorate of an anti-war movement in this country and when you're saying that drone strikes create terrorism what you're really saying is it well with people if they do first and drone strikes primarily kill civilians and it's very strange sanitized way of handling an issue where if you had a person and you had some Rambo character you send them overseas you said hey I want you to go get this Isis terrorists and in the process kill everybody the f*** that you see every everybody that's in front of them that person be a war criminal you had a guy and he knew that some Isis guy was in an apartment building so he just started going down men women and children in that apartment building until he got to the terrorist that guy would go to jail but if you do it with a remote control and you launch Hellfire missiles out of a drone and it blows up the apartment building and kills all these innocent people but also gets a terrorist its mission accomplished and it's crazy it's crazy that we're signing off on that it's it's a thing because we're not there where this is weird sort of a adjust a there's a bridge that we're allowed to cross into this really sickening act it's a very stiff when you have anything that's ineffective to the point where most of the people it kills are good people or at least our innocent people should say that's crazy I mean this is not saying that is not terrorism is not a horrible people in Iceland you look I'm a pro military person I think we need military and I think it's just like the same I need we need cops but to deny the cops sometimes are bad is f****** crazy to not deny that sometimes when you allow the military-industrial complex to do things like have drones that launched missiles into wedding parties because you think one of the people might be a terrorist and are often incorrect often to the tune of 90 + percent look at you knows the last 10 years you look at some of these terrorists to have conducted terrorist attacks you look at actually what their intention was in a lot of them the vast majority of literally sight US foreign policy revenge mean every time you kill 98% innocent people whoever survives if you lost your whole family that you have an incredible amount of motivation to get back at whoever did it right and that whoever did it is the United States stop normalizing this and you know militarily speaking Trump actually you know it's not his truck I mean this is a bipartisan effort throughout the entire Congress if there's one thing Congress can agree upon its to make nonviolent DDS efforts against Israel legal and also to just keep ramping up the military and egging on whoever's sitting in the Oval Office to be more militaristic and that's exactly what's happened with Trump in a bizarre way I mean Congress approved to like a 7 on your trillion defense budget and the increase alone in the last year was basically Russia's entire military budget more than Russia's entire military budget that's how much the s**** ramping up and then you have the space force I mean it's just like how far is this going to go to society is collapsing if you looked at the argument against this you would say we need this in order to keep people safe here they'll be the argument against it question would be what are we what threat is there Isis when has Isis ever done anything here other than I mean there was like a truck I mean come on we already know the statistics on terrorism in this country and they're very low right I mean you're if you're basically more likely to die from Mike Furniture falling on you or your apartment yeah yeah and the whole Isis thing I mean set still criminally ongoing I mean Trump announces indefinite extension of the criminal occupation of a rock it's just crazy how normalize this as you know far longer than Vietnam war in Afghanistan fatalities at an all-time high all of these things are a direct result of US foreign policy and look at the refugee crisis look at immigration the Honduras coup all the ships connected and that's what we need to start like expanding our Consciousness and our empathy worldwide to understand all of these things are linked in the struggle is all linked and our world is shrinking really rapidly what candidate speaks in this way like what candidate do you think understands and recognizes all these things that you're talking about I mean Mike gravelle hit the only one who's like we need to end the US Empire Bernie and you'll see my crevalle was he was the guy who the Pentagon papers into record he is a good guy really awesome but I need toll cease speaking a lot about regime change Wars which is extremely important but she still believes in front strike she basically has a little bit of Obama's foreign policy that I don't agree with that fundamental understanding I can't believe that she believes in some sort of just broad-brush use of it I haven't looked into that the nuances of that but I do think that no one is saying I want them to about us Empire about you no scaling back the US Empire and and stopping all of the Civil Society movement because it's not just about invasions anymore it's about you know usurping the Democratic processes of all of these countries like what we've done in Venezuela what we're doing all around the world to try to foment unrest all of this needs to be stopped for sea of time where our dependence on foreign oil is radically reduced to the point where it doesn't judge by these regime-change wars in our dependence on these resources that these people have I mean this is almost every conflict in the world you can boil down to the acquisition of resource protection of capital and that's like what a lot is what a lot of it is now is actually just Capital interest needing to expand and grow and continuing to up and increase the profit structure of these corporations and that's exactly why we've seen Imperials you know kind of go out of control in the way that it has I don't know I mean I thought that we were more independent oil wise I don't think it's good I think that climate change yeah I think that's it hasn't stopped you know it hasn't stopped the imperialist Misadventures of the US government so I think I just need to be a really big shift in Consciousness and then people to stop thinking that it's our right and that we have to know the right and the duty to do this around the world it doesn't the right we don't have it it's not right then it's really not and we need to really reinvigorate the masses here because again Society is collapsing that's pretty f****** obvious bro even if it's not obvious what is obvious is that we're not evolving right in terms of if we're still involved in drone strikes that kill 90% of people if we're still involved regime-change wars were still involved unnecessary military actions against Iran it's these things are people freaking out about this is all the same kind of s*** that people have been fighting against forever that we don't want our brothers and sisters and husbands and wives to die for nonsense we don't want them to die for some people that live in his air-conditioned rooms that are making billions of dollars that are profiting off of the actions of these these people who think that they're doing it to protect America I mean this is the narrative that they're being served this is what they're being told and when they're going to these places they're not going to those places to act as evil as as to as the the boots of some Empire they're going over there because they think they're protecting Freedom they think they're protecting their famine their loved ones back home that's why they're doing it and we're still doing that we're not evolving wanted to go out there they're the ones who are going to the sacrificial Lambs for these defense contractors and that you can argue anymore that this is for freedom I mean how can you what threat does Iran pose we had so it's so tough so I don't I don't know what what benefit would it be for them to start some s*** with us and that is the craziest idea ever. That's like my you know a nine-year-old kid trying to pick a fight with Mike Tyson's f****** doesn't make any sense like what are you trying to do trying to get killed I mean inevitably we're trying to get to the global confrontation with China and Russia I guess I mean that's it's scary to think that we only have a couple independent states left to knock down to be under complete subjugation from the US Military and global capitalism it's pretty nuts won't even if we do move into some sort of some sort of a situation we're in control then we're bigger Target and with the amount of nuclear weapons that are possessed by these countries that were I mean just what North Korea has just this one small f*****-up country could ruin life on Earth just this one country and forget about Russia we could literally annihilate each other right that's a possibility chose to launch an attack if they decided they have a justification to launch an attack then all sudden we're in a real war like a f****** war war people are invading us it's getting knocked down buildings and bombs blow up I mean or devolving capacity to cooperate to innovate and we're stuck we're stuck dehumanizing the other we're stuck with this Mass conditioning to basically perpetuate these these in justices and it's really a shame I mean we have all the information at our fingertips but we still keep reverting back to what's the myths the myths that underpin our society is conversations and what can we do what where does it end where does it go now these are the big questions and then also did what we discussed before it's impossible for anyone to really have a deep nuanced understanding of all these different issues right what we can do wheat you know the heaviness of it all you just have to do what you can do you're doing what you can do you have me on to to help spread awareness about these issues and that will freak out and also just understand your place you known and just extend that you can and just yeah I mean it's it's hard because I don't have the answer all I know is what's needed and what's needed as we need a movement of the masses if not going to come from the top down it's going to come from a Grassroots mobilized effort to try to change these policies that's the only way things have ever changed in the past and I absolutely have hope and optimism that we're going to change things and that we're going to correct this horrible path that were on do you think that the 2020 election can have a real significant impact of any of this and you think that whoever gets into office can really have an effect on the kind of policies that were talking about with the kind of influence of the military-industrial complex of all these lobbyists of Wall Street all about all these like Monsters machines that just pure good old-fashioned democracy can actually step in and and turn the ship away from the Rocks Bernie I really do think that he's won last chances not because I think that he's going to completely do some revolutionary upheaval from the top down as we know Congress is stocked with a lot of terrible people who will block a lot of these efforts but I think that he's going to mobilize the masses and reinvigorate the labor movement and reinvigorate unions and help workers understand that they need to fight for these rights that have been eviscerated you know over the last hundred years one thing that does inspire me as well as seeing people like Elon Omar is incredible she's a Somali Refugee she Advocates BDS against Israel and she does not f****** back down I love that woman what an incredible woman she got this viciously attacked for retweeting one of my episodes from Empire files and I think it just shows how scared people are of of her and her ideas and you saw how hard everyone came down on her for just saying that is real has an influential Lobby and DC she's also wearing religious scarves right right away is the job and then there's something somebody hit piece on her yesterday to see anything she married a brother that's ridiculous country that's a religious marriage but then she had another I don't know what's the only one in Congress other than a band of course AOC and you know some other very few people but she's out there everyday speaking against the military industrial complex being against the wars I think as a refugee she under and the effects of US policy and I'm really excited that she has a voice in there but again I don't think that the hope is going to come from within Congress and the system is way too far gone with the Electoral College and the gerrymandering and the voter rights you know that I've been rescinded its it's a lot and it's an uphill battle but that's why someone like Bernie I think we'll turn to the people and say I can't do this alone you have to come out and get my back and we have to have millions of people in then rescinded its it's a lot and it's an uphill battle but that's why someone like Bernie I think we'll turn to the people and say I can't do this alone you have to come out and get my back and we have to have millions of people in the streets demanding these things that's the only way it can work</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Bloom boxes know really what is it thinking about them lately I remember seeing him on 60 Minutes years ago and I think Google headquarters was powered by one what does are these funky little black boxes that had some chemical process of creating energy and they were like early on massive news promising Tech in their super groovy little simple boxes and they originally did it for like campuses military like large large installations for you multiple complexes and stuff and they were also making them for automotive and they had a prototype I was so excited I think it was elements within the shielded box to create the energy but they were like self-sustaining and super groovy boombox literally is just a big black box doesn't what's in there it's just one of those things that seemed so promising that then went bye-bye seemed like to Royal engines there was a great engineer at the Lodi that was real getting to radials and get a Ford Focus that would do is like his daughter's old car with a blown up motor he had his own to Royal Motor that he had developed that could run from the energy in the charged particles in the air what thing did like 15 miles an hour on a flat Test Track Running on are charged particles in the air is charged particles as they are could be a real speed wow I saw him once at a trade show and I was exhibiting at the show as well since they're on setup there's bored out of my gourd we were done by was already set up in the fort boots that is walking around for the sniffing around and see this trippy scientist guy in his lab coat in this s***** little booth was like a note 6 by 10 foot booth and radial thing and then a bigger toroidal thing and literally like a chalkboard slime tube what's going on so start talking about it starts explaining the technology and what he was doing and like the smaller one at 300 foot pounds of torque the larger one had two thousand and he was looking to develop it for rail cars for semis for cars like an on and on and on as I get the biggest problem is stopping you from 12 to 2 of that first cylinder was such that when the combustion occurred and it propelled the next piston into the next combustion cycle and kept going so getting that power out of the simple crank was a challenge and then how to stop the damn thing was like the bigger challenge but they'd run on like horse piss ionic charge particles diesel gas boot gun empty done and I have the guys info and try to reach out to him website go on the website I looked at the Night Before Dawn that gobbled up five years later I see him again in another trade show with another kickass design and man was he a bitter man so I can never again cuz they bought it and they shelled it I'm never selling anything again f*** them I'm licensing to specific channels of applications and that's it his new product so what do you think happened if your conspiracy theorist do you think someone bought him out and just bought a small independent business owner real realest in that hell yes someone didn't like that and they shelved that s*** so they bought it and so is next product generator and you had a small battery in the vehicle right so this is a retrofit system the retail model was brilliant because you have like a pretty cheesy inexpensive 3 axis Mill a s*** ton of CAD files and one product on the Shelf so in a lightweight car it was like an electric supercharger to replace your alternator and had a tooth Cog and for the pulley and then your crank pulley wood added to the card to it and then to the Bell so the idea was it would assist the internal combustion through its compression cycle it would negate the parasitic load of all the Fiat all the front engine accessory Drive mounted things you know your alternator is smog pump or whatever like pushing engine through the cycle with the captured electrical energy from the deceleration use it and then the guy disappeared off the face planet again series Crisis guy should happens if you remember there was a video that was circulating many years ago about a guy who created a car to run on air no excuse me water get created a car that runs on water and then this car that ran on water make you apparently had a viable engine and it was really working and then he he he had a heart attack and as he was dying you saying they killed me they killed me and then he died but we can put them in a little box and called a conspiracy theory or whatever and he has therefore it never happened doesn't believe in conspiracy theories I say look at Jeffrey Epstein could do what physicists say is impossible turn water and hydrogen fuel efficiently enough to drive is dune buggy cross country on 20 gallons straight from the tap that's f***** up that's f***** up I don't know if it's true history of mankind have been a little off The Rocker sexual desires and love affair that we had and the distraction and presented that he in quotes destroyed his sexuality I do not know what that means I don't want to be walking around like a mini have a hip switch sort of swept aside that you wonder like there's a documentary who killed the electric car I don't know who he is but that is another example of the you know that was an innovation that was a little bit ahead of its time and the powers-that-be were like f*** you early patent troll horse carriages and we got these new motor things and you know what something to could be a Horseless Carriage so we like literally did like a chicken scratch b******* drawing and filed it and got awarded the patent so Henry Ford in his first two companies as well as the Dodge Brothers all the early Pioneers in the transportation sector in the US had to pay this break a massive royalty to even produce the vehicle and it was Henry when he read when he after he went down and under knee has reborn and came back out with Ford Motor Company the second time that I'm not paying this s*** and it was like eight years of Court battles to overrule it in the National Automotive Dealers Association originally didn't want any trouble and everyone was pan and Henry was the one who had the gall in the balls if they know where you're not pay this brick and they finally got a kicked out but they say that the injured innovation in transportation for a good decade only the electric starter the magnetic starter that Henry Ford integrated into his cars that really made the massive shift away from predominance of electric cars to internal combustion so when you flash forward in your look at mr. pains filmed who killed the electric car and you look at Firestone and dad who was it Pacific oil oil company Tire company and they created that bus company and then they did all the law privatized Municipal transport so that then they could slowly by them all up and you know California had an incredibly successful electric Trolley system through the Westside it was brilliant his pioneering was at everyone they're the ones that ended up stacked in the desert near this some of that footage in the film that everyone they're the ones that ended up stacked in the desert in this some of that footage in the film company that's doing amazing everyday put it on the Shelf</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know there were. Periods of time and in our history where people would steal our religious objects and our sacred items they still do and ludar Graves law called the Native American Graves protection and repatriation act that was meant to repatriate those stolen items in those stolen ancestors back to tribe so that we could help with our cultural revitalization as well as put our ancestors back to rest there are still at least 200,000 ancestors in boxes in museums that's just in the US in the US just in the US around the world French people in boxes in museums in the US are recently in our sacred objects for some reason there was a sacred Shield of the Pueblo of Acoma in about 2016 that was being sold at auction in in France the the tribe the Pueblos fought and even went to court in France to try to stop at auction and get that item back because there was evidence that it had been stolen in contemporary times and France said you don't have standing in our courts so even though they're considered Sovereign Nation here in the United States we didn't have sing in in the French court and couldn't protect that item this way so we had to use other means of negotiation and arm-twisting that item is finally been repatriated but it took it took about four years to for that to happen no this is a sacred object right these are items that are used for religious purposes or after their protected sacred items and the association we were fighting with the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year and the year before because they were displaying items from a private collection that were sacred one item was even a funerary objects with an item that is never supposed to be seen because it's buried with the ancestor and it was on display and without any kind of consultation with the tribes affected it's horrendous the way we still look at Indian people and and our cultures and our practices today I were still being called heathens everything article I think just last week there was a a religious man saying that we're heathens because the stage that I gave you because we burn stage as one of our medicinal and in spiritual practices the reason why a Christian group an Ohio where indigenous peoples have just been removed wholeheartedly is that tons of archaeologists and other people that like to loot they have taken so many things out of the ground there was a case that the FBI actually got ahold of in Indiana gentleman by the name of Don Miller who had huge Ranch House in farm and it was just full of Native American artifacts including human remains and there were even items from other countries that he had had looted and taken and the FBI actually investigated that Anne and because the man was like 90 years old they didn't prosecute him but they were able to take back those true that Native American Graves protection and repatriation act I've been Consulting with tribes to repatriate those items back but that looting and collecting and in areas like Indiana and Ohio and if so where this gentleman's get all this stuff including the FBI told media Outlets report Mueller report admitted he conducted illegal digging Expeditions we never face criminal charges before his death in 2015 so this guy was just digging stuff up and just showing around his house and then there were rules against this oh absolutely absolutely keep any records of where he got a lot of the items so our laws are really screwy with this to so Federal and tribal lands are protected so public lands parks and tribal lands are protected lands you can't go and Dig Inn in federal or tribal lands without a permit among other things but just in state private private lands it's really dependent on state laws are in and it's it's really inconsistent whether those weather looting is protected or not so that's where it's interesting because there's a lot of gigantic ranches in Texas that are privately owned that were originally Native American hunting grounds they they're the ones that a friend of mine is hunted on that they have these pictographs you go inside these caves and it says on private land someone owns this can artwork all over the walls of the cave and signs of fire like they'll sit on the ceiling of the cave where the lit campfires like this should probably be some sort of a historical site bright and it's it's usually not protected and and dumb people get real angry when Indians try to get involved in and we're there maybe development that hat will have an effect on Berry side of sacred site other other type of site people really get angry and it it's so it's really hard for tribes to work to protect these areas work to learn about what the areas are even about there's been so much amateur archaeology in this whole country was founded on amateur archaeology let's for for gold and other special things and oftentimes they just took whatever was in the grave and and and created all over the world today so the association is constantly looking at auctions and trying to return items it that private collectors have been improperly we just got a human vertebra removed from u.s. auction just a couple of weeks ago they were selling it because they said it had an arrow point still in you know so that that has value in in in some markets how do they prove that it wasn't just satellite that was killed by an arrow right I don't know and that's the thing about that's the thing about I'm trying to work with auctions and private collectors as they often don't want to work with us because they're trying to make money so often times items whether their religious objects or human remains they have a story or with call the provenance associated with them that is often made up to dry the price of the item so whether that was illegitimate a vertebra van Native American we don't talk to them how would they determine who the person was isn't necessarily going to tell you where it came from it could tell you that it was Native Americans in the state of Washington he was old old old old and the universities involved in the Army Corps who had possession of it we're going to repatriate it to appropriate tribes and what ended up happening is is that you know Academia stepped up and said I wait this isn't Native American we think he's something else and four years back and after a court case that the item wasn't that the ancestor wasn't Native American DNA test was done and it was indeed Native American and and the ancestor was finally so I say if you want and it's brought back and given to Native Americans to who until we're right so so so let's look at the best case scenario and in a lot of museums have maintained records that may have human remains and Associated funerary objects and have enough information to know where that came from Woodside was located at what county what state and we know from tribal histories as well as as Federal us documentation that that that area was likely affiliated with with you know this tribe or that tribe or maybe several tribes and so consultation occurs under that law about those ancestral remains in funerary objects and it's determined where those items should go back in the case scenario where there's not any information often times evidence of a will who were the collectors that were giving to that institution what has been the history of the institution and where has it obtained different Collections and through that you know it's deduced who may be affiliated with with those those items are the the ancestors so it can be a pretty long. process but what's interesting about it is is is museums and other institutions fought this law for a long time and they said well you know all of our collections will you know we won't be able to fulfill our purposes at a museum or an academic institution to study these things work to consult with museums most of these items are in boxes and often poorly managed and maintained so they're just sitting somewhere in storage right Americans do you agree with the idea I'll get want to hear Kennewick man finally it's free-to-play never found in North America what does it give us a date on his what they have car go to that picture that he's again that's crazy so so just let me tell you that looking at human remains for many tribal peoples is is difficult it's like looking at him a naked body I mean it's it's the essence of someone that you know we shouldn't be saying that that should have been in the ground that should have gone and disappeared it had a journey at got interrupted and and you know it some tribes and cultures believe that that's harmful to interact or look at or just it a little bit humiliating it's exposed an In-N-Out and at least in the United States you won't find that in any kind of Public Museum now you might in some kind of private institution or private collection other cultures that they're trying to get those back to some sort of a that be cool if that was Ronald Reagan you know what that be cool if that was someone from our you know our lifetime that died with had Janis Joplin's head you know in a box somewhere and then go stare at it when that weird you out or how about Amy Winehouse how about someone that died yeah she was saying yeah that way we don't seem to to to go oh that's not okay so it's no Outlaw their religion how would I feel if someone did that to me right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> one of the things they talked about in Black Elk was the practice of the Ghost Dance to this idea that they were going to somehow or another bring back the old ways and it's a sad sad story when you hear them talk about especially because it's coming from the words of black alcohol with a guy that was there with the Battle of Little Bighorn and then from then now is an older man talking about what would his experiences have been haven't had seen as people moved to reservation I seen it basically every single treaty broken I mean was there a single treaty that United States had with the Indians and it didn't break that what that's insane mean every single one and most treaties had some similar language a lot of them talked about they had bad man Provisions so bad man Provisions were basically if our men the us if our men come in and to your jurisdiction and do something bad will take care of it for you you know just some simple Provisions like that but never was enforced the US let let their people come in and take over what we're supposed to be protective areas of land and that was just constant that happened that happened everywhere so there were bad Provisions through a lot of Provisions lot of beautiful Provisions that that the tribes still talk about today as long as the Grass Grows and we'll have our lands and in none of these Provisions wherever upheld and a lot of the East Coast tribes there their boundaries were changed a new treaties were made and accepted and Andrew removal happened and there were new treaties and nothing was ever maintained and the other tribes that were removed to Oklahoma and by the way because of that removal their tribes that were already there were removed so they're already tribes there the Caddo and Comanche another other tribes that this was our he their land so new tribes moved in and land dreaming I'm forgetting my dates now but there was a Dawes commission around 1906 or so there was a census and individual Indians were allotted about a hundred sixty Acres apiece and this was an effort to decrease the amount of land base that tribes held in common right and this happened all across the country not just in Oklahoma where there were allotment policies and I believe there were there were about heck I'm not good with numbers I think they were like 19 million Acres that that were removed this way of of land but what happened today there is a criminal case before The Supreme Court that is actually addressing these issues because even though our lands were allotted the exterior boundaries of our reservations the area that we had agreed to live in they've never been extinguished never been diminished and so the Supreme Court's is activist Supreme Court has actually looking at this issue now is to whether we still have jurisdiction within the exterior boundaries of our reservations in Oklahoma well so so not necessarily so so it's raised a lot of fear with with non-indians about taking back the Land O my God but what would actually happen there's a lot of places in Indian country where there's a lot meant and there's there's a non-indian individuals who have feel and within the exterior boundaries are reservations and then individual Indians only feel and within the exterior boundary reservation land how you would how you own land it's called it's not restricted it's it's it's in you own the title to that land right a lot of land held by tribes in trust during restricted fee so common Ariel and likes like let's look at them the Onondaga nation in New York state they have the exterior boundaries of the reservation they own a restricted file and so they own it but they can't sell it without us permission trust land is similar and it's treated the same as restricted fee but it's held in trust so the US has more control of of of what happens on that land or has been seen to have a little more control than it wouldn't in just restricted fee but with a boundaries of the reservation you can have this checkerboard ownership of land of non-indians and Indians and and but that doesn't necessarily mean that the tribe has jurisdiction over the non-indian feel and and the the civil and criminal jurisdiction issues on an area of land like that is extremely complex and continues to be argued in the courts and it most of the time our jurisdiction most of the time since the 80s and 90s and up until today we there was really a change in kind of how the Supreme Court decided Indian law cases so if we back into the history of Federal Indian policy you see this kind of weird schizophrenic you know those those those Marshall cases that I talked about they really stepped forward kind of schizophrenic principles that unions are sovereign but the Civilized so we have to take care of them and so you have a different eras of time policymakers who support tribal sovereignty cases to help support that sovereignty and then there are other administrations that come around not talking about current Administration but that that use those cases against us an integrated policy and degrade any kind of rights that we may have gained in in other eras so it's it's really been you know Indians today live in this live in such an insecure world you know our statistics are horrible the suicide rate for youth high school graduates everything that you could possibly think of there's a statistic on were usually the lowest were the worst and it's because we live in a society that is constantly changing we can never depend on whether or not our rights are secured whether or not we're going to have the lowest are the worst and it's because we live in a society that is constantly changing we can never depend on whether or not our rights are secured whether or not we're going to have land jobs being able to practice our culture</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the things that I got out of this recent obsession with American Indian culture and the stories was realizing how little I knew about the history of this country you know you you might know you might have a basic understanding of what happened that you learned in school it's real peripheral and it's very surface and then upon reading these books and maybe realize like what happened here this is what happened here over the course of a couple hundred years is almost unprecedented in in history like that this nation was conquered by all these Invaders that just kept coming in kept changing the rules kept breaking trees making trees breaking treaties wiping people out calling things battles when they were really just massacres of women and children Municipal horrendous horrendous stories of justification of these massacres that were no no different than any other horrific Barbarian Slaughter that you might have heard about in history that's looked down upon but four years in this country they were taught as if they were actual battles in that did the history of this country with in regards to the tribes and the American settlers and the soldiers is terrifying it's terrifying it is just happened a couple of hundred years ago and that people are capable of these things and the ancestors of these people I just roaming around today and that's what this country was founded on this country was founded on the massacre site and and and that policy has been steady by folks like Adolf Hitler and in his book Mein Kampf but it wasn't just the battles there have been many different types of battles that we consider Warfare though it hasn't been done with you no guns and legal right legal battles exactly I mean since the 60s Europeans have been trying to educate us and assimilate us and in civilize us and have passed laws once the States became a nun new country and 1800 pass laws to take our children and move them far away and and punish them if they spoke their language cut their hair put them in the schools that were military based and they studied academics in the morning and then they did trade in the afternoon and in those trades were to help pay for cool so they were basically indentured servant slave labor making sure that the school could have enough funds to pay for their own education and the boarding school history in the United States and Canada has horrendous Renda stories and the schools were funded by the US federal government and dissociation and other groups are trying to get the United States to release records of of who were the children in the schools we think there's a there were about 500 boarding schools across the United States and about at least 20,000 children that we can figure out where were killed were duck died in the schools some of this work has been done at the Carlisle Indian School and in Pennsylvania which is now owned by the Army Corps Army Corps of Engineers and there are some tribes that are trying to repatriate their children that are engraved Aaron and bring them back home so this is been a process all over the country trying to figure out you know who these children were where they belong and in to bring them home it's been a really difficult process for the organization any of them cuz he's not being fed working too much all those things that could kill a child at all these think those records of all these different children probably doesn't have the records probably has mismanaged a lot of the records regarding these boarding schools in and there were different times have been different eras of Indian policy where the federal government was like oh wait this isn't working let's let's get out of this business of teaching Indians let's give it to the church has let them do it for awhile and then it would come back into the federal government and but the churches would have it at course we've heard all of the horrible things that different churches have done to children and there are still many boarding school survivors today that can tell those stories of abuse sexual and physical and who still live with that today there is a organization called the Native American boarding school healing Coalition that is really working on these kind of issues and have are pulling together the stories and are also working with survivors I to try to heal from that that trauma that's not just theirs but it's it's this insured intergenerational historic drama that has been with our communities for a couple hundred years now so they're there are a lot of stories like that in the end this again mrs. US federal policy while they were while the US was building the reservation system and and and putting tribes kind of in these Blockheads if you did not send your child to school you weren't given rations you weren't given your food if you practiced your culture you could be killed for practicing your culture using your language because and because this was the assimilation policy of the day and this happened I would say 18:15 70s through the 1920s there was this horrific. Of federal Indian policy of of doing trying to do away with language communal type living cultural practices in religion so this isn't just you know gun warfare this is been continuing policy that affects us today policies it even affects us today on warfare until they got the Indians to move into the reservation and then it was basically an annihilation of the culture international law</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let's go to that then this is the United States has a very strange situation with Native Americans were Native Americans have reservations and on those reservations they have sovereignty they can have different rules they can do what they want to exchange is like those Nations inside of our nation how do you feel about that start with the beginning like how did how did how did we get to where we are today there and there's a lot of information and so you got to stop me if I start getting too carried away all right so there are Supreme Court cases and there was his name John Marshall who is actually buying Indian land from from us the US Country u.s. Grants and so he was interested he was an interested party but he was making decisions that that set forward the kind of watershed principles that continue to affect who Native Americans and Indian Nation governments are today and so those three cases coming to court to try to determine who owned a piece of land in Indiana and there was one guy Johnson who is plaintiff who would purchase the land directly from the pinkish all Indians were related to the Miami Tribe today and then the defendant was MacIntosh and he purchased Land from the US government and so the case of course was who had the proper rights and through that case The Narrative that Justice Marshall created brought forward a piece of Discovery have you ever heard of the doctor to conquer Dennis Heathen people's so this was the principle that this case was based on and it set forward this weird relationship the tribes in the US government have today so if the us if the Christian European peoples had the rights to take land away from tribes because they were an inferior race which is this this is language from Meister inferior race they're Savages they're unable to govern themselves and they only have a right of occupancy so that was the first of three cases that Justice Marshall decided and of course he was an interested party in the whole thing because he had purchase land from the United States and he wanted to make sure his land was Secure the second case was Cherokee Nation V Georgia they gotten through Congress to remove the Eastern Indians west of the Mississippi River and Indian Territory which is of course now Oklahoma Kansas Texas area and and again this was the case that actually of the Cherokee Nation tried to bring before The Supreme Court and before The Supreme Court could even make a decision on the and I just realized I didn't even tell you the facts of the case I'm getting ahead of myself I apologize this is this is incredible experience to be here so I'm a little bit nervous so in Cherokee Nation vs Georgia Georgia was trying to assert its laws over the Cherokee Nation and so the Cherokee Nation brought this case before The Supreme Court to say that the state does not have any right to assert any of its laws against us and what Justice Marshall did is sit is said well you're not a foreign Nation so you can't bring a case before The Supreme Court and determine the tribes were pseudo Sovereign Nation that they were still under the tutelage they needed to be civilized again the same kind of Savage language in this case and held that the federal government had plenary power over tribal Affairs and that the Cherokee Nation couldn't bring this case to court so what ended up happening is some missionaries who were serving the Cherokee Nation actually developed the case and violated Georgia so they could bring a case before The Supreme Court in that case was called Worcester V Georgia and I think that was about 1830 to 1831 and in that case it was ruled that the United States had a guardian and Ward type relationship with tribes and so we were the wards they were our guardian and that set up this weird dynamic that still exist today the Supreme Courts and other case other courts site in decisions today to basically take away more and more rights so so that was that's the Watershed basis for this weird relationship that we have and it's based on racism it's based on tribes being an inferior peoples they not be civilized and and so here we are so help help directly into another question here so fascinating thing the idea that the United States government is that they're like the big daddy over the tribes and the only way the tribes can exist as if they exist the European way right the great white father and so all this was happening while they were trying to conquer the West so all this was happening around the gold rush time before then so this was happening in the 1830s was 1850s absolutely Civilized Tribes were in the Southeast at that time and that's what's so interesting is because you see through this is a this is a little bit why have a problem with some of the books that you've read is because they've taken small pictures of what was going on and kind of removed the context of what was really happening there so many tribes across the United States that tried everything to resist or comply or stimulate so that they can maintain their weight I've maintained their lands and continue to prosper as they had been but the United States was obviously for a formidable opponent and regardless of of of for example of Five Civilized Tribes and their their their tactic was to assimilate was to go to school and educate themselves and learn English and even though they did that and they did everything that the United I wanted them to do they were forced off their land to the West into Indian Territory the Comanche learned about through the book they that those events happened during a point of time and that was their effort and resistance they saw how disease wiped out their brother and from other nations than that folks were coming to get them and so that was their way of resist being simulated and having everything taken away from them in the defense of the authors of those books they did Cover a lot of that they did these books are in no way taking the side of the United States government you know most of them the most amazing thing about Empire of the summer moon was just how special the relationship that the Comanches had to the land in about how when did Jessica and Parker's at with no Cynthia Cynthia Ann Parker who is she's the photo out there the woman that's breastfeeding your child she was kidnapped when she was nine and assimilated with the Comanches and then was re kidnapped by the United States government when she was in her thirties and didn't want to go back she missed the Comanche life and threw her and threw her depictions in her descriptions of the way they lived the understanding of it they got a better sense of like what she missed about that life and that they had an incredible relationship with the land they lived basically just in teepees they were very nomadic they just followed around the Buffalo and they had you know what in her way of looking at it on a magical existence in comparison to this really boring life that these settlers had and when you know what she looked at it it was interesting because she was a girl who was born describe a white settler and then from the age of nine on lived as a Comanche so she had like sort of the view of Both Worlds and you know she very much took the side of the Comanches and she wanted to go back like she had spoken Comanche and in the book there's an encounter where they bring in someone who was the Comanche to speak to her and she grabs and she's like take me back we're going to leave let's get out of here now like her thought was like we got to get out of here like this way of life is b******* like I want to go back to the Comanches but she just didn't understand that that way of life was slowly going away and her son Quanah Parker who is that photograph over there that's on bullets that somebody made for me I don't even know where that came from somebody sent me that he was the last Comanche chief and they bothered during her lifetime and her son's lifetime was the last of it and it's a very sad story do the Comanches live today in Oklahoma but they do but they don't live the way they did right that means their way of life was removed mean they were wiped out Comanche still live today right in Oklahoma has quite a few of them is very cool but they do but they don't live the way they did right that means their way of life was removed mean they were wiped out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> ulcers aren't static we're not static and I think one of the major issues that American Indians have is that we are often stereotyped into this this picture and if we don't fit that then we're not legitimately Indian rhetorical question so are you one-hundred percent Native American and that's that's let's talk about that talk about that what other so blood Quantum is an imposition from the federal government that is that has been used to weed out Native Americans so the whole the whole idea of US federal policy has to assimilate Indians to rid themselves of the Indian problem so that land and resources could be obtained right and so blood Quantum was one way that the u.s. government could do that so if you if you didn't meet what they thought was some kind of purity test then they could write you off right but that is not how many Indian nations View tribal citizenship for membership it's through other types of cultural continuity family relationships and it's not about race that's been an imposition on us so I'm polish and Choctaw absolutely absolutely Italian I'm Italian but I have a last name is Irish cuz I'm one-quarter Irish so growing up around Italians who was always like the way they made fun of me and it was like it was always a funny thing like are you sure your Italian you know like it's a purity test an ice last name with a lot of vowels you know it's a that's what they like and it's really interesting Association on American Indian Affairs we get tons of inquiries probably the top inquiry we get our people wanting to do DNA test to determine what tribe they belong to so everyone seems to want to be Indian and even some people are are emboldened enough to say I did my DNA test Native American that's a real issue that doesn't exist but there's some kind of of fantasy or myth that many people in the US have kind of believe about Indians because we don't know it's not like it's taught well in school if it's it's not like this is part of a normal dialogue identify whether you have certain genetic traits that might be from North America Canada or might be from South America as well right you have to do that genealogical research and if you know where there's 574 federally recognized tribes in about 300 other tribal groups in the United States on top of the fact that aren't recognized by the United States for many reasons and so each one of those tribes have their own laws they have their own systems of governance their own whether it's a more traditional form of government or a written constitutional government needs one of them have their own eligibility requirements for citizenship so you have to do your own genealogy and then if you do find who you may be affiliated with any that nation and you talk to them about what their eligibility requirements are some of them are residencies some of them are familial relations and some of them are blood quantum Indian federal law of art it's a legal term of Art it's a it's a defined Federal term that has a specific definition in u.s. code we tend to like to be called the nation that we belong to from south of the invisible Border North of the invisible border and and in the Western Hemisphere so it's a much broader indigenous peoples is a great great term I really want whereas the people that live on my friends live in Alberta and First Nation people can know they Dave Dunlop hunting seasons they just do whatever they want they basically say look let's just pretend like we never invaded and you just live how you would normally but with modern equipment and also it's it's a little odd but there's no getting around it. they don't have hunting seasons they just do whatever they want they basically say look let's just pretend like we never invaded and you just live how you would normally but with modern equipment episodes it's a little odd but there's no way getting around it being odd</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when I'm asking this in terms of like if you had a magic wand what do you do with the reason why I'm asking you this is because I've thought about it I've sat down and tried to go over at myself and I don't see a solution that sits what's so strange to me is that we have Nations inside of our nation and I don't I don't want it ended and I don't want to continue it neither neither one makes sense to me like to take to end it would be to say you are assimilate you no longer have sovereignty we're going to break the last treaty and disband the reservations and make everybody just be a United States citizen that seems crazy everyone is a US citizen I'm just I'm just trying to look at it like from an overhead view like if I was an alien and I was trying to sort this out I had no no ties to either call Trevor like what are you doing with that like what do you do with that like I understand these people been massively f***** over that the genocide was perpetrated on their their their race that they were wiped out both with disease and by military actions and soldiers and treaties were broken I get it but the stay turn right now when you look at what we're talking about with these reservations are the horrific conditions in the problems of drug abuse and alcoholism and suicide and and despair and self-esteem and all these issues like what is the solution what would beat me if there was an unlimited budget like what what would you do if you were like it is President Shannon if you got elected you could win right you can be president and vice president you ran on the part of what your platform was was fixing this gigantic store that we have in this country our relationship with the tribes what would you do unlimited resources you do whatever you want I think if we were properly educated about about history I think if we really understand who native people are and their importance here and their importance to continue as Sovereign tribal Nations and it has to start it has to start with with public education we have to recreate what's important to us and I think Indian nations have have been here I think they're a symbol of of amazing Prosperity that the country could have and we've just never tapped into it and I'm I'm talking about just principles and values that that we don't seem to to hold any more in this country I feel like you're kind of being sarcastic no no no no no no no not one of the major problems we have in this country is we don't ever appreciation of nature we really don't you know we we don't look Seven Generations ahead of us to see what our decisions today or going to do to us in the future we're constantly looking for the dollar today and how that's going to reward our efforts today or not looking how you know what the lives of our children are going to look like with the lives of our great-great-grandchildren are going to look like in in and I think those are the kind of values that that we need in our country now and I think that's what's being debated in the Democratic campaign right now you know where our values are at what we want you know a hundred years from now even though their spokesperson we barely talk which is hilarious I mean to shows you how strong money and media and the influence of DNC is what would all this education do though and explain to people to the American citizens are outside the tribe how is that going to help the tribes themselves what what can be done to help these problems that we pretty detailed the problems with alcoholism the problems with suicide and despair and self-esteem all these her room conditions that exist on Mini many tribes what part of that is is is not anyone anyone's problem but ours that we have to deal with is as Sovereign Nations within our our own communities and how we how we choose to fix those issues but I think looking outside how how we can really affect change is there's something called prior and informed consent and it's in it's contained within the UN Declaration of indigenous peoples and it requires a state or government to include tribal nations in the decision-making processes that affect them so this Administration has been horrible at it absolutely horrible but need to be part we need to be the decision-makers in the things that affect us so if if you were going to a bulldoze and blow up our sacred sites to build your border wall it seems like the proper thing to do first would be to have a conversation with us in him for us to make a decision about how we may can do that a little bit better to protect those sacred sites and and natural springs in other things along along the border instead like the proper thing to do first would be to have a conversation with us in the end for us to make a decision about how we may can do that a little bit better to protect those sacred sites and and natural springs and other things along along the border instead of just blowing up everything</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so what do when when you look at that situation the casino situation we're now all the sudden economically these tribes can Thrive and the the reservation that owns that casino can Thrive and as you're saying the money goes straight back to the reservation and to the people that run it and it ended it legitimately helps the people that live on that reservation what other things like that can be done to also take advantage of the fact that there are Sovereign Nation and allow them to economically Thrive without things like fracking and s*** that's bad for the environment other other things that are being implemented that could also help they're all different types of Economic Development going on in Indian country that can be very successful for external businesses because a benefit sitting outside business would get if they did for example manufacturing with in Indian Country they could benefit from certain tax exemptions and in and rebates that they wouldn't get in an estate so if corporations the Border or going somewhere else there would be great opportunities but and some tribes are taking advantage of those business opportunities not just gaming but out of gaming has grown a lot of a lot of investment a lot of entrepreneurial ship in tribes in a lot of the money has gone back to help educate and teach language and and ancestors and and the things that are important for that tribal Nation so there's many different ways of investment that that tribal Nations look at it it's not necessarily economic but it's about healing their people and and helping us survive in and live better than we have in the past so investment takes many forms and Indian country tribal Nations look at it it's not necessarily economic but it's about healing their people and and helping us survive in and live better than we have in the past so investment takes many forms and Indian country</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what do you think would be best case scenario for Native Americans United States like I'll sort of give you the magic wand again like what would be best case scenario cuz the strange thing that we have in front of us here is that there is one country the United States but there's not just United States North American citizens here there's also Native Americans of various different right that have their own reservations and as you said they're Sovereign and they can come to make their own decisions what would be what's the magic wand how do you clear up all these problems associated with the mean that the horrific treatment the of everything from alcoholism to the problems with schools to self esteem issues all these problems in North America while also not that the Native Americans in the way I'm looking at it they want to stay a member of their tribe and they don't necessarily want to be just Americans they want to keep their Heritage right universally how does that how do those two things work together how do you how do we all live together in America and yet have these trucks and do it in a way that works best for everybody that's a freaking complicated asked questions even with a magic wand and not rely on others to tell our stories we need to be able to tell our stories and to reteach the general public about who Native Americans are where we've been and where we want to go Custer they've all been stories that have fed into the American politic in a certain way at certain periods of time and what I want is that this is the time now we're tribal Nations have a lot to lose and we're in a current Administration that is trying to terminate us once again what are they doing differently than other administrations they would there are a groups that are attacking the basis of federal Indian law and the rights that we do have so there's there's an act called the Indian Child Welfare Act was passed in 1970 and it's an act that the association was heavily involved in to get past and it started with some work with the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe and a woman came to the people back then and said they took my kids they stole my children and after investigation it was found it it wasn't just happening it it Spirit Lake but it was happening all over Indian country were state welfare worker children in a disproportionate rate of quarter of all Indian children during that. Of time were taken away from their own families and adopted out to white white families and so the Indian Child Welfare act required state courts to do things before a child was taken away from its tribal Nation there are groups that are working to dismantle that and because they they think it's racist so they so it's it's like they've taken it and in an hour or looking through a backwards mirror so instead of it and to make sure that the children had ties to their culture and their families that that's not in the best interest of children so they're still looking at Indian tribes as we can't take care of her own kids that our way of life is is not acceptable and other adoptive families would be better and what's interesting is that the Indian Child Welfare act doesn't prevent it just requires a certain process to make sure that the involved in that placement adoption process and so that the child can maintain those those connections or that they try to find a family that's more culturally appropriate for the child so there's just been actually it came out of the Goldwater Institute which is a Goldwater when he was what was the senator he actually voted Indian Child Welfare act but today the Goldwater Institute is is actually funding cases around the nation to attack the Indian Child Welfare act what is the what is the reason behind what are they trying to achieve child welfare organizations around the country that say the Indian Child Welfare Act is actually the gold standard in child welfare in that that we should be utilizing those principles that are used in the Indian Child Welfare act to protect all all children to maintain familial connections</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> where was the situation that was happening during the Obama the Obama Administration where they were trying to put a pipeline through and they were hosing people down and it was on private land and they were going to private land and people are protesting it but they would never force me through anyway where was that in North Dakota and is affected by that so there are some land right issues there but we're talkin about burials and sacred areas not to mention a water quality and the tribes I'm Obama stopped at but as soon as Trump got into office he he he he pushed it forward in and did not consult with tribes and it's been a fight ever since same thing happened with they put a stop to it right before he left office right right right I'm so cynical I wonder how much of that is horseshit how much is Isaiah. You know what's going through it don't worry boys to our reservation like the majority of presidents and he did actually he was adopted into the Crow Nation I think so he adopted tribal member has visited since then that had never been done before and they actually were looking to tribes and building a government-to-government relationship that no one has are really done as well every year they would help hold a big tribal consultation in DC where tribal leaders would come from everywhere and consult with Obama and his administration it was unprecedented and the doors closed so even though he appointed assistant secretary for Indian Affairs a Tara Sweeney who's Alaska native that Administration in the department of interior and under the president has just been so close it's been hard to get anything done or to get hurt or even actually have that government-to-government relationship anymore we've been left out of a lot of the decision-making process it's going on Oliver Indian country that's a that's a very good thing to hear about Obama that he did that and so sad to hear that the Trump Administration is abandon that but it's nice to hear that someone was making an attempt to do that so what I'm getting is it really is no no long-term solution there's no solution you're saying that the trucks going to have to deal with a lot of moving parts and I think I think it you know Indian nations need to determine for themselves how best to handle the problems within their communities but outward-facing to have a strong government-to-government relationship that takes into account not just takes into account but actually require the before effect their rights or or at least some diplomacy or negotiation with varying interest before decisions are made I think that that's the heart of of what needs to happen outward-facing and also we need to take a new look at at our curriculum in schools we really need to most of our correct all of our curriculum and in public schools is about looking at Native American pre pre 1900 so and not caring that into today and who contemporary Native American tribes are and what they're doing to help their people and in what's so wonderful about Indian country today is that though there have there are some places that are extil there some anti-indian hate groups out there that fight tooth-and-nail against anything a tri-band in there kid tries to do to develop economically there are other communities where tribes have been able to bring an economic development whether that's through gaming or otherwise and by the way mean is like no other type of corporate gaming and I think a lot of people don't understand this so if you're a gambler go to Indian casinos cuz that money goes towards Indian Nation government legislated that that money from those casinos go back into Indian Nation governance and are used for jobs and employment and Social Services in all of that relieves the state and other government agencies from from having that that responsibility Oklahoma State Oklahoma Indian nations in Oklahoma about gaming trying to get more money out of game but the Governor Stitt I think is his name and he's trying to negotiate that in order to bring more money into the state so essentially trying to tax that for State purposes denying The Sovereign Nation right well in the Indian gaming regulatory act which was passed it there's so much Federal legislation it's insane of federal Indian law I mean it has its own which is their inherent sovereignty to do so this act came which was kind of a compromise tribes can do what's called Class 2 Gaming which is based on Bingo and and there's electronic bingo games that are kind of like slot machines so types in the state they have to work with the state in order to develop some kind of compacting and revenue sharing of her class 3 gaming so the state the federal government again allowed state to interfere with that inherent tribal sovereignty to regulate their own Economic Development they can that's the class 3 gaming have to do it through the state it's so strange right it's like they get no help at all and then when something comes along that allows them to economically Thrive then the governor's like hold on inferior so back again to those Watershed cases of of Justice Marshall their inferior even being able to assert jurisdiction over non-indians who come into our territory and do something wrong we can't we can't guidelines or the state government's laws the tribe does not have criminal jurisdiction over non-indians with enemy comes in and robbed the casino then the state has to take care of it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what what is currently a major Focus for you cultural items back to their Affiliated tribes any institution that received Federal funding or federal agencies to work towards repatriation of items that they've received overtime back to their tribes but there are also tons of ancestors and items in in international Museum so we're working on developing strategies to go after those because a lot of those countries there there has been kind of a a real thing about the purpose of museums and in public education regarding indigenous peoples and how do we decolonize these institutions and so trying to work in some countries are easier than others because if you have sacred religious items from American indigenous Societies in some museums across the waters their country considers it their cultural property so you need an act of their country's government in order to DSS in those items in and return them home so there are some countries that are much more difficult to work with than others but we're in the process of developing strategy to help we're also trying to watch private collectors and people about the importance of of returning cultural patrimony and other sacred items that received over time whether or not or is it a legal obligation to do their there's definitely an ethical and moral obligation to return these items so that their culture is can be Revitalize and let those items can be put back to use so that's one Shenzhen in foreign governments took to work on these issues sacred sites I just was before the indigenous people subcommittee in the house a few weeks ago talking about what's going on at the border and bottom they were blowing up another section you know so it sits and that is happening because there was a law in 2005 that allowed Department of Homeland Security to waive all these environmental laws and if there was an emergency to do so and so the administration is is saying that the border wall is is an emergency that allows them to waive all these environmental laws and so it's not just about protecting sacred sites all the other environmental concerns all the the animal Migration Birds plants and water quality that are being affected by the border wall because people strong like think we need a 30-foot you know tall border so it's overworking we continue to work to protect sacred sites along the border wall where where they're doing this do all amenities berries have been designated as sacred science and so is that what you're saying they don't identify the bones New York for the rest of the culture that might have existed there and identify it was clearly about how do we protect and how do we make sure that the tribal consultation and other options can be presented so that the environment and other areas are pretty and the Republican Congressman that was there it was really quite seems like a nice guy basically said there is more damage caused by migrant traffic trash and defecating then there is by blowing up the ground and so that is the part interior Homeland Security and and republicans in Congress are saying about that border wall stop and think about how ridiculous you can pick up trash you can pick up s*** you can't pick up once you blow up sacred sites bones forever and replaceable these are irreplaceable resources definitely challenged him about that but you know it's I think the laws on their side is it safe to say that there's many areas that you're talkin about along the border that are probably undiscovered cuz you're at you're dealing with things that are potentially thousands of years old. Remember undiscovered has different meanings so people do not that they try to protect and so that's why consultation is so important and working with tribe so you can understand what's going on on the ground but usually they do some kind of of of minor investigation and supposedly that was done that is being dumb but nothing's being done to protect it so it's this is this area is essentially a burial ground from a thousand years ago and our ancestors use this all that school story we're going to put a wall here and those opportunities for public comments comment have been completely waived those stories always weird me out when someone's building an apartment building and they stopped construction because they found some sort of a burial site or anything like how many of those are out there I mean how many how many areas where people are digging into the ground they are going to find some incredible archaeological Discovery and it's it's getting you know smash by a bulldozer a lot of our a lot of the context for what was happening here before Europeans came is gone because we just destroyed all the evidence of it you know so that's why I often the archaeological investigations have have move forward is as they look at discrete sites without connecting the dots in a more holistic about o what's happened in a certain area so all most of our archaeological context and all that evidence is gone and it continues to be looted by amateur archaeologists and of course you know I've worked on many different developments across the country where different developments across the country where you know the bulldozers come into the Phil</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you hear an origin story like the one we were talking about people coming out of the earth what how do you decipher that well I've actually been to that origin site and it looks like a female it's a place where we were birthed it it it's at a beautiful amazing and almost shocking place in Mississippi kids that were no longer connected with and it's our lives today or so out of context with the natural world that we don't know it's possible anymore we've been so separated from that Rose's you think that's possible though that seems highly unlikely there cuz I'll give you if you had money to bet I give you a thousand bucks and you can put it on this or that you can put it on well we probably people got here by all sorts of means the way people got Everywhere by all sorts of means or they came out of the ground like flowers or Adam and Eve stories that they create our identity they create who we are at the center of our being and they have lessons to teach us and they also remind us what we're responsible for and that's what I'm saying that we've been so separated from that part of us and our connection to the natural world into the Earth from the Earth we were put in certain places to be responsible and care take for that area so a lot of these stories what they're they're essentially trying to connect people with the idea that they are part of this great Earth they're part of this beautiful ecosystem and maybe this origin story is devised to sort of explain to them in a way that makes a clear connection is that make sense absolutely absolutely but but but it's but it's part of who many tribal nations are this is our place this is our homeland this is what we're responsible for and we haven't been able to do what we were put here to do our purpose has been ripped away from us so so a lot of the work we do is to try to you know work Birds environmental healing and try to bring lands back into our land holding so that we can care take for that land that's not that's not all over there are some places in Indian country that extract the environment people for the environment and nations are sovereign the tribes are sovereign so they get to decide what's best for them and whether they're going to be sustainable or not</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> look at the future of Native American tribes in the United States and again as you said you know Native Americans that are in these reservations are United States citizens but it's it's such an unusual situation that really really have a comparison to Canada with their first Nations what what do you think happens in the future what when you go from 1900 you were talking about the the path of 1902 today abysmal hundred twenty years other than the economic success of the casinos what do you what do you anticipate happening in the next hundred years it's it's hard to tell I know a lot of tribes have been diversifying their Economic Development without or cultures were won't survive in fact many elders and you may have read it and in Black Elk speaks that no longer who we are without our culture without our languages in likely will no longer be recognized by the federal government unless we are Indian enough things are really important to who we are in the next hundred years and I think it's it's those things that we will be rebuilding of the next hundred years healing from the last and and moving forward with a new-found understanding of who yarn and a stronger identity in NN self what that actually looks like an and what's important I think that we are so still so dependent on the great white father and what happens with us politics and whether we have a voice there or not we've got great organizations that help advocate for Indian Country in general National Congress of American Indians which has been around for about 75 years and it helps Lobby and educate Congress and keeps tribes informed about what's going on in politics and advocate for many of those interests there groups like ours that are advocating for more cultural revitalization and strengthening ID and protecting our use so I think part of what we've been building is is really a coalition of of organizations and and tribes to strengthen who we are and kind of correct the misfortunes of our history I know we we still have Tribal Nations out there that where are living with egregious poverty and hand and issues that still seems so far away from being corrected but you know like my grandma always said where there's hope where there's life there's hope so I think we just continue to I mean weaves freaking survived for this long and this coronavirus isn't going to take us out either I mean we're going to continue to to tipis forward and and and try to have a better future for our kids just like anybody else just like anybody else and I think that's that's what's important is that we're not were not on the stage with everyone else we're not at the table where decisions are being we're not in the room where it happens but we respect them as a culture like they're they're thought of as we're not invading Mexico and I'm saying and whether or not you agree we're not looking at them as something and fit we're looking at them is another country we don't look at Native Americans the same way we look at maybe it's because you are also United States citizens they would look at them the same way we have the same like the respect for people that live in a Sovereign Nation another Sovereign Nation you know this is a Sovereign Nation inside of our nation it doesn't I think you would agree doesn't get the same respect that other Sovereign Nation 500 absolutely we have the same like the respect for people that live in a Sovereign Nation another Sovereign Nation even though this is a Sovereign Nation inside of our nation it doesn't I think you would agree doesn't get the same respect that other Sovereign Nation 500 absolutely</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> thanks too-big-to-fail the banks failed in the people fail unbelievable man being all this s*** that we're spending the Venezuela's s*** all these sanctions it is Venezuela coup I mean were you following not that was insane walls falling it as much as you were sort of putting as much you were putting a very alternative you supposed to like what we're saying and either left or right-wing publication and then you face a lot of resistance because of that right right but you were there yes yes I was there and that's why I knew with my own I mean I saw with my own eyes the reality on the ground and what do you think is happening over there so what is happening over there I mean if you pull Venezuelan themselves they will say that their quality of life has lessened because of us sanctions to back in 2015 Obama declared Venezuelan national security threat very random there was no threat opposed to the US but it was just a kind of start the sanctions on them but who knows who knows pressure I mean there's always been pressured because of course of us is always hated Maduro and hated Hugo Chavez and the US Empire doesn't forget and it doesn't forgive and you know going back to 2002 Busch tried to engineer a coup against Hugo Chavez that didn't work and so what we've done with these Civil Society organizations is trying to foment radical discontent on the ground in Venezuela you know get some sort of Uprising the guy one why do was just some guy plucked from obscurity who was just well known in Georgetown in Washington DC much more well-known there then he wasn't even in Venezuela so you know this was completely engineered it was totally concocted no Venezuelans really knew who he was I think like 80% of Venezuelans have no idea who won why do was but the economy went into a spiral because oil prices dropped they would have been able to pick back up their economy but unfortunately the sanctions were so debilitating that it went to complete free-fall Venezuela's not a socialist country that's actually a vast majority is Private Industry and a lot of those private CEOs are very anti-government long story short is that the coup was initiated you know during the Trump Administration after he slapped like 70 sanctions on Venezuela and we're talking about medicine food all the things that they're saying that they right there trying to Stage these fake Aid Caravan deliveries I was all bulshit what they're doing is actually preventing the delivery from food and medicine from getting to Venezuela and then this crew was a failure because the resilience of the Venezuelan people they believe that they have a democracy they do have a democracy it's actually more free than our democracy there's not a dictatorship there Maduro won the presidential election last year he won the presidential election that us lobbied the opposition candidates to not run against him so then they can say it was that was a dictatorship and so he want he won the popular vote and they tried to implement all these things and they've been blocked and the opposition keeps crying to the us that they need help that they need to be invaded it's pretty disturbing when you have opposition candidate stain slap sanctions on us invade our country help us Trump help us I mean it's absolutely ridiculous but when I was on the ground I saw a flourishing democracy I saw dozens of people hundreds of people who said that they the process there that they believe in the bolivarian movement and that their tra'ves mode till death and we don't understand because those people's voices are totally censored from corporate media the only Venezuelan that we hear from and corporate media are rich opposition either you know expats or people who just have fled and what do we hear from corporate corporate take so this is even Elizabeth Warren even Bernie Sanders has been terrible on this I mean it's it's really bad I mean their take on a corporate media if you're looking at Fox News they'll say we need to overthrow Maduro and and everyone's starving and it's a failed State they never mention the sanctions they never mention the fact that us sanctions just from 2017 alone has killed 40,000 Venezuela's this was just a study out by steeper 40,000 Venezuelan have died from Trump's sanctions from insulin shipments not getting there primarily a lot of other things medicine the people have not been getting and they are dying so that is absurd and I we we like to think of sanctions as kind of like the soft power that just Target delete that the country know it's an act of war and that's exactly what's happening to Iran and Trump's implemented sanctions all over the world in a really devastating way but but the corporate media will say we to overthrow them their failed State their you know there a dictatorship reality know they're not their democracy and they we don't like their politics that's really what it is their politics are politics are that they nationalized the oil and that's really where it comes from this fake Ambassador that was trying to get into the embassy here Carlos Vecchio he's an XX on lawyer and you see all these people who are involved in ExxonMobil and all the oil industries that were flourishing in Venezuela before Chavez got up got elected and they just want their profits back they want their money back they don't like the fact that Chavez took the profits from the oil companies that's what that's what the the problem is Joe and it's amazing it's amazing how transparent it is so ever since these failed coup attempts over the last decade the US has been fomenting regime change through the Civil Society organizations usaid offshoots in the country and I'm basically trying to foment violent unrest violent unrest of the extent that they burn down streets there's lynch mobs I mean when I was there during the height of the violence in 2017 like 200 people died news just kept saying like insinuating that Maduro was going out there with police forces and actually gunning down people in the streets it couldn't be further from the truth we looked at all the deaths we broke then I'll down we looked at death records and we found out that the opposition lynch mobs are actually responsible for the overwhelming majority of deaths in the streets so that's happening people get lynched for being black they get lunch for being Chubbies now these people are targeting maternity clinics hospitals basically any Enclave of government services because that's what this is about it's about I'm kind of a fascistic bent of the opposition wanting to take back the power from the poor the poor people got power and they didn't like it and that's what the Crux of the problem is but when you're looking at the corporate media it's an absurdly cartoonish brush that's being painted and if you look at the liberal media with Maddow and all these other people they either don't talk about it or they say Maduro needs to let the Aiden even saw Bernie and Elizabeth Warren say Maduro needs to let the Aiden let the Aiden Maduro the 8th was the Kool-Aid was was a trick they're getting 8 everyday from countries that are not trying to actively overthrow them but we staged this big stunts on the border of Columbia and by the way Columbia is actually suffering more than Venezuela Colombia is in dire poverty there's people getting assassinated every week who are labor leaders and teachers I went there and I talked to a teacher who is living in Exile cuz you scared for his f****** life but we don't hear about that right because of their allies with the US so it's cynical stunt to try to get this humanitarian International outcry to say oh my God people are dying people are hungry it's not a matter of that there's no food is that food is very expensive because there's an actual economic War being waged by Massive corporations in the country and just external entities Weatherby the Trump Administration or us multinationals that RX fixating preventing Aid in food from coming in and the aid of their they're claiming that they need to excel basically a hoax at the stunt on to try to get the regime change to to happen we just saw Richard Branson stage some ridiculous big concert on the border of Columbia and they had like what they said were Aid trucks on this big bridge and got CNN on the ground being like it was it was fake it was a truck full of like I don't know like very miniscule things but they wanted to try to Ram these trucks through how to get the soldiers up in arms and try to get them to the fact it hasn't worked they've been trying over and over again to try to get something going and basically at the end of the day what happened was just a giant money grab it was basically a money laundering scheme you look at these people who are the opposition leaders now one why do Carlos pecchio they've just stolen all the money back maybe they realize the crew wasn't going to go forward but they basically ended up stealing at least 70 million dollars in just putting it right in these people's bank account pretty shocking I mean you have international as an international conspiracy to try to take the money back from from the people whose money was was basically administered by Maduro friends at all the poor I mean poor people got a voice and I never had a voice in that country their entire lives and not country was you know it was a colonial holdover and to the bolivarian movement started Midol across Latin America and it was scary was a giant threat to the US establishment and actually that's why I tell us where was founded tell us where the the the organization that I used to sell the show to it was started as kind of a counter to This Global hegemony and his corporate narrative trying to overthrow a democratically elected leaders but it's shocking when you see like the bank of England seized all of this gold that was rightfully maduro's They seized it illegally all of these days send International body just stole all this money and they just gave it to these opposition leaders so even though the opposition leaders weren't able to take you no take the power back in the country they still have taken all the money and no one's talking about that and everyone just acting like this is some crazy dictatorship that needs are saving how dare you do we think we are I'm really going into the nuts and bolts of what the economic crisis really is and my partner Mike Risner did epic take down of John Oliver you know the liberal media is just as bad John Oliver did some f****** absurdly false kind of like analysis of the whole Venezuela situation and we just went through and debunked every single line of it I mean it was extremely disingenuous I bet he had someone who wrote All right so I bet he probably has no real knowledge nor could you really unless you extensively started at the way you have and especially if you have feet on the ground right I think that most people just in order to understand a complex nuanced problem like some sort of an international conflict that were involved in that has to do with nationalizing oil like God damn you going to do a lot of work do you do if you run a show like last week tonight or whatever it was called Define that with a lot of these so-called online experts when you talk to them one-on-one and you get them off the Record without notes like they're just people there's this guy that u n human rights investigator named Alfred de zayas that I did this big interview with and he said he tried to propose this to the UN saying there is no no humanitarian crisis there this is all fake yes people are suffering and dying but it's not because of maduro's policies and Corruption because of us sanctions that exceeded the economy in Peru any sort of recovery from taking place and the economy still in free-fall they can't work with International bodies again we have the threat of sanctions with institutions that now work with Venezuela so they've been isolated they've been isolated from the world so was the idea that they just put these sanctions employees allowed this political unrest take Play support the opposition and then just have a slow burn until it all collapses and swoop in and fix everything and make it a part of the United States government and then these people will not have the flu any longer and another thing that they hate is that maduro's given 2 million free homes to people that's something that's completely unheard of to maybe Americans but that's one thing that one why do said that he would do he immediately implemented a new hydrocarbons law or he was proposing to implement a new hydrocarbons law which is again in ovary privatizing the oil and also just immediately privatizing all of the social services that Maduro and Chavez did so it it's it's pretty shocking what would happen I'm pretty devastating what would happen if if y dos could you did succeed and the whole Trump Administration I mean it's not just Venezuela its Nicaragua and Cuba to I mean we can't go to Cuba anymore we have to create some genocide or blockade that prevents food and medicine from getting in there to what was the whizzer adjustable did they say why they're doing this while they're imposing these new laws it just John Bolton's bizarre speech about the Troika of tyranny number the number the axis of Evil Nicaragua that is weird one right the Cuba ones is what what has happened over there nothing actually give out free HIV prevention pills and they act up which big Pharma it's so difficult because it's so new ones but that's you know I encourage everyone to maybe check out venezuelanalysis and Empire files and tell us or if they want to learn more about that situation</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I think you nailed it when you said the 2016 elections of sort of the awakened this reptile brain cuz that's what it seems like you're seeing you seeing so many people to think that there's a war going on like a war in this country right instead of discussing things they don't want to discuss things down that's part of some of the motivation behind in justification for deplatforming people wiping them out like remove them get them out you know we're at War right now we have to fix this we have to get a woman right game and you know like this kind of s*** but you see like they they feel like they're in ideological war that's why identity politics is so fascinating because it's just been adopted by The Establishment by the liberal wing of the establishment to try to Electric people that were somehow a progressive society that it's all just like corporatism with you know under the flag in the banner of like social politics and identity politics and it's completely absurd I mean with Barack Obama we thought that we were in racial Society cuz we had a black president and we know that that's absolutely a falsehood so I just think that we're just going down the wrong path here and neoliberalism has really done a number on this country in the world and we're going to see kind of more authoritarian fascist policies take root because people are really down and out with with how capitalism has morphed and has strangled basically the economy it's really disturbing because you know you're looking at like left identity politics but it's under the banner of capitalism so really it's just about privatization neoliberalism is just about privatization so it's not about like leftist you know social is politics Bernie Sanders is not a socialist he's a Democratic Socialist which means that he just wants social democracy he's not talking about abolishing private Industries not talking about nationalizing anything you just talked about having workers have a seat at the table and getting share so we're just kind of gone off the Wayside of like rhetoric and we just have no idea how to talk about these things in like a fairway because things are so heated and ideological and people are just blinded I think and don't really understand these issues well enough and it's really disturbing because we're at a point in our country where we need to have conversations we don't just want sound bites but going back to the center shifts the consolidation of corporate media people don't have the platform they don't have the voice to get these ideas out there which is why your show is so important I mean having people like me like Tulsi I mean bringing out these Concepts and and Shifting the Consciousness is very very important when people are hearing the same thing over and over and over again from one side and then an opposite view over and over again from Another Side it's it's very difficult to have and understanding what the f*** is going on it's it's very confusing to most people and I think they tend to either just give up or they tend to just find whatever side seems to get them the most social credit or the most most to reasonable the perspective in their terms like is whether it's left-wing or right-wing and then just support that just just given to that and then just have this pattern that they adopt this this conglomeration of opinion adopt and then they're so busy with our jobs are so busy with your family so busy with his wife and then all this other s*** when you're saying you know the deregulation all this other s*** you're seeing when the stuff that caused the banking crisis that stuff all the stuff is going on and it's going on without their knowledge it's all happening underneath the surface and then something erupts like the economic collapse of 2007/2008 and they like what the f*** is happening I didn't see this coming now the economy crashes we have to buy out all these f****** Banks and then then it rebuild back up and people are still doing the same goddamn thing they're still working and trying to get ahead and try it and then all this is happening behind the scenes and it's so incredibly difficult to pay attention to all of it develop a nuanced perspective of what the problems are how to fix them and then who was actually going to support a real tangible solution versus who's just saying some Elizabeth Warren type s*** to get elected the streets because there's no person who's going to change this there's no top-down you no implementation that's really going to revolutionize society and get people living wage and get people Healthcare even Bernie said I'm not going to be able to do this I need you to come out to get my back but yeah I mean there's nowhere in the country that you can live if you're living on minimum wage and actually afford a two-bedroom apartment I mean that's the reality here but when we bailed out the banks in 2008 no one had a Reddit about how we're going to pay for that I mean it was just it was just kind of understood okay we're going to pay and give the banks the bailout what about f****** us don't we deserve a bailout what the people and give the banks the bailout what about f****** us do we deserve a bailout about the people in the people fail</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah it's it's it's sick I mean you texted me that video of the kid you know another medic was just shot so there's something crazy. Bilal Muhammad Uso brother UFC fighters out of his Instagram and I texted you that it's so against another so difficult that put their head in the sand and don't want to look at some of these atrocities and don't want to look at some of the video you sent me a soldier shooting at people that are not doing anything right I mean yeah I mean their whole argument is that it's all Hamas and they're human Shields any we looked through hundreds of hours of footage that these people gave us and it's mind-blowing footage it looks absolutely cinematic and epic but the footage is heroin and I didn't see one weapon I didn't see one not one weapon it was literally people with slingshots throwing rocks at tanks kind of a Rite of it's very symbolic they're not trying to hurt anyone no Israeli soldiers have been hurt or killed during 2018 which is what the film looks at his is through 2018 of the great March of return and there's not any weapon there's no militants Hamas has nothing to do with these with the March and it just shocking I mean it's shocking how many war crimes were committed on camera and it just amazing the propaganda that's just told to us about what this is and why they have the right to kill people that posed no threat to them when you were on last time we talked about this one of my email accounts was flooded with literally a chain letter the same letter like denouncing you and your lies and your anti-semitic protective in your anti-israeli perspective it was it was weird because it was the same email AstroTurf gas fake now that the campaign what has a lot of money behind it yeah that's a lot of money behind that I mean the film is mind-blowing go to Gaza fights for freedom.com if you want to check it out when it when it gets released and it just really on incontrovertible Joe I mean even if it were a war between armies all of these things that Israel is done are still documented war crimes and very Grievous violations of international law and were talking about direct targeting and assassinations by Israeli snipers of disabled full of children rest and Medics and that's what who resigned was she was a medic and as you mentioned another medic just passed away was killed rather I hate to use the passive voice cuz you always hear Palestinians died know they were murdered her whole being murdered by snipers and they pose no threat to them and so the film looks at this you went investigation basically during the march in 2018 and documents all of the Grievous crimes and atrocities conducted by the Israeli military and I mean you know Palestine has a right to defend itself and this isn't even what that is but if you look at the UN Charter of 1978 they say that you know occupied people's and besiege people have the right actually for armed self-defense and in the fact that this is not even want that is that there's literally people going out there in peace with their bare chest holding flags and they're getting killed and and sniped there's so many amputations I mean just in 28 phone numbers 35 kids were killed 900 shot the kid who went up to the fence and just put a Palestinian flag and she was shot in the head and died instantly it just goes on and on and on and so you know we're just trying to document this to really kind of push the needle for accountability because these laws have been agreed upon by the International Community some of the 100 years ago and I have kind of a rogue State acting with complete impunity knowing that it has Total Protection from the US Empire and given more freedom than ever under Trump with this Golan Heights thing and the moving of the Jerusalem Embassy or the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem I mean it's just it's abysmal and it needs to be stopped and no they can't control the narrative any longer because we're seeing this with our own eyes and that's what this film does is really lays it all out have you concentrate focus on so many different f*****-up part of your world but you sell your very friendly and upbeat like see like you're laughing at this how do you manage to maintain your sanity because I I I have a hard time if I just watch one of your pieces I watch one of your clips and I just got bought the rock I just want to cry and I don't know what to do and I want to hug my kids but you're in this year in the trenches every day and you go to these places all the time how do you how do you do it well I think that well first of all I go and Camp a lot I can denature a lot which is also kind of depressing knowing that you know climate change and blah blah but I try to get out and see the beauty of the world and understand my privilege especially as an American citizen because I don't have we can't afford to not be aware and we can't afford to not be educated and talking about these issues especially when our government is subsidizing this around the world 10 million dollars everyday what are tax dollars you know I mean this is this is going on and it's so close to home and we have to acknowledge our privilege and acknowledge the situation which is we have agency we have agency to Lobby our government to change this and to stop these criminal Acts it's so close to home and we have to acknowledge our privilege and acknowledge the situation which is we have agency we have agency to Lobby our government to change this and

		<div class="paragraph"> CNN Fox News all that I know you hate somebody but what if they just know they create kind of this this Panic what if they just on 24/7 car crashes and people die from obesity and you know we be f****** terrified we be terrified f****** bones in the mountains and f****** in Norway people would believe it they could do you like they found Santa Claus bones disease is just jumping the people he said that it happens all the time and can't control it Corona slow down booties for the lack of testing there might be way more people with it so it shows it how how it's not that deadly to know how many people died that's for sure but we don't know how many people have it so it could be less than the only thing the flu to I mean if this is supposed to be ten times more potentially 10 times more deadly than the flu right is what the worst case scenario predictions brains as to what is causing this and is there another way to generate food I'll talk to because when we're old and we're not 80s the kids during those times are going to look at this is weird because like old people love toilet paper they just talking about toilet paper like avian flu that was bird agriculture swine flu that was a pig agriculture when they Jam all these animals together occasionally one of those f****** bugs with jump ahead with plans are the ones that jump coronavirus food wide this does seem like a massive overreaction Trump confirmed coronavirus in Cook-Out it's just a bad motherfuker though that guy throws horror movie it's a horror movie Aspirus series well there's some real dangers that it might be as much as 10 to 15 times stronger media is running with us because it's bad for Trump I didn't kill the economy has made the virologist have that in mind when they make their decisions I think all these millions of people smallpox this is what they do they try to stop a lot of diseases are trying to kill us every f****** day it is if we have a war and there's a war against viruses it's a real war against nothing but we don't think of it as a thing because it's it's you but it's I'm learning how to find many people how many people have died in the US so far if it was like the zombie apocalypse from an old folks home in Washington you know something like wait a minute the average age is 8230 of the first round 229 to 28 to 27 to 26 225 so if you want to sync it up or watch John makdessi vs trinaldo Francisco tonight it is a weird thing to see no audience and it's a weird thing to think that so many people are so afraid of this that they don't do anything and go out but it kind of makes sense if it's as bad as they think it is now if it's not as bad as I think it is the problem is just going to be a lot of people are not going to believe them but next one thing comes up to the next Wednesday I know I wouldn't I know I wouldn't know I don't know I don't think it's the history of viruses in the United States and in the world or the Spanish flu right that was really bad for young guys with rate at 23 or something I hear you describe what the disease was a guy just woke up from a coma and that Mike NBA cancel there's nobody at the UFC my my my thing is maybe they were trying to get it does the scientist CDC might be saying let's stop a peak in cases that overwhelm hospitals not infrastructure cuz we don't have the infrastructure to deal with this come on down right now by hand sanitizer nobody nobody addicted to drugs are there life fell apart all these all these things to be contributors right but you're not responsible for them and pretend that we are and we just leave them there is ridiculous like it like if someone would just littering where they are and just throwing shade in the street throwing needles and sweet arrest them but but you don't arrest them and they're setting up camps under these Bridge like this is nonsense cheap housing for people as well as medical help housing for people are Smokers Choice Medical help</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> does it take to develop a vaccine for this coronavirus question I I don't mean to sound glib again but I can make a vaccine for overnight the questions is it safe and effective and that's the challenge we have right now questions about how do you make immunity to a coronavirus and what kind of vaccine do you have to have that brings in all the different parts of the immune system so we don't know that yet so some of this research there's a condition in humans called antibody-dependent enhancement adee and it turns out that if you have no antibody or immune response your gets a disease if you have a lot you're protected in between level and then you get the disease it actually enhances the disease immune response is really destructive and in fact there was a couple years ago got the vaccine actually may just a little bit of antibody and when they got the real disease it made him a lot sicker and so we found with the 2003 SARS vaccine that there was an ATV component to it when we made it in animals and so we're going to have to really study this to be sure it's safe and as you said earlier you know we can surely make mistakes we don't you know we need not too and so I think between getting the effectiveness on the safety data together I mean maybe this is not going to happen soon you know it's wishful thinking you every time I mean I go back to Cyrus in 2003 and look at every event zika 2015 we settle will have a vaccine for in no time. Are 5 years later vaccine and so this is one of the challenges we have we have to complete the job you know it's like we start on something and then we forget that it's important because it kind of goes away for a while but only to come back and so this is part of that picture we talked about this with Peter hotez you know we got to finish the job on these things you know I worry that we'll get through this situation and then people say all we're done and then we'll forget until the next one comes along and so so this is where vaccine research and development is really important how do they test for safety come up with a potential vaccine how do they make sure that it's safe what you do it gradually first 30 humans you know they volunteer willingly knowing to see what kind of reactions they have really bad people that are in jail and practice on them a lot of people before you know that the chance you might find that Brian 30 people for a while and it's just a joke and you say it's like if the Iowa farmer wanted a harvested corn and half the time it doesn't mean by planting twice as many acres you can do that in April you still can't Harvest October</div>

Pump filter it's it's definitely bad flu in in some people's accounts in that it's causing some serious damage we got there Jamie oh it's it causes damage to lungs and brain damage saying we're all going to get it in one of the reasons why this is a real tricky one is that the symptoms don't show up for a while so you can be contagious for a long time and I wish I had it 3 weeks ago something like a million five hundred thousand chickens it's honest article and they just shut everything down there like this is fixed it this is something that's going to f****** kill half the population legitimately kill out the populations Arkham Washington Post that that gets like a bunch of experts and the kind of what the things that you agree on about the coronavirus and when you read that makes you feel better more than 50% of the cases that are serious like hospitalization are people that are under which is very unusual because the other people in other places that we there they're reporting this mostly older people with underlying health conditions weak immune system weak immune systems people with high blood pressure but you know you really should stop and look at the numbers of just the flu and this is supposed to be way worse than the flu but if you look at the numbers for the flu the flu kills a fuckload of pains a motherfuking 50000 in Euro reporting this mostly older people with underlying health conditions weak immune system weak immune systems people with high blood pressure but you know you really should stop and look at the numbers of just the flu and this is supposed to be way worse than the flu but if you look at the numbers for the flu the flu kills a fuckload of pains a motherfuking 50000 in Euro</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Vault the game looks like to tell everybody who you are what you do is you do Martin and I'm the game director on Doom Eternal of Doom Eternal he showed us the game and show in ran through the sum of the first level holyfuck goddamnit so next level it's so next level graphics Regina my life it's awesome it's but it's okay because of the violence against demon yeah totally and and we we we work hard on that like you never there's no cursing that I have three kids there's no cursing there's no sex I do want it to be something that my nine-year-old could play don't you think it's kind of crazy that you could rip people's heads off you can shove their arm down their throat you could cut them in half that's fine just don't use any of those naughty word kids yes because I was joking with something the other day it's like my kids like he's not going to go to somebody in like Glory kill them but when someone says they will glow with like a Shader on them and that means you can go in to do a melee finisher basically which is like a a melee attack and you'll get help from in there there's really really cool animations so crazy like when my kids see that they're not going to do that but when they hear someone use the F-word they're like oh I could use that in everyday life and and that sucks so that would be awesome it is cartoonish violence so if you could be at its very much like a cartoon the first one with ID software we've had Carmack in before he's no longer with yes software but is will it still there no he's not there like whole sequence looks like I was like a CGI movie it doesn't look like gameplay like remember when we used to play games and used to have that opening scene there was like a video and then it would go to the game was crude this game is exactly like the opening scene which is so crazy no pre-rendered that everything those are the in-game assets that's how good they are the team is like insane the guys are true artist Craftsman you know like they just go crazy on the details and when you zoom in with the camera for the cinematics they completely hold up the rigging like it's like a feature film it's nuts are you guys there is right now let's play Let's play the the the old Taylor this is the old trailer me too know if you just listening this is just annoying music and noise but if you're watching it looks f****** sick 100 Angels Angels 2000 Jesus waste of time for people 3:20 so that's when it comes out it was 9 days from now yes that guy if your Bruce Lee that is your Chuck Norris yeah and you guys are going to admit the whole scene actually when you meet him there which is a little kid from that really inspired by that Tina is it Enter the Dragon or Return of the Dragon when he fights Chuck Norris yeah or for the Star Wars fans your Obi-Wan and that's your Darth Maul in the prequels were amazing they were really good yes I've watched the one against Obi-Wan and Anakin like a million times like I love that one it's so good like when they in the wild in Chittenango off on each other in like it is to make George described it in an interview that it would be like you would be seeing a Jedi at their Peak that that really in the first three Star Wars films they were not at their Peak and then in the prequels you would see them in their Prime you know I'd like kicks in his prime so like that's what's so cool about that fight that Bonnie Tyler it's amazing yeah well what you guys have done is create something that's going to ruin people's lives I hope you really excited about massive waste of time I mean we're talking before the show about video games in the addictive quality of video games I have a real problem I just can't play them that much yes in every now and then and then I shake my head and I got to go running or something cuz otherwise it'll get the grip on me video game. Cuz you're like in the movie and it looks like a f****** movie now and you see what the glory kills like you are your own fight choreographer if you're sick of Break In the arm and shoving it in his head then swing around from behind and cut them in half you know like you anything you want it's awesome what is unique about our single player is that it will give you the same Buzz that a multiplayer will give you because you're this time are the AI that opening level that's why I felt so you're messing with like easy dudes later on it will continue to level up and as you saw like that guy that comes out with the acts like again he is he is as tough as you are so you will get the same feeling from the single-player that you do from a multiplayer times one-on-one you run around the map and collect your rocket launchers in your ammo and armor and s*** and just f*** each other up we have a multiplayer Cold battle mode that is f****** awesome like it's really really good and then like Quake multiplayer looks no different is very unique the last multiplayer we made was not super well received it was a really competent good multiplayer but it was Doom 2016 multiplayer experience but it really wasn't Innovative enough like fans yes I do something new so we basically took the single-player experience that combat loop at your master and then we would give you away to do with your friends it's a 2 V1 so it's up to you guys versus one guy gets to be the Slayer with all the guns and it's really really cool and then there's Invasion so like you'll play the single-player campaign and then someone can become a demon like Jamie could become a demon and then invade you while you're playing you won't know where he is and I'll just come out and try to f*** with you like it's really cool but is there anyone but battle mode the closest we beat that we come to the one on one is to be one instead of one versus one you know it's the balance there no one demon can stand against the Slayer you know the doomguy is all-powerful he's got all these down it's right here he's got all the guns and the mods and he's at 8. secret spot to hit his arms are like trees so like that there were other men other jelly donuts is like a sword and the bicep just like his butt but anything like that in the future like that you never know like certainly will see but but we're really really proud of this like I think what you want to do is you got to innovate if if you want to make something that's really going to engage people like that fit like the whole point is to like give them something to master that they've never seen before cuz if you're just asking me to master a new version of a thing that I already mastered sure a lot of people would appreciate that but you're not really going to capture like a large audience so we really created something I was completely unique I'm so excited that now is there going to be a deathmatch mode where like all of us can get a room and f*** each other up by now or pillars of like we needed a lot of drama then I had a lot of pacing like that variations and pacing in the match and something with deep strategy so and and was primarily Innovative like unlike anything any anything anybody had played before and was like it's a multiplayer for people who love Doom Eternal Soul play the Doom Eternal single player you'll like this like an awesome Graphics are so off-the-charts I don't play this right now because I know I'm looking at this video to Jamie's playing showing the video of this guy playing in The Other Guys</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yes when did you guys start on this about four years ago so it's been 4 years of steady work to make something like 10 in 9 days we're going to like give it to the world yes I'm like oh my God yes I'm just now they say that it's four days and you start exhibiting symptoms so okay I coughed at the airport and people looked at me like I felt almost wanted to apologize I was just clearing my throat I didn't cover my mouth everybody was like yeah it was last week with the fans like lines of fans and the beginning everybody was touching elbows that lasted like 20 minutes and if we were just high five trying to give you Knuckles and that you had but fifty and up or something or like it's the real problem is people with respiratory issues people who are overweight and and people who are old does a does a real problems refit and he is now on a ventilator and he was in Italy I don't know the specifics you know sometimes look like I've got the flu before and I'm sure you has have as well and sometimes what happens is your worn down from travel you're worn down maybe from drinking you warm down from too much exercise and then it gets you and then if you're not like and this is just the common cold and apparently the common cold is a type of coronavirus make sure that's true I'm pretty I was reading up on coronavirus is last name was like what is a type of coronavirus is this just here now forever like this is a part of the world like coronavirus question well Michael osterholm who wrote This Book deadliest enemy and who was on on Tuesday on the podcast Tuesday he opened up a lot of people's eyes as to like what what the issue is and what what you what you can do to prevent it but those wet markets that they have in China or just bananas man with the f****** bats on the tables and coronavirus or a large family of viruses that cause sentences ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Eeyore SARS a novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans so zoonotic or xonotic meaning they are transmitted between animals and people so what was happening is these four wet markets he was detailing how they have chickens that are in one cage and civets that are above the chickens and civets are shiting on the chickens and chickens are eating the civet s*** and oh my goodness is like it's just a perfect environment to create a disease is going to jump from one species to the next that is scary yeah and he's like in many of them with jump to humans I mean all the major whether it's avian flu that's from bird swine flu obviously from pigs they jump from farm animals or from these people and they're not going to stop us markets so it's like people by their food which is just crazy and making the videos and pictures of what they look like over there know that seems scary though Rock concrete bats laid out with their mouth open they look cartoonish didn't even look real and they have no wings at James oh my God and over there look how big these bats die trying to kill you and they're going to they're going to cook those that is how this disease got started if you're hungry eat a bat you could Glory kill that thing and get help that would be good as well so don't eat bats kids I mean that's one of the things that China is doing what they have to do there's too many people not enough food and a lot of what they're eating is just we wouldn't imagine eating it or are you not traveling because of this change and s*** that's my wife asked me a lot like she she was really concerned about me coming here and I was like we got sell again so I just got back from Vegas and I was a little nervous while I was over there but I did everything normal I went to work out you know I-81 to the fights which is 20,000 people at the T-Mobile Arena all stuffed into this one area and everybody was acting normal our brothers high five Fighters mean outbreak yeah I am I'm worried about old people I'm worried about my parents for sure I'm willing to help people are overweight you know I have friends that are not healthy to Mayberry she'd lose some weight and I'm worried about them I'm worried about people with respiratory problems you know a good friend of mine has a daughter by cystic fibrosis the train he canceled his tour shout out to Everlast he canceled his tour because of that I mean that he's got a real concern serious lung condition that is really scary people that he's got no choice he has to stay home and play it safe and I think a lot of people going to do that you know it's going to be interesting to see how the government handles it was one of things about love or hate Trump he's willing to do some s*** that's a lot of people think would be unpopular like closed down traffic yeah closed down flights coming in from other countries that are infected that have high rates of infection you know I mean I wonder what they're going to do and something the really radical has to be done to try to start the slow down this this f****** Illness but I don't know what they can do are we waiting for it to watch your show at this guy are we waiting for it to go away like I read a quote that like when the weather changes it'll it'll stop or something that's horseshit Michael osterholm set of straight on that that's nonsense and I can handle it he develop an immunity when you catch it and for many people this is going to be like a bad cold for many peoples going to be like you're coughing and your end you just you just try to get better stay home drink a lot of fluids be healthy do your best and eat healthy and then get out and you're going to have an immunity to it and that's going what's going to happen on the other end I saw one guy he had it and it was fairly mild and then they quarantine and he got over it is getting over it and getting better and then they quarantined him with a bunch of also had it and he got it even worse probably wasn't fully developed yeah and then it just overwhelmed his immune system cuz he's basically quarantine with a bunch of other people that were really really sick but he got through it he was talking about it and all these poor people that are stuck on boats oh my God it's crazy this is going to kill a cruise ship industry there's nobody there it's actually kind of nice I only ask and stuff but I'm just like f*** it what are we going to do by closing down buffets all-you-can-eat is f****** pig out but that's also how they do it on a lot of cruise ships have buffets only one-on-one cruise ship and by the end I wanted to throw up like oh my god look cuz the first day you like the food is amazing but it's so buttery gross and it's like being stuck on an apartment building filled with drunks but you're all on the roof and if you jump off the side you're definitely dead yes but tasty food it's like being stuck on an apartment building filled with drunks but you're all on the roof and if you jump off the side you're definitely dead yes and they're feeding you the fattiest grosses but tasty food</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Carmack at a bar in Texas which was fuckingawesome and it's funny because he started telling me like well if you guys going to make it you know we were in production on Doom Eternal he's like if you guys can make a doom game here's what we thought we may doom and everything you listed we're all like that's what we think Legacy to live up to yeah it's the pits a really special place to work at the tremendous amount of I do want to say pressure but we're all motivated spot that's just they they they they are able to get away with things at a lot of mainstream AAA games struggle with because of how violent is I mean they are like again it it's it's Evil Dead 3 with a Transformers budget like who the f*** gets to make that like you know like we get you see we spent that shitload of time making that stuff like in a lot of situations I've been in a Craftsman you know working on the entrails later this looks pretty good and well and literally the notes you like I need the pentesting the kind of like flap a little when you get the thing off you know like how do you know if you cross the line is there a is there ever been a time when you had a scene and people are dial that back we we actually totally you know what you say hi to you start the project it's it's kind of like there's a fair amount of brainstorming in the strength of any creative team is the biz at least four game is how you brainstorm with each other at the Cinergy in that room has to be good you got to be selfless you got to show up you got to be willing to support other ideas other people's ideas we have f****** amazing group in that regard but totally we try to establish that the like look guys we're not making Saul we're not making hostel it's not malicious it's not meant to make you cringe and we actually got together a little video of like what we thought violence wise was inappropriate and totally felt off and then we made another video of what we felt right and that was Evil Dead 2 with like it's not a slow trickle of blood out of a sliced open wrist it is some dudes head came off and Hawaiian Punch to start Spa and shooting out of his head you know like that's really what it is like it it's cartoonish you know how it goes so far that you because the thing is you do this so much so often you are murdering demons per minute like I don't know what it is but it's fun crazy if it was off-putting and realistic and kind of like who you'd be so turned off it be sick like you did make you sick after a while but so kind of weird that would make you less sick well it was more realistic and less bloody I'll for sure I mean it's totally we could we could twist that where every one of those is mean-spirited and really off-putting for for sure I mean I don't want you to sell me some PR stuff to sort of defend your game against people that are anti-violence what you're doing is super bloody and disgusting and vile to say that somehow another that is less off-putting than less gory is it's a ridiculous argument I don't use any here or anywhere else it's Joseph it is not this is no PR this is so like this so you look at saw you look at torture p*** horror movies there they're cutting Achilles tendon f****** exacto knife and the dude is screaming in pain and he's a person like this is gnarly s*** he doesn't look like he's having a good time like verses on Evil Dead 2 when you wipe off the head of that one Grandma creature that comes up out of the basement and like f****** Buckets of Blood start coming out red people believe that because look Your Design Story is going to be exposed to the to the consumer into 10 seconds like they can see through your b******* in 5 seconds if they like dude you're trying to sell no like so we have to have an honest good design story that we can stand behind that is true and that that is the truth I mean we basically looked at like cartoons and like make it over the top be animation so every time he was a perfect example every time you murder a cacodemon which of those flying balls you pull out their eyeball kaco OCA Co you literally here like out I can't do it sound and that is absolutely intentional to take the edge off what you're doing because if it was more gruesome and they're like it's The Exorcist vs. Evil Dead 2 those are two completely different movie Sino house house was the movie that came out in the 80s that was inspired by Evil Dead that's like a f******, timid is a comedy and and it's a horror comedy versus The Exorcist which is f****** amazing f****** amazing but really very serious you know and that's that's how we're able to do what we do they stop selling it look like if you had a demon s*** that's what would look like like oh no tearing you up on the way out what is an original one that is the original cacodemon from the original Doom yes oh cool so it's an updated version of that but you know just more graphically intense yes</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's my hope for the future is it games are like that and you're actually able to exercise doing that because I think that if you had a game where your in a warehouse and you're actually running for your life again you know and demons are chasing you and shooting down things like your heart rate would be jacked you could do that for an hour and get a sick workout in and have an amazing good time that would be awesome great shape running from demons you would I wouldn't have to get up so early in the morning play this game but you can play this game in a warehouse where you know you have all of the boxes and all those stairs therealreal stairs and real box yeah you're running around this pre-designed map and you're actually engaging with his VR demons with a haptic feedback so f****** Glory killing them half repair parts write Jamie David new rides today for I guess Out Here Disneyland the new Marvel campus is going to be in somehow they're tracking your hands so during the ride you shoot things for points weekly daily and monthly stuff psyche and your family could get dragged me along our the best at this ride going on with the games whether your mouse and keyboard or controller though it would be hard to achieve in VR I think VR offers like a very specific unique and f****** amazing experience and I would I would just like separate the two like you know when when and when we're making VR games we're definitely trying to do something else which is cool in and of itself in and of itself but there's like not just in our game but in a lot of games like there's just Resource Management there's likes the high level 2 skill medicine happening I mean you know you play so like you know that that's hard to reproduce in VR in certain ways at least at this time but it but I think that's the thing where people want to take how you feel or how a movie and gauges you and apply it to a I think it's like Let It game be it's on your blood game be a game but a movie be a movie what VR be its own f****** experience like that looks fuckingawesome but if we just so so I would love to kill waiting a platter and beyond our I mean seriously especially somewhere like Texas where there's a bunch of warehouses like oh yeah where you can get three or four of them and set them up for different maps in the game Debbie f****** off a laser sight on your rifle and you it is it's it's it's a lame arm I can do anything he wants but he's doing I now like he's not doing VR anymore I heard I heard he was Consulting with oculus but now he's he's pursuing a i he likes a challenge he's a very interesting got to talk to you I really enjoyed talking to him yeah he is awesome you really think about what he's accomplished in the world of video games mean he's the Mack Daddy amazing games that's the guy you guys like keep your eye open for like where VR is headed and things like that and go will not yet or not ready for that yet but one day down the road we'll have something kind of a different again like we're like it's sort of like with cars I went to school for automotive design and because I love video games you know the training in automotive design big clay models about that big there their they're f****** amazing and and really really amazing place did you know that the design process that you learn their you can apply to kind of anything anything but a lot of things certainly video game for sure cuz it's just kind of questions you're asking which is like how do you start from nothing to something you know like that involves large groups of people then you can learn that there I forgot your original but I know it's like you know so I use a lot of car now she's at the office quite a bit and and it's kind of like we make a race car and and if VR is something else that's like an SUV that's like just another kind of car so like we kind of perfected how to make race cars and is been doing it since the 90s so like Doom Eternal is just another race car. accessible to Consumers I'm wondering you know where video games are headed I'm wondering if you if you think that's where they're headed everything is always going to be a place for them on an actual video game I can get an actual computer rather than the actual video game I think the the that's where my focus is other people like Carmack are looking to see where will not anymore but we're video games were going to go next but I am fully focused on where they are now and how to make what they are I think the the that's where my focus is other people like our Mac are looking to see where will not anymore but where video games were going to go next but I am fully focused on where they are now and how to make what they are now better</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> anyone contacted you before this or sense in particular and asked for your advice as to how they can better prepare like the president and and that's right yeah and so you know I I've never had a partisan. I'm just a private in the public health all right and so I actually service assignments Envoy for this Administration in the state department last year you know if still in my full-time job at the University until I've never been I mean I'm there to give the best advice I can see and do you think there's anything that you could do now that could help them make sure that we don't have these shortages of masks and shortages of medicine and IV bags and something that could be done to you obviously you've laid out all these problems and you laid it out in your book here to pick about right now go pick it up on Amazon right there an audio version of it as well I have no I don't know I don't read myself now there's actually a really good voice not mine I work at 110% time but if they were trying to fill all the orders they've gotten just in the last few weeks would take him years and years with the capacity they have in you can't build build these new machines to make mask overnight so this is something that should be set in advance of anything like this any pandemic happening like long Advance we should be prepared we look at what all do we need we don't do that in public health we've tried and so you know what stockpiling 500 million of these in 95 would have been the difference between night and day and when you look at the price of one of those VS1 airplane not even close if you look at the things like that it's like these medication at or think about our defense department employees are at risk of running when we can start now but we're not going to fix it now is to say what are the key things that we should do vaccines you know if we had been serious about this we might very well had a coronavirus vaccine work specifically for this train will it work for SARS and MERS but right after Stars happened in 2003 everybody was hot and then when the interest rate is it something like the flu where you know sometimes when they come up with the flu vaccine it doesn't necessarily address the current strain it could be and that's where a coronavirus family vaccine may not match up right here now but it could end in the flu and you've really had an important Point there's one where you know we do have in it in perfect vaccine but it still does a lot of good you know if 50% of people protect that text lot better than zero if we had a vaccine right now I can't wait until the crisis to fix these things you know what we spend about .0001 percent of Public Health compared to our defense department and yet look how vulnerable is the bugs is not a war is not a missile is bringing down the world economy right now virus and that's what I lay on a whole plan in here like these vaccines like to stockpile some ass you know we should have a plan in place already what we going to do with our schools when they close are we going to really close calls let's not try to make this on the Fly and I just mentioned if we closed schools we are going to really hurt some people this is a wake-up call cuz you're nobody I think really believe that I got to take you know the market today cuz you know on this particular day crashed badly and you know I think that up till ten days ago the market didn't even think this was a possibility they just be if you look at it with flying high on Friday I did a briefing for over 400 major Financial investors around the world and you know I am Halifax and make sure people understand it the questions I got from these people almost remind me of a six-year-old who's afraid to have to go through on a dark dark hallway and I thought friends and colleagues Friday night through this we know where we going to go with it no plans again is caught Everybody by surprise I mean you were the one of the few people that wanted to deal with this issue you don't we set this up several weeks ago you know and I think that's where the country hasn't seen it caught by surprise</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> China because they have this incredibly large population 2 billion they've got this food supply that is largely Wildlife that comes into these markets weathers is incredible contact between people in these animals and the crowded nature of that society mean I think one of the things that surprised who in Wuhan city of 15 million the entire metropolitan area of 60 million and so you have crowded so closely together that if you add in the bugs coming from these animals and then the potential for this kind of of contact word spreads quickly has been a vessel for a long time that's again why we have to protect ourselves here because massive number like these kind of cities these wet wet markets so that's what it is a lot of I remember one day buy my own half wild big mean in these titles every animal imaginal to humans and I swear to God they were some of the movies I think that were in there and they're all just right on top of each other and I actually have a picture that I show him some of my lectures there was a situation with all these chickens in a cage 15 or 20 getting a flu viruses if you wanted to create the perfect experiment that no no University you do research group and let you do is you put birds and ferrets like that together and so together as a ferret to put down some markers on what they're going to do to supervise these markets have to eat but I think this is a dangerous practice where we see it but you know what happens to look at Africa with ebola primary source of this outbreak in West Africa was so it went somewhere pretty big bats you know they're very literally 3 ft wingspan so they're big and so you know that's one of the challenges we have with with China we know that this was going to happen is going to occur we think of the flu viruses the same way and that's how we knew doing better flu vaccines usually beef flu pandemic the same thing hanging out and some of them are still alive and then they'll actually preparing for your right there they they basically kill him and got him and so forth to get some pictures up there's are there you go.

I would have been hurting that ramira but probably hurting yourself kicking it on me just Solid Rock is a solid imagine. And he didn't just a break-in hurt him affected. Uses length uses reach uses attributes down the outside use the he's a higher-level kickboxer use that you know and try to lure them into you know attacking encounter those those attacks but it's one of those things with ABC like when Tyron Woodley Wonderboy kind of same thing geologist are there let's just be in a really exciting but you lose if I'm going to have that sort of a special feature in your card right those hot those punch holes are valuable and you you let yourself get cracked when you didn't have to there's no need for that you should always fight smart it's dangerous enough do you let yourself get cracked when you didn't have to there's no need for that yeah you should always fight smart it's dangerous enough to fight smart hitting look at hit and I love that you know that's how I believe as well you know that's why it's just Styles it's just style the way Styles match up</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when did you start training what year do start I started doing it for that you're not even 10 years knowing he's so I actually started MMA training as just a kid two cakes while offline bug lake so I was you know that was when I was 214 pounds so that's something that obviously when you when I'm farting and you say 240th and O what is exactly 6 on a good diet give me a good stretch at do some yoga sessions at 5:46 but you know what I mean it's just I wanted to stay fit in between ya and in between Luxor of the Season preseason so that's why I went and started and just loved it ever since that was about Guerrilla volume are you guys say it was size you so you were early early twenties and know martial arts training it all before that wrestled so I wrestled before I even done rug Blake arrested for about probably yeah I kind of remember was about a year and you know I'm pretty good actually pretty good at but you know what I play football with my mites and drive away in the tots United wrestling and stuff like that I was just something that yeah I end up just playing for the night so I sort of gave it up and I was actually pretty good at so we wanted to win the Nationals lucky Estates the wrestling is known as Big in Australia as it is over here but you know I still want to look around Championship twice and stuff like that to have a game tonight because that a PCYC Place Boys Club it's just a local Club usually don't have no games not tonight that wrestling day and I just went there one time and another tryna was just like Alicia coming into trying to go so I just thought of doing it and then I was actually pretty good again I was always the mother's room 12 person God wants us all to me and you know Tomatoes all that much older as well and I used to do well so that's why little people you have photos mad you know when I gave that up because I was doing so good and then the sign was about to be late when the play-by-play giving people photos mad giving that up as well because of something was pretty good as well so what made you decide to make a switch to MMA professionally football play of the match score for email try so you can imagine that guy running for teemagers was just so I was trying it and having couple of thoughts while I was playing rugby league pretty full-on solo happening you know I guess that's probably where I get some My Fitness today as well you know I mean up just always been a bit of a game and then I'll just it's just something I've always done but maybe from back in the days as well but I really do I look in American football mike I think rugby safer I don't think it's safe it's obviously a very rough combat sport be a lot of limits kind of a cop it's kind of like a team combat sport but you were at least not under the illusion that you're protected like American football players have been for so long with the helmets in the pads and that's what's causing a lot of the brain trauma don't run in a tepee no no no helmet as well but I get what you're saying I actually think that you know I think you're right I think it down there I think they they considered this but people are so accustomed to football helmets football pad so the idea is to just make better helmets and better pads but according to the guys who really study traumatic brain injury that's not going to help because it's the impact of the had the brains washing around inside your skull that is just so the amount of mass that you have these guys colliding into each other almost unavoidable actually when you talk in person and that is willing to love people you know obviously wake up the smaller clubs within the boxes that they have more padding but it's just so many more strikes to the head and they recognize actually and I can imagine is and then also there's nothing else you can't even louder it goes to the ground you can hang on you could try to submit someone you try to wrestle with them there's not a lot of options inboxing you know I definitely so what so you you did well in rugby and you had a couple of fights while you're playing right what was it was it just a one-on-one aspect of it like what made you decide to focus entirely on that. And I love the fact that you know you're in there by yourself you know I've always been so you can play the time of your life in USA Rugby leg and still lose where you can do everything right in a Nike thousands of meters whatever it is and if I am Papas and you knowing the gym you going to say that Comfort on and I'll go no one else to blame but myself so you know that's all boys love that and again I just always love martial arts boxing UFC even before I even started in a training MMA Outlook and listen to music and all that unites picture myself in the world to AutoZone can you can watch whatever time you want and the pipe of you was at Publix inside a butt in the pipe with you was on and I remember watching Chuck Liddell Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock that was the first time they first thought so the first time I ever thought about you in like UFC and that's when I just absolutely stopped loving it's always been in there and all that and I wasn't even trying to talk he doesn't mean that there's a lot of them are sure there's some pussies over there to cut their men you know what I mean like this like one of the ways people look at Australia it's like it makes sense yet great combat sport athletes who come out of Australia Gonna Fly to know what soda stop but when I was younger that that would happen and I saw the boys they known to fight and being able to flattop a thing of voice at this year so to defend myself and I want to start it but I have to finish it but it's just something that I guess I'm heading me so talented God you never got a lot of that very good athletes everyday but they're always in your rugby legs and I have fell or whatever it is now UFC and MMA is getting so big that you're wigging these athletes starting in a training tonight and you're only going to say it grow even more when we going to get a little more Champions coming out for me original they're good athletes everyday but they're always in your rugby legs and I have fell or whatever it is now UFC and MMA is getting so big that you're wigging these athletes.

		<div class="paragraph"> well what else can people do in terms of all this hand sanitizer Jazz and masks is that all right thing for stopping a lot of infectious diseases they actually are really good they're good for your hands do you know in terms of the skin they kill the bed bugs but the whole issue of using your hands touching your face be transmitted that way so I wouldn't tell you to stop using hand sanitizers but don't think it's going to have a big impact on this f*** you see that viral video that's going around that woman who is giving the address at the best of the White House and she she date she tells people not to touch their face and then immediately licks her finger and I did sausage and you know the data we have on this is so sparse to say that that's the case I think the primary thing about hand washing is is legitimate but one of the things people want to do something they want to be able to like they're doing something and so we tell him wash your hands often in 2% this to prevent this disease and I feel like we're not being really honest with the people can you stop this disease which there's two kinds terms of the air coming in on the side they're not they're not effective at all so people wearing they look like they're doing something or not now if you are sick they may help a little bit from you transmitting because if you cough then you cough right into that cloth and the other one that was called an n95 respirator but drawing I'm just saying that that's how I look at it all the time and helped her all the time and they use me about 90% of my using industry so when they're grinding things are asbestos osetra another don't breathe in all these parts so if we have one of those battle to some Costco don't have the money to do that those Preppers right now are so excited yeah all the properties across the guy knew it I knew the day would come yet will they are they are and this is really important because how healthcare workers go is how the country I think we'll see we're going the other been over 4,000 healthcare workers in China who are infected mini of on their job and a number of died and if in this country we have a real challenge delivering healthcare because we roll and then we have healthcare workers picking up the infection like we talked about the group in Milan and we don't have the protection for them I really believe that's when the public will say wait a minute what's going on here and and that's where I think the challenge we have lived affect your healthcare workers they are the front line of people and end the biggest probably have a lot of these those people get infected the doctor and nurse working intensive care it's not like you just took out another Soldier you took out a special forces person you just can't bring somebody in from Family Practice forever and put them in there and so we've got to protect these workers and why I'm really concerned that that's one of the areas we not done nobody stockpiles we have no capacity to make lots of small the sudden you know prior to this event the hospital purchasing agent would go online workers and I'm really concerned that that's one of the areas we not done nobody stockpiles we have no capacity to make lots of money all the sudden you know prior to this event the hospital purchasing agent would go online click a button send me five thousand of these will be there the next morning</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you said when you sat down was absolutely perfect that the timing could not have been better tell everybody thank you I understand where they come from so we can make sure they don't happen in the first place but most of all trying to respond to situations just like this just like this and just out off the bat overblown or how do you stand on this first of all you have to understand the timing of it in the sense that is just beginning and so in terms of what hurt pain suffering death has happened so far is really just beginning this is going to unfold for months to come yet unless I think what people don't quite understand what we saw in China I'm convinced as are many of my colleagues as soon as they release all of these social distances is mandated stay and Holmes have Straumann weeks and weeks kind of thing when they go back to work there on Planes Trains and Subways buses crowded spaces manufacturing plants even try to come back again and so this really is acting like an influenza virus something that transmits very very easily through the are we now have data to show that you're infectious before you even get sick and in some cases and remind people that's just the beginning probably the best guess what we have right now on what limited data we have to say this going to be at least 10 to 15 times worse than the worst 10 to 15 X fatalities over 480,000 can occur over the next three to seven months with this situation so this is not one that to take lightly and I think that's what I can understand if you say 10-4 2450 desk just remember two weeks ago we are talking about almost no cases United States and now that we're testing for it and watching this bread he's like the second spread very quickly and it also can affect people I think maybe to put this into modern turn to this is something we think of often and we think of you know pre-antibiotic days you know the old time medicine we have an employee at our Center for infectious research and policy at the University Minnesota and she has a dear friend who lives in Milan Italy and she works at a hospital and she texted this to this employee of ours last night and this was an email that came out yesterday from one of their in Blount the largest hospital. He said I just got a very disturbing message from a cardiologist at one of them Milan's largest hospitals they're deciding who they have to let die they aren't screening the staff anymore because they need all hands on deck and have a very small areas of the hospital dedicated to non-coated Patient or they still screen doctors everybody else is dedicated to covid-19 so even if they're positive me if they're sick they don't invite they don't have a severe cough or fever and they have to work he says that they're seeing an alarming number of cases in the fortysomething range rage and is Holy hook horrible cases so we need to stop thinking that this is annoying Old person's disease but this is what I'm going to unfold not just a move on some folding Moline is unfolding here and Seattle and this is what's going to continue to Rolling Lee unfold throughout the world rumor come from that it's an old person's disease people that have died from it so far been older yes in fact that's the primary risk factor for Dyna Speedo old and then having certain underlying health problems for example in China those men over the age of 70 who also smoked ate 10% of them died 65% of older Chinese men smoke the case fatality rate the challenge we have is it that's the Chinese data but there are series of risk factors that we worry about that if they overlay on this disease are going to cause bad outcomes and we happen to be right at Ground Zero for one of the major ones here in this country has obesity we know that obesity is just like smoking in terms of its ability to really cause severe life-threatening disease and 45% of our population today over the age of 45 in this country are obese or severely obese we have is we're going to see more of these but I would guess I would call very serious and life-threatening cases occur in our country because of a different set of risk factors and we saw in China you mentioned that there's some sort of an incubation period before people become sick they're still contagious what is incubation. And how do we know about it when we call something an incubation. Talk about from the time you and I got exposed I was in a room somebody else who was infected with the virus was expelling out I breathed it in how long from that time. Tell the time. That you get sick and what is that is that we called incubation. So that's when case numbers can double or triple and every so many days in this case is about four days so and we actually have data there from people who are exposed one time for one time only and we know when they were exposed were there were exposed how soon do they get sick afterwards so the chauffeur in the car with an individual is sick showing symptoms than the show forgets it 4 days later they were there one time and one time only the chauffeur does not show any symptoms he's still contagious because he's okay this is what's unfolding here and in this is what I think is such an important and I said why the timing is so important cuz you know Joey really got to get information off the public there's so much mess around for information right now and you know we're going to be this for a while this is not going to happen overnight I worry I keep telling people were handling this like it's a Corona blizzard you know two or three days and 6 months or more that are going to be like this and you know so far this thing turn on folding exactly as we predicted it we on our Center put out a piece on January 20th and said this is going to spread worldwide have time people said I was just trying to be put out a piece the first week of February said this is going to pop probably the last week of February first week of March is what happens if it has what's called are not or a doubling time of these every four days do to increase is doubling every 4 days so if you go from 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 it takes a while to build up that's what we're seeing happening places like Italy we're beginning to see it in some ways up in Seattle with what happened in China and you know when people are confronted with that suddenly this low-risk phenomena there were talks about isn't solo anymore and that's we need to prepare people for now what can be done like what what can the average person do I see people walking around with masks on wearing gloves is that nonsense largely first of all ocean is just a restaurant just breathing in studies in Germany which just have been published literally in the last 24 hours they actually followed a group of people who have been exposed to so many automobile manufacturing plant and then they had nine people that with this exposure he said if you have any symptoms virus they did blood they did stool they did he earn any found it at that very moment when they first got sick they had in Crowley high levels of virus sometimes ten thousand times that we saw was SARS in their throat mean they were infectious at that point already they hadn't even had symptoms yet over and and that's where we're concerned because then vaccine we don't have a vaccine here so what's happening is people in public spaces are getting infected and the way you need to address that is unfortunately if you're older over 55 you have some underlying health problems which unfortunately allowed Americans do we have obesity then right now you don't want to be in large public spaces what we eat we can close schools one of the big challenges we have right now if we closed schools what we accomplished and influenza virus when we closed schools that kids are in school really good news features of this disease China only 2.1% of the cases were angry 19 years of age and you know we don't completely know because I still get infected with the virus but they don't get sick I get sick and the kids do symptoms are going to test against are all positive so some diseases will manifest my primary when your adult but not as a child this one appears to be the same so do we close schools or not if we're not really spreading the disease because it turns out that if we closed schools with a recent study done showed that 38% of nurses today in this country who are working in the medical area have kids to school and suddenly 1/4 of the population has no sick leave if we closed schools they don't get paid if they have to stay home so when you ask what can we do we have to really be thoughtful about what we do are we doing more harm than good by closing schools for example if nobody else I hope we got to do everything we can or do we just tell people you know it's going to be a limiting your contact as much as you can and that's really about what we can do and limiting the contact is that really going to help do not transmit as much if I'm if I'm sitting in a room with a hundred people and what kind of sharing are the Transmissions remarkable right here the off the coast of California you get your cruise ship cruise ships for recirculating air inside the inner cabins we've had a number of outbreaks that's why I'm having these outbreaks quarantines of some kind of a want and follow up on him but you're guaranteed they're all going to keep getting infected day after day it seems like we're not really prepared for something with this although the CDC has been telling us for a long time that we should be you know we are not prepared at all things to come you know what a flu pandemic would look like if it emerged in China and if you read it it's exactly what's happened to supply chains went down trying to lock down the country it spread to other countries people have pointed fingers and you know it's it's the kind of thing where we hear in here but we don't get prepared you know five years ago I gave a talk at the Mayo Clinic a picture of a building Puerto Rico nondescript building and I said this is our next big disaster turns out that 85% of all the world's production of IV bags with sailing we need desperately we're made in these plants in Puerto Rico and all we needed was one one Category 5 hurricane Maria this is a wake-up call the business Community I hopefully will wake up you know what are the other things were doing right now this is really one of the things that has been most concerned about this whole situation is our group has been studying for the last year-and-a-half with support from the Walton Family Foundation looking at it turns out that we identified that people need right now are they died on the crash cart all of them basically are made offshore the United States and large part mermaid in China and India and at this point we have shortages anyway everyday but just before this prices happened now they Supply chains have gone down our group is actively helping United States government try to figure out anybody else they are beholding in China for these drugs 690000 Americans have end-stage renal disease right now most of their private. You're coming from China and now with the shutdown that was happening with us and this is what I talked about in the book why I'm so concerned because we are at risk situation it's about what the entire system is rigged up to be and what does virus does once it gets into it does once it gets into it Jesus you make me nervous before we get done here to talk about what we can do to get people not nervous because this it's too late</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the average person that is sitting around reading these articles that say don't worry or readings aren't these articles that say this is the end of humanity what would what could these people do like what what could they do and what do they do if they get infected or first of all and and let me just give you an example because we've heard a lot about Wells going to go away with the coronavirus with the seasons okay when it warms up it'll go away well you know the other coronavirus have that we've had to worry about was SARS which appeared in 2003 in China and when that came out illness in the name really Crash and Burn and many of them died but what we did was basically by knowing that identify these cases in their contacts quickly and so they had symptoms brought them in put them in these isolation rooms they wouldn't infect anybody else and it took until June to bring out of your control that had nothing to do with the seasons which is another Coronavirus by the way sorry it was palm civets and we the type of animal food the roads that we got out of the markets are in the Arabian Peninsula we're not going to use that 1.7 camels and there it's a hundred and ten degrees out in this virus is transmitted find thank you I mean it goes from animals to people that goes in the hospital's there's no evidence that seasonal there because there's a model for it and what will it be because how does a how does something like stars run through a population then stop being around anymore we had good Public Health had we had the same kind of transmission where you're highly infectious illness and you knew that you are in trouble and then you could isolate you and we didn't understand virus transmitted so that's why I stopped because we don't get rid of the camel switch keeps hitting humans day after day but then when I go to the hospital we no longer allow those individuals to transmit to others in the hospital cuz we do what we called good infection control soon as they get there during special rooms with special mass and all this kind of thing buddy saying about seasonal flu year you know we're going to stop this one if you don't have vaccine that works you don't it's just breathing that's all it is so what's the best-case scenario here come with us and so we don't quite know what it's going to do yet I think you know we've been right on the mark predicting where it's going to be today I think from here on out I can tell you it's going to stay around for months is not going to go away tomorrow we got to stop thinking about if we just get through tomorrow that's it so we're going to prepare to do that rods in the reaction I should say and then it stopped by itself but also because if your if two of the three of us in this room room you in right now to protection because natural protection that I couldn't transmit to anybody so that's what's going to happen if you had enough people get infected all family then slow down stop transmission that way but that's a heck of a price to pay to get there flu or something that's really ruthlessly deadly 1% of people who died and grandkids mostly older or younger people that's one out of a thousand with this one right now in China were seeing between 2 and 3% of the people die in summer this is okay but on the other hand we have a lot of different people in countries like ours that have even more risk factors for having that outcomes in China and so Spanish Flu 1918 that was about a 3 to 3.2% case fatality right now it did preferentially impact 18 to 25 year old brainstorm which is an antibody response in your body that's out of control and it basically you destroy yourself and it sets this thing up to trigger off so the healthier people have the more adverse reaction to exactly the part of that immune system that woman says this is not all me get rid of this like a rejection of a graft and the other part saying it's the most precious cargo / carry you know I got to make sure I don't lose it and when that virus got in between those two it started again that same kind of cytokine storm now the thing that concerns us about this fortress on in in 1989 really bad flu year at .1% and it could be as high up here you know getting closer 2-19-18 like and that's the numbers I just gave you a few minutes ago from the American Hospital Association of funeral 480,000 us here in this country over the next 6 to 12 months</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> earlier about probiotics is there a benefit of probiotics once you've taken antibiotics to refurbish your gut Flora you know that's where the study is really at this point have demonstrated that it's very temporary in other words if you're taking probiotics you can get a boost initially but it doesn't sustain itself over time in the natural Flora comes back but what I'm saying is is it beneficial to people if they do take a probiotic after antibiotics does antibiotics do have a devastating effect on your floor is it beneficial for people once they have taken an antibiotic to take probiotics with rotary flourish at least temporary support that they don't stay around what if you just keep taking it they just don't stay around your normal gut Flora will come back and take over so the probiotics and of themselves are not giving you that long-term boost so you don't think there's any benefit to having even even short-term boost now there's one exception to that where I would say this is a very different thing than probiotics but we actually have a disease called Clostridium difficile which is bad bacteria that happens when you take too many antibiotics and it's colonizers your gut cuz you don't have competing organisms there and then you can die from this there are treatments for that called actually fecal transplants drinking poop purified purified bugs from the poopy right but you take that and that's what that's that kinda is what you're talkin about that does have real benefit and there is clear evidence that if you take those those people transplants as opposed to just probiotics with such that that can have a major positive impact on your recovery from things like classroom difficile infection and so more more institutions now actually are doing which you never thought that that would be but are those who've had problem there their life saving there maybe we should change the name that would get you don't forget it if you that's what's going to be nerve-wracking to people I've never really done much better much better</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I seek the advice of experts whenever possible and what what I was seeing was that there was a lot of weird misinformation and I could conflicting information lot of people saying don't worry in a lot of people that were terrified I'm like okay I got to talk to an expert and lucky you were willing to sit down with us and help us out hope you tell him the stuff they're going to panic can I say what what's Panic if you see anybody ride in the streets yet have you seen cars turned over smash you seen people hurting themselves over this issue if they're concerned they want legitimate information and so what you need to do is just tell him the truth and we have many experiences like that a few years ago thousand people were in so we had a big town meeting several thousand people showed up and I addressed them and gave me everything I knew about meningitis were going to do about it a cetera and then towards the end of the flock I said I just need to let you know about one out of every seven cases of this dies and then they got on with dealing with it we vaccinated the whole town 20,000 people affection one weekend for this bacterial meningitis but it was because they had faith enough cuz we told him the truth and we said what we know and we didn't know so that's what we need to do here then you just have straight talk don't tell him it's low-risk hurricane that's when you do today is just say this is going to be challenging and we're going to get through it. We are going to get through it I hope this wakes people up to the value of vaccines to there's so many wackos out there that think that vaccines are you know us scam or they're dangerous or if it's there so many people out there that won't vaccinate their children I couldn't agree with you more I think that's really important point that the you know we got to get this idea these vaccines can be life-saving if we had one right now think how different the situation being wearing right now it would be radically different. You see that the measles making a comeback and vaccines we are just finally bring into a closed this outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo far Northeast part of the Congo 20-something 2800 people have died from this okay been going on for almost 2 years totally preventable mean I think that's why I have to say thank you for what you do say about vaccines cuz people listen to you and we need every positive ways cuz we have so many crazy voices out there right now that are seated arm medical innovation in in human culture and that's vaccines it's amazing what is done have there been adverse effect effects on people course everything everything that people do there's some people are going to react in a bad way it doesn't mean it's not a positive thing and there's a reason why the cases of polio or so tiny is a reason why smallpox went away it's because of vaccines text Nate until we get enough people not vaccinated and then look what happened there's a famous photo of two twins from the early Twentieth Century one of them has smallpox and one of them was vaccinated have you seen that I have I have skin all over his bodies faces hands and then his brother right next to him with nothing and you know what's really important to note here is that in that body all those things are very painful but what's going on inside the body is equally bad and so don't get diseases of terrifying they're really terrifying and went something like this can be prevented and the reason why people don't do it is because they're avoid vaccines and they get that information from some wacko website or some person who really has no business talking about it you know whether it's the people out there that the think that causes diseases or that the government plot or that it's a medical scam because just trying to raise raise money it's just all of it all of it very very disturbing but it's part of people you know that human beings for whatever reason there's a percentage of us that lean towards conspi toriel thinking and did the lean towards thinking that there's some sort of a plot against them or the government's against them it's just got to listen to Medical experts the chapter on coronavirus is the title is SARS and MERS a harbinger of things to come I mean we don't we should be funding these things almost like we pay for our fire department if we had to go out and buy a fire truck</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> ask about Lyme disease Lyme disease is a scary one right then. I mean so many of my friends in East Coast have it it's really terrifying that that did that part of the country in particular seems to be like really badly infected with these these texts that would carry this disease what can people do to prevent that and what what can weed has no vaccine for Lyme disease and I know there wasn't one point but people were having an issue with a good friend of mine actually got Lyme disease from the vaccine before they discontinued it what can someone do to sort of protect themselves United States named after Lyme Connecticut it's a disease that actually probably originated in the Upper Midwest and I tell you that because it turns out that there is a focus in northern Wisconsin and and East Central Minnesota where there's Lyme disease is a disease called anaplasmosis a human deer kind of component and back in the CCC of the 1930s the whitetail deer population had been virtually totally depopulated from the Northeast and so they actually trapped here in northern Wisconsin and took them out and deposit them in the New York and Connecticut and so forth and most of those deer are actually deer that you know today Hillsdale College in my knowledge of Davis we're up in northern Wisconsin that has Jerry come into the check station and they would actually measure the number of ticks are attached to the nape of the neck and they had a lot of things wrong and they asked Hunters who are driving back to Madison and Milwaukee if they would be willing to check in at the station down there for just a second and then they're going to count the kicks again and it turned out that as the vehicle come rolling down from Highway 51 from northern Wisconsin get on the interstate 90-94 and go to Milwaukee or Madison but it's just kept falling off that this Lyme disease issue is a key 1 Lyme disease is really important disease it's real no question about the challenge we have is that there's a lot of people that assume that they have chronic lyme infection and you're the data on that is just really really not there to support that these people are chronically infected but they do have an immune response it again for the bacterial infection it's a fact that this bought at your bone body's immune systems we've talked about several times today I starts attacking you so I think it's a summer picture with chronic fatigue syndrome same kind of thing these people really are sick they really do have problems but it's not something you can treat someone people I have a challenge because when people take IV antibiotics that extended periods of time for Lyme disease had what we call a double-blind control placebo-controlled trial where half got the drug half got a IV but no drug and it turned out all four of these studies in Lyme disease the people who got the gist of placebo did just the same as the people got the truck and I worry that were using antibiotics a lot there in this is where I just mentioned earlier about claustrum difficile died from the IV treatment for what was chronic lyme disease helpful and so we need a lot more research in this area to figure out what are these people getting what is it that we can shut off so that they don't have this chronic lyme disease picture knowing that it's not actually just you have to treat him or treatment so I can help him with the antibiotics anymore and so I think that that's an area that we just need a lot more working and numbers are growing as you know game systems really cranked up immune system is playing something bacteria but if we treat you is that like it's like every other picture you can really get rid of it but I used to have this chronic illness that's occurring and what I think is hard is that we see people who have those who are desperate to have somebody understand what they have and they end up going to people who take advantage of a clinician to charge them an arm and a leg for things that are not going to help them and drugs can we used to it reverses immune system disorder I am a friend of mine who's a UFC fighter Jim Miller and he's he's got Lyme disease and it's pretty bad he takes a stack of pills I don't know what he takes every day what do you think someone is taking and what what benefit would they get from that I couldn't help but I'm not without knowing what it's there but again it's not that the bacteria still growing like it might be for a lot of people in autoimmune it's autoimmune that which is real you know that this is another thing you'll find interesting Minnesota prior to the arrival the first Whiteman the Native Americans burnt March 1st 8 all the time the Prairies for much of the territory even in northern Wisconsin Northern Minnesota we had the classic you know Pine Forest firewood White's room and so much of the forest that the you have a very different kind of mammals population d r a cetera et cetera and with the suppression of fire what's happened is we now have instead of having these old growth for us we have all those younger you know Nann Pine or any kind of like the old trees of the Upper Midwest Elms in the maples and everything else comes in in the Buckthorn all that kind of stuff and takes over so so what's happening is in in our state of Minnesota is we have a really good example of this is we're losing her moose and the big primary reason is brain worm the North in Minnesota and where that intersection is we're starting to see moose develop his brain worm infection cuz it's from the deer so the tick population has changed to due to the fire lack of fire in many places in the Northeast never used to be like it was with her all the time that would clear out natural everything so so one of the challenges we have with Texas is there here we're not going to change how we live suburbs and trees and all of that controlled Burns eliminate a lot of them ironically the Moocher population is expanded dramatically Isle Royal why because there's no deer out there and so they're not getting brain worm out there so people have said you know the we're going to lose our mood as well as well as the deer so so fire actually has helped the most in areas in northern Minnesota where there's been a lot of fire the Moose populations growing because the deer or not there because exactly those mammals or rodents and so forth are very different and burnt-out areas and they are in will they do controlled Burns in some states I got a lot of friends hunting in Washington state a couple years ago and he said it was really weird because there's these massive fires in the distance that were actually being controlled they do it on purpose which is a lot better than having the out-of-control fires where you have so much fuel problem with the east coast is you're dealing with a lot of these sort of almost residential area that it had all these ticks for Lyme disease for us we need is there any kind of an animal not enough now they're they're doing very well thank you text do very well as you know so heavy in in certain times of the year at the really literally takes a lot of blood happens day after day so that is a hit on it's a real hit on them to pull up the picture that took a freak people out there to watch online just didn't need to see this it means it's not affecting me until someone in your family has it UFC fighter Marcus Davis who he put He had his wife got Lyme disease and he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to trying to help burn in do something about and treatments and all these different things for it it's it's a challenge and this is another area again you know when you think of the amount of money we lose in just lost time let alone pain and suffering now this is the kind of infectious diseases really need to Renaissance I mean when we do a lot of the United States where they showed the areas that are affected by these 6 + what what percentage of ticks carry Lyme disease they've tested and some places in the Northeast Us in the 60 for sale you still there they're very real coyotes in Central Park they do absolutely in the Bronx they have them in it makes weird it's weird to see because this is something that just didn't exist before and how these coyotes have that all over the poor dears when they got rid of the wolves and they try to do the same to the coyote they just actually expanded their territory and they're sneaky very clever little animals adaption just like microbes coyotes. How when they got rid of the wolves and they try to do the same to the coyote they just actually expanded their territory and their sneaky very clever little animals adaption there's like microbes adaption</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> did I ever tell you the story about my friend Phil Hartman when he was a kid he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix for one night he was like what it whatever you would call it a grip someone who's on the road a stage text and and and he's there putting his hands on speakers making sure they don't fall over because they were kind of seriously close to the edge and away from me I could have touched them Hendrix Phil Hartman told me with great with me and Phil Hartman got high a couple times when we did lose radio together it wasn't wasn't much he got high he got high a lot I matter fact I might not have even gotten I definitely a drunk anyway he was telling me about when he was a teenager that he worked with Jimi Hendrix he was at the whiskey when he was a teenager Jimmy died in the late 70s right I think that was 24 years later that make sense if he was like 19 is a time or some like that wow so anyway he's a kid and Hendricks is right in front of him and his job is to make sure the speaker doesn't fall into the crowd and he's looking up at the stage Santa in his prime and I went out when everything is going down you couldn't believe it was real you couldn't believe you stand right in front of you exist before Hendrix Hendrix and everything else is like what you read about Eric Clapton quotes about seeing Hendrick play for the very first time it's fascinating cuz you realize like the top of the food chain guitarist go to see Hendricks and then Phil said it was happening right in front of me fill in a wood dabbling music for funny really enjoyed like playing guitar f****** around do for him to be a kid and be standing right in front of Hendrick performing was like wow that's a new one right dog whistles only been around for like 2 years has people calling something a transphobia homophobic our sex is dog-whistle like holy s*** like you can't say anything anymore I was on the internet very early 1987 before the world wide web and you may remember we had something called you snap group yes and you snap groups and the way used to work because we didn't really have a widely spread internet back then accepted universities now is on MTV and when I saw the unit like holyfuck I'm emailing with kids my audience who are not counted in the ratings by the way College audience don't count in the Nielsen ratings released didn't at the time and they want something very different from what MTV playing so I was like wow this is interesting cuz I got into these Usenet groups in the way that worked if you post something and then overnight it will be copied all around the internet and how to connect with special server when you pulled into groups that you had subscribed to and so really it was kind of a it wasn't immediate conversation we post something and then people would reply back and I just kind of jumped into feet and immediately f*** you commercial what's the quote like that you supposed to go to the bottom and the top and I'm like well what's going on and what that was is the minute you have the opportunity for people to say stuff anonymously they turn into giant dick bags almost everybody this is just an easier way to do it now we made it so easy and with all the little the and I think I'm big Louis have swollen because of this and then you get this you respond differently to what you think is an attack in the attack Reddit and you know this shouldn't have registered in your brain is it something really dangerous to go back on them but they're not and that's the that's the best thing than the blue checkmark became a little more interesting which I don't have and I tried to get one for a long time and they somewhere over there hates me and now really I've never gotten a blue checkmark I don't want one now now to me it's the mark of the beast you got a blue checkmark you know I'd be looking over my shoulder man is like so now that's become kind of those those the people that now risk being deplatformed because you have status until it's going to bang against these people like the f*** this guy so it's some human nature that is just exist within us know if you really easier for me to go online and under whatever Twitter handle had Joe rubbing you dick wouldn't say that to your face looks to be the fuc up some know both my parents converted from Judaism to Catholicism where they met each other that's what I'm getting to is during the during the second world war they were both in New York first generation American Jews they converted for different reasons from each other and then they met my father's family was Orthodox and his father and him shepsle deubner would come here when he was in his maybe late 20s from Poland he still lived as everyday in Brooklyn as if you were still in Poland you didn't change at all when my father converted and his father found out my father was in the war he was overseas he was home on leave and his father was cleaning up in from my father's pants that he left over chair rosary beads slipped out and fell on the floor that's how his Jewish father ships will do when you're found out that his son had become a Catholic so what he did is he proceeded to sit Shiva for him the Jewish mourning ritual or for 7 days you mourn the dead he he declare that he would never again speak to his son and he forbade everyone in his family speaking to his son so I owe the time I was born I was the youngest of eight kids in this family because they become very Catholic I didn't know this whole family of my father's was unknown to me entirely so they did exactly what you're saying now did the same thing but it was less dramatic cuz her family was less religious so they still did take it all that she'd converted but you got any children yeah I got a couple again though it's alongside my first of the first book ever with long before Freakonomics with called turbulent Souls although it got been republished under different title called Choosing My Religion and it tells us the story of my my two parents around me are children so no chance but but on the other hand maybe this is what Freakonomics is what I try to learn through doing Freakonomics is you know to measure the what and try to figure out the why but then not be the judge who says that was terrible this is wonderful because you know different people I have to look if she absolutely were here we can ask him what's your side of the story he could tell us a story that might convince us that you know what this son of his did a terrible thing to the family did a terrible thing you know he would say how could it be that we Jews existed for generations and generations and generations when everyone lived there was always someone trying to you know get rid of us and then we finally come to America you know the land of Freedom religious freedom economically and Hereafter generations and generations of forefathers fought to stay Jewish hear my son decided to become Catholic what are you thinking so you know everybody's everybody's got a perspective everybody's got an emotional experience so I try to respect that but no I would not do that to my children that their pool with a pulling it back with fishing wire to keep it up on his head that just seems he seems oddly stiff you know I'm saying yeah like it seems like everything is pulled Victor certain amount of laxity in a man's face when he reaches a certain age particular around the forehead area I'm just not seeing it I'm not seeing any movement either which makes me wonder about that like I want to see expressions in your forehead My worry is his lack he has a very big that he lacks the ability to have like a cohesive story but he's not good at being bunch of little black kids be like in the black kids will come up and they see my hair go up and Bubbles come up his brain is it he's losing a lot of I tweeted something this morning cuz there was someone put a video of models on the runway on a catwalk and they're all tripping and falling at the same spot these dumb she was there and I was like this is Biden's brain cells it's like they think you're on the right path of the they get there are now and then and then he called his wife isn't everything you know that you know I forget what it was ever forget with The Gap was but it was one of those we listen to me like what your what do you say it like it's it's like he has no brakes I want to have a different take on it cuz I listen to I said all I know what he's doing when do you think it is from the bottom on the second he doesn't want to hear it what's the old man who can't talk like this is not a joke like that right now you know nothing play that again 2 into a mental hospital they should be like Hey Joe you are right he had three Strokes while he was saying that the first one what does that word dude self-evident is that we hold these truths to be self-evident yeah dude either drunk or you can't talk me it will just choose your bezel evident he shouldn't be doing this and then and then he says when he goes he could have just said all men and women are created equal and gotten out of there been like f*** it and said he goes being like f*** it looks instead he goes I think he didn't want to see the Creator because there's a lot of the religious thing what are you trying to say you believe in evolution or not are you a science denier Joe Biden the science denier</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> are you saying from your perspective saying like he he was a martial artist right so then isn't that still true without the movie should he was a phenomenal martial artist was definitely phenomena martial arts you can compete really compete well yeah I guess that's part of it but I mean like can you not compete and still be the top of a thing I mean is that possible I don't know man you know that's the one thing that if I was going to make an argument against me as a commentator for the MMA for MMA identify like it's kind of hilarious commentator for MMA you know I'm a fan of it I know mostly what I'm talking about I have it it's really interesting Cruise or work with Daniel Cormier can you call me in particular so I can of the best wrestlers to ever compete in MMA an active wrestling coach coaching two and Lara MMA coaching two but both guys are so good at breaking down the Tactical it makes you realize how little you really know about certain Specialties you know what is a good at what you did at the differences are they good at also articulating emotion and Publix the public of viewpoint that the difference I can give expert analysis of ground fighting ground fighting I can do the expert but just you know not to blow my horn but I know what's going on like the way a lot of people know what's going on with boxing I can tell you what's going on with chokes and when friends in trouble when someone's not and I could see it because I've been strangled a million times so I can't see that most MMA fighters at a certain point in time they know most basic s*** in terms of positions and when things are dangerous is. Gets exotic like weird rubber guard transitions or strange chokes like people invent new chokes all-time Zoe's like something new that you haven't seen before I caught a f*** that he do that and I have to go come watch it again but your people think how many people think that you did fight and I don't know how many a lot probably. I don't know I had two in one and kickboxing I lost my last kickboxing fight but as far as taekwondo I have no idea I won the Massachusetts state championship 4 years in a row and I want and I think it's called the American open which is a big turn when I came in second place in the u.s. cup that was a big thing in that was in Connecticut and I fought the national champion in the finals and I thought I'd beat him that was when I was like 1920 that was when I was at my best when I was around 21 before I try down for the Nationals and try was going to try to make the Olympic team that's what I was starting to box and kick box and I was losing faith in Taekwondo I was realizing that there was I had a distorted perception of what I could do so just wait for you and you were way more engage with boxing than you ever were with like it up yeah that's what it was I would go to these kickboxing gyms and when I would just bought when I kickbox guys I could kick them so hard they couldn't get close enough to box me a lot of time so I'd kick him in the arms I kick them and they be like what the f*** and then I could even though my hands weren't as good as those my legs were so much better cuz why these guys couldn't take it all so long as we're starting at a distance I could my legs into them and they just be terrified like so many guys just be worth who's trying not to get hurt and you can't kick this is a terrible feeling someone to see if someone in a fist fight I'm done I'm getting this pain in your arm like motherfuker it sucks dude but when I was boxing with you I was getting lit up and particular there's just one dude there's a box with his name was dangerous Dana rosenblatt and wound up to become the Massachusetts or the New England middleweight champion really good guy and I was sparring with him a lot in the beginning he was beating my ass and I was like damn this kid wants to fight way more than I do cuz I was already doing, the time and I'm starting to realize like I got to pick one of the other and then as I was getting into boxing this when I got into, right after my twenty-first birthday and so when I was getting into a trike really into kickboxing was like 20 into 21 and the same time I was thinking about doing stand-up and the same time as realizing Taekwondo is bulshit not not really bulshit but not for you and it's incomplete right to protect yourself you don't know where the punches are coming from me and you get used to it only way to get used to his to learn how to actually box and I didn't know how to actually box until I was like 1920 when I started going to these other gems and then when I when I realized I had these giant holes trying out for Taekwondo like doing Taekwondo tournaments and I still competed in Taekwondo but last I wasn't excited about it anymore cuz I realize like this is if I want to be a complete martial artist like I want to follow like Bruce Lee's teaching I found a hole in my game search it up there's a whole part that I thought I knew how to do and I didn't I got a punch things like I can post things hard but you think that's boxing until someone pops with a double jab left hook up to like boring to you too cuz I still wasn't the best in the country and I'd lost in the finals to the guy who is this Kareem Jabbar think his name was sounds good he was good I lost a lot of fights but there was ones that I won that I didn't get the decision of what a point system forget the side I never understood but I love boxing watching my whole life and things don't get I still don't get boxing scoring when you're like one where do they come up with these numbers just people that aren't good at it you know if you had like a boxing judge just like that's what I used to love about a county judges Letterman to tell you what the score was who tell you what the score was like so he would say this is how I have it play I wasn't bored with it in that I achieved the highest of heights it was that I realized it had holes in it like big holes huh big hole dig holes in a street fight with one of those boxers and I was in a bar where I couldn't throw a kick out of being deep s*** yeah deep s*** and side learn how to box but that was right still like Mike Spirit like I'm no expert that's my point like I'm not a guy who should be explaining like everything is going on but it's entertaining all these NFL guys are mad cuz Tony Romo got a 17 million dollar contract and they're way better than him on the field than he ever was on the eleven guys are getting paid way lesson this dude was the f*** is this dude getting paid as talking that's what makes Guys Like Me on Sanders he he does have and this is something that you would share his Acumen for the game is so strong but his also like his onions are so real that he's not trying to save a job a lot of times these announcers they strategist save a job you don't like doing the right thing me and say he doesn't give a f*** he'll call out an offense or defense and say well this is why they f***** up that last play and I think America goes oh s*** that's great that's cool to know versus someone just going here's a play-in there's a plan that would happen next better than anybody has he played The Game Genie just came off the field, and he's great DC DC, and yet Donna Cruz Paul Felder who's great attitude and all these guys that have fought before especially at the the really highest level maybe even fought some of the guys are doing commentary for they give real inside as two things that God does what they train for Tennessee's now he's great DC DC, thing yet. Chris Paul Felder who's great attitude and all these guys that have fought before especially at the the really high as level maybe even fought some of the guys are doing commentary for they give real inside as two things that God does what they train for tendencies</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I wonder if if you want alot the inside of your knees gets accustomed to it like I get to calus in there will know like it strengthens is that possible cartilage look it up baby cartilage is gone out of those ultramarathons how they do it year after year after year cuz it would have canceled their whole life you do for a chunk of time to your niece your schedule if you if you just a b**** you keep going if pushed through Wendy's window fixing himself legs just break and no usually likes Calas over once I can there's a campaign for a great cyclist called shut up legs if you look up shut up legs it's like a whole thing about his people worry about running ruins knees but a new study finds activity main fact benefits of joint changing the biomechanical environment inside the knee in ways they could help keep that could keep it works moot working smoothly made arthritis come on Ronnie may be good for your niece that's the New York Times you dummy You Don't Know Jack schitt epidemiological studies of long-term Runner show that they made that they generally are less likely to develop osteoarthritis in the knees and people the same age who do not run sometimes scientists speculate that running running may protect knees because his often associated with relatively low body mass caring less weight is known to reduce the risk of knee arthritis there's no evidence and proof they're just saying this is a possibility the widespread argument generally Falls the lines at running will slowly wear away the cartilage that cushions the bones in the joints and causes fries for this little evidence supports the idea that makes sense okay okay so what I was saying I was incorrect I was just tried to jump paragraphs I miss the context of it you would think they didn't these volunteer stop stop go back these volunteers visited Clinic where they have blood drawn from an arm to researchers also siphoned off a small amount of synovial fluid a lubricating fluid that reduces friction inside joints when the right knee healthy knees contain only ones that were soup console speculative to there's nothing to research supporting it to channel knows well it makes sense though that your muscles would be stronger and then that would probably support uni better than a person who doesn't exercise that cartilage wears out either way anybody you know that's a great athlete that was said that I need to meet cartilage and we're through so much like jumping a lot like cutting exploding I left you know I can move that you would you want to court you know and then if you're running on a trail or it's got some dirt get a little cushion in the other something other some George in there this is a 2017 this one is more updated off of a new myth toppling new study that says that middle-aged Runners do actually rebuild the health of their knees what did I tell you I had an idea what is the question again with the scroll up could it be that marathon training and racing are actually good for Arnie's maybe a new study you son-of-a-b**** Runner suggest the answer is a qualified yes the study finds that taking up distance running rebuild the health of certain essential components of middle-aged knees even if the joint stops off somewhat tattered and worn when I tell you b**** show me the results also contain a caution John mileage Cooter Road one vulnerable area within the needs the study finds if one is not careful focus on running activity harms needs to do scroll down the question is that the end of it so you're giving me s*** about I wouldn't know you wouldn't do it either I would do a half either I'm not doing it I don't wanna run with all the people very specific spot it says the Improvement to the damage subchondral bone of the tibial and femoral condyle lies make I know that they do microfractures and s*** like they do all kinds of different things to people to try to heal the cartilage in the knees right now I just realize how privileged running is that was like I just got to run sometimes during the day yeah just so you don't get so fat from eating all the food you want that's crazy all of our problem in America is eating too much food yet and we have way too much access its were spoiled with it but I just realized I got to go I can run to the gym and I'm home and that's a good nice day I get to have nice lucky dude man no I wouldn't you know I wouldn't run a marathon because I don't like the people that do that's genuinely at you see all the people that get accepted the thing the culture I don't want to be a part of it no thanks play music for hours before an actual Marathon plan things miserable if you had a track or go standard University track this is how how how many feet is that like was that quarter mile what's most are you paying me and Jamie but it seems like that would be a great bet if he's ultramarathon Runners ruined put their money where their mouth is the get-together on track see how long ago or s*** * 404 quarter of a mile that means four of them four of them are a mile so if you'd be pretty close to a hundred how you get to run a hundred four times to run a mile time to run a marathon on a track laps Yeah a hundred Laps on a track but now you're closing in on Marathon around around a hundred times it 100 four times as it is a marathon no way no f****** haven't you hit 7

		<div class="paragraph"> really bad stoppage this past weekend in the UFC really bad really bad I could so much controversy huh but this one was a bad one was the worst stoppage I've ever seen there was this guy who will pull up the you can find it in the UFC's I got to remember how to say this guy's name what he claimed he stopped the fight don't need to I was hurt and he wasn't hurt he was faking it okay so the Michael Medved Enclave she's think that's how you say it and I forget I say kudo Bella's first name of things to Aeon I think it's aeon coulibaly on soku Bell was playing possum if you watch the video you can see the video it looks like he's playing possum so he's pretending he's hurt see he got hit for sure but look how is his head back and forth he's Sakura man for that right hand right trying to pretend that he's hurt and then so that right hand the referee stops the fight while he's throwing her yeah yeah yeah he's like I'm fine what the f*** are you doing that's not a guy who's rocked if you watch it again you can see that he definitely is getting hit but you can also see that like when he like that this that's fake that that's wobbly with the head because you seem like Haymakers and trying to lower the guy into thinking that he's so her that he can't control himself in these trying to throw Haymakers please also definitely getting hit too so I can see how the referee fell for it but you got to let guys fight you got to let guys fight and sometimes referees in the interest of the fighter trying to save a guy from damaged they step in and they make a mistake that's an easy mistake to make cuz it is a really bad stoppage but because the fact that he was faking like he was hurt but he wasn't faking like he was hurt enough to stop a fight now it didn't look like it back with big wild Haymakers he can win any time has been many many fights where you see a guy win a fight is getting dominated because he catches go get overzealous and turn right and that's what we got robbed up referee f***** up or the you know the referee booked up but he also was a little bit tricked by this guy trying to lower this guy in by pretending and then exploding he didn't even if the guy was really that rocked it wasn't enough stop the fight that guy was throwing back he was defending himself it was moving back with his hands up and turn and fight you don't defy just doesn't end when someone gets hit or ignore the fight and you can't protect yourself anymore defenseless yeah Ace is trying to soccer this guy and I mean maybe he's got this thing that he does and he rocketed sounds like he's hurt I don't know where could have Bella's from is that rough going to die number if he's rushing at Randstad yeah the only that's the other thing other sports have many refs you're the only one dude and you're on edge and Shih Tzus when I stop another referees to go ocean I do.

		<div class="paragraph"> did Fox News is designed for old people on Loop in my data on Loop in the living room so many old people want to go over their house there watching Fox Box new men over 60 is mandatory I can't believe these lips I can't believe them Fox News may start getting really having to pop culture that's when it makes me laugh when they stare like did you see what Ariana Grande was doing the other day and like nothing to talk about a ton of s*** oh yeah give me the presidential candidates that have been on Fox News like I think Yang I know Bernie's been on Fox News and I think Tulsi definitely been on Fox News as well yeah and people just get real mad at them whatever. Buckeye bottoms are too I just wonder about his skin that they're pulled a pulling a back with fishing wire to keep it up up on his head this just seems he seems oddly stiff you don't saying yeah like it seems like everything is pulled like there's not a I expect a certain amount of laxity in a man's face when he reaches a certain age particular around the forehead area I'm not seeing any movement either which makes me wonder about that like I want to see expressions in your forehead My worry is his lack he has a very big his he lacks the ability to have like a cohesive story his brain is an easy losing a lot of I tweeted something this morning cuz I was at someone put a video of the models on the runway on a catwalk and they're all tripping and falling at the same spot these dumb shoes there and I was like this is Biden's brain cells it's like they think I'm on the right path of that I get to know did you see the thing that he was talking about God creating women or no and then what do you say it like it's it's like he has no breaks his car is not going on the Hills I got a actually I like that more already want to say to me but do you know that you know that you can't be president. We can't play any games here folks this is a really old man who can't talk like this is not a joke like that right now you know the thing play that again this should get you into a mental hospital they should be like Hey Joe you are right do you know that you know he had three Strokes while he was saying that the first one what does that word dude self-evident is that we hold these truths to be self-evident yeah I'm right here again doesn't do it equal and gotten out of there been like f*** it looked and said he goes he didn't want to see the Creator because there's a lot of the religious thing are you a science denier Joe Biden a science denier that's it but that's part of the problem with all these my biggest beef with anybody in the Democratic party when he watches debate is they all want to say the thing that they really feel but they're tiptoeing cuz scared of the f****** minds someone going Warren Jeffs at T and she's not DC's anti-trans because you refer to their waiting for them to f****** while they're making people behave the way they would like them to be right there they're forcing compliance right another f****** minds someone going Warren Jeffs Etsy and she's not DC's anti-trans because you referred to as they did their waiting for them to f****** while they're making people behave the way they would like them to be a life they're forcing compliance right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think you'll love the story the illness Amazon trip I told you about we land in this airstrip when is playing when we get into this Village and I'm like cool about today to hear it took the bus 5 days we're going to head upriver and are like translators like you can't do that yet what do you mean you have to have the shamans blessing to go upriver and I'm like okay what does that means I come to the Moloko which is the spiritual house spiritual house and we talked and we talk him to go but just like almost like idle conversation where he's almost like interviewing us it will what are you doing where you going where you from any other really understand any of this right he's like living in this community long story short he goes okay you can go but you have to take the blessing and we're like sure whatever you need for us to go so he pulls out the snail shell I can show you a picture of it the snail shell with a monkey bone in the top and a tube worm to close it and in the snail shells with green powder and he's like this is what you for the blessing so he goes around the circle and threw a monkey bone pipe he blows this green stuff in your nose not know that word that we heard I couldn't tell the name of the pipe no no the stuff they blow up your nose is it ddmt it it's coca leaf and tobacco I'm like all together and around the circle and he hit three guys and my brain feels like yes or gets really close to get this long tubular Monkeybone piping and it just blows it up in your nose and hit three of my guys and I'm watching a little bit nervous cuz like I'm very like standoffish on drugs I got I know things affect me very strangely anyway hit in the nose all of a sudden I feel like I've got acid on my brain like chlorine in my head I break into the sweat eyes explode and I'm like wobbling like this and it's 30 seconds later I'm just crawled over in the fetal position just projectile vomiting cannot hold it together and Lorenzo this the tribal Shaman goes good good and we're likewise as good and he's like he had a bad spirit in him if he had gone up the river he would have been killed he's just got the bad Spirit out this is why I had to bless you now you can go and I was the only one that hit like that are five person everybody else my brains or whatever I was literally fetal position feverish puking crate and I've never done any drugs like hard drugs like it's just not my my thing and this thing just hit me like a ton of bricks after he said that did you think it was there a scientist you're very smart guy but was there a part of you that was like mad it's just got right yes that's what's so crazy here I am nobody else f*** affected I'm sitting in the fetal position puking my brains out in the guys going good now you'll be safe and the whole f****** trip I've got that in the back of my mind going maybe the whole reason nothing's going wrong it's cuz I just had green f****** powder blowed up my nose super weird and nothing is ever affected me like that I mean curled up puking shivering when you trying to make logical sense out of this we try it when we like was was there ever a thought we like maybe in this extreme environment that's so utterly different than any other place in the world that these rules are different absolutely I'm sitting there going going into it I'm like cool yeah I'll do the stupid powder if it means I can go on my Expedition you know I mean like I'm not like embracing it I'm just like going through the motion to get my job done as a scientist and then I had this experience and I'm not saying I was enlightened or awoken or anything like that but all of a sudden I attributed my success and my safety in small part to the green f****** powder blown up my nose by a shaman through a monkey bump in the thing about it is even if that's not true if you think it's true and then you wind up being okay and you have confidence that you're going to be okay and maybe you have less anxiety and make better critical decisions because you think that everything's going to work out exactly exactly totally cuz I was super focused on my mission we were very very successful in what we set out to do and I feel like because I had that crazy experience and cures this old little jungle Indian going now you're now you're going to be okay I didn't have any anxiety going into the situation and before that I had no thought of it ever playing a part of the placebo effect right that's real effect by believing it something works right but is there a fee for a change in the way interface with reality if you believe that you've experienced some sort of spiritual in richening and then some sort of the some bad spirit is been released from your body is that possible I think so I think it changes your own reality because of your perception of the outside world that is a freaky thing for a scientist to say I am a hardcore I've never considered spirituality religion anything and I had this this crazy experience that is like Change My Mind Set On on crazy jungle medicine and drugs and catching animals at everything because this one got blue crap out my nose and I puked everywhere you want to experiment with other plant medicines the only reason I did that is because it was a necessity to do what I was doing it was coming from an expert if you will but a person who saw it as a necessity to do what I was doing and I was under his guidance to go out is because it was a necessity to do what I was doing it was coming from an expert if you will but a person who saw it as a necessity to do what I was doing and I was under his guidance to go out and you know pick a mushroom and try it and having experience is I don't I don't see the benefit in that but when someone who lives in that Community Embraces that wild jungle said this is my home in this is how you do it I will absolutely do it so you do it like out of respect absolutely</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you were doing this like you've been involved with so this is like the family business sort of my family business is my mom's business actually it was Safari businesses so like like you say sit in the Land Rover see the animals kind of thing and they did a little bit of Taurus walking safaris but then I grew up on a farm on the outskirts of Harare Zimbabwe and then whenever I wasn't in school I was on the farm run around Barefoot catching snakes fishing yada yada and then when my mom wasn't booked up she had this little Bush playing the cheese for safaris and weed Adventure all over Africa sounds great I mean it's like one of those things where it's what you're used to write on moving to the states at age 14 and like trying to find my place in the world be in this weird little private school kid from Africa way more terrifying than going to meet a tribe in the middle of the Bush for sure I go to school pull my part of sitting in my uniform sewing to a very proper English boarding school pull out my pocket knife start cutting my Apple 15 minutes later I'm in handcuffs then like what did I do what did I do I literally had no idea what I've done wrong because I had a knife at school everybody I'd ever been to school without a knife to cut their apple like it was the standard thing so here I am with like police and guns and badges and they're throwing me in handcuffs and taking me out of the school on day one in America and I'm like this is the scariest thing I've ever seen and I didn't even learn until later that day that it was cuz out of pocket knife at no point do I think having a pocket knife is a bad thing so they didn't tell you know they just grab me there was like this whole thing like the knife went flying I was chained up another what's going on what's going on in big trouble and it's everyday my whole life and now I'm like when you think back about that do you think that's just the consequences of being in a law population for sure I mean like we like it was nothing like that but then you come here where you know the stabbings and stuff like that and it's because you know we had to do you think that it's possible that there's no way you could live like that over here and there's no way you can have kids with a bunch of knives nobody talk to you about it before you left the house she's from Africa or things so you were doing these always doing is walking so far as you started out doing the driving ones and then eventually you start doing the walking ones far as well which is why I have so many Hippo &amp; Croc stories cuz we'd be canoeing down the Zambezi River and then taking photographs and seeing Wildlife that way what a crazy way to grow up man relationship to wild life is so different than the average person in this country for sure I feel like I have like regardless of being a scientist by trade I feel like I have a very intimate understanding animals cuz I grew up completely surrounded by them now what other countries have you explored I'm over sixty countries now or for biology contract before I did the show or just because like for instance when I got done with college I was like I had a little tiny little business during college sold it to travel the world and try and photograph these animals and I went to 28 countries looking for wildlife</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you want to get done sorry let me ask you a slightly different question or text me totally different as I'm sure you know if you look at any indicator of like Prosperity longevity health literacy access to food Etc humankind is way better off and it's ever been without an average there still a lot of people with a lot of trouble there still Parts the world that are still in bad shape so I was trying to get an amazing amazing Direction why are we unhappy I don't think we know how to manage our life correctly in life doesn't come with a guidebook it doesn't come with when you're in this condition seek out these remedies start exercising get together with your friends tell them you love them meet up and have dinner and hug each other sleep well sleep well drink water you know there's also you know so many of us have a bad head start like you're starting off you know like how about your dad he been growing up getting kicked out of the family I mean and then starts a family of his own will you don't even know your grandfather made its Madness right Madness so you're coming out of this stressful pocket or maybe your dad goes to jail or maybe your your mom dies when you're young all these things that happen to people where they have this bad start right and then they develop defense mechanisms to deal with all their insecurities and they get around similar minded people and Euchre the world and fuckeverybody fuc the police and f***** of this and then you get in these communities of people that think the same way and then maybe there's gangs and maybe there's drugs and maybe there's crime and despair and sadness in any because negative people maybe there's none of it but maybe there's no dangerous just f****** annoying everyday people complaining about s*** and you're stuck in the mud of humanity with people it's real hard to engineer 350 million people out of that but for yourself you can take Act make your life better and if everybody did that if everybody took actions to make their life a happier experience by doing those things by exercising eating well hugging friends and enhancing Community everybody pretty much and they all sound attractive so why hard for so many people to do it because people are lazy and the reason why we're lazy is because it's very difficult for us to waste resources on something that we don't currently do and even though we know something to be true that if you do this Ronica long-term benefits because it used to be a very rare thing to achieve I so if you could pick one thing let's say let's say I'm aware senior why would I pick one thing I feel like you know what society says everything is great I'm unhappy exponentially okay why is exercise the one did you get your blood pumping release natural endorphins and you legitimately feel better and I also think of the by think about this all the time I think of your body as almost like the energy and your body is like a battery and it requires a certain amount of use and when you don't use it it overflows and then you get weird behavior and overreacting to things and you almost like it and see if you got to get up and move I find what do you do with let's say you have to take too long flights that say you're unable to exercise for like you know 24-36 hours fine you don't have no I mean you you didn't do nothing you don't develop regular habits I can prove you're sleeping it may be accountable like 7-8 hours every week 4 and 5 or sleep well sleep with earplugs and eye mask anything like that don't have a problem sleeping kind of sleep well really need to know you're not a napper know I don't know I just never enjoy it really yeah you never tried it doesn't work when I'm done I'm done do you drink caffeine yes have you ever tried the caffeine nap you know about that are shut down shut down there's a balance there's a balance between being productive and being happy right and I think it's hard to find that balance because we look at like the the numbers that come in with his money or productivity or you know the number of things you've been able to create and you think of that as being like but look I can get so much done but if you maybe got less of those numbers but more of the numbers in terms of the amount of sleep you got you would enjoy the whole overall experience more I worry that I think for a lot of people who were successful in different Realms could be Sports business entertainment whatever successes intoxicating and then you want more of it right and then it becomes very easy to see that as the main goal at the expense of loved ones other people I'm looking for I'd like to know how incredibly generous and spirit to people around them but I find that you are a kind of its success often is driven by sort of ambition that's a little bit unseemly and I'd like to know how to deal with that a little bit better but it seems like it would be if it's a number game right if the success meeting like you're in a business you're trying to sell the most placards or the whatever whatever it is you know you have this thing in your head and like you're really driven I just say puresalem placards you already starting behind it's in you you have this goal in your mind being number one and you're obsessed and you know when everyone's going to tell your story told Bob he wouldn't let it go but every time I got there it was in the office and he left after everybody but look now Bob's got a f****** yacht and he's also got a pacemaker right Bob's ready to take over any minute now but also I think the thing is in pursuit of success I think would often happens that I've seen in people I know and then people I don't know but I've read about is that your moral compass starts to shift a year true there's a lot of people that are successful and we're only talking about business right when I'm talking about I'm thinking of some people in Academia who you know even though the average person may not consider the stakes in Academia super high but like if you get in a big university department and you start to write papers and get published and then get grants and accolades and so on your on a trajectory that's very intoxicating and then all of a sudden I think it's it's more I think it's tempting or not even tempting I don't think it's even a conscious decision you start to make decisions that are not as sound not as morally acceptable as you would have made 5 years ago when you were starting out and I don't like I see that happening a lot I see it in media I see people cutting Corners I see it in business I don't think it's even a conscious decision you start to make decisions that are not as sound not as morally acceptable as you would have made 5 years ago when you were starting out and I don't like I see that happening a lot I see it in media I see people cutting Corners I see it in business</div>

Suicide which is if you live in an environment where let's say you've got a spouse that's cruel to you or you got a terrible work situation where you live somewhere with a government is repressive whatever you can always kind of see a light at the end of the tunnel and you can say that you know when that problem is done my life will get better but if you live in a society like ours where you've never had to worry about having enough to eat you've never gone too cold or too hot where you're surrounded by prosperity and you look around and everybody else in like they're not depressed and you think what is it it's me the no one left to blame Theory and that's one argument for why there's like right now is a lot of teen and young people suicide in a country like America where the riches are the prosperity is boundless love your red Jonathan hates work so his take on that is that these kids are experiencing social media and they're experiencing this addiction to the internet and this cruelty that they experienced that the bullying the meanness the coldness and that when it started in on people and when they're losing their position in the social chain and they feel left out they don't have the tools to cope with that they're developing minds and this is the reason why you're experiencing this uptick that's directly correlated to the invention of the iPhone and the eventual the invention of social media application to all sorts of correlations will you see the inventions of these particular things have changed everything and then you see the uptick trying to keep up with the Joneses and this this feeling that they're inadequate or judging themselves against girls that are you know supermodels that are photoshopped and they just feel inadequate I hear you on all that we have to be careful that correlations proving causation cuz it's really tough because I totally want it looks like they both travel together. Right on the other hand history is full of correlations it looked good you know we're talkin about polio vaccine earlier polio for reasons they're still not understood by the way cuz I never really figured out the disease that just figured out of vaccines I never figured out what caused the disease but it turns out that polio would always spike in the summer time so there are a lot of theories maybe to do with being outdoors so parents would keep their kids indoors maybe it had something swimming pools people keep him out of swimming pools but then there was one theory that what else happens in the summertime that doesn't happen in the winter time ice cream consumption so there was a theory for a while that all Wheels caused by ice cream on paper the correlation looks pretty good so I'm saying look internet and depression and suicide are little bit more complicated than ice cream and polio but it's hard to tease out effects for sure know you're right but it's also hard to ignore the effect of social media on people's seems people are addicted to phones people are addicted the license of reoccurrence it's also been engineered in order to attract the most eyeballs and the best turns out the best way to get you outraged I agree but again just to bang the same drum again and again where there's grill with you where there's cost you got to look at the benefits and this is what I hate about politicians is they'll talk about a policy that they like they ignore the cost they talked about the opponent's policy they ignore the benefits so with social media friend since I know a kid a boy who was a friend of the family who if you were born 30 years earlier and there were no way to connect with people other than in person or phone whatever he would had a very disconnected life yet he just had some issues with with doing that with kind of in person he was kind of you know Behavior that's a little bit on the Spectrum just would have been very difficult as it turns out because of the digital Revolution he was able to build a community that is unbelievably good are there downsides to these things absolutely but you know you got to look at the benefits do I do I do I do I do I think human beings are adapting to a new normal and The New Normal is constant connection with all the people around us all the time if we so choose to engage and Lead are free so choose a problem is when it becomes more invasive than that right now it's if we so choose to engage but we get to some point we're wearing something that I transmit stuff into our brain always someone's wearing us if you don't if you don't do it then you can't be a part of this Corporation because we're about succeeding in this is the best way to succeed is to connect yourself to the network to uptick your bandwidth so that you can keep up with us come on Steve what's up headband that are you a tree Mystic about the future and in a general way now and with so that you can keep up with those come on Steve what's up next thing you know you were in the f****** hemp the headband that are you are you optimistic about the future and a general way now</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the house I bought to write my first book was unbelievably I was so fun I could focus for like 14 hours a day 16 hours a day writing but the reason I was able to focus so well was because of cigarettes hydrate for about 20 29 minutes total focus go outside smoke the nicotine we just reset all the focus was an unbelievable drug but it's a terrible delivery system I've heard someone recently say I recently heard reluctant Trump supporter say the same thing about Trump that a lot of the things he's doing policy-wise especially foreign policy or Economic Policy really they like it so they said he's like he's like a cigarette like the drug is good to delivery system is absolutely terrible but that this one instance where I stepped outside with my brother after this intense moment and we had a cigarette and a few years later the book have been published I was buying the house now and newly married and I know that you're supposed to buy life insurance and so I got this insurance broker and he knew my name is that I read your book I said that's that's great glad to hear and then we started to price out the insurance and he said you know what do you do are you smoker I said no not a smoker cuz I quit few years earlier and then he called me back and said you know I read your book where you stepped outside to have a cigarette with your brother all the sudden I got the smoking rate for life insurance so this message I would say is really serious for anybody even if you've been smoking for 2 years they say if you quit your lungs can actually recover greatly so worth it he quit and that's how he quit so the best science at the moment says that vaping is almost certainly much better than smoking because they don't know all the chemicals and all the damage potential damage of vaping may or may not do but they do know the damage is cigarette the combusted combustible cigarettes and all the chemicals there are demonstrably pretty bad that even though like you said we were told doctors do it this is the best we told the same thing about sugar sugar gives you a great boost and so on but again my take is if you want smoke go ahead but wait a minute live in a finite life or wait a minute let's see now we are talking about who pays right so this is it gets back to the externality saying if you smoke and I'm paying for your health insurance as a taxpayer don't I get to have to say it's very good question and how far we should we extend that cuz if you're fat should have to pay ring you keep eating why do you keep beating right okay if you if you don't sleep well and you prone to heart attacks someone supposed to pay you know there's there's so many variables are you guys rock arms or what if you fall and break your leg have to f****** pay for that there's a lot of variables you got to wonder about when you start breaking down how much how much assistance people get based on their life choices at the way to do that is to free free healthcare then there should probably be a premium or I should probably pay into a little fund that is a pool additionally right you you theoretically hard to regulate Behavior because again where do we draw the line it what about BMX riding what about people who do this and that there's a lot of things that people hate to do everything you do you have to pay for the parents have to pay about driving the car you know my bad then we got to measure the benefit to CrossFit right you're building up your body going to live longer well that's positive and you're also probably hanging out with lunatics like you were riding you know crazy vehicles right so I'm a driver but I think that CrossFit the benefit yeah as you're getting in shape so that balances itself out as long as you do it intelligently you're you're involved in athletics but should we reward people should they pay less so if someone does Yoga 3 days a week and we supposed to make them pay less I mean I think you get into some weird swampy area people start Juke the system the same way when you know people got paid for rats and let rats loose and then f****** kill them gross yeah but we're improving</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> tricky part I mean that's why I that's why I like economist's because Economist are ruthless bloodless they almost don't know what humans are but they're very good at measuring cost and benefits and that's what I feel that our kind of political social media discourse is missing people are all for the most part Advocates are activists they pick up Blaine and they stay in it and they want to pave over the rest of everybody's lanes and make it and it's not a good way to be now it's not you know that's another episode that I was listening to of yours recently about how hard is gay people change their mind on things and I forget who the expert was who was talking but it was a really interesting point that he had about the mind like it was a change your mind you don't really have a mind or the mind of the community and if you step outside the beliefs of the community they can be very bad for you in terms of like your personal connections with people and I really enjoyed that episode funny thanks it's a it's a paradox though cuz the way you just said it like if you are in your tribe then even though it can be healthier for you and for presumably many other people for you to change your mind at least think differently about things right you risk losing credibility or whatever sentence like now you've escaped our group you are you're you're an outsider to my father who can both my parents converted from Judaism to Catholicism where they met each other it was very unusual it's a long story I'll tell you if you really want to know but anyway I'll do the short when I'm getting to the end this was during the during the second world war they were both in New York both first generation American Jews that makes they converted different reasons from each other and then they met my father's family was Orthodox and his father and him shepsle deubner would come here when he was in his maybe late 20s from Poland he still lived as everyday in Brooklyn as if you were still in Poland you didn't change at all when my father converted and his father found out my father was in the war he was overseas he was home on leave and his father was cleaning up and from my father can City leftover chair rosary beads slipped out and fell on the floor that's how his Jewish father ships will do when your found out that his son to become a Catholic so what he did is he proceeded to sit Shiva for him the Jewish mourning ritual were for 7 days you mourn the dead he declare that he would never again speak to his son and he forbade everyone in his family from speaking to his son so I owe the time I was born out of the youngest of eight kids in this family because they become very Catholic I didn't know this whole family of my father's was unknown to me entirely so they did exactly what you're saying now did the same thing but it was less dramatic cuz her family was less religious so they still didn't like at all that she had converted but oh yeah I got a couple again though it's alongside my first of the first book ever with long before Freakonomics with called turbulent Souls although it got been republished under different title called Choosing My Religion and it tells us the story of my my two parents run me to your children so but you're so scary at scary but it is but on the other hand maybe this is what Freakonomics is what I try to learn through doing Freakonomics is you know to measure the what and try to figure out the why but then not be the judge who says that was terrible this is wonderful because you know different people have look if shepsle do me were here we can ask him what by the story he could tell us a story that might convince us that you know what this son of his did a terrible thing to the family did a terrible thing you know he would say how could it be that we Jews existed for generations and generations and generations when everyone lived there was always someone trying to you know get rid of us and then we finally come to America you know the land of Freedom religious freedom economic freedom and Hereafter generations and generations of forefathers fought to stay Jewish hear my son decide to become Catholic what are you thinking so you know everybody's everybody's got a perspective everybody's got an emotional experience so I try to respect that but no I would not do that to my children I understand the outrage I understand being upset but I can understand choosing that over your son and over the relationship you have reached the end of the story then when that Grandpa and my grandfather I never met it was a long time ago my father's father I was very young so I didn't know the story either that was why I wrote the first book was fighted try to figure out this all the stuff I'm telling you now none of this I knew until I was in my twenties when I was writing this book but when shepsle deubner was dying of cancer in the may be late 50s or so a nephew of his who my father used to be very close with and who looked a lot like my dad and this guy with maybe in his early twenties late teens when he walked into the hospital room Shep so you know on his deathbed really thought that that was my father and son my my my dad's name is Solomon he called him shleimah and he was he was calling out to him shleimah Shawarma as if he was you know happy happy to see him it wasn't him though and my father didn't go visit his own father dying in the hospital because he been forbidden to go anywhere near I'm looks this is my religion I've been long fascinated by religion and I think that again if you think about it the way that Economist think about things there are costs and their benefits complicated hardcore atheists where they don't see any value in it whatsoever even though people are that they're getting some sort of ethical value moral value in the way I always put it is like it's like a scaffolding to live your life by you can live within these can fines and it really kind of makes sense if you follow it Loosely that we're doing to try to for the benefit of community a real community that comes from meeting and Sunday with all those other or whatever day it is with your religion and you meet in a group of other people that are also in the community and you are basically are staying together that you should do good things and be good to people and treat each other the way God would want us to like all that has undeniable benefits and it also says differently is like you're deluding yourself like your points the atheist or hardcore make points about the Preposterous nature of a lot of religious text her on the money but it doesn't mean doesn't mean that it doesn't give people the benefit and that I couldn't even disagree with them continuing it cuz there's a lot of people that benefit greatly from religion someone wrote to Assaf loneliness episode came out and said how did you fail to write about this supposed epidemic of loneliness without addressing the huge decline in organized religion in America which I thought was a very good piece of criticism that would have been a good because you're right it's a community one other thing I would add to the list that you provided what it can give is humility right because you know if you have an image of some Superior being God do you do whatever you want to call it you kind of understand that one mortal is you know the world does not revolve around me the other thing I would say and look it it's hard for me to scientifically logically Embrace a lot of the arguments a lot of religions make a special about things like the afterlife right that said even to an atheist I would suggest one way to think about it is if someone does believe in those rewards Rhythm and economically terms were talking about them as incentives even if it's a placebo effect in other words if I if I'm encouraged to do to treat other people well on the on the chance that if I do so I have a reward in the Eternal reward hey that's not a bad reason to incentivize people to do well sounds like a nice justification for them psychic house has a drive-by at the neon sign to helping people giving people a sense with the future going to be like a bad reason to incentivize people to do well sounds like a nice justification for them psychic houses we drive by at the neon sign the helping people giving people a sense with the future going to be like it might be imagined if that's where the real psychics are those neon signs</div>

Write how do you feel about that I mean there's a Libertarian argument to say what do you talk about people can do whatever they want they can do drugs they can Eco bungee jumping bacon workout stock trading which is stressful you know can do you can do whatever you want so where do you lie on that well I think first of all there right and you are doing something is definitely going to harm you however I feel like if you want to do something that you enjoy doing that's going to take some time out of your life that's fine night anyway who the f*** am I to tell you can't do that right am I going to tell gymnastics calling the ball crosses in a lot of the sub-concussive drama just heading the ball causes a lot of C I know a lot of Youth leagues now we're starting to cut out heading which I think is probably pretty good idea going with that because we didn't even touch the surface of this I'm in favor of people doing what they want to do with their life if you choose to do something we likely are we going to take away race car driving because that's one of the scariest goddamn things a person to do not as much anymore 2000 Dale Earnhardt Jr on his body out anyone in depth about brain damage that he's gotten from multiple crashes he talked about the severe impact of the concussion he talked about the difficulty coming back into the different modalities a different medical treatment to these had to have I. Dale Earnhardt jr. this after his dad is gone right this guy talked like real extensively on this podcast about his personal struggle with brain damage that he's received from car accident scary way to make a living. Arguably more scary than fighting because there are guys like Mighty Mouse Demetrious Mighty Mouse Johnson is like this elite MMA fighter that barely gets touched there's guys like him they don't take any damage and then there's guys who are Elite NASCAR drivers who wind up me crazy collision and go sent through the air and they wind up in the hospital all f***** up the impact was the impact of Internet Cade just your brain rattling around inside your head f**** you up and we're letting people do that and I don't think we should I think we should let people do whatever they want if they want to do they want to take a tightrope walk across the Grand Canyon and film it on YouTube I can't I'm not the guy unless it's over private land for public land with there's a law against using it who are we to tell people they can't rock climb who are we to tell people they can't ski where do we draw the line where do you decide a person can you make a good argument I don't think there's a bad argument with what you're say it's saying that it's it. Causes damage to people you're right by the way I'm a I love the NFL I would cry if it went away on the other hand and I and I know a few NFL will now former NFL players one of whom stop playing in his 50-year way earlier than had to cuz he was worried about CTE but also he was getting a PhD in math from MIT at the same time while he had a plan yet an alternative but then there's another guy combination keys and you should have money or show John Urschel his name is Urschel Domonique Foxworth play for the Ravens but I've got to be friendly with them had a great money-making career because he kind of got his big contract in his whatever 4th 5th Year took out insurance on it then got her in there and really never played again so he banked enough money Daddy went and got an MBA from Harvard cuz he's a bright and interesting and ambitious guy he will never let his son play football like to hear these stories about the guys who done it who made a life you know out of it and it just really makes me think about your right everybody should have the right to do anything for their own livelihood or for their own excitement right on the other hand like if we had the Coliseum today per se like the modern version the Colosseum if we had the Coliseum purse a fighting the Tigers slaves getting thrown into fight the Tigers we don't like that like the line things are repugnant until they're not and it's hard to predict where that line is a lot of things that used to be not repugnant slavery fine the whole world if you had the ability to do it right and then go straight back to the Coliseum the same thing and whatever the cultural line is especially depending upon how many people died around us how much plague and murder and do you do it right and then go straight back to the Coliseum the same thing it's like we have a line and whatever the cultural line is especially depending upon how many people died around us how much plague in murder and how much you know how much you're dealing with war that line moves yeah yeah</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> as a person who performs it and also has an audience member when I'm an audience member and someone's killing I'm letting them think for me right I'm not even thinking I'm just letting them take me down and say it like Dave Attell Dave Attell was at the Improv the other night we work together and he was f****** amazing one of the best I've seen from him and he said always been amazing but he was on fire and we were all it was me and my friend Owen Smith and Tony Hinchcliffe we're sit in the back room and we we're watching Dave and we were in a trance we were just laughing we were letting him think for us you know I'm saying like he's doing all the thinking we're just on a little ride to Dave's taking us on this ride and as an audience member I recognize that there's a mass hypnosis there's nothing that happens when we all get into this mindset and if someone is like really well-crafted material like Dave Attell and they take you on that you let them you like me politician is speaking quick question for sure Trump has a lot of elements of stand-up comedy in his routines for sure 100% if you watch his most recent speech where he's making fun of Joe Biden saying a hundred fifty million people are killed with guns at the First Lady oci keep doing stand-up so someone took it and they made a video saying Donald Trump at the Apollo and so they put him doing this speech with audience reaction from people watching stand-up comedy and laughing at a laugh track over it and it seems real it seems like he's a comic what about Bernie Bernie has a powerful speaker but I don't think it's that funny funny thing every now and then when you talk about like going along for the ride like doing the thinking for you such an interesting idea bright is a trustworthy person people trust him they see him up there he's not polished right the thing about Bernie it's like when he's saying things so there's and theirs and theirs you know anybody either the different kind of Polish what do you mean look polished performer fill in the blanks loading up his weapon for the next line when he's going to throw and call crazy Hillary lock her up like a stand-up it's basically look he's doing stand-up that's my buying is so f***** he's so f***** cuz he can't talk right he has a really hard time talking he keeps screwing things up and it's a real bad horse to bet on cuz he's an older guy you're still a Bernie guy I'd love the guy I love what he represents who wants to do good for people that don't have much that's that's a sentiment there's a desert quality that I think helps us as a community as a community of the United States if we have this agreement hey let's see what we can do let's see what we can do to balance things out and take for the downtrodden for the people that are hurting concentrate on them and he's made that a huge priority of his life and always has and it to deny that like look what he's trying to do I don't know if he can get any of this s*** past I don't think anybody knows until he gets in there but the idea is were saying we want better for people who don't have much yet that's what he stands for and you can call it Democratic socialism but it's an idea the idea is like helping people just helping people helping people you don't even know waking the world a better place than the corollary what's the Trump idea and why did it succeed bunch of pussies out there trying to ban Free Speech bunch of pussies out there come on America's number one f*** you f*** yeah there's also he doesn't talk like a politician you know we talked about China you go to them listen motherfukers when they charge 25% every like it's way more entertaining ever lived and not even close he buries all of them and he drags him if his fight even Hillary's now talking differently about other people she said about Bernie nobody liked him you would have never said that before Donald Trump she would have never ordered those word his victory over her is deep in her DNA now she starting to exhibit some of his patterns aliens millions of people who say nobody like him or nobody liked him in the second course course people like him and then they started running I like Bernie this #I like Bernie start popping up that behavior is a direct reaction to her getting pounded on by Donald Trump through the entire campaign are you still there and let me ask you this you've talked to a lot of people from all different Realms in here right if we can agree let's say that being entertaining is not a great prerequisite for qualification for being if we can agree on that what can be done whether it's in the political sphere the media sphere putting something in the drinking water to let people to encourage people to have a little bit more of what you're after whether it's compassion with at understanding whether it's balanced where there's moderation another Ridge why is the entertainment Force winning right now and if you don't like that notion what can be done well the entertainment force is written for whatever reason is being portrayed through Trump only see he's not a politician he's a guy who's a media star he's been a media star for decades he knows how to manipulate the media he knows how to sit on the Letterman couch and kill he's been doing it for a long time is very comfortable being in front of cameras none of those people have those kind of skills and nobody thought of it as a skill they thought of a politician being a politician stuff guys calling you crazy Ted or lying Ted you know lying Hillary heated makes up dance or you sleepy Joe I mean and I'm smiling because it's funny cuz he's good at up he's funny he's good at it there's a problem you should have a goddamn popularity contest to see who controls thermonuclear weapons that's f****** stupid it's stupid tilt allow pee but it's vote but it faces the popularity system we've got and that's what I'm asking you is what now I'm in the way that these election no cuz I don't think it was me if you look at the Lincoln-Douglas debates those are actual debate but I mean let's say that you're not happy with the way it is and there's a lot of people even there are people who like Trump quite a bit on some Dimensions who are very troubled by other dimensions there's a lot of people out there who are open to like no let's let's try to adjust the thinking let's try to change her mind try to not be influenced as much by what we're being influenced by do you have give me pointers the real problem that we're having is this tribal Battle of left vs right and the the strongest voices on the left the loudest voices in The Most Extreme often times are the worst representations and the same with the right the loudest most extreme team member so the people at the front of life okay we're going to kick their ass with me and there's also these ideas that we have that are cemented in stone that you know if you are a left-wing person you believe in XYZ this is your doctor and maybe you think that maybe maybe we should incorporate a lot of things we do with the fire department and you know when do that to schools and do that to housing and do that. Make sure that all the stuff covered make housing like an important part a civilization but for every but we did a piece of Freakonomics radio Pizza year to go cold Americans hidden duopoly and it was about the Democratic and Republican party basically acting like Pepsi and Coke right they kind of divide and conquer the market and they built an industry that is incredibly valuable to me is this Trump won the presidency as the Republican that the RNC most wanted to get rid of Bernie last time found was the Democrat that the DNC wanted to get rid of they lost by getting their candidate Hillary in this time Bernie may very well become the candidate is again the party of the DNC is out to get to what is it say you've got a duopoly literally the machines running the system that we kind of let ourselves get manipulated into buying like you said I've never understood my mom my mom and dad were democrats for a long long time typical Catholic not so difficult as your former Jewish got the typical Catholic working-class big family meat potatoes issues no-brainer that they're Democrats okay and then but my mom is a devout Catholic she started the local right-to-life chapter in Upstate New York where we live New York state has legalized abortion before Roe v Wade so she was fighting that fight early when that happened and the Democrats lined up against in favor in favor of legalize divorce she switched parties everything else about her was still mostly Democratic but she had to become a republican because of life and that's a that's another powerful one that got integrated into the right and it happens to all of us though we take there's one issue that kind of sets people off and then they have to join the team that they met everything else about her was still mostly Democratic but she had to become a republican because of life and that's a that's another powerful one that gets integrated into the right and it happens to all of us do we take there's one issue that kind of sets people off and then they have to join the team that they met</div>

really want to have some kind of service component but I don't know what to do I'm to question I think first start with the people around you right start telling them you love them hug enhance the sense of community that you share with your friends your loved ones do your best to sort of be the person steps forward starts it off you know like makes an action tell someone how much you care and appreciate them I care about them and appreciate them when you maybe wouldn't have done that ordinarily you can we can all do that and we've all had it done to us and it feels amazing when someone comes up to you out of nowhere and goes hey man I just want to tell you I really appreciate you I know I know sometimes we don't talk to each other that much but when I do I really enjoy it I just I love you give me a hug I just want you to know I'm very fortunate that I have a lot of friends that do that kind of stuff real supportive group of friends and if you don't you long for that and I think that's a big thing like become that person really want and try to try to start that I can't imagine anybody hearing you say that would disagree such an Obviously good way to be and yet and yet I find that so many people kind of go out of their way to not just be generous cuz they're scared there's not a scarcity there they think that they have they have to make it and that if you make it 5-0 some are a loser yeah it's thinking it's real real real, our Hardware is the same in our software is not but you understand what it is and then you have that time to adjust that's why losing in life is so important weather is getting dumped getting fired losing a game loss those feelings where things didn't work out your way that's important because it lets you know this is a bad feeling that comes when it goes wrong and you improve and that it makes the good feelings of Victory all the better and I mean that you know when the relative sounds like even getting good at something good about Victory like making terrible book to get rejected by every publisher and then writing a really good one and people accepting like f*** I got better yes like the feelings of failure are really critical for your motivation that's interesting I've always thought of failure like or like like a failure or just like a bad event I've always thought that they were good because I'm like a scaredy-cat in some ways right and then if the very bad thing happens the very beard happens you survive it and then you learn to shed more fear and more directions you know what I mean so I could look at it that way but there's a lot of ways you can look at bad events you can't I a bad event is just who you are and you just have bad events in your f****** loser in life hates you and God hates you and look at that happened in the Mike again can't f****** believe it is a lot of got to go through life like that and you know they can say that they seek comfort in lowering the standards that they expect out of things when things go bad they say lot I f****** knew it for them alleviate some concern about what's going to happen the future cuz of Future's always dogshit know by doing that they've taken away the fear of Rights eating the fear of overcoming the fear of improving the fear of getting better as a human being has exhibit the same patterns you fall into those patterns other is alcoholism a gambling addiction tracks addiction people falling those because they are accustomed to it becomes a normal part of your life I think that's a scary thing for people want to buy pattern and to say okay I have to stop drinking how do I dress right what what steps are make and what's the best way community sponsor now and they work together that's I think the solution is as a really good so you know I have three brothers are all older on the youngest of eight and I don't mean to disparage them and I also know year younger than me but I kind of wish you'd been my old whether you would have been really good maybe Robin sucking up p**** come on man stop crying yeah that's okay with your brother and sister sometimes the only people that really know you like I have conversation with my sister sometimes she's the only person who really knows our childhood rain will talk about it was like 1 or 9 and ran and do you have the same option of it super honest right and she's what I mean you remember you remember yeah yeah yeah anything right we both have real similar Recollections of our past so it's a bit but those people that have experienced those things with you there like the only ones who really know you deep at your core and the more things you can experience with people the more you can share that sort of the people that's make me sad that people have no friends and no confidence they have no one they could talk to let me know when that knows their seat said there's no one that they can tell terrible joke to that you would never say an in mixed company right do you have no one who you know especially comedians We are the world famous for it we say things to each other all the time. Of the most horrible things and just to get a rise out of each other like one of my friends will say something terrible also in our culture there's a currency of being able to joke around like that of course physically if somebody makes one of my friends makes fun of me it's hilarious it's 5 and we do it to each other all the time because it doesn't actually like a currency and be able to take it to like you can make fun of Andrew doesn't give a f*** it's hilarious it's 5 we do it to each other all the time because it doesn't actually like a currency and be able to take it to like you can make fun of Andrew doesn't give a f***</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> chocolate poison has gotten so much better than the fact one wrinkle of climate change and global warming is that the particulate the soot in the atmosphere in the 60 50 60s and 70s with apparently what kept things little bit cooler because it refracted sunlight knee or ankle that's the irony is you clean up the air and you allow more bleeding where when people reduce it to the headlines and then divide people into tribes exactly the opposite of what you want perfect example because it's clearly a right vs left thing too and some people circles if you are on the right you're supposed to say it's exaggerated it's a hoax it's a distance and that's not my concern my concern is jobs my concern is if I give you repeat the talking points and if it's on the left that's how dare you think the biggest I know it's it was not a bad imitation I think one of Obama's biggest mistakes he plainly wanted to address climate change global warming but he did it in a kind of standard left Democrat Way by calling a global warming by saying that there were bad actors which is true the thing that astonishes me that Democrats haven't done is talk about it in a language that every Republican every conservative every Hunter fishing would respond to which is pollution which is what it is by the right right there why why it became a conversation about a much bigger much more abstract much more difficult to understand and act on problem is strange to me because you know humankind comes together we came to look polio vaccine it wasn't like everybody was working on it but there weren't enough people concerned about it and then you had a president who said hey March of Dimes let's have everybody raise money come up with a vaccine and then Christina liew no salt with the vaccine is just interesting about the way medicine works today you basically said no no I don't want to I don't want to own this patent he could have become a billionaire you know this was this is this is the way we have fought in our passes humans about solving big problems we seem to have gotten away from that a little bit and I think that's weird to me that tribalism is the most dangerous it's not about the political charades I don't care about that don't think that's particularly damaging why I think it's damaging is by dividing yourself into these tribes are so exclusive and they have these purity test what we're doing is weird actually diminishing our Collective ability to come together to solve problems the good news is there's a million people out there at academic institutions in garages groups of one and two people who are working on solutions that are that keep coming you know human humans a species Jonas Salk when he did create That vaccine the world was a different place and it wasn't this pharmaceutical industry that we have today that's you know what has such a strong ability to influence the way people look at things through advertisements and just threw the way the influence politicians where is it's a different world to compare what did the Bounty that was awaiting Jonas Salk for coming up with the polio vaccine it's just a different world to the world different he didn't give credit to the other people to help him with the back yet there was an I do I do you read a with money but not good with people I haven't read this in a long time so I can't I can't speak to it but I would even like I've been do you like Richard Fineman you know Richard Fineman so so you know when he talks about and I love hearing him talk about when he was drafted to work on the Manhattan Project and you think about America was it was an existential fear legitimate about all the complications that we have an enormous scientific challenge we have an enormous competition against the Germans were trying to do the same thing and then even if we win then we have another hole challenge is tomorrow challenge but there's a way of thinking about those things that again wet measuring the cost and benefits of people who'd might disagree aggressively and they did about Manhattan Project can sit down and say okay here's here's what we're going to do what's the what's the lesser of the two evils and I feel like right now as much progress as we've had I feel we've gotten worse at looking at the lesser of two evils pass that looking at weighing costs and benefits for what is the lesser of two evils in that regard as it dropped the bombs and stop the war or is the lesser of two evils never drop the bomb and stop the war later yeah I mean look there's a million books been written about this I could make an argument in in either case I mean Japan we were very very scared of Japan Japan and showed a lot of ability to punish the United States even though Germany was out America still felt very fragile so I totally get the argument that it was meant to be you know I get it to ya on the other hand your picking some pretty big city to drop it on and you're picking too so you know killing mostly civilians yeah yeah so it's hard to imagine that decision will be made today you just said about being a polio vaccine different different case but roughly same time you're in you know it's very hard to project your ma rolls onto you know 50 years from now we may have a very different view about MMA friends since it's very hard to protect it for more people literally out of existence but I think that just the fact that these brilliant scientists were forced into that moral dilemma like one of my favorite videos online shopping what is discussing what he said when the first atomic bombs detonated and he pulled the Bhagavad Gita and he said I am become death destroyer of worlds and is just to say that it to see have you seen it the video please let me let me play before you play Oppenheimer right after went describing what it was like cuz it's so Eerie ki'teer you have one of those brilliant scientist ever who completed this fantastic project Manhattan project that literally were nuclear weapons never happened before in all of human history as far as we know and hear the guy that did it that knew that knew that was going to be the death of untold amounts of people listen to this listen to what it says line from the Hindu scripture the bhagavad-gita Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince but now I am become death the destroyer of worlds I suppose we all thought that one way or another imagine being that guy I mean here's a guy first of all according to Bhagavad Gita in 1945 little ahead of his pretty pretty incredible or 40 it was 46 when did they detonate 40 the test where I think 44 and Hiroshima and Nagasaki 45 correct this guy who you know is just a brilliant scientist he's not supposed to be the guy who destroys a half a million people in One Moment One brief flash of light and vaporizes a half a million people he he went to the school in New York City called The ethical culture fieldston school which is where my kids went so Oppenheimer is kind of a patron saint for having the brains to do something unimaginable and having the ethics and courage to know that what he done was unacceptable on some levels you know on the other hand would look if we're talking about costs and benefits let's think about nuclear power nuclear bombs as a deterrent against others down the road rights you have to say killed a lot of people how many lives did it save impossible to say argument right then y'all drive to talk about then that's also talk about nuclear power which was the byproduct of this right and there are those who could argue and I would probably need this argument to say that if the US had continued on the path of nuclear power in the 70s rather than totally flipping out after well after Three Mile Island then later Chernobyl which is much worse accident at Three Mile Island if if that had continued what we have now is probably much much much cleaner cheaper safer nuclear Fuel and instead what happened because we basically stopped building nuclear plant instead for the next forty years we weren't a crap load of coal that's been terrible for the environment for lies a lot of lives lost in mining colder than the pollution so so you know actions have consequences with seems to be all benefit off and has a lot of costs and life is complicated but I think the more with the Wii measure and weigh things sensibly the list screaming there is I I just I love changing my mind I love hearing somebody make an argument that makes me say oh you know the way I thought about that before I see why I thought it I don't feel like a fool for having thought of it wound now that now that you've laid out some facts and laid out some counterfactuals I appreciate the opportunity to change my mind I enjoy that I don't know why I think we're so often you are a Diaz like our ideas are part of us and we're losing if our ideas that we've been discussing or incorrect if our assumptions were incorrect is a value judgment against us right you know I think the nuclear thing is interesting because I think one of the problems with what happened was the shity design of like Fukushima where they can't shut it off as freak people out rightly so and it's in there it's built in a bad spot and The Back-up Plan sucked everything's wrong and hotspot I was going to be like that for a hundred thousand years break there's a better way and they never had a chance to find that better way because they've had a better way for everything else in those later ones the ones that their operational now are far better than the Fukushima month and they could have gotten way way way way way better and that is it's one of those things that doesn't seem like a make sense like women nucleares clean it's working really clean it's really clean if it's done right and if they allow them to innovate over those forty years we would have got to someplace where it's like super efficient just like everything else if you look 1970 car right and then you look at a car from 2020 how did Tesla like maybe they would figure out how to really knock it down so that means there are still a lot of people working on next next next next Generation nuclear power MacLean Bill Gates's involved and including some that are working with using as fuel with called spent fuel in a traditional nuclear attack traditional nuclear a big problems at 1 so it's eventually going to crack do the bunker and toxify everything around it maybe before you could also theoretically use that as literally as fuel also</div>

fishes Community First Village Star by this guy was in construction and he just put down a whole bunch of tiny homes and people who are if your homeless you can go there and you can live in a tiny home but you rent it and there are some no some prerequisites but you don't have to be drug free because you're home so you can do whatever you want in your home but it's like $200 or $250 a month most people if they do the paperwork I can get the Social Security or disability which will cover that they still have to either work there in the community garden to feed themselves at different like I auto detailing at all this different stuff but there's no police saying it's not near as 500 people there now and it's working out fantastically can't get money to that because you're f****** god nuts or whatever it is but it's really working extremely well that's great when someone comes up with something you know I don't look at this Alan Graham is the saying what what he did and he lives there he lives in a small in a small home on Primacy and if you go there he'll be happy to show you around and all kinds of cool stuff at but it's just people are living together he says so if Joe walks out in the morning not Yu-Gi-Oh but the other he's got his his his dick hanging out and instead of the neighbors calling the cops the neighbors Hey Joe what's going on man will sit down for second step of coffee let's see what's going on 30 pants up your local city council your Mayors always a lot of people with mental illness who have houses so you know it's definitely mental illness and drug addiction but it really starts with catastrophic loss of family that's the number one reason people become unhoused out here it's the shift was Jimmy would you say about four or five years ago it really started kicking in somewhere around then yeah somewhere around four or five years ago you start noticing like Villages of tents under under passes and then at least you Fear Factor in Downtown LA like right down the street from Skid Row which is an extraordinary place if you've never seen skid-row and you drive by and go what this is real like this is downtown Los Angeles and you You're Beautiful by the way Kid Rock which is just you can't believe the Staggering numbers of people that are just camped out Stadium to see a game Adam Carolla said we got to do something about whatever you're doing and that's part of cancel culture people are afraid you know you could cancel culture was real if you have something to lose like you got nothing to lose I have nothing to lose they did your on your bulletproof do degree I'm bulletproof cancel all you want you taken away for me to do advertisers I don't have them stop listening</div>

Jamie gopher was basically the World Wide Web only was no web and so you could log on to a terminal and you could use a menu system so basic with the arrow keys but if you go to the right you might be connecting to a different computer to different University I eat a different server and then you can have a tattoo as they say all these information documents linking to each other and I started one piece of mtv.com like I went to him and said hey I don't want to do this thing on the internet and I wear a lot of our audiences and I want to register mtv.com yeah that's cool don't worry about it we have the AOL keyword so you go ahead and do a little in it that thing their son do whatever you want I got an email from the University of Michigan or that the Gophers is at their symbol Michigan thank you and they said dude you're using this commercial you have to pay us $5,000 for a license and like just for the server software which is open for free but they it was something in the license MTV and I said okay and there's a video on YouTube with me with a gopher t-shirt on MTV and then we like all mankind Urbana Illinois and those Marc Andreessen. He went on to create the biggest VC in Silicon Valley and when I saw that picture took an hour to download p*** video look at that I was like what the number what it was girl giving guy b****** it only lasted like 15 South was there ever a moment when was the moment I should say Obviously now today we all realize it's out of our control and it's a wild very strange thing that's taking over alive and then I want to talk about neural link to know something about that about Elon musk's invention neuralink I know a little bit about it but when you were we when you saw it kind of getting away like when was the moment where you were like this is a very strange thing it's never the people before I had the online part figured out because I ran a bulletin board you might remember those you could call in and maybe like five lines and you go in and do your business and then get out and who years that this is got to be early 80s maybe even late 70 so there's time for Innovation that right is big long strap things don't get any better well the speed got marginally better people got more online step the computers are able to do more than over there also some other things happening we had Windows Windows 95 came into play so now people were wearing a different world of computing used to be. And people have him wordperfect and and then all of a sudden we have an interface on top of it and we didn't have that the show that started to teach people how to deal with the environment so that was all there but the self would be 1987 and I login to get on the unit you had to log into a dial-up account launch a PPP session or slip and then had lunch the software on your computer and then you could open a terminal and you could type things like telnet and then a domain name or Indian IP address it could connect to someone else's thing and kind of look around was just all text-based but that for me was like holy ship you can connect from one to the next I understood the hyperlinking I understood how powerful that would be and if I just had a little computer today on my desk had a Mac plus with a gigantic external 20 megabytes cuz he hard drive 20 megabytes hdpt Mosaic browser browser the web and then the third moment was Carl Jacob Facebook but at the time and he contacted me so I can see what you're doing to send you a computer and sent me a Sun Voyager which is like a portable a luggable with an LCD color screen is UNIX which is even crazier and so he started show me stuff and he actually stream the song from his work station in San Francisco to my computer in Montclair New Jersey and I played I had him on the phone here I heard him start it and then it came through and it played on my on my computer I've never seen this before or heard it was like broadcast we can use this to broadcast since that moment I think that's the mission I've been on and look at Mama I have a ride here we are that's an amazing story man that's cool as f*** I love hearing it from someone was there from the very first steps and your we used to have the yellow page of the internet Yellow Pages which was a book I still have it it was published was published right that's it fell apart that's what happened with newspapers he was with the newspapers f***** up with the news when the internet came around and there were I saw it other people saw Craig Newmark saw it and it's classifieds because they were all hoity-toity about their advertising model but they're really making money off the classified ads everybody knows it everybody knew it and that's what Craigslist who you try to sell it to Tribune Tribune or Hurst for just a couple million bucks and it's like now we're not interested we don't need it not invented here whatever and so he ate up there their they're classified business overnight and they were left holding the bag saying but we have cool news to advertise on well-known and I will put some in there but not always about the classified that's where the money came from the more I can tell the story of the story about how they passed on it and he's very well the classified ads do they even have them newspaper Obits dead people is that still a good business the Obits dead people is that still a good business to have some but no not really how often do you hold a physical newspaper in your hand to read it whenever I whenever I'm at the airport I always buy the newspapers</div>

Breathwork the ends very interesting it's not against anything and distract myself cuz I'm floating you know when you drift into the wall sometimes so I wait until the ripples died down and climb and there's going to be like a little bit of George Ranch and when you lay down once the water gets still then I let my hands go and then I just think about breathing and I thought I am not a wizard at this right eye goes in and out I think about I forgot to call that guy got to send an email and then if I just stay vigilant and make sure I was okay when I get back on the road and the road is thinking only of the breathing only of the in and out in and out I just visualized are coming in and out of my lungs and just died alone while line the tank and put me in a trance and it takes a while but I can do it quicker because I've done it for years because the tanks in normal thing I get in at the most I always think his I should do this more often that's what I usually think but I can get in the trance but just thinking about the breathing what line the tank of put me in a trance but I can do it quicker because I've done it for years because the tanks and normal thing I get into the most I always think his I should do this more often that's what I usually think but I can get in the trance but just thinking about the breathing</div>

It does not it depends entirely on what you're doing no joke names of whether or not you get punished twice for the same crime so if they can prove exactly the same way they proved with John if it was things happening is that the testing is getting far better so they can test you for stuff now that a year ago is absolutely impossible for sure so the threshold right now that day or said his was confusing to me the threshold that they tested John was supposed to be more then vodka yes and then the deny the fight this is where it gets weird me the night of the fight to commission testing them all the same. Cuz I'm pissed commission USANA &amp; Final Tustin St piss you sodded didn't report anything commissioner before anything right in about you claim to fight but then bada did with you Sade up in the rulebook no matter if it's Pecos whatever is if you get flagged it doesn't matter if it's from residue whatever is you cannot compete until that is out of your body that's the rule book black and white it don't say well speak still good doesn't matter we cannot Grant you the license to compete in which is why they don't suspect that's why I honestly think why they're doing this because they don't know exactly how this is happening I think they have been there series which you know it works right now but ultimate they don't really know what's going on so if they were to suspend John and he's really not taking Chase to the f*** out of them so I think double jeopardy stuff in the system is no indication that he has recently taken it which is not the same drawing Powers John what happens if someone takes say you take creatine the creatines tainted and you have some forbidden substance in your system and it supposed to only play in your system for 6 months if it's the certain stuff but now the testing gets better and so now instead of punishing you for something that you accidentally took and then they test you and they say off we can prove you accidentally took it so when we going to give you a six-month suspension bit after 6 months is over they can still tested in you why because it's got better what do they do now because in the past they would have said it's time served for the you want you don't want to punish a guy for something you've already punished him for if you proven that it's this is what he took with it but that the rulebook is it so you can only compete when you pass the tab you read this will guess yes discussions about this was he think he should be allowed to compete because getting a license to fight that is the rule that's explain the most all the fighters that the real problem would be is what if it's proven at some point I meant to say a big Thrift what if rather than one time that they can tell if you've ever taken anything ever your whole life and they just disqualify anyone forever even if it's an actual shift test you started testing their parameters are based off of Olympic that's right they stop suspending guys 2 to 4 years you know f***** up that is to do a fighter like Josh Barnett that house Smalls your windows not we're not the Olympics don't come every four years it's such a small one or two to four years baby got a guy who's hired some Victor Conte type individual back when Victor was doing this with the other clear any higher some guy in this guy get some on some s*** that no one knows what it is and he's just running through people and he's looking like yoel Romero on smashing people but he's rebuilding it and everybody's like I don't buy it something's wrong and then one day you catch him ever again how many people are cheating right and what should the punishment be should be based on how many people are cheating or should be based on the philosophy we're trying to get cheating out of the sport I don't know whoever can get it out as you do you wish that the Japanese were super crazy strict about steroids back before Pride point for letting a guy like him take something so he can recover you know cuz he's 40 years old he still enjoys fighting but his body doesn't produce testosterone the right way anymore testosterone use exemption VTOL jet</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> any further we should give you credit you're the reason why all this started you are the original podfather soda legitimate one like if there's a lot of people claiming that you're the guy who made the very first podcast you even keep up with the name of it right I didn't come up with the name of podcasting was invented in 2004 anyone was podcasting before there was an iPod interesting late I was living in Amsterdam at the time and working with Dave Winer Who had who really invented blogging and he hadn't created this RSS syndication format and he had software you could block and then an aggregator kind of like no Google Reader at the time that you can read blogs and it was kind of like a two-way communication thing was interesting and lot of people starting to use it in Amsterdam they had cable modems ruled out everywhere and cable modems was sold the time as always on internet it wasn't fast it was just f****** on you didn't dial in which was oh my God this is great this was a huge Improvement and have to kick someone off the phone line all of that so the the experience of multimedia was s*** like you want to hear a song or play a video is like click wait wait wait download-wake-me-up it would probably download an open up some kind of player than it was not an experience there's nothing nothing there that made sense so and I always want to broadcast on the unit that's always been my thing from the moment I saw it so I came up with this concept of the last yard so what if you had a little thing running on your computer in the background that would know if there's something you wanted let's just forget the Howard nose part it would download it and would tell you that there was something new when it already had it on its local hard drive so you remove the whole wait experience cuz you don't know you don't know that this computer's been downloading something you it just tells you how it's here it's not abnormal in Media or the 6 News most of its produced before the actual broadcast so I took this idea to Dave and I said we need to come up with something that can download a media file that I program somehow like this is going to show up and then it download it and only tells me when it's there and I can click on it plays immediately and it took some convincing he didn't exactly understand what I was saying he probably thought that's f****** MTV guy gets f*** out of here that's exactly what you thought and what I wanted to do in his own software and he said okay I'm going to do this but only on the condition never ever ever f****** use my software again because that was horrible what you just did and so we created the enclosure element in RSS and so for two years we were doing back and forth like movie files stop and don't click and would open up in the experience was good until I saw my first iPod friend of mine to look at this and like the white one with the big, it was a good one right there for awhile like hard drive and I looked at him went this is not a solid state receiver programming and so I said about again with my fantastic programming skills skills to make a little application and the dye pot at the time you still had to sync it to iTunes is how you got music onto it back in the day and so you could put a an MP3 file into a blogpost basically but it was a special attachment really and so this program would just be looking all the time it's just something new something new something new download it then QuikTrip it so that it's synchronized to the iPod and it works now not being a programmer actually Kevin marks the guy was working at Apple same to you a version of the script that actually work that was helpful and I set about creating a radio show but we didn't have a name podcast yet and I wanted to be able to talk to developer software developers who could create receiver Sony we had by Potter I Potter should I Potter lemon all the all these different applications which kind of did the same thing and because I was talking to developers I called it the daily source code so I did every day and source code is kind of what the developers working and I was really talking to them like the guys over in New Zealand 8 and they've created this version of the iPhone is really working well and we discovered all kinds of crazy s*** like you subscribe to a feed because we don't have thought it through try and download know everything you had feed all at once so try to download 50 episodes and we still had kind of always on internet help with everything with Crunch and die and this just kept building and building other people started doing these and we called and soliloquies and little bundles of joy and all kinds of really dumb names and the Denny Gregoire guy who was just listening to podcast and the name stock Ben hammersley from the Guardian years earlier had actually use the term podcast somewhere in article which has no podcasting at the time but he envisioned that and then called it podcast so really fast before I knew what the BBC was calling in the interviews here and then I'm like holy s*** something blowing up here and it wasn't until that that's a big moment was I got a call from Steve Jobs and he says I can watch it with Eddy cue big-man-on-campus there now so can you meet with Steven like an hour and it was and I had a lot of interesting that he busy dude my my best meeting to date had been Quincy Jones where I got drunk with him for an hour on live radio show that was Steve Jobs really heard before two of us is Maddie's f****** pissed off and is yelling about the f*****-up Wi-Fi and I learned later that his his plan always for the iPhone was to not be a cell phone but to use Wi-Fi networks around the world and it really wouldn't be that scene was for that was his his vision and actually I thought to myself probably come down just to make sure and then he was talking about Eddy cue says yeah you know the Raa called and they got a problem with the with our able to record sounds on the macneill breaking any kind of encryption and I said important because in order to record stuff we using like audio hijack Pro and all these different kinds of tools and I said Mom and I hope hope they don't do that because it's kind of important for production to see you f*** it down to f*** themselves this is tools are guys need on him and then he said I'd like to put podcasting an iTunes are you okay with that I like are you kidding me yes I'll give you my director that built the directory of pothead I'll give you that the started off absolutely and then I was kind of funny so then maybe what year was this 2004 2004-2005 time frame and then they can find if you want it's a pretty funny video so he announces this on stage playing my my podcast where I just rail on the Mac it's if they're really legitimizes me in the world of podcasting thank you Steve I really appreciate it. You got to check this out this is hilarious free radio invented podcasting and now he has a podcast called The Daily Source let me go ahead and subscribe to that and now we can go listen to his latest one and just click on it do with 500k do you know exactly what he was doing bro I'm telling you he went on to raise lot of money from those companies to build my podcast Network what was the first what year was your first podcast the first one you released also that was 2003 I guess what was going on before you was there anything was there any other people did putting a video and audio if you remember that low-grade streaming stuff and with this really made it did two things I mean it's all the problem for downloading that was the first and now that's no longer an issue of course so it but it did put the subscription model in the place and because neither I or de why nor have ever patented any of this it's completely free and open so no one owns it and that was that was the mission I'm very proud of that that's beautiful because otherwise if someone Spotify is now trying to buy podcasting by buying up all these networks and they'll make it exclusive and Grant trying to switch from a music company to an audio company but ultimately look at all the applications that are out there that are really good people love them the Apple podcast app I use overcast I like that a lot there's any of tons of different ones and it's all because it's an open standard that no one can control in Silicon Valley loves control in a Walled Garden locked into Apple stuff know then you have they didn't have many different ways they could do stuff or they could help but I don't know why I don't know why they're not I think it's I think they thought for the longest time that I was just this thing that people did that was no big deal and then it's become so enormous but they still have this Mount this model of their operating under that it's just they're just aggravating could be I mean what was interesting is when they started off they immediately start to highlight NPR programming which I'm not I'm grateful for WGBH in Boston did a lot with the putting their first programs make nose available as podcast but kind of the the beauty of the amateurism of podcast and got pushed down a little bit and it was all BBC and PR CVS a little too much for me the Radiolab Isle of Radiolab but I know what you're saying it's very produced it's right like people answer questions for the ghazt instead you look hot in it so what he said was this why you just let him say it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's just nuts how much money is involved in in and how many people look away and people are trying to stop different flavored tobacco smoke I see you're a vapor will that that I actually look into that very very deeply and now this was that the tobacco industry had a problem the problem was this I kicked the cigarettes with this cuz it's just me or not things happen the lung issues and I don't know who you know personally but there was a surge don't know anybody personally there was a scare in the scare killed a couple of people like 10 people and would have turned out was that was people who would Vaped THC cartridges and some putting him the people who put the you buy your THC cartridge from a dispensary here it's actually package by somebody else not by that person so you have new king World whatever it is different here that's kind of a reputable brand but it's somewhere else that means putting it in your putting the stuff in and they put in some vitamin E acetate and that just have like created a Whitney of heat that up and became a web of some s*** inside your lung and f***** you up so that's an odd thing but that nothing to do with vaping nicotine with with the typical chemicals do you get from reputable companies The Vaping from marijuana with their processes more problematic than vaping of tobacco well he was in that case let someone change the formula then you need to have some some oil in there and work keep it near liquid in Fort just for it to be able to go into the Vape and not the issue was actually the vitamin E oil so that's top of course somewhere someone did something shity and that happened really high guy actually said this to me once he told me that he uses organic MCT oil for his you vape I don't even know you you could be a crazy person you can be a DMT Vape DMT Vape now you might be going into orbit for 20 minutes not quite the same as death by helicopter controlling the rotations of a bolts very delicate like literally the amount of effort you put if you like you if you watch a good player the amount of effort they put really accurately depicts how many Revolutions of the cutest Georgia and after its colliding with the object ball and you get more sensitive that when you're high is another one a lot of people do Jiu Jitsu it's really, most perfect Landing ever it when I was super into it anyway so we had a real issue also comes back to the States because there's this master agreement that was put in place decades ago that tobacco companies would pay a percentage of their sales to all states to free compensation for whatever fuckedupshit people get from smoking tobacco and all the states wrote big bonds against that money and so when the income from the tobacco companies would decreasing significantly because of vaping all of a sudden the states are going especially this one what the f*** Brooke so everyone had an incentive to get rid of vaping get people back on Tobacco so they Ultra bought juul the debate that the main thing this is Hardcore this is Jewel is a prepackaged product kids were buying it like over a juul you can control how much can you put a fan put whatever you wanted and not just limited by what juul wants to sell you and went back to the cuz you like the story okay so so tobacco States everyone's keyed-up they buy juul for 18 billion dollars they buy it as a write-off they want to get this company out of the market then they go to the FDA and they start all this s*** about flavors flavors flavors flavors you start everywhere it was it was a perfect storm 10 people dying from vaping something completely unrelated but vaping Theory cigarette he died it was actually now you babe but you vape too bad teeth THC cartridge and now got a severe problem so you know how the media plays that and it just kept like what we have to stop the children in the way you stop it is by taking away the flavors cuz children they want flavors that's what the problem is so that's f***** Jewel over and then actually Altria Philip Morris Bass pesos the biggest tobacco company they start they already wrote down half of it but I just taken L on it they want to get rid of it because in the wings they had their Computing products which is iqos I quit ordinary smoking small icapital qos and he eats tobacco so it's a it looks like a vape pen and has but it's actually runs on Tobacco and it doesn't burn it it Heats it up has whatever some kind of mechanism in the filter you inhale and is almost there dream which is the smokeless very close to it but most importantly it's not a nicotine synthetic nicotine it is tobacco product which is their business and they got they really ratchet this up so high that they got Trump involved and Trump actually with Melania is that they did a thing with Alex Azar the Health and Human Services secretary he said well we have a kid actually was one of those moments were I'm about to jump on Trump he said Melania has a kid forgot to say was his whatever it was and now she overheard saying I wish I'd never gotten involved in that f****** thing because he figured out he's figured out was a huge scam the bill has been stopped but now they're still trying to push through a bill that will help the tobacco companies even more by outlawing any type of flavored e-cigarettes or juice liquid or they just want to get rid of it so it's really like who killed the electric car wait exactly that they just go look at it out iqos they launching this news stories today to say oh my God it's the Saving Grace we have the new product we've all been waiting for that right at the moment that vaping is going to kill you it's hooking children because of flavors so do you think they're they're hiring people to write news stories and the News organizations are picking you up because they're being told to do this release to do press on it so easy to medium oh by the way we're all three so we're going to buy five hundred million dollars worth of advertising over the next five years would you please run our story or do you might want to look at this, tobacco so do you think that they make a deal before they accept a press release to do advertising or do they wait a little bit television subject and it would be a good subject a lot of people paying attention to it it would get a lot of ratings if you have a lot of stories about over-medication of children what is going on to be something you would be interested in and yet they don't do it because the advertising found these days because I'm sure that I'm being blanketed with so many ads that eventually I'm going to get Propecia eventually I'm going to get high blood pressure I'm getting my dick's not going to work cuz that's what you're telling you every every commercial block now Land Two Half Men and what's the other one Doug and Carrie I don't watch those are one of two countries in the world that allows advertised as far as Australia is the other either one but for whatever reason sorry either one cup call out the wrong one of those thinking but that for whatever reason that everybody else is like what are you crazy and once we got it in there it's like 1 something becomes something that everybody does we are crazy it's really difficult to fix</div>
