		<div class="paragraph"> look at this like okay now we know something can happen that we never talked to happen for the whole world shuts down now we know that's it we should we should act accordingly in like how we run things now we know what that's a silver lining I mean like that's a silver line it's like when you have a thing happened that you realized like you know whatever like in your car you get lucky and you notice that the tire is like super flat and you feel you fill it up whatever you see thing and it saves you from a later f****** thing they could have been a million times worse but you know man the wake-up call to me is like it's no joke that you need to at least be on like some terms of your neighbors and it's no joke that you need to understand how to do like how to grow food out of the ground and it seemed like basic first aid and stuff like that and I always have gas in your car trees in like f****** the Vino left a credit card at the house right in like the car was kind of low on fuel cuz I didn't gas it up like I should have right and no combination of settling not being able to put gas in the car and he's too dumb mistakes it wasn't just a normal shity day where your car I got a gas now it's your cars run out of gas during a pandemic meaning you got to call somebody to come and get put gas in your car or walk somewhere to get gas at the whole different Denver for not asking someone to come and help you it's kind of like asking to me would you mind like taking a chance and I know you're wearing a mask and everything but you know what I mean so suddenly f*** ups in this kind of environment they mean a lot more than f****** in like the previous world that we are in and that's teaching me a real kind of responsibility you know like having some cash on it like stuff like that I hate using every season with turn Silver Lining right now and it's like anytime you say I saw you at the Silver Lining on the people who drown in their own f****** mucus it's not the few know it's f***** up but I guess one of the Silver Linings in it is just that the fact that it's like look man Trump just was talking about maybe we should inject ourselves with a Lysol okay Yeah Yeah Yeahs tweeted it when you look into the abyss the abyss looks into you release date of an entire planet that it might be a good idea to inject Lysol in your body's here at let's hear my computer I had to get the sound out of it nothing anyway bottom line is he's saying wacky s*** in the focuses on this lady and now she's watching him she's like I can't even f****** believe I have to handle this I don't know how you doing there you go cuz you see a thing like that and it's like okay lean into that like that's going to fly Queen into that is a thing that you can count on that's a thing saying inject Lysol that's the kind of thing where you're crazy as friend if they said that to you you wouldn't be considering like calling their of their friends their mom to be like hey Jackie's having like a hardcore manic episode he's talking about injecting Lysol I knew himself you better do something that's a f****** president and it mean what that tells me is like Parker you need gas in your car you need to make sure your phone is do stuff you know whatever you need to make sure that you are like you got to be ready because if if we like think we're going to lean into some like imaginary hammock made of like people Doterra saying that we should inject yourself with Lysol then wormate then it's our fault cuz you know it's like let's say you went and you I don't know you went into the forest and you got attacked by a tiger but right before you went in the Tiger use the force you said to somebody hate you think I should go in that fourth or Tigers down there like no and then they start shooting up with Lysol you know what I mean if you go in that Forest that's your fault you f****** listen to a dude you thought you could shoot up Lysol you know what I mean that's your fault intelligent way to get out of this f****** subject and I've already started and I've already coming up with perhaps for instance maybe you could maybe you could hit somebody with a tremendous whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light and I think you had fun some of the way and I think you said you going to test that to sounds interesting right and then I see the disinfectant with knocks it out in a minute 1 minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or or almost deplaning cuz you see gets in the lungs and volume down put your lungs to a carwash like what what a crazy thing to say I mean cleaning cleaning give him a cleaning you know soap to me you see that and it's like okay well I'm not quite certain that that is where I'm going to get my data stream from because that's a Lysol person and then but then we but then there must be like a thing we can do regardless of the fact that clearly you wouldn't even talk like that on a podcast imagine you have zero expertise in a certain subject to talking to someone is like some expert in this said subject and you're proposing these outlandish like you're at a Podium you don't even have a private conversation in front everybody you're someone to have an aside conversation we are proposing these ridiculous ideas you can't do that you can inject this infection he probably upset and she wants to do the best work that she can do and this is just some nonsense just to handle along the way a lot of things might be able to be done and maybe you could do a strong ultraviolet light like in the skin that is like oh my God I'm laying out possible ways that you could tear this terrible to keep going I better have more than one yeah for support like I think you said maybe I think you said maybe looking at that yeah man I mean it definitely has that sense like when you had to give her a report at school and you hadn't prepared.</div>

alright so that and the Bry activity that and then bribed the rest of it sure you know you're you're getting a picture taken of you to try to get you into the school that your dad went through or whatever you're complicit to some degree like you have to be a little bit good luck stop go up look at that that's a grey sweater grey t-shirt grey t-shirts it's really f*****-up is like there's some kid whose parents like like you're making 20K a year who's working as f****** ass off you know I just like somehow managing do I study non-stop to try to get into a good school and doesn't get into the school cuz of that s*** that's the that's the satanic part is like they buy their way in and that's someone's place they have a limited number of places meaning like theoretically somewhat doesn't get into the school who could be the person teleportation or some s*** schools are you have your first choice second choice 1/2 Billy custard Choice yeah he's going on where's it going South Dakota Illuminati with an embarrassing and if you don't know how I talk around my friends what if that's how it is with like Illuminati to like these kids don't even know their parents were the Illuminati

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm not like a paranoid person but I'll tell you a joke you got me to leave my house for the first time in five weeks since I don't have you left and I'm so happy I tested the first time in five weeks that I've left the house and yeah Airsoft but no great to be here thank you my pleasure and I haven't I haven't left my house in 5 weeks I've been isolating as a responsible Citizen and excited to be here okay at this point in my life there you go right before this happened and I kind of think of myself sometimes I think okay imagine if I had been in a relationship that hadn't been going well and this happened and then you have to make the decision to isolate with somebody I'm not in that situation I'm home alone and I've been talking a lot to my friends on FaceTime and I've been socializing and I've been you know living life in this world but alone in my house I'm going through my computer's started going through old footage I found that clip from when you came up to my house back in the day and now I just saw this moment were in the clip where we started talking about my old web show and you come up to my house back in the day and it was so cool that you came up then and remember the time your website was like way advance write like it had all sorts of extra stuff on it that people weren't really doing on the web back then and you came up we start talking about the web and that was because of my webmaster Andrew Blevins shout out to Andrew Webb creating talking about what we got to do prophetic moment how can we make money off of it now we're here in this beautiful Studio really planted a seed in my head to do something like this online this yours was a big one got done at your house and seen how you had servers is not a sophisticated service provider set up at your house like you could have run like a network in 2007 the whole rack set like it was much more like a sad than anything I've ever seen before outside of a set it would light screwed into those ceiling I kind of trashed my place even figured out how to take video calls from people that was exciting then I guess you and that's that was a bad Corner my living room there to Genie delete all the wires going up to that that's going up into the ceiling. Through the ceiling into the spare room which I turned into the editing room I forget what models is Sony's Witcher so you started with a tricaster and Mister system first I had that for a year then we got this the first person to tricaster that's Victor who was working on the show until you stuck that I'm here today I still talk to Victor quite a bit to shout out today but but still kind of legit oh my God cuz Anthony cumia had a kind of a pretty high-tech set up in his basement that was another inspiration cuz he was doing that while he was doing Opie and Anthony and you know they actually is important I'm wanted him to stop doing it they decided something or another it's not he shouldn't be allowed to do an extra show karaoke with machine guns in front of green screen haha he was always really funny and just like like a comic but he never did stand up I mean I'm just making this up right now but I think sometimes people that have never done stand-up who do radio or afraid of it because and that went out and it was defining what's happened in our world you were just saying you know like what we do we don't need the advertisers anyway we do you need the Network's anymore we don't know we can cattle go straight to the advertiser that video available anywhere I think I saw it on the internet about how this internet stuff is played out since then so I remember I got a call this is one of those like you know when you think about syncback user kick yourself I was so I mean how far in the weeds the guys from Denver is San Francisco San Francisco and Barrett Lions did he do some stuff with some guys from Denver that was that was sort of around the same time they were that was Mania TV but TV was the only people that were really doing live streaming and I said hey you know like I want to build this TV studio and the studio but I wanted to I wanted to be autonomous of them as well so I got my own servers through this company bit gravity where they basically invented the technology to upload video and then serve it up so I would link that to my website on green.com completely autonomous of the other website Mania TV so made a few mistakes all the stuff to be on my website and then YouTube started now what's this will YouTube all the school they're still doing things out of an apartment in Sanford on the member one point somebody called me from YouTube said hey man we really like what you're doing be on your server right so you have those fuse not thinking okay we could have it out spread it send it out but it was it was exciting everybody thought that ya done now it's like comparing two of them because all those other video things it's like yeah you'll get some views but it's just YouTube for whatever reason captured the day I have the market could never became my space you with your phone or camera development you can upload it like real simple anybody can do it and then anybody else I can get views like that is amazing that one company has that locked up in technology and they got the fun to be able to stay right on top of it just make it the strongest platform possibly I don't know I don't even Twitter like how they do that just like one Twitter I mean there's Facebook on Instagram but if I if I go to your page and I'm reading one of your caption someone will say something in response to someone that like a f*** you dick boy or whatever and then I try to click and find out what they were talking about and someone will say something in response to someone that like a f*** you dick boy or whatever and then I try to click and find out what they were talking about and I get to the beginning of the comments and then I got to go through all the comments to try to figure this out like why can't I just click</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and you start thinking about all the possibilities what could happen and then this Panda happens and then you know I still live in the same place where did the show you know I just started seeing you know I'm here in Los Angeles to I was seeing Black Hawk helicopter Apache helicopter do you know I haven't watched it let me know it's crazy Walking Dead Seasons Ross hear about it now but maybe even better is the first season of the LA version of Walking Dead what's that one called couple episodes of spectacular felt like is that what time the beginning the beginning in the beginning it felt touch-and-go when everybody was hoarding all the tooth to toilet paper and I were fighting a gun the gun lines were giant Rife gun stores were creepy maybe it's not obvious enough so toilet papers big ass so because it's big takes up a lot of shelf space who takes up a lot of space so everybody went to the grocery store at the same time and there's probably far less toilet paper at the grocery store then it would appear too because it takes an entire Royal cuz it's big so everybody want but one piece of package of toilet paper on the first day he was instantly all it's instantly an entire empty aisle which is dramatic looking and it was the first sign of shelves being cleared and it was the toilet paper was gone and everyone went on their f****** phone toilet paper and all of a sudden. Compounded it exponentially and I was going to the toilet paper they don't need to be gone for the toilet paper and we had the great toilet paper shortage of 20/20 this is the type of investigative reporting you do when you're alone for five weeks Columbo toilet paper cuz it's big dumb people think about a lot of shiting write wash your ass with a washcloth back because s*** is going down alrighty that's the last thing you need to worry about is my toilet paper you need to worry about consuming food and staying alive don't think it's ever going to get to that and those the ones that stock up on toilet paper the ones who buy like rice and beans and stuff like that those the people that are planning their legitimately planning ahead you want to stay a lot corn and rice that's what I was a subsystem enough vitamins and everything you need so you don't get enough protein that way but you get some from being overly not as available sun is bioavailable as it is in other Foods so protein you just going to eat a lot of protein vitamins and everything you need so I'm sure you don't get enough protein that way but you get some from being overly not as available bioavailable as it is in other Foods so protein you just going to eat a lot complete some forms of protein</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> watch the movie about the free free free climbing movie that's playing on the plane but the guy that climbed Alex Honnold besides like I said earlier we're going to make pants I want to make tents I'm going to climb that you get to meet so many people like that yeah that must be fun well it's it's very important for me as a person trying to figure people out is to be able to see this insane spectrum of exceptional people right to see some like Alex Honnold has a really fascinating guy very fast really smart is really to India and he's really mellow he's got hands like saucing ass right you realize he didn't bring his chalk with him so he found some other climbers that were on their way out there were on ropes and said hey do you think I can borrow some chalk and they gay I have an extra bag here take it so he's f****** thousand feet up just hang it on finding other people were connected to the ropes with and they give him a bag of cherries over he leaves at the top of the mountain cuz he passes that cuz he's in he's not your man don't show me on freaked out food bro. Down to that wow holy s*** dude f*** all that look I know it's together with a group of people and I'd always said I'm never going to jump out of an airplane that was always my thing parachuting because we drove out there together group of people and I realized on the drive that I was the only person that wasn't coming out the airplane OG's and for whatever reason my competitive spirit that the best of me I said there's no way I'm going to be the one that didn't jump out of the airplane on the way back so we suited up and I just in that movie Charlie's Angels okay and there's a lot of parachuting in it and the stunt coordinators from that movie were taking the cast out to jump out if they wanted to so I went and Jared Leto was there you know my friends were there and I did and I didn't regret it but I'll never do it again it was amazing it was exciting you're you're strapped onto a guy doesn't your back right doesn't your body is getting a lot further away and then you're now the weirdest part about it was 20 years ago now but or 18 or whatever that you're now you're doing this right and you kind of realized control because there's another guy over there he's kind of far away and all sudden like you lean into it and you fly up to him like Superman this far away is far away I don't know what a papist you looking at each other and it's amazing and exciting and then nothing was weird about this then you pull the Chute or the guy on your back both the shoot and now you're hanging from ropes and you would be the time where it's you can relax but to me the one time I've done it talking about parachuting like I know about it the one time I've done at 18 years ago that's the scariest moment that the only thing preventing you in your face looking at your feet now you're looking at your feet hanging below you and your feelings ropes you're holding on holding the ropes gun these ropes gift like nothing nothing but amazing experience will never do it again surprised you haven't I think you got a contact high song there's no reason for that I think you would I think you would if I lived yeah yeah I'm pretty yeah I get it I get it but I don't I don't think I need that my life now I don't that's what I always said to where you end up going out to parachuting thing with a bunch of people unless you know here in a relationship and the person when you going to be that the chickenshit you got to do what you got to do save face ya almost. One of those things that you kind of you do it and you think I'm going to be okay and then one time maybe you're not and that's all it takes one of red bands dad his friend worked with a lady was little it was really in the sky diamond she's always trying to get him to do it and then one day he showed up at work and she wasn't at her desk and so what happened last night all that f*** all that dude</div>

These guys race runways out here now that's like the thing now is run Runway racing so they go out and they go side-by-side half-mile they're doing like to 2230 and 1/2 Mile would fly through the Air Jordan Fly you would drive the number being more than normal car that doesn't fly yeah I would drive something then by the way after that they changed the they read sculpted that section of track Brianna yes they for a. Of time Shane they impose the speed limit even during races through that section to prevent that from happening again they changed I believe the rules of the racing series to unload the cars down and then I believe they re did the track there is well after that incident like that or at least to make it substantially less likely scary crazy place at every every reputation that it every bit of reputations are ended it deserves and it's but you going to doing it is like one of the more unique experience of your life and you don't have to like you know like you said you have to go for time you can just go and drive it as a fast fun road which is what I've done as Americans we should be ashamed that the Germans have the Nurburgring Amelia but it was a Hitler it was a fourth Reich superiority thing right alongside the Autobahn best race tracks best race cars best highways as part of their deal and it is how to figure out speed people run speed and they're giving it to the pilot at a speed probably was doing speedballs like f****** John Belushi I mean it was it was crazy and yeah yeah yeah submarine base leaders of floating coffin and they sent these people out with like 10 tablets of meth and nothing else and this little submarine that had a little gun in like none of them came back just can't. That I have sympathy for Nazis but messed up soldiers and death submarines maybe a little bit is that what it was that little thing oh my God yeah, it's the picture I saw had the bubble somewhere in Columbia is a dude with a thousand pounds of Coke in one of those right now that a great idea anyway knocking on the bed early do they open up the jumped on top of a goddamn submarine and made the guys open the pulse open the sub bro it is Bonkers a submarine holyshit looking this 25 footlong sub so these guys are following behind it and he jumps off we was bad motherfuker so we do you think you think this sub is capable of fulsome urging or this is the closest to sublet it gets stops and filling them up with Cocoa FL in that made any way to another country in that big ship in Philadelphia that cargo ship that was supposed on by Chase but I had 200 or 400 million dollars worth of cocaine really Paris to Dakar Rally is the car race like cars like my Safari or like built for that and it's Grace and then there's these support trucks right and they they race the trucks to since like he's like, pause and like man trucks big off road tires huge engines and the trucks are in the race and so these Coke Smugglers that the trucks the bat in the back of the truck is enough parts to like rebuild the whole car and the truck has a racing driver and a v mechanic screw and they chase the car at the car brakes right and so Smuggler's bought one of these Dakar race trucks did it up like The Livery and just like couple miles after the start just like enter the race 13000 pounds I'm sorry it's like seven and a half times that is crazy and 37 Bales million pounds worth escape the built the sub Ray Liotta and Kevin Dillon invention No Escape with her on the prison Island they get the</div>

I'm all your babies I'm all your baby that is very kind of you to say I'm sitting here on your incredible show with everybody is riveted by your show when you say something it matters which is different than when you do a show on your audio podcast now I got a few people listening but it's not like it doesn't matter right that's responsibilities out but you're when you say something here it will affect the entire Society you have people now who don't believe in the stay home order there but they should until the actual scientific experts that they should go out but here's the thing who are the experts and are they different in different states and I think that's one of the benefits of having 50 states when I'm talking about the different styles of living Arizona lets you have a gun just carried on your hip right you can't do that in San Francisco right this different styles of living let's find out what different styles are right way to reopen the world we know the world got to be reopened okay we're not going to just stay Oscar winning run out of food I have to do things so do we have to do things after the vaccinations and can our society survive that do not many people are committing suicide right now my Suicide a week now they're doing a day this is something that needs to be factored in the drop in the economy equivalent to a loss of a certain number of lives and that every time the economy drops a certain percentage equal to x amount of life we might get to a place where it's conceivable that more lives are lost because of the ensuing depression and economic shutdown then we would have been lost if we didn't open up we didn't close anything and we just let everybody get sick it's a complicated thing and this is one thing that we have to really rely on the people posed to be in power to address accurately and honestly no one knows the right way to do this there's some real good protocols and replaced for 4p keeping people healthy and protecting each other and staying away from each other as much as possible and wiping things down and using hand sanitizer and stopping the spread yes for sure but no one knows how to get this thing started again no one knows what's going to happen and in the meantime what about the other diseases that are still around but about the colds and flus and what about all that stuff that kills more people than any of these things including covid-19 projections attacks not knowing I mean you don't know if you can prevent this right you know you know you eat well you can you look after yourself you'll be less likely to have a heart attack but you don't know if you can breathe can't breathe in a heart attack thing is all dependent upon your genetics as well as some people that have a predisposition to heart attacks but I'm wrong and it's so you must I'm just kind of curious how much time do you do spend research and cuz you know you know so much information 99% of the time you Jamie Google things to correct me in Midstream Instinct sort of the the you know the truth through the b******* and then you kind of cuz cuz I mean because everything is so polarized oh I've got to choose to say this because that's what everyone saying and they're just kind of saying it cuz everyone saying it was you definitely straddle that line in a way that to me seems incredibly astute but also must be some pressure to to make sure that you're right tell me about it this is b******* Go music is my daddy is being he's being like a real elf have a hard conversation things I make mistakes too if you're doing 1500 whatever the f*** shows plus by Companions and shut I don't know JRE MMA shows another 50 those at least write a hundred Jesus number of interactions that most people have with each other are positive right otherwise the world be a war zone on hey what's up hey this thing is podcast the vast majority of the stuff you do is going to be good this going to be moments where those some guy you were taking a left turn and he talked to you and you said f*** you need to know f*** you in like how do you decide to not and I don't feel like you do have an agenda to change or change things in it and it's premeditated Direction you just you're trying to be honest yeah yeah I can tell you just want to be real I wanted I just want to be able to talk to friends about stuff that's actually happening that's it but if you have any at all cuz I want people to do better included do martial arts really think about how you're doing it and More You Realize are others like a lot of stuff I could learn here that's what I want to do I want people to find things and try to get better at them doesn't mean try to be the best does it mean to be obsessed with it there's something that you get out of trying to be better</div>

A lot of sleeping do you not love your neighbors do you want to get sick or is there any been any evidence that that is happening now that there is with our phone specifically to do you know the phone tracking who destroyed like are they to the concept of it is definitely available right the concept of it of contact tracking is being talked about openly and then if if a company Shores figured out I say it's like there was a place to go right this is becoming interesting so say there's a place you go Tom Green you go and they give you a vaccination what's a vaccination comes available and you know that you now don't have to worry about getting this thing so we can track all the people that have been vaccinated as long as you sign up for the app and all the people not be vaccinated you see them and see them on the app well before we stepped in this mall will see what kind of shity f****** citizen through have been vaccinated you're not allowed in the mall on a map and it will get real weird yeah it's another step a really quick step in a dragging us into the machine and to take away you know the nuances of just human life they were accustomed to and it would become more more digitized and organized and people need Freedom man and if you don't have the freedom to just be somewhere without the government knowing that they're like it if you haven't committed any crime you're not a criminal and if they can just monitor you and you've never committed any crime that has a weird place that's weird things getting weird is supposed to be supposed to be following criminals only and I know it makes it easier for you to follow criminals if you can follow everybody but you were changing what everybody is you change if you follow them all the time everywhere they go if you listen to everything that they ever say through the microphone and they're f*** changing what they are and you're making up scared and everybody knows it and no one wants to admit it you're making people scared of people do things because they don't want censorship they don't to be censored then we yell at they self-censor they don't want to be not in compliance it changes their behavior we all know that we all know that it's dangerous to creativity dangerous to authenticity is dangerous to so many things it's not it's not a good way to be as a person like looking over your shoulder people to watch you all the time 2 we're just too weird too weird to force the hold and then who's got control that the government like what some people that got elected to a position the only one to get the look in and everybody and then would have that opens up with you know everybody can look in and everybody f*** it the information act what is kind of given to the evitable tell me to watch this s*** I'm going to watch you s*** from your toaster cuz you toast yeah man it's not going to be pretty but it's almost like we're taking a step closer and closer towards the digital world with this and that's I don't I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the sense that I don't I don't I don't think that robots are out to get us I don't think that the electronic world is looking to consume us but I am concerned with some steps that we could take that make our life more digital to take away too much of what it means to be a person some what it means to be a person is like fun is this find the weirdness of the world there's fun in the danger of the world you take away all that s*** with apps but and and alerts and you know and like where I can't go down that street there's a guy down the street that was arrested at one point in time s*** to do for safety and then we become what would have become his unromantic boring bulshit digital things that are locked in the pleasure sources it pumpkin pleasure to they taking the place you know me really they could do that if they could get to a point where you wear an implant it just keeps your dopamine levels up at a very high high note you get augmented reality glasses were buddies hot and be pretty cool do you like The Matrix member when the one dude was given into matrices like luck I just want to be an important person or Duncan actor some memories writing he's</div>

I like what you can't believe sometimes people I out there that don't do that that are in like the media that are in this that sort of video loves this s*** more than I mean how to hate Trump when it's like 90% they're f****** fault part is there's a lot of different things going on in sports you want your team to win that's a huge amount of that you know that movie Annihilation with Natalie Portman where they buy the same people can see that movie now alright well when you see the time to watch it it's pressing against the door she's fighting it and then she stops for a minute and then she gives it a grenade and pulls it in and gets away by being the more she would fight it would give equal reaction back at her reflection and you hate it the more they fight it the more it presses them back up against the door and that's that's there's nothing I'm never going to figure out how to just like give him the grenade and pull the pin and walk away cuz they can't like a Uzi he definitely makes mistakes but they are also so wrapped up in everything that he does in a way that they distort even things that probably turn out to be a good idea anything you like I'll do a thing every f****** day and what you going to do and people like there's like a bunch of us don't follow me they like his genius all the time you see Fighters talk s*** to each other right one of the reason why they talk s*** to each is it trying to get the other person emotionally invested in the fight right to try to get him angry and pissed off we're going to do something irrational they're not going to be logical right that's what you're saying front and he was like the people that vote for a feel like that Obama feeling that's what it's such an offense it's anything Obama did or didn't do its the feeling that it's send it right when you want that back always said about him I forget about his policies like he was a great Statesman the way he would talk that's because he was reserved and he was articulate and smooth and when you would hear them talk but that's an excellent representation of the United States where's like the thing with Trump is that he's you know like you said he's not really a politician so he's just being the guy who's always been there but it's like I thought you were going to be a president though I thought you going to act like we need cuz you want to be called POTUS people got him for specifically the opposite of that it's done now so people still want that The West Wing or whatever the f*** like that's what it is it's like your West Wing kind of people that you want well I think it exposes how not rigged it is cuz it's only controlled it no f****** way to know you don't like trolls some of it well this is one of the reasons why they're so scared of Tulsi gabbard cuz she doesn't lay down like that you see that moment was Kamala Harris in the debates they haven't either the internal thing you got to settle with all the people that are actual left that are like mad and they want their Trump so they're not going to go along with the same cuz cuz I think a lot alike just liberals don't get that the the lefties hate you more than they hate or not they hate you more than any right-winger just a regular liberal that's who they want to get them that's why they turn on Eleanor whoever the f*** cuz they're waiting to have a reason to turn on you cuz cuz I think a lot alike just liberals don't get that the the lefties hate you more than they hate a Nazi they hate you more than any right winger just a regular liberal that's who they want to get them that's why they turn on Ellen or whoever the f*** cuz they're waiting to have a reason to turn on you</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> has there been discussion it like as anybody brought this out like a Dan Crenshaw was not aware of this when I discussed it with him when they were talking about federally legalizing marijuana right it's not just about saying it's okay for kids right it's a it's about mitigating these problems that you have with cartel sure is when there is an illegal opportunity to sell something that there's a demand for than the criminals going to sell it and that's what we have now exactly and it has there been discussion like to someone to bring this up like this is one of the primary problems with having marijuana federally illegal with California having its state legal that there is this massive confusion in this you know diminishing of penalties in California with growing illegally there totally is and you know you got the opposite ends of the Spectrum in and here's what we're learning with regulation I've always said this I said look if we're going to regulate and we need to regulate to stop this black market let's do it smart you know let's for one everything we we we really try to push here in California was regulate legitimate cannabis the correct way keep people safe child it tested make sure those pesticides cartel pesticides are absolutely man and other people they're not destroying waterways when I get in gunfights over it great you know no problem but for like that you know the outdoor trespassing with these cartels let's take that funding and put more effort into stopping that you know that's not water down to misdemeanors and infractions things like that and you know it's an even if we keeping take cannabis out of the equation show from the standpoint of I remember a few years ago as quoted by the Associated Press of saying if cherry tomatoes were so desired on the black market or illegal and people were paying $4,000 a pound for cherry tomatoes we haven't gun fights over cherry tomatoes and having band Poison Sun cherry tomatoes that are kids are being in the salads you know because of the black market so you can take you know cannabis even out of the equation and look at the environmental in and look at the public safety but we have to do something to regulate this thing uniformly over the across-the-board and we have to break the black market but what I've seen and I go into the last chapter of my new book hidden were extensively on this is what are the challenges moving forward after seeing regulation in play for 2 years boots-on-the-ground watching it and having a great relationship with legit legitimate cannabis Growers and I'll tell you a few stories that really open my eyes and and got us unified right cuz the whole thing is we the unified on this concept non-polarized left to ride anti cannabis grow cannabis let's get you to fight environmental safety Public Safety all of it but because of how we regulated and the licensing fees and the protocol and everything else we've had all of these you know Black Market growers in the 215 days that wanted to get legal and saw everything coming into cost to do it and being on Big Brothers radar or law enforcement's radar and they backed out like in Humboldt County we had it like I want to stay in the better part of ten to fifty thousand Growers ready to regulate and we barely got a thousand you know and they went you know I can't afford to go through this permitting process I can't afford the delay so I'm just going to go back on the black market I'm not going to be on the radar and that has to stop if we're going to regulate right now the thing it was what was really interesting and I never saw this coming but win and we're about to roll out prop 64 and you know it had been voted and recreational and in the medical laws were tidying up how's the first law enforcement guy being from a marijuana enforcement team to to go into these California Grower Association hosted grower meetings in Santa Cruz right over the hill from my place right and I mean I'm in the oven be to use the camo bottoms the polo I'm going in might you might rain attire for met and the look on 500 Grovers faces when I walked into that meeting just like what you doing here tell your story I'm going to show you a powerpoint it's going to be graphic I'm not here to work anybody you know I'm here to unify just hear what I have to say no judgement and so I was on these guys aware of how big the situation was before because bite but anyway I explain that literally would back in hundreds and hundreds of yards of pipe and tubing like roses on their back other tough yeah I've got I got photos in the new book on trail cam with felt on their feet covering their tracks with the sea bags 100 + pounds and a split pipe they're tough and there I mean to look at the environment they live in for 6 months man they're all Outdoors but I was at this meeting and I gave the presentation I talked about it and it was crazy to see look a shock on these these groups faces I mean some women were in tears some of the guys were just like pissed off and pump in their face and they're like that's b******* we are not about that we're not about doing anything bad with our water we like our wild life we just want to grow cannabis we want to be regulated you know and it was such a turnaround you know from the traditional relationship between law enforcement and a cannabis world and has to be the one guy there with all of the growing Community there and then go from complete horror that I was there isn't a berseria judgment or anything of that or you know to to do anything negative from enforcement standpoint to suddenly haven't real talks about was going out and and I could kind of see the authenticity but genuine is on some of their faces reacted to my slides to the videos and so when I left that first meeting I remember I just got flooded in my patrol truck and I had Apollo with me my little lab and she's an icebreaker I thought well could be an interesting meeting I should have the dog for pets you know and she jumped in and I always Growers were coming to my truck and I'm packing up my stuff and while this is weird and was always you know farmer supervisors from all over the state Mendocino County of the Emerald Triangle Santa Cruz just give me their cars and I have work I have resources we will hike and clean up a grow with you let us help the Met team let us help the Cannabis program whatever we can do and no no charge and and that was genuine man I was really really taken back by that in a positive way and I realized if we get the legitimate Farmers on her side and they're aware of this they will help Market that message nikhil they have money and they have money Cochran campus as it is right but if we could allocate that taxes absolutely to you guys would be incredible where's the money going let's have a certain percentage of it designated for wardens that's starting to happen to because what's now that we've had a couple of years and we're seeing some of the regulatory funding on the taxes trickle back I'm in contact with my team all the time I still get to see him periodically and train and do things like that and really give him a shout out for amazing Risser taken in the work they're doing and promote their message with her out there doing but the money starting come back to us now we're starting to get equipment we start to get more bodies or starting to get like overtime funding so the ridiculous long hours are small Teamworks are compensated for that just happened literally you know within a month or two of Abbey on the show with you so we should have some positives it's great stuff makes your mouth smacked out gives a little it does a little more problems they still have a black market you know and anything right now because we're not regulating federally and so every state anything that's grown stays in that perlot right but every all the demand is back east in these non-regulated states are I don't grow it sew Colorado has you know when Interstate Black Market that's done by the you know quasi legitimate Growers as well as the cartel element so they're still that black market thriving within you know the black market cannabis industry that isn't cartel public lands we got different mixes and we've got a different kind of a problem in Colorado so they don't have as many Epsom I talked to those guys work with him a little bit and they do have some but again they're kind of like where I'm at Montana now tight little growing when do you know early winners late father's plea don't have a very good growing season Outdoors the conditions aren't Prime like they are here in Cali this is a giant issue that is largely undiscussed and it's one of the reasons why I was so fascinated by that podcast isn't it and this is one more one more piece of the puzzle when you talk about border control somehow or another we've gotten into this state in our country this this place our country where some people want to control the border and some people don't want any borders right and do you have to understand that this is the number one problem with the border the number one problem with the borders cartel violence cartel violence cartel crime that's the number one problem and the giant percentage of these people that are coming over and doing illegal activity or doing it because it's profitable write a reason why profitable is because it's illegal and so they can do these things and then sell marijuana Friday all over this country illegally because it's illegal and if it was legal we could regulate it we could tax it the money go into schools and pay for guys like you and and go to fixing this problem instead we're playing this little stupid game where you know some states are legal in some states are and lets lets you know and it's federally it's still schedule 1 time when there's millions of legitimate law-abiding taxpaying citizens and enjoy it and crazy it is and into that point you know you you look at you know the discrepancy and just the inconsistency on cannabis regulation some states I'm not federally not but when you go to the Border issue you brought up that good point of it's not just that cartel element for Discount this poison cannabis stuff for this toxically Tina canvas as a better way to phrase it it's the smuggling traffic in this all those other crimes I may have sediment production so I'm not sure I get asked a lot like after you know what you had a great conversation with the with with my Baker on this was no are open borders going to work and no again about some regulation it's just not going to work does not even so that's why I open borders are going to wear it right if the world was even then start a dialogue in last week. Yeah boy is he scared the s*** out of you though when he comes to the stories about Maco about how bad I was down there and there's there's just an insane amount of violence it's going on down there and it's insane amount of crime and so much of it is connected to the illegal drug trade and it looked that you're not going to kill at all if you make marijuana legal but you would kill a percentage at least it would make it a little bit better and Woodstock that yeah it one of the things we we we get from from getting that regulation if we can stop that black market for you know cartel weed we're going to save a lot of wildlife we're going to preserve a lot of water weighs right because all those other crimes are very heinous and very destructive and I hate to see the human trafficking and all the meth problems and and anything related to violence or by deterioration of a soul but you know I love the wild man was Irma Church yours D I mean what you do for conservation the elk hunting that you're doing all those different things it's magical out there and it's just most people just don't even know I don't think know but I know you don't get a chance to experience what it's like to actually be a real Woodsman the real woods Witcher but what you're getting shrinker smaller and smaller and smaller even here in Cali that is so much Beauty but I look at it this way I said look if we lose all over open space to a problem like this and a compound the problem and we lose our wildlife and good water you may not be in the outdoors right now you might be a preservationist you might be you know on your freaking digital ice all the time and looking at Wildlife through through screen but if you ever do go out and you get that peace and Tranquility to get Center like we do run a trail hike Aveeno LA County Mountain Trail open space don't even get that far in the woods it's just soothing you know brings us back to our Center in you know if the new generations that aren't getting that from the cities can get that or they get their kids doing it with our grandkids are here about it but it's not there to go do that to me man we're just we're just not paying for it this is this is something I got to stay on and I really appreciate you and what you stand for because of the message I think just some people don't know yeah I just think that's a big part of it I said I don't know what's interesting to me to is that the allocation of resources that it's it's so when you have something that's illegal you're not getting any of that money no and if it was legal there's an enormous amount of money that could go to schools and fix the roads and we can allocate it to a bunch of different big time you leave ways to spend it and we're not doing that and it's it's the reason why is because that illegal and this is crime problem is very similar to what they faced during prohibition with alcohol and you the rise of organized crime and that's where they were getting their money from because there was such a demand it's really a disgusting dumb way to approach problem that is many people's ideas of social problem that money could go to so many. positive things for perpetuating it true that reason and many others we're basically you know we're basically embedding a problem in our country and Ed said this called romwe our dialogue in earlier this week and he said you know he's kind of look at things from the border and South and the issues coming in from the border from the cartel front he said you know now getting into your book and I'm starting to analyze what year you guys are fighting on the ground inside the borders of California the rest of country goes it's embedded now I mean it's not like it's just coming across mean the Enterprises in here in the nation because they have the pipeline they have the distribution they have a market and they don't have to deal with border issue and round for bull because of exactly where we're at and when people aren't aware of and in California that it's just a misdemeanor which is even more so yeah it's that's got to change a background and crime especially violent crime and you get caught doing something like that I mean it should be severe severe penalty it should absolutely severe the same Grace that is when we get the environmental crimes that we bring from the fish and wildlife standpoint to those charges for these guys we get it back to felony status because we had an interesting thing happen as soon as all that regulation started two years ago and the water you know those trespass programs or water down hangover talking about District Attorney's all throughout the state said oh man we're not going to be able to prosecute these crimes I mean we're not going to have you know we're not going to have a jury that's static to these issues it's not worth it some Sheriff's departments were saying hey we know how violent these guys are we know your team's been in like six gun fights man and your partner was almost killed in 05 in the first one you guys take these guys head on you know you want to protect your Wildlife whatever but they're not stopping and it's a misdemeanor and we can't convict him so we're not going to play so a backlash of those crimes be watered down Joe was team stop working it except us and like the feds you know and not only that. execute so I remember speaking for the California District Attorneys Association on this and saying guys are the solution everybody no matter where they sit on the Cannabis Spectrum everybody hates to see Bambi dead water poisoned everyone has a little bit of environmental passion in my both sides of the fence and that's why I say here we get to the you we can unify and not worry about where we sit on the performer against and if you take these water code enhancements if you take the felony in the penal code from the band you take these water code enhancements if you take the felony in the penal code from the band toxic Carlos here in if you take a streambed alteration diversion or dead Wildlife or littering close to estate Waterway you stack all those up you get all these penalties and you can convicted on that you know even in a sympathetic jury on Sia cannabis issues so we started to prosecute these cases and it started to come back and it's an arduous and around it's more work than we should have to do but we're doing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Sears man we are just tested on yes apparently it's been some controversy about this so just let me let everybody know right away there's no shortage of antibody tests and what were using there's no shortage of them people say white people in the front light and it's just misunderstanding and confusion these tasks there's no shortage of I understand some people in some places have a hard time getting access to the test not the case here so I take it upon myself to test everybody as a coming to the studio is not taking away from anybody that's on the front lines cuz I'm taking test away from any medical workers that does the test they would use for them particularly that they're using swabs I mean look man those f****** people that are working in those hospitals in the medical workers those people are legit hero yes you know and if I found out that there was something we were doing that was somehow another taking away from there would you be tested I would never do it so people got upset apparently because people writing articles about things cuz you know it's like it's Hot Topic right and their own people like posted some story making comments from Instagram and using them as quotes just some random mcgough that's posting something in this one of them said that we were low-key flexing that we had tests higher time I just shared with you earlier today there was a new study that Jamie Siri pull up that study it is out of I think it's out of UCLA is that what I do it's it says early antibody tests indicate far more cases and a much lower mortality rate Ryan so they think there's at least four hundred. people have been infected in in California so the mortality rate is way way lower than they previously thought it was at least in California you know it's obviously varies there's a crazy disease if it's raised doesn't make any sense it varies depending upon your physical condition whether or not you've been smoking with a night is apparently up a great benefit to exercising regularly even while you have it if you cash it exercising but then it was his f****** what is that guy's name the fox thing we'll do the first there's a there's one on La, look at you indicates far more covid-19 cases lower mortality rate there's a decrease in number of deaths study indicates that there could be hundreds of thousands of people could be infected without knowing it that's what's so weird about it the only time they think that if they catch it before the symptoms set in you survive survive but if they don't catch it for the symptoms I didn't like you just get rabies you don't get over like I do every black person I know always cross the street the only time they think they if they catch it before the symptoms set in you survive survive but if they don't catch it for the symptoms I didn't like you just get rabies you don't get over like I do every black person I know always cross the street when they see a random dog</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but to share that with everybody nationally in my world in the thin green line and for them to start having it happening on the refuges and even just a know this stuff's getting back to their parts of the world and poisoning there are cannabis users you unsuspectingly horrible information right but we need to know a lot of guys didn't know it and so that was one thing to see hey what we need a baseline training in the way we do it here in California is we all go through a really strange an academy everyone gets their basic tools arrest control defensive tactics and firearms training all of that and get good at being the traditional game warden doing all the traditional stuff and they get you know get get their feet wet out doing their own thing for a couple years and then we start to find the people that have the motivation I want to get onto a specialized unit like our met team or one of the Watershed teams or Wildlife trafficking team very seldomly do we put a fresh person there because you know I think to really be a good game warden you got to cut your teeth on all the traditional stuff Google just how how to check guys with guns all the time you know most cops look at that and go that's crazy I mean everybody you check has a knife or a firearm 99% on work I want to see a game warden and game warden wants to see us but for that one felon it's on parole and he's in the woods hiding out and we run across that a lot and I ran across a ton of that down here and So Cal at the start of my career and I'll get some interesting stories about that but so guys who are like Ben skip bail and then hide yep and they've got like a no-bail warrant their wanted on some warrant somewhere and so they're efficient they have an illegal firearm maybe there a felon in possession of a firearm they can't even have and now they're out and remote area where no cops going to find me here and then on the new game warden the Riverside County you know all freaking motivated really green I don't know totally what I'm doing yet and I'm in that truck cruising and something I got into down here that was just crazy but I will say this was a heck of learning curve and I'm really blessed it went out the way it did and it was definite but we would gang banger something from La here and they would go over in the Riverside County and get into my kind of rule Foothills on the edge of the national forest and they have AK-47s and they have you know automatic pistols and they would Spotlight through these Canyons gun in for everything they kill rabbits that kill coyotes they kill deer they get to the end of like a canyon that has like a an outlet of a damn bro Gill night out and spend all night or just gillnet fish turn freely and shooting and killing everything with the spotlights grab their gillnet grab hundreds of fish pack up and then head back you know back to the LA basin I just retired with what you and Marshall Ave Apollo yellow lab English lab she's amazing never to buy a bad guy but you can't lick them to death and try to shoot right you know turn them our way but I didn't have a companion dog the time and I would go and run into these guys and go okay this is what I learned in the academy that you know that that head-on spotlighting stop that you never want to have her get in behind and blacked out and track them down and next thing I know I got a case and I got all these freaking prohibit exotic weapons and I'm going this is crazy Tony's guys that alone I don't have a lot of last year it was just me how many guys did you run into some time to be to one. I pulled like eight people out of a man and I was alone ocean and they were all armed and it was one of my heaviest most intense cases and I've been on one year so this was 1994 and what we were doing in the Riverside Squad as we were just Saturday in the area cuz we're getting everybody from overlay side here spotlighting all our games are like okay with saturate this and back. Joe the game was to catch a spotlight a right-handed cuz they're so deliver his light spotlights all yeah I should I should have done that but there's a handheld Spotlight flashlight whatever and you going to remote areas and you look to find animals at night because they freeze the really relaxed their eyes glow and then you shoot him that way you kill him illegally at night after dark which is never allowed you know it's usually in or out of hunting season any ones go Spotlight a deer nine times out of ten they're they're not lice they're not going to do it during season like we do so they're doing that so in the in our world is game wardens that's the ultimate Wildlife criminal because they're going to kill those you know that have that unborn trophy Buck for good genetics they're going to kill a trophy deer weigh in the right you know that you know needs to go another year or whatever so that's what we focused on that was like if I can cut my teeth and get you know become a reputable game or in a going after the hardcore is that was the game then it was 94 and I'm pulling these guys out call him Alan Ladd I've got my weapon on him and I'm like oh man there's a lot of guys out there I can't get him to jail I'm calling back up I got Riverside County coming and I'm even have the Sheriff's Office helicopter come in several nights once we got to know each other and they realized who is this game or an order these game worms Riverside County going out and dug just crazy areas by themself they monitor our traffic and they come in on the helicopter and light it up and call them I'll call these bad guys out on loudspeaker system make sure we were okay and feels good when the calvary comes on those nice man let me tell you they just didn't know that you would ever run into someone that's that arm that many guys and a van or what have you ate people but it says hold there was a reason why your Patron by yourself because they didn't anticipate anything like this well and we do know the bodies right this was one of the things that was crazy we get back to the thin Green Line concept and realize it one game warden is responsible for 200 to 250 square miles give or take you know so I squat a seven-game words to put in perspective check this out brother so when I was supervising traditional Patrol before we started the special ops met team in Santa Clara County we always have vacancies because we always alone bodies we couldn't hire game Words fast enough we weren't funded for it over the case maybe so we might have for 5 game wardens for 7 positions and we had to cover all the Santa Clara County which is everything from the city to all those Foothills and there's a lot in Silicon Valley people don't realize all of San Benito County which is huge Hollister Gilroy right where I'm from in Gilroy that whole area down to the South that is just mass amount country full of Wildlife and then like part of Monterey County and I had five people in myself as Lieutenant that is insane I can't believe that so to go out on a spot to that point and have a partner with you just one other game warden that stuff you know you're basically pulling a whole other area you can work 9 or so is spotlighting common it is still going on in the state and its going on a lot back then here because we've been so little presents here in Southern California it was off the hook it was crazy one week in 1994 I remember I was at a really good ride along with me a wildlife biologist social Savvy Hunter great eyes he became kind of like my right-hand man Brian and we I said we're going to catch spotliter every night this week just think so I was a crazy let's see if we can do it and so we went and worked all night long you start Monday night how do you catch a body look for a spotlight like what you give me an appointment glass it's ya just like the glass in a big Basin for help write in a really good OverWatch you get the most visibility in a pie the truck and you watch and you find areas where it's likely to happen and it takes awhile to learn where that's going to be just because you got this huge district and you could have 20 places where guy spotlight you get into the areas a new war normally get to figure it all out you don't know where to be in it it's a trial-and-error but it took me six months give or take adjust just going out and it's gotten hard and in seeing where this road goes and how does that canyon look what type of water do I have down there what am I seeing a low light in the evening when animals are coming to Waterloo I got to hold her to healthcare I got a whole herd of deer got some bucks you know I'm seeing other animals run around this is going to be a hot spot because guys can get to it and if you just put the time and you just kind of lion wait you don't come up with tied together just like hunting big game eventually starts happening and by 1994 and I've been in District a year down here I pretty much had my spots figured out my partners in other parts of Riverside did too so we'd all be out alone so we can cover more area and talking back and forth I mean and I'm a date myself here but cell phones brand new so I'll have those flip cell phones and we're it was the flip phone you have the Star Trek Communicator, partnered really love those where you at their crate Haystack type thing you know but once you get into it you get really good at it but it it always is difficult because again just the percentages of catching a guy on the right night that he's going to be out there and then you got the guys are kind of get Savvy to North game warden lives driving by his house looking for his patrol truck to see if he's out that night where's the truck parked we start getting into that problem so we always kind of you know kind of maintain as covert as we can you know we're known in the neighborhood in the thing is we live at home we work out of our homes home crossword clue store Community because if we kept our truck in a field office we have no response time all spread out so we get very community-oriented in in community functions and conservation groups and everybody knows us whether it's a big city or small little town in the mountains so you got guys doing the cat-and-mouse thing looking for us and you know making sure he has his truck there or is he out patrolling I'll maybe I won't go out tonight but that would show in in 1994 was was off the hook I didn't get a spot lighter every night that week but I got 6 out of 7 at 1 a double so it's crazy Mom Season the time guns and you know some guys were going to jail somewhere but a lot of wildlife would say that night because they wouldn't they would it would have done a lot of harm you know most of these guys are they doing this recreationally forefathers unit for food like what are they the group I was getting into down here it was it was recreational it might have been to sell the meat I couldn't prove that or it was just to go kill stuff you do get people that need me you know that do Spotlight after dark because they need the meat and stuff like that it's still a violation we still deal with it as such but if we ascertain that we're going to be fair about it you know we said okay look you're poaching I know you're starving it's out of season since season you have a tag but you just really got to get that meat I mean there are certain cases we just kind of feel for that person to go I see what the motivation was you know and a very small percentage of poachers are that way but some of them were just you know they're just trying to feed their family and it's a whole different game we're going to be fair about it or we should be fair but most of them gang Bangerz are most of them criminals like what there's it was there a felony she Ridge down here seventy 80%. Criminal histories had illegal weapons associated with gains those almost like Recreation for that little boy that was practice guys pretty inebriated pretty liquored up and I'm as a head-on stop and one of them had a like a $50,000 no bail warrant for cocaine trafficking phone case down here that was a pretty crazy one it was it was three guys pretty inebriated pretty liquored up and almost a head-on stop and one of them had a like a $50,000 no bail warrant for cocaine trafficking out of Mexico and that was in that week that we had you know crazy Spotlight things going on so it was just the demographic of down here we're up north it it won't it won't be necessary that fell into that guy that just wanted a trophy buck and to get it cheap to get</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what is the is there an estimate of how many cartel members are growing in this country right now if it with you save there's 27 28 States is that what you said what is the is there a rough estimate of how many cartel members are here right now doing this kind of this comes to it you know it's it's a real approximation because you only know based on who you catch your driving ability breathe but like in California when you're from the amount of grows we we deal with every year just on the trespass you know cartel front number of operatives it takes to run a grow and get it started and then harvested I mean conservative estimate 10,000 10,000 very conservative because it's such a kind of a silent Enterprise and it's really hard to get some of this data but we've we've just validated it through the numbers of things we run across you know when you look at the fact that it takes to skill Growers that are vetted because they cut their teeth done do do it effectively under the Federalist nose and they grow well in and you mention this weekend Mike Baker on the show which was interesting and you hit on the head when you said man these guys are really resourceful you know if you got to respect their work ethic and now you have to because they're there hiking water line of hiking infrastructure in their covering their tracks they're out there for 6 months at a time whole lot of photos in that book about things we've seen on trail cameras and they will put felt-lined line soft felt on their shoes time of tight and if they're walking like an Old Forest Road you know that's got a gravel base you'll never see that track I mean you know you've tracked a game I've done it you know it's the same type of technique and if you don't have any sign I mean the really good at disguising to actually found a guy and I have a picture of this in the book and also in the PowerPoint when I when I teach this throughout the country actually carved out of wood because a couple years ago we were in the u.s. forest service a lot of this grow problem is on or national forest you know Northern California Northeastern California not so much Silicon Valley where I started but the rest of this day even down here and what these guys to do with those cattle leases on those properties were in a Rancher can run cattle and part of the forest and you know originally on private property and we were getting tips on a bunch of crows you know where you seen from the air or Hunter Wrangler would report them or we do suspicion cuz of water weigh and we get see some plants from satellite or whatever and we go try to find the screen we weren't picking up tracks and we're we're pretty good at finding these things now we've been trialling are in it for a lot of lot of years but we're sitting like Halifax cuz we're running around with cows and sure enough they were putting on calipers and strap them on top or underneath their their boots clomping around to disguise themselves as cattle clever right and then once I get way up into a deep Canyon where they're going to put or they just take them off and throw my backpack in the light bulb went off with we better look at you know our tracks little more carefully so how do you guys try to go about finding these things do you do rely on people reporting them or do you have like aerial surveys how do you it's it's a mix of all event we get a lot of reports from people in the ground and are our best reporting parties or we call our peas are Hunters &amp; Anglers I'm going to come to the outdoor public but across some butt Hunters &amp; Anglers especially because where do we go when we when we're going to find a good water hole for Elk or you know what hunting black-tail we're going to go stay on the beaten path man we're going to go down to the headwaters we're going to find a pristine area we're going to get away from people so people that are going the deepest into the backcountry absolutely absolutely in their finding the water you know source and then maybe they're following it and it's dry or it's diverted like what I found in 2004 that started this whole craziness and running to aggro we also do find it from the area now we do all agencies it's no no secret and no tactical reveal we've we fly look for the stuff from the air I have a friend of found one on Tejon Ranch really yeah yeah a few years back and I didn't think anything of it I thought it was just some crazy person decided try to grow pot his back for is recreationally legal okay and it was no shootout or anything crazy like that they got there after realize that their grow up it been compromised and they took off but you know Tejon Ranch has enormous thick 270,000 Acres yeah and just the gall of these guys to go deep into that ranch and set up this grow site right on the guys who work there they I guess they just stumbled upon it I think they stumbled upon it because of garbage to if I remember correctly yeah that that that follows track in the thing now you're talkin about private hunting ranches got a catalyst and all that tones huge we've done a lot of good stuff supported you know good hunting programs are but an interesting statistic when I retired last year in December 2018 you know I mean we keep stats ever since one of the cool things about the are specialized team start in 2013 as we solidified all the documentation to be spot-on you know reporting was kind of haphazard throughout this day we weren't sure what other agencies were doing but we knew what we were doing now and so I'm keeping that data and there was a real shift in just public land presence of these cartel Growers and by the time I retired last year I won't have 50/50 split so ranches like Tejon Ranch a private hunting club in the Silicon Valley one up in Shasta County so you know where they're doing big-time conservation projects to get black tail and mule deer in Tule elk and everything else up and numbers and now they've got this presents on their hunting club hitting one of their sensitive waterways you know so so it's it's not just a public land thing is really good for everybody listening to know that you can find it anywhere in and you stumbled on it and it is 20 mm reporting parties a cool thing after I did Stephen show on a mediator and talk to those guys was hard to get tips actually got a tip and you know when it's it's in play and I won't say too much more about it but will definitely be talking when it's all over and done but it's it's going to get handled and it's so cool to see the guys like you and I didn't love it and love the passion of what's out there are out there stumbled on this stuff and getting out safely and and were fired up enough not to wait you don't work for calling people to say it's out there can you help us Ritz award a mediator and talk to those guys we start to get tips actually got a tip and you know when it's it's in play and I won't say too much more about it but will definitely will be talking when it's all over and done but it's it's going to get handled and it's so cool to see the guys like you and I didn't love it and love the passion of what's out there are out there stumbled on this stuff and getting out safely and and were fired up enough not to wait you don't work for calling people to say it's out there can you help us with the warden Sheriff's</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> don't these dogs that your training know Phoebe was like there was very interesting listening to how effective is using Belgian Malinois that were using your permit earlier main dogs Belgian Mel and Powerful dogs they are amazing so smart and I can't talk enough about it man cuz no matter where you sit everybody loves a good dog story and you know some people say well Dual Purpose you got a bike guys what's what with that is really aggressive and look at it's a lifesaver for everybody it's a lifesaver for us Lifesaver for the suspect to because it usually involves a potential gunfight at the dog basically you know alleviated because she or he was there so we got our K-9 program in agency going kind of full speed around 2018 I'm at 3 we have three levels of canine we have like the companion right along canine the kind of does everything with you she's never going to bite anybody unless Apollo that's like my lap right then we have the detection level dog eye muscles are Labradors like Marshall like Apollo because Labs have such amazing noses they really can hold on sent you know that they can trained it to Tech many cents and we certify him and different things and then there's the feebies you know the bells romells or the Shepherds and really it's become mostly males now in our age why Mount horse shelters in the heat you know Shepherds have longer hair and 100° weather we're on Long hikes you know or unsupported those dogs might have to sit quietly after hiking 8 Miles and sit in a prone quietly while we're watching observing and stocking it on suspects to make an apprehension in a rest safely and hopefully avoid a gunfight so and we also found with the with the males it's like I said they just hold up better on average and they're certainly exceptions to that but when we got our Dual Purpose program back on track these are dogs that will buy 22 on command but they have great noses so let's still detect wonderfully you know Finding evidence fine in tainted weed whatever the case may be a firearm a bear gallbladder all of that but they'll also you know like Phoebe was nicknamed the fur missile because when it was time for her to go to work and some guy was going to pull a weapon on us she was all business and cool thing about a dog like her in the end and Michael and I got into I'll hit you especially in he was going away he said I've never heard of a dog in a domestic law enforcement team that's had like a hundred sixteen apprehension bites in her career and she has 216 know JoJo Diaz on the cool thing about that was a stampede of life she saved and she also arrest another 8 to 900 that she didn't have to buy in her career why how many of you guys arrested when I retired with over thousand and in five and a half years yeah and we ran against all grow-ops grow-ops are related to grow up so that they are all guys that are armed all gussied up knives or guns you know that you're not getting bit unless you know you're a deadly force threat on some level or significant threat so yeah it's been a lot of guys so that number that you talking about 10,000 I think it's very much so yeah that is so insane because if you fly over like Humboldt or any any of these areas I can particularly medicino Northern California the density of the forest of the the the public land out there there's a lot of land there's a lot of land in a lot of potential we're not seeing so and that's still still thriving so when you you know when you when you look at Phoebe has a canine and you go well let's see if she was in the field doing these type of operations for about seven or eight and yeah that's great for my records standpoint and numbers in the life you save but it gives you a like a like a snapshot of the issue how many guys did we not catch that were out there or that we weren't involved in and the dogs are just say lives man they have saved this in the new book especially in 2012 but right before our team started Phoebe save my life Brian's life and all these other operators in Santa Clara County in Silicon Valley right where I grew up engage the guy that was pulling up a Russian automatic pistol on me and I was the support for the for Brian I was basically a k9 Handler or support guy and Brian had to deal with this other Growers partner that had a big Taurus Judge revolver on his hip and he was pulling it so he goes for that guy and says John just take my dog to be something by it and he's biting this guy in the calf and yeah this guy's nose down and we don't know he's got this weapon and I start to see it coming out and I get on him and I do what I need to do some physical control and Strikes and whatnot to get the gun Christian but had she not been on that guy in a bike show. Guns turned on me at 5 feet I'm engaged All The Rifleman behind me on you know I'm in a gunfight again we've been in too many of those already how many gun fights in 6 and I've been on the ground for four out of the six there guys have been involved in and they've all been around this particular problem we had a lot last once the team about formalize and so we started using dogs but we still had two during the window of the team being operational that we could avoid and dog four out of the six other guys have been involved in and they've all been around this particular problem we had a lot less once the team got formalize and so we started using dogs but we still had two during the window of the team being operational that we could avoid and dogs played a big part in that as I go into a new stories</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Trump like even Trump like as much as he hates it he has tone down a lot of his rhetoric because of the criticisms he's faced you know and that's it's important it's very important to him and he has the that's one thing as viruses making everybody have to do their job everyone have to actually do their job wondering if you would do it again all over again if you knew how hard it would be and how much you would get s*** on I don't know I think it was so funny when he presented to me was like it was like like the hot new nightclub you know what I mean like everybody was in there you know what is like like a nightclub and you can pretend to be who you want to be and you can just in the coronavirus comes and that's like when the lights come on in the club and you get to see you know I have fuckedupshit really is and and so was when the cold country just kind of like I said I was going to go with your biting regardless of how loose if you feel he is or how sharp you thinking is when the whole country is like his Uncle Joe just let me think like Trump is like a fancy a nice resort like hotels is the number one thing I want to do that but after awhile you get tired of spending $21 for internet and $40 for pancakes and you just want to go home and enjoy his kind of sent it felt like he represent home you don't mean like people I kill all the kids dementia but I think he's going to be propped up by so many different people going to motor like President Obama's going to come out in the door soon and if he doesn't listen that's crazy what I'm saying because he's familiar he was dead next to the guy that we all felt more comfortable with especially in situations like this endorsement video straight up gaslighting matter whether or not I think he's going to lose I do think is going to lose record even if I thought he's going to win he shouldn't do the job he there's no way you can take the pressure of that position with the cognitive decline that he's already showing but there's no but you just want the Democratic party to be back in control I get it how much time does Michael open the damn trying to give you an example to me just the way that Trump is handling having any kind of criticism is anything it's unsettling it's like so you have to have degrees or whatever but to be in charge of everybody else that guy who's in charge of everybody else is just it's like man I just wish he didn't cost so much just wasn't the way he he was you know what I mean I wish you could just take the kids seriously once again into office and Uncle did expect him to yeah he's always been the guy that if anybody says anything about him he talked mad s*** about that person wonders never lied to you or respect all of that but it's just like in times like this one is required some empathy and say I feel for the people that are dying not give me credit I come over it so I feel like so what I'm saying is I feel like having Joe come up there and play those notes it feels like he will everyone just all of a sudden overnight goes Joe Biden's our guy it felt like everyone together but what is going to be like after a year in office dealing with International Politics the economy the environment for all these different things people how quickly who's going to be the vice president Elizabeth Warren who's going to put in there the country or would it be a good thing for the country because it's the best person for the job both both best person for the best person for the job I feel could be a woman of color in the Best Western Plus country could also be a woman of God because a lot of policies kind of stop before Consulting the people of color in a woman of color can see what we're leaving out this group male of color who's better qualified for the job I don't but that's not my point what is what are the qualifications for this job is is what I just said there's no test you have to take is just a popularity contest remember she just she just did a whole thing about something on Netflix and she was like we aren't even on Ellen's that we just like it was like yeah you probably should I think I'm not the right person to be talking about this but I feel like you know what they say Stacey Abrams is in the running and I don't think he'd be a bad choice but why she just puts things in context and she is very smart very sharp and she is not thrown like she would be extremely qualified she could be president she was the first lady so she's accustomed to the public eye she's accustomed to speaking publicly and that's why they say Joe Biden was the best bet because Joe Biden so Pennsylvania it was a is a swing state and Joe Biden is the only person out of the democratic nominees who did not say he was against fracking he was like you can't you can't be again you can't you can't do it all at once and then they have to have the clip of the fracking protesters at CoCo for somebody else man and he also supports he has an in with you know the coal miners and the fracking industry just like you know Trump so when it comes to Electoral College votes Trump doesn't knows he can't beat them Sy hence the whole Ukrainian get some dirt on them just announced something's happening. I think that was kind of like The Narrative of that and know when it comes to electoral votes that whole Midwest game that whole Michigan Michigan to buy in his right there and that's what I'm saying like them yes man oh no I don't know but what's going to happen once people start hearing him talk on the campaign Trail but I don't know I don't know how I don't know how brilliant or a ticket at Trump is like I don't know I think I think everyone it's a matter of being able to control crowds and have these exciting rallies he does Arenas dude he does sold out Arenas and he kills you want a woman of color to be the vice president wife and I would love that I would love for I'm not saying I would love for things to feel like that I want to say back to normal but I would just love to feel like when the president speaking with it what I'm talking about is his ability to excited base in the ability to get people behind him he's a unprecedented ability and depending upon how he handles this coronavirus crisis they could swing left or right it really depends entirely upon who Biden pics because remember when George W was president is really was like President Dick Cheney doing everyday and Cheney was consistently in the bunker he was in the bunker for like weeks of time they were saying he's an update demon told us he was in a bunker but just in case anything happens like why isn't Bush and government will you have a guy who was the former CEO of Halliburton company that countries after we blow them up getting no-bid contract to rebuild a country that we blew up while he's making the decisions to blow up his country powerful speakers someone who apparently and if they pick someone and I'm sure the groom and someone right now who you get excited about yuto okay this person this person could step if Biden lost or find lost it right or find died which is also possible bro there's a there's a photo of him that was on the New York Times yesterday we can see you like where they gave him the f****** the face is that like you know and just just just how the government works well what the what was it the pandemic agency was closed down in my pantry what's the his lawyers fight what can I do what can I do Shore what can I do what can I do and he just goes you know then he takes his stance based on what he is known he's no he's going to be protected legally and he doesn't equate that he's present of all of us you know I mean it so I just feel like that's what's missing and he is incapable of doing it I know when Prince had the Mike Pence was getting popular at 8 at Trump music you want to talk about advice but I don't know what that guy's voice sounds like somebody so emotional right like nnnn I feel like Trump's a businessman so he he's not approaching this if any emotion and it's a good thing that he did was blocked travel from China that's a good thing that probably saved a lot a lot of people saying you're crazy for doing that but so what do you mean you actually didn't I don't know I just heard that's why I'm saying that I was saying conflicting with Mikey block travel because of diplomatic reasons to go out and go to Chinatown with no worries bullshittin the way out of this while she was blaming the present it look everybody got this wrong everybody got it wrong everybody did fournette 30,000 people of travel from China to u.s. Sister coronavirus surfaced the coronavirus surfaced in this is just a this I think this is just an article about yeah I know but this is an article about when the coronavirus surface which was in January that's just letting people know how I made it over to America that's not how many people came to America this is since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak on New Year's Eve in two months after the president impose restrictions arrived in January at airports in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Chicago Newark and Detroit all places fuk by Coronavirus what kind of restrictions were they the bulk of The Travelers who were of multiple nationalities arrived in January at airports in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Chicago Newark and Detroit all places fuk by Coronavirus</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you seen all the s*** that point to the fact that this came from a lab viruses there are a ton there's a ton of of scientists that are pointing to that just one French virologist Gmail send you this there's a French virologist who identified HIV and this French virologist was looking at this disease and it's like this is not a disease that came from nature know that this is a disease that came from the lab on Netflix the series on Netflix that takes place in China that like two or three years ago they called the coronavirus in Eli played the thing really yeah there's like episode 13 season 3 or something like that of the show Jesus Christ than they knew this stuff was happening while people knew that it was always a possibility TV industry like it feels like everything is becoming YouTube you know. I mean like all the time or I'll just I'll send you this right now Jamie hold on a second Bill Maher has some great f****** rants I mean these are tweeted twice to him that where I said Bravo yet are you playing it you know he's he's pushing all the buttons you know he's he's doing, he's doing like real edgy comedy while he's pointing out how crazy this all is I appreciate him right now is so sad guy who's on the left that I really I really like the fact that he doesn't give in to all the craziness he doesn't get given to the the lunacy of of left-wing policies he still he still like rational about it all although clearly left-wing bias he still rational goes with comedy but it was well yeah I want some I don't know man I like him a lot and I watch you like a bunch, I want to know cuz I watched some of his stuff and I feel like it's two things you should have me on this show basically cuz he's always talking about kids or he would be talking about he did his whole rant about why can't we call it the China disease and stuff and I was listening to a chinese-american on on The Daily talking about her experience of a feeling like being an Asian-American he was always like a probationary experience as long as I did the right thing and stay out the way people left me alone but when this came up just for going out why people like you f****** Chinese detective you know and and it's kind of like so it is it's me I love watching them because it's because it's also these blind spots that he just his whole rant was really about stop these wet markets you can do it you didn't have to do these but here the other like you know SARS or murderers are two middle eastern respiratory did make that point he was the head of China you know he would say that and then the Chinese guy was saying hey this is the whole world's problems whole world pandemic but yeah kind of but it did come from a f****** if it did if it did come from a lab you know we should call the lab-created Wuhan virus how do we know that this guy's correct it says analysis indicates the virus has a natural origin it was not engineered the so-called unique protein sequences her since found the 2019 coronavirus can be found in many of the organizing not just HIV but that doesn't mean it's organic or natural in origin I think that we are right now in this. Of conflicting information and you going to get it bouncing back and forth from con but I've read multiple sources that seem and end from respected scientist to seem to indicate that there's a distinct possibility that came from that lab one of things they're saying is the actual bats that they sequence The genome when it when it when they found the genetics for this virus the bats that tested you know that we're this originated from where the same exact they're from the same exact locations the bats are they do research on in this lab and Elizabeth form I mean it's not it's not outside the realm of possibility we're in the Wheelhouse what they're obviously I'm a moron I don't know s*** about viruses but when China says all definitely wet Market nothing to see here yeah well the web markets are f****** gross you know it is but that's also a sad thing about you trying to feed a billion people and you feeding them Wildlife a lot of what they're eating as Wildlife they're so cool it's like squirrels in</div>

He's got to go to that got to go to that but that's very important for everybody when people get sick it spreads to all of us now we also we don't want ever to know anyone that you love is going to die because they can't get Healthcare that's available for people that have money that stop that just stop with fire department Fire Department EMS fires on fire how to help Healthcare we should be we what is the what is the what is Covered California what the f*** is that all about that I don't know man I don't mean if you think about how much money gets spent on things right with her it's computers whether it's cars whether it's houses whether it's with his it seems that people by how much of a percentage of that if you could escalate just a little bit and all that money goes into just Healthcare not just taxes worth no one's accountable you don't know where the f*** is going to go everybody's dollar cost $2.05 for most things you buy up to a certain point all that money go straight to healthcare wouldn't you be willing to pay instead of a dollar a dollar five or something if you knew that $0.05 going to go towards Healthcare Ben billions and millions I mean after while it seems like it would be better for everybody and it would be better for us to not worry about what happens if you get sick cuz you don't know if you can deal with pay for it sometimes people get hit with crazy medical bills after the unexpected injury worried about what happens if you get sick cuz you don't know if you can be able to pay for it sometimes people get hit with crazy medical bills after you do an unexpected injury</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> stories crazy it's crazy and I think it's also a really important part of human history imagine if the Whistleblower had not come forward and we didn't know about MK Ultra and and then all those documents didn't get but they didn't find a warehouse for the documents fall back on you know we signing I was with the agency if we talk to you without permission and they're not going to give us permission we could go to prison imagine what life must have been like for them knowing that this is what they were doing people that such a strange way to also these people are agents for the federal government and what kind of precedent does this establishment most of the people doing the research were subcontracted researchers at medical personnel at prisons and in the case of Jolly West he was first in the Air Force and then he was in university settings and jolly was once it got to University of Oklahoma he was experimenting on patients and in one of his letters to God leave asking for more funding he's saying working with psychiatric patients actually benefits us because people can't not quoting directly weird behavior wouldn't be noticed by anybody at the hospitals because they're psychiatric patient so these people are getting LSD which is a pretty powerful drug and Other Drugs he was using and he was hypnotizing them and some of it many of his experiments without without their knowledge and their psychiatric patients I mean that it's worse than Nazis your mind is you know the next most important thing besides your soul and they're tampering with it you know one of the jollies take the guy who actually took over the department when jolly and 69 came out to UCLA from Oklahoma said to me cuz I would show them all the documents and he said he always has one of his best friends I think 45 years when West died in 99 he said what he said to me Jolly it doesn't surprise me that he would have done this this is the Jack Ruby stuff which I guess gotten to yet Jolly was Jack Ruby psychiatrist Jesus after Ruby was convicted of shooting and killing Oswald in the spring of 64 before he was going to testify to the Warren Commission he had never told him never testified at his trial about why he he killed Oswald his defense argument was that he had epilepsy and he had had an epileptic fit and shot him and was amnesiac of the of the the shooting yeah so that's right into the narrative like a key well it's gets better so West inserts and shine through his connections to Ruby's new lawyer you were Winston Smith his old other kettle of fish but anyway goes to the Dallas County Jail in thing was April 64 to examine Ruby in preparation for not the Warren Commission testimony when she was giving in a couple months before his next trial cuz he had you got a new or an appeal for a psychiatric review and West who had told Sidney Gottlieb and in these early letters from the 50s that part of his experiments were inducing insanity and a person without their awareness West goes to examine Ruby emerges from the county jail and there's press weight for him and he announces that within the preceding 48 Hours Ruby had had a psychotic break that was a irrevocable couldn't he couldn't return to sanity he had audio and visual hallucinations during the exam he said Ruby hit under a table cuz he thought they were people in the room trying to kill him told Weston he could hear children's screams outside his jail cell as juice children as they were boiled alive and West said he's completely insane that was the day I mean there was no evidence of Ruby being mentally ill prior to West exam West was alone with him in the cell and then treated him for about six months when Ruby finally gave his testimony the Warren Commission so Earl Warren chief justice Warren who was head of the commission down the Dallas with Joe Ford who is Congressman and on the commission and Arlen Specter the young while inspector who was an investigator for the Warren Commission to eventually came up with the magic bullet theory he called it the Magic Bullet anyway on the three of them Ruby Underoath and Ruby battle was incoherent grabbed on inspector who was like him. cities that don't you know that killing Jews and and that they've killed my brother and cut off his legs I hear them being tortured outside my other good news anyting West that was one of his objectives and his uncal to research was to make people into sinsanity without a person's awareness was there any contact with Jack Ruby before he killed I won't again that was one of the things I can't tell you how hard give me Western movie anyone anyone could have done something to get out to kill to organized crime and federal he was part of which later emerged the anti-castro Cubans effort to overthrow Fidel Castro which was Ron it was Operation Mongoose by the CIA with an illegal assassination program Ruby tonight in the book I found out that we can through West papers that I got access to Ruby admitted never that he stalked and killed Oswald on the orders of anyone but that he was working with these people who were suspected of being involved in the assassination if there was a conspiracy and he had never admitted that to anyone it's only an in West file and West with how that the the the primary theory of who was responsible if there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy and one of the thoughts was that it had to do with some sort of us CIA operation to overthrow Castro yeah well there was that by John F Kennedy was second-in-command to judge Warren on the commission Richard Helms who was actually Jolly West employer for MKUltra was the liaison between the CIA and the commission so Helms new that Ruby who they call their most important witness in their investigation the Warren Commission investigation because he was the one who silenced the killer there could be no trial for Oswald cuz he was dead so they try to learn everything they could about Ruby to see if he had had any meetings with Oswald prior if he had connections Beyond The Superficial ones to organized crime was there something deeper the commission which I believe was you know a joke from the beginning it was set to determine mean they said in the beginning their objective was to prove that Oswald acted alone they came up with that conclusion but after the first Intelligence Center in what is hearings in the in the early 70s that exposed MKUltra chaos cointelpro primarily that the Frank Church hearings are they found out that fellows and Helms and others had lied about the cia's involvement with Oswald and and with their own agents who have had these peripheral will not their peripheral not but definitely encounters with Oswald they withheld all that so the house voted to have they call the house select committee on assassinations that began in 77 and 78 they released a report which they concluded that was all a probable conspiracy to kill Kennedy that Oswald didn't act alone and you know it's there's lots of books about that and in their findings and then later the to the head of the committee Robert Blakely wrote a book where he said that that Ruby had acted on behalf of The Conspiracy to silence Oswald that he had stalked him premeditated the murder and that the whole thing was part of keeping the secret so was West apart of that and you know again I can't prove it I wanted to find out if what I said had any encounter or any interaction with Ruby prior to Ruby committing the murder couldn't find that and that's the kind of thing that maybe no evidence maybe it happened but there's no evidence but I wasn't going to put it in the book and I exhausted every resource I had you know cuz that that one is always been so puzzling for me cuz here's this guy that's not connected to the murder allegedly and then steps forward and shoots Oswald in front of everybody in himself mean like there's no doubt about it and you're the guy who did it go to jail forever report which was fabricated by his first lawyer who admitted this years and years later he told Ruby to say he did it to spare Jackie Kennedy from having to come to Dallas for a trial of Oswald that was made up and then Melvin Bell I was assigned to the case was I mean really fired like three lawyers in the first couple weeks and I took over and took it to trial and his argument was that he had had an epileptic fit and didn't know what he was doing when he was grabbed by the cops after he shot Oswald he said hey I'm Jack Ruby what what am I doing here what are you doing to me don't you know who I am cuz he knew all the cops my argument of my book is this important my most important finding is that a CIA contracted agent or researcher for mind control became the most important witness to the Warren Commission he came this is doctor right before he testified and told his story I go that should have been disclosed obviously to the commission but they're not going to say it cuz it's a secret program and then he goes crazy crazy by a couple of people who were nobody on the commission would talk to me that was alive when I started pursuing them Joel Ford wouldn't talk to me or I think I mentioned that to you before there's an interesting I approached inspector who was running for re-election this was 2002 and told him I had new information and he had all he had always maintained you know he would he made a lot of money off of his books about Justice and hit in the magic video defending is magic bullet bullet theory he always said if anybody comes to me with new evidence I'll look at it with no open mind so I had sent him a persuasive letter while his people they finally said all right if you have these documents showing this is Doctor Who treated Ruby you know within the 24 hours he lost his mind Specter will look at them and then decide if I'll talk to you fax them to us and at that point that was 2002 I lost a magazine story and I didn't have a book deal so I was operating entirely on my own I said I can't send this stuff to you because it's my Smoking Gun the letters between got leading and why scribing off the experiments so finally Spectre agreed to talk to me on the phone for a few minutes and it was amazing he called me from the senate floor while they were waiting to vote on whether or not they were going to invade Iraq this is 2002 so we were only supposed to talk for a few minutes and when I explained what I had and what it showed West had you know been involved with at the time he treated Ruby he said well if you're not going to send the stuff to me I don't know you know I need to see it and I go well I can't send it to you and he said where you want to meet me cuz I told him I was in Philadelphia visiting my folks and he he was from Philadelphia to he says I'm there in the weekend I'll meet you Saturday I have a squash game at the Wyndham Hotel meet me there squash so we had a meeting set up for like 3 days later and this is something I'm always second-guessing about I made a decision I don't think I got to I don't think I've ever really got paranoid doing this but it's factory been a long-term Senator he was running for re-election and it was the first time in his career but the polls were against him that his opponent was they were predicting that he was going to Spectre was going to lose he had also you know defended this magic bullet theory forever I mean more people knowing for the Kennedy assassination than anything else I thought so if I do meet with him and I show him these documents Maybe diosa me too I thought he's going to go my God I need to be part of their you know exposure cuz if he didn't and walked away from it I thought they were important enough that he would know that that would you know once they were publicized and he had the opportunity to say hey we need to look into this and didn't he was like bass and I thought well maybe he's going to two things he's either going to use it for to get publicity have a press conference and help him in his re-election or he's going to use it to be the hero of it and run with it before I publish the book and then I'll just be a footnote you know to all those cuz he took it so I cancelled the meeting the morning of I called up his press secretary and his cell phone like the three phones I have for my said you have to tell Senator Specter I am so sorry but there's an emergency I've got to go back to Los Angeles actually was scheduled to go the day after on Sunday so it's a lie and I didn't talk to anyone I just left a message and I said I'm so sorry but I obviously I've worked so hard to get this meaning it's embarrassing but I have to go back so I left my parents place to go to the post office cuz I've been there for three months I was actually writing the first version to proposal at their place to get away from my friends and you know all the distractions in LA and I was only going for like 15 minutes ago mom if that press secretary calls I told him I was leaving till tell him that I'm I just went to the airport and I and I apologize so I can't lie to a press secretary I got to go to the Post Office and I come home 15 minutes later she's like this why does it goes I go watch Senator Specter called himself he wanted to know what happened why you changed your mind so I don't know if that was a mistake on my part I think you know 20/20 hindsight I should have done it and taking my chances I did all those what that would have done come up with that whack iron without ya ya ya and the fact that never gets brought up if there were more bullet fragments in Connelly's body then there were missing from that bullet in the fact that anyone who knows anything about guns and if anyone has ever shot a gun as seen with a bullet went on what it looks like wood look at that f****** bullet and think that bullet went through to human beings Siri in the first place is because the guy was hit by a Ricochet on the underpass don't know the whole story behind that I did I tried not to lose myself anymore than I had two in each compartmentalize area I was going to so with the Kennedy assassination I just did a superficial like Manson I was never interested in any thing so called conspiracies yeah I never cared about Kennedy or that's was connected to Ruby and again that was a moment that I was like oh no I mean first it was West in the CIA and then I'm like and Ruby how can I not look at the Kennedy assassination so I kept my focus narrowly just on Ruby Oswald West Spectre I look a little bit of the Magic Bullet and agree with you but I never did a deep dive into a lot of that stuff first it was West in the CIA and then I'm like 10 Ruby how can I not look at the Kennedy assassination so I kept my focus narrowly just on Ruby Oswald West Spectre I look a little bit of the Magic Bullet and agree with you but I never did a deep dive into a lot of that stuff</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I would do without Iowa seduce people into the story and get them as I would love to. I was like pretend I'm a guy and you trying to pitch me this book in the beginning of the first years just that the trial that had occurred that have been prosecuted by Vincent bugliosi had a lot of malfeasance in it by the prosecution I was able to document that they planted former prosecutor on the defense team to sabotage the defense I doubt that two or three of the principal Witnesses including Terry Melcher who played a big part in this and will probably talk about that at some point lied on the stand you know supporting themselves and in a murder trial and if you commit perjury in a murder trial you could be convicted of murder I mean you could be sentenced to a motor if you get up at murder sentence to because of that so there was about a thousand of those and none of them happened all at once. surgery during a murder trial you could be sentenced for murder for the same amount of time that someone would get sentence if they murdered somebody are subject to an actual Capital you could be elected you could be sent to the chair wow and the five people who were convicted of murder in the first trial once had I been around and able to prove this in the early 70s Vincent bugliosi and the three people who lied on the stand in a material way you know I'm a very important way they all could have been tried for that perjury and sentenced to the same or given the same sentence of the people who have gotten the Destin I told you that I just got to the 11 chapter of your book right and essentially what I'm getting so far I haven't finished the book what I'm getting so far is there was some sort of a CIA program where they were explain how they did it they they infiltrated these hippie communities and they allow Charles Manson over and over and over again to get out of jail they knew that he was committing all these crimes and instead of an operating careful required for the first year after Manson was released from prison and 19s Rodgers Matthew and he was a criminologist in the Bay Area Manson violated his parole the day that he was released in Los Angeles and this is one of the you think it's a little lie but it's an important lie that been fully OC presented not just a trial but also in his book a trial it's much more serious he change the narrative he said Manson have been given permission to try San Francisco from La when Manson was paroled meth and hadn't been giving that promotion he just showed up there they originally were going to violate them set them right back to prison and someone stepped in and took care of that and let Madison stay in San Francisco and he was assigned to Rodger Smith it took about a year-and-a-half but through a Freedom of Information Act process I got his Federal parole file and those with a kind of seeds of how I found out that Manson has its immunity prosecution for the two years he was out of prison from 67 until the murders occurred in the Summer of 69 who was Smith doing this for who was giving him the instructions to continue to let Manson out and they needed a modern well that's a problem I didn't get the whole file and the file I got had weird actions he would report to the head office and they would give him instructions and then he would violate those instructions and there be no repercussions for him Warframe Manson for instance Manson was arrested in July of 1967 three or four months after you got out of prison when he was under by Christmas supervision for interfering with an officer who was trying to arrest one of his first young followers Ruth Ann moorehouse who was 15 and he was put in jail plead out so he got a 3-day sentence a new probation sentence as well all that was hidden like this not believe she's booked the parole officer Rodger Smith a week later wrote to the head office at Mattson was doing fine and he actually recommended that Manson be allowed to go to Mexico and work in Mexico and the head parole office in the United States census Federal wrote back and they said that's insane he was supposed the job that he was going to do in Mexico was surveying soil for insect insect the size and they had nothing to do with it documents showing the who is hiring Charles Manson to survey soil it was a company and Nevada which disappeared a couple years later it was a b******* company's I believe so yeah 1959 the last time he free man he had violated his parole then he was arrested in Mexico right he was arrested in Mexico and brought over by the federales and and given over to Federal custody for I was a drug violation and then some other stuff so why would his parole officer send them back to this place three months after he been released and how do you supervise somebody who's in another country can I make a summary just for people who like what the f*** is going on right now what you're saying is that Charles Manson was a part of some sort of a program yes and that through this program they were using him and using but with LSD and all the members of the family they were turning them violent and why why do you think they were doing this together so I got to reel it in a little about not saying anything that I have been able to prove what I proven is if he was getting leniency from the federal government and the law enforcement first in San Francisco that year the person who represented the federal government there was his parole officer Rodger Smith Federal parole officer was getting him leniency Rodger was also doing drug research at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic which opened in June of 67 Manson during that period turned the Manson that were familiar with today you know the monster the embodiment of evil as been fully OC call them the guru who could control the minds of these followers so he would come into the clinic to see Rogers when he went for two reasons but it was a free clinic it was at the height of the summer of love summer of 67 and he will come in with a women two girls here about five or six followers then and they would walk behind them they wouldn't speak unless he spoke to them the man he issued towards then they would follow and they became very well known around the clinic and they were there principally for Manson to see Rodger for his weekly parole appointments and then the girls were going in for STDs and there was some pregnancies and stuff never getting free treatment that was the summer that the Manson family formed and then they left in late 67 early 68 and migrated down to Los Angeles and became is Killer caught it's crazy how quickly this all happened it's insane in Haight-Ashbury 69 the tate-labianca murders and then the trial and then everything else was basically just sort of a two-bit criminal who would spend most of his life inside the system and had been incarcerated for what half of his life his life when he was released about 8:32 and 67 off Federal institutions to which was interesting even pelillos he pointed that out in his book first of all his mother was a prostitute kind of she would get sent to jail for petty theft or prostitution and she had them off to her parents or other people and by the time he was 10 11 12 years old he was stealing cars committing petty theft and stuff so that he was sent to adult detention centers in schools reform schools are run by the federal government and then when he committed his first crimes as an adult which was again car theft the first crimes require that but when he stole the cars across state lines so then it became a federal offense and he got in prison but with much more serious sentences if it's a federal offense in if it's state and he do these long sentences back-to-back-to-back and then every time he was released he either violated parole and probation and they were actually strict with him in the 50s and early well still 60 when he finally went to prison for 7 years it wasn't until 67 when he came out that all the sudden with hands off and what do you think happened in prison did they find him in prison again I'll go there with you okay which we know was a good possibility as I lay out circumstantial evidence for a case with proof of each circumstance but when you put them all together that's the hardest part is linking them finding the bridges what I do is show what the objectives were either the federal government's case to MKUltra than other programs cointelpro and it and chaos and the enforcement in Los Angeles and San Francisco at the time so MK Ultra began in the in the federal prisons experiments on prisoners famously or notoriously Whitey Bulger I don't know if you heard about this but a few years ago it was revealed that Whitey Bulger had been apart of MK Ultra experimentation the fifties when he was incarcerated and after he was convicted he was claiming that he believed that all of his violence was a product of what it happened to him in prison when he was experimented upon with LSD through these scientists so theoretically Manson was in the pine place where the experiments were occurring in prison before he was released in 67 in federal institutions they couldn't do it in the state of Mo is federal parole file which was an accident never been released from 67 to 69 but I also have the one prior to that from the 50s and the 60s and all the correspondence and he would talk about these doctor's coming in to examine him and he didn't trust them and didn't know what they were doing and this was late 50s and unfortunately he never had the first names for the doctors over to one of them was dr. Hartman I can remember the other one's name that was in Hartman in Los Angeles who was one of the early psychiatrist using LSD and in the 50s Cary Grant was one of his patient so theoretically he could have come out of the program or the experimentation that began there but you know I hate to even I rather all this without showing all the documentation and stuff what was going on where he was and how everything matches up but you see that when you get through chapter 11 okay so far so 1967 he gets out of jail and he how long before he hooks up with this clinic so he got out in March of 67 the clinic open in June of 67 so just a few months it Will Rogers Smith he was a living in Berkeley Manson was and he got his first follower Mary Brunner and then two or three or four more and then Rodger was the one who suggested that he go to the hate to absorb The Vibes he thought Manson my benefit from the love and peace five that were happening in the Summer of Love Smith was his parole officer in 67 that gal Sedalia told me she was his assistant at the clinic at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic when he was running his amphetamines study in in 68 she said that Rodger had told her he met Manson when he was doing probation work and Illinois and the early sixties eventually interview Rodger several times and Rodger denied that and when I went back to jail she doxycyc I can't believe he's denying that that was a connection here. That's why I meant was able to leave Los Angeles he was sent to Rodger Smith so Rodger could be his parole officer I was never able to document that Benson had been in Illinois except for 3 days for in 61 or excuse me in 60 when he was brought from Mexico to Texas and then they brought him to Los Angeles to be violated in front of the judge there he did spend free days at Joliet prison where Rodger Smith work but he was there a year or two later know that was one of the one of the many frustrating moments where everything makes sense except for one but one very important whole which was will they weren't there at the same time at least as far as the official record shows so if Smith was a part of these experiments in Smith was also his parole officer and did know him before he did this 10 years before he got out which is when it's speculated that Manson was possibly experimented on and Smith might have been aware of the entire process of it and was supervising him upon his release they would just let him go and give you a little background on Smith is he told me he called himself he goes I was at Rock rib republican from the Midwest and I came out he went to Berkeley to the school of criminology to become a criminologist I think I'm 65 or 66 he was getting his master's and his PhD and his special area of study was in the beginning gangs Collective behavior and violence and then how drugs would make some of these gangs that he had people he was working with infiltrate students infiltrate mention that this isn't an Oakland in the ghettos and in like 6566 on the Panthers were forming then and 6866 he decided to become a federal parole officer while he was still writing his dissertation and he got assigned to something called the San Francisco project which was an experimental program run by the federal government to see how different numbers of parole clients caseloads for parole officer where you know supervision it was about recidivism so if you had the lowest low was 20 clients the largest was like 50 or 60 were you able to supervisor you wouldn't think that 50 or 60 is going to be a lot more difficult but it always wasn't so Smith join that program where he's supposed to be paying much more attention and care to his clients because are the special program called the San Francisco project and in fact you was I mean he was he was seeing Manson more than he was even officially supposed to thinks he's stopping his parole officer was actually removed and he said it was voluntarily so he could focus more on his drugs and violence research at the clinic Manson three or four women followers got arrested in Mendocino they had lured a cup young boys into a house giving them LSD they're advancing it sent them out up to Mendocino to recruit people for the family the three women were four women were arrested one of the Mary Brunner had the first baby with Manson in the group and Rodger Smith and his wife Carol went up to Mendocino and petition the court to take Foster custody of the child until Mary was until her case was resolved so they were the foster parents of Manson's son I mean nothing was irregular about this that actually that case is pretty interesting so Mary Brunner and Susan Atkins two women who actually killed for Manson in 1969 were given they were convicted of contributing to the delinquency of minors illegal drug possession and without a trial a plat out and then there was what they called the sentencing phase where a probation officer is assigned to decide whether or not they should the prison are given probation supervised probation so I got access to their files Brunner's and Atkins and in the file with recommendations to the core by Rodger Smith and his wife saying these are good women they shouldn't go to prison Susan Atkins who you know stab Sharon Tate and is that proven cuz she said it and then we went back and forth and back and forth murder she couldn't do it but this was later on that she did it and then when she testified to the grand jury she said that she didn't do it she held Sharon while text abdur later in prison she said that she did do it then she changed again she go back and forth that she was pretty brutal and probation instead of sentence partially based on Rodger Smith recommendation Rodger Smith identified himself as a form of parole officer you know what this expertise and he said he had known both of them for two years and which was also a lie I had only known Susan could have known Susan for 2 years but he knew her for about a year he did not marry pretty well and he never disclosed that he was Manson's parole officer a Manson hide in the same files as the person who lured these women into crimes that they were his communal wives that they would steal for him prostitutes themselves for him and the other people that they interviewed the probation officer are good against it saying they're going to go right back to this guy who's down in Los Angeles and continue the life of crime but the judge released them what they were trying to do was people into the family so they would offer them drugs and and and sacks and lot of women and bring them to these parties and where they screwed up is they got an underage boy who was Rick out right and he was the son of a sheriff so many of these instances where Charlie or members of the family were arrested and then it seems like the police officers who were holding them we're being told hey you got to let these guys go the others this is a higher the situation is above your paygrade and saw that I mean I think describes to arrest that Manson released on a technicality you know the shoddy police work or something when he should have been violated but what he didn't do was talk about three or four more and if you've got enough to chapter 10 you seen all that stuff laid out so when I got this record of a pretty substantial record I took it to someone in Lewis walk neck who was a retired judge and retired district attorney from the valley at around here Van Nuys cuz I needed somebody with the expertise and the knowledge how things work have to look at everything in context things work out differently today than they did in 2009 or 2100 him but he was there and 69 in the DA's office I brought the documents to him and we lay them all out on his kitchen table and he's looking at them in the poor guy was very sick with cancer and the recorder going and he's looking at all the documents and he's seeing this pattern of catch release catch release chickenshit chickenshit this is all chickenshit because he shouldn't he should have gone back the first time because they wanted him out he said he thought he was more important to somebody out than in he goes you got to find out who it was and I go out how do I do that and go you're not going to be able to that's using informant I go but who should I what should I look at because what he was working either for local law enforcement the federal government the FBI somebody wanted him out there doing whatever he was doing so that was important another turning point was a bunch of years later was when I brought similar materials to Steven K who was blue Yoshi's co-prosecutor in the case was an informant that's not just informing on crime and also can be doing the police's bidding that's where the CIA are the FBI part of a program where they're allowing this and also there's speculation that the the goal was to try to diminish the anti-war movement and that this guy was a part of the hippie movement and then so now people with associate hippies with violence and drugs and murder and all this horrific stuff and also there's speculation that the the goal was to try to diminish the anti-war movement and that this guy was a part of the hippie movement and then so now people with associate hippies with violence and drugs and murder and all this horrific stuff</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so you brought up MK Ultra MK Ultra was a government program run by the Central Intelligence Agency originally started as something called Blue Bird and 1948-49 morph into artichoke and then in 1952 became MKUltra was a mind control program a brainwashing program the CIA was trying to learn how to control people's behavior without their knowledge now this is all came Senate and Congressional hearings in the 70s that was exposed but nobody knew about it until 1974 when Seymour Hersh the New York Times Reporter ever put it on the front page of the paper so their main objective was to commit to create what they called Hypno programmed assassins people who would kill on command popularly known as with Manchurian candidates after a book that was written 1962 and later became a movie movie again the people would be through drugs and hypnotism the objective was to get people to go and commit an act of murder against their moral code and have no memory of their programming and be amnesic even of the ACT after-the-fact often that was just one of those are mango but they were also trying to create careers people you know military people that they couldn't plant messages send them you know dangerous areas where they were at that time was the Vietnam War and deliver messages and then have them wipe from their remember in case they were captured that all kinds of objectives so Rodger Smith was supervising Manson when he became exactly what are he was able to do exactly what the mk-ultra program have been trying to create and do for at that point about 15 17 years when it was off supposed in the seventies and there were these hearings first the Rockefeller commission hearings and the church hearings and then finally Senator Ted Kennedy and Daniel anyway held hearings the CIA admitted that they had done this but they know one would say exactly what they did all the records have been destroyed when the two people who ran it Richard Helms would become the director of the CIA in the sixties and dr. Sidney Gottlieb who was kind of the mad scientist 2 had supervised doll that all the plants safe houses in San Francisco New York Los Angeles where they would experiment on people that were lured into these apartments and houses that were either look like brothels or hippie communes or whatever and the people who are working at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic that was run by another Smith which makes it a little confusing but dr. David Smith who founded it he had given and what's to a scientist name Jolly West Louis J West who was when when the killings occurred in the seventies identified as a top and kale to researcher he was an academic come out of the military have been at the University of Oklahoma University at University of Oklahoma sorry and that UCLA running psychiatric division he denied ever being involved in MK Ultra and this was one of the moment. 2001 when you know things really kind of shook the course of my reporting was I learned that West had been at the same place of Manson was in the hate in the summer that Manson became exactly what the CIA was trying to create and I knew lactide interviewed West about 7 years before for a story I did about celebrity stalkers with people who are obsessed with scars and then only to kill them or try to kill them is an expert and violence hypnotism brainwashing and he was a chair of the Psychiatry department at UCLA at that point he was dead when his name came up in the Manson story and there wasn't a lot of I mean I guess it was a lot of Google then or a little bit when I did a little research I found out that there been these allegations that he been involved in MKUltra he always denied it he was never prosecuted never even investigated he went to his grave threatening to sue anybody that said he would have anything to do kind of a program again through another long story but I got access to his files which is been left at UCLA and never been never been processed when I called and went when I made the request it took him two or three months to process the papers I went through them to the whole summer looking for a needle in a haystack and it was intuition God I just thought there might be something there and sure enough I eventually found it it was correspondence between Jolly West and Sidney Godley doctor that ran MK Ultra beginning in 1953 about Kentucky conducting experiments on people without their knowledge to get them to have a musics Asia of the ax after they were programmed and everything that he had been accused of and denied he did not only did he do it he created the blueprint for the whole program of God lead the fact that all these kind of interesting research problems emerged at the hate at the clinic and then Manson came out of it with the power to do exactly what the mk-ultra have been trying to create up to that point I thought was worth investigating further and that's why I kept going and going and going and a lot of crazy s*** back then do you wear of operation would like midnight climax that does with the safehouse play Lordi John's and fees brothels and then dose them up with LSD and studied them yeah George Hunter white was ahead CIA get guy and he would sit behind a two-way or one-way mirror and watch the the John's will be dosed with LSD they try to aerosol or just drinks different things and then they would study their behaviors aerosol sprays play The Wreckers are so scat because Helms order gotlib to destroy all the records in 1973 when the two men left the agency and the only reason anybody ever discovered that it existed was a whistle-blower somebody who used to work for the state department who remembered that there were records in a warehouse and they were just Financial records from the beginning of the program and 52 until the end and the possible and in 73 and it was just Financial records of where research took place how much was spent what kind of equipment was bought but nothing about the content the guy that found that ended up testifying to Congress and working with Seymour Hersh to expose it was named John Marks he wrote the first book about MKUltra that came out in the mid-to-late seventies called The Search for The Manchurian Candidate and after he wrote his book he never you know he spoke to the little bit of a tour and then retreated Into Obscurity and never would do an interview again until I approached them in the early 2000s and when I told him what I had what I had found West files these documents he agreed to meet with me at his townhouse in Washington DC and he told me he said the reason I stopped talking or writing about this is people were camping out on my front lawn you know telling me that they've been victims of MKUltra because I couldn't go anywhere in my whole life became crazy cuz everybody thought that they were subject to this cuz nobody knew they did these drug test on prisoners hospital patients John's hippies people that had no idea this was going on for 25 years so marks became the authority so he had never given an interview till he met with me and when he looked at my documents at that point I think I had about 10 or 12 or 15 pages that grew eventually cuz I kept going back to the files and get him or he said it was the unredacted uncensored account of what the real objectives were and what was really being done had never he said if I had had that my whole book would have been different so that's one of the problems about saying how much did they do or how far did they go there's barely any record and that's another reason it took me 20 years cuz I was trying to find out whether or not West it actually interacted with Manson and was a girls I know he was in the same facility I know that everybody that work there cuz I interviewed everybody that was a lie there most of them were still alive back in the late 90s early 2000s when I did this they all said oh yeah Charlie was eating them we knew it was Charlie in the girls they come in every day or every few days to see Rodger and and West was their recruiting subjects now west while he was there that summer had opened something called what he called the Haight-Ashbury project and in his correspondence and papers that I found he called it a laboratory disguise as a hippie crash pad and and just like the operation midnight safe how they calm safe houses which were disguises Bethea Cordello's and that type of thing or brothels these this was an apartment that was decked out or is he called a tricked-out to look like a communal hippie places six graduate students and I have his letters to them before they came to does grow your hair long wear jeans dress like hippies and lure people in there so they ran that for the summer of 67 and West was getting people from that Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic on Clayton Street and sending them around the corner to Frederick Street to participate in that and and they said idea what we're really supposed to be doing here we feel like this whole thing as a cover for something else what is Jolly want why is he making us bring these people in so I can do to bring people in and drugged programming go on to do legitimate work the ethical foundations of your career or set up in such a strange wife you're manipulating people against their knowledge will they didn't know who they were doing it for that's why they were always questioning at so you know I don't know how I found one or two of them after and they were very careful talking to me I'm sure that yeah that there's no statute of limitations on murder right I mean that's one of the biggest disappointments of my book is that people like West aren't alive you know that to answer for that to answer this and it was really frustrating for me because his name was on the front page of the New York Times in 1977 when they had the major hearings about MKUltra and it identified him as the head of the Psychiatry department at UCLA very prominent doctor researcher and he said he had nothing to do with that he never used LSD on humans and he wouldn't he said they had asked him and he said no I have all these letters between him and the guy who was running the program describing how they're going to do it hide it from his colleagues when he started at he started at Lackland Air Force Base he was running the Psychiatry department at the hospital there 1952 when he was there running that hospital that's when he started his prisoners human subjects and one letter to Gottlieb he says eventually we have to take these experiments out to the field of Jesus exactly does that mean well if you haven't gotten it through a chapter 11 yet you haven't gone to the Jimmy shaver a year after maybe Jamie did a year after I was contracted with the CIA to do these experiments July 4th 1950 for 3 year old girl went missing from the parking lot of a bar at about 11 or 12 at night and her parents with a heatwave they couldn't sleep they went to the bar they brought their two kids they let them play in the parking lot at midnight the little girl disappeared they organize a search party about three or four hours later they went to a gravel pit and two Arrow to Airmen itinerant guys had called the police the local sheriff and said there's a guy here that wandered out of the brush with scratches and blood no shirt and he doesn't know how he got here who he is the police came his name was Jimmy shaver he was in Harriman they did a search and they found a little girl's body not too far away and she had been raped and murdered by this guy who had no memory of doing it the guy no History of Violence had a couple kids and he was a flight instructor at the school he been in the military for a number of years I think it was in his early 30s well guess who became his psychiatrist in preparation for the trial Jolly West who inserted himself into the case and then extracted his memory from him using sodium pentathol where he admitted to the the murderer now in the context of what we found out west was doing and what is detectives were at that same time it raises huge questions about this was an experiment gone wrong you know that he was part of one of these experiments at Lackland Air Force Base where he was signed up during the trial it came out that he had had treatment for severe migraines experimental treatment at Lackland that's another you know smaller subchapter in the book but is it described what kind of experimental treatment he received nobody I mean I have all the testimony of there was actually a treat a trial or jury trial and sentencing and every time it came up it was really frustrating because he never testified so that it was either his wife or his mother who would talk about it was mostly his mother saying well all I knew it was they wanted him to be involved in this two years study to try to relieve his his migraines he would have such horrible migraines he would put his head in bucket of ice water the people who described encountering him that night when he was arrested and immediately taken out of the sheriff's custody by the military police and brought the Lachlan and then back to the Sheriff's he was in a trance the doctors tested him for alcohol cuz he's drunk Uno out just a little bit of alcohol in the system but he wasn't drunk and after the fact they found out that he had I don't want to get into this cuz it's really getting into the weeds but he had hallucinated that this little girl was a cousin who sexually abused him as a child and he was trying to kill her name was Beth rainbow all the stuff came out at the trial Jolly West in 1955 send a report to Sidney Gottlieb which nobody had seen it was another document I found in his files and now it's saying that he had learned how to develop the technology to remove true memories and replace them with false memories and a human subject without their knowledge which was one of the main goals the biggest goals of the MKUltra program it again when the CIA when they have the hearings in the 70s the CIA said nothing was successful everything we try was a failure it was a waste of money we shouldn't have done it and most experts think that that was a cover that they didn't want to admit they that they had developed these technologies that were effective they also claimed that they had released everything they had I found the same report where West said that he had learned how to replace true memories with false ones without a person's awareness but they had remove that from the report and then release it to Congress so that's a crime right there you know there's a lot of that stuff in the book is that this guy through these experimental treatments that they do stuff up with LSD and experimented using these MKUltra techniques and did that to him and then do some sort of this is speculation. I'll go there a History of Violence never been arrested upstanding citizen is only problem with these horrible headaches and he shows up by a small girl's body who been brutally murder with no memory of doing it a year earlier doctor West who became a psychiatrist within a week or two possibly had experiences with them before but there was no record when I try to get the record from the medical center at Lackland his file his name was shaver I think it was essay was missing so where shaver would have been in the medical records it was gone so I couldn't find out whether he'll actually participated in any kind of experimental program that so is the speculation the Genesis speculation that he did commit the crime that he was somehow another induced into committing this crime will go out and do things not even necessarily what to do things against their will against their moral Cody but how would they know that this child would be there how would they do know she wasn't targeted so was it just that they put it into his head to go and downplay anyone was one of the Premier Research new to it he had actually come out of here first gained national attention for being one of four or five doctors who treated Korean prisoners of War who were returned to the United States after they had made confessions of spraying the Korean Countryside with you legal biological weapons the United States so that we don't use that that's against the Geneva codes and these guys were brainwashed by the North Korea Chinese Soviets so when they were brought back after the war West and four other psychiatrists were assigned to de-program them what a lot of researchers believe is that they actually brainwash them into thinking they've been brainwashed by the Koreans where they actually were telling the truth because there's a lot of evidence has come out as recently as 5-6 years ago that we did use these weapons in Korea is that they actually brainwash them into thinking they've been brainwashed by the Koreans where they actually were telling the truth because there's a lot of evidence has come out as recently as 5-6 years ago that we did use these weapons in Korea double cross</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> other big eye opener for what's kept from us at one point 2011 I had a researcher at the Washington Post a woman there who has been there for years so I can get myself in trouble for this to I won't say her name but anyway she's very well known and she's their intelligence researcher she works with all of the reporters at the post on intelligence stories National Security stories and she had someone at the CIA fashion Department who would confirm or deny stuff with her and she said I completely trust these people I've been working with him for 10 years I'll ask them about Jolly West and see what they have on them and I said before you ask them don't tell them cuz she had the documents I share them with her don't tell them what I have proven that he was part of MKUltra just say you're working with an author of the book who wants to know whether there cuz I redone request we can neither confirm nor deny then she said they don't they'll tell me the truth like they're not going to give you another confirm or deny we'll just say we have something and we can't tell you if we can or we have nothing but we'll get the truth to see what they have so a week later she lets me know and she said they said there's nothing he never participated in the program there's no record and I go up and want to say her name I go well I don't think you should be using them anymore because they're not liable and you know that cuz you've seen the documents so she we think that I don't know we know what you did after that's the way they can embed themselves with reporters by letting me know that I'm your friend like I'll tell you the truth it's a complicated world where I keep people safe discuss three Woodson he's the guy that claim to it he'll infiltrator the Manson family no no no no is that after 11 chapters are there 13 including the apologue yeah yeah yeah what's a spook and unfortunately was dead by the time I start a record I wasn't interested listen to some of his close friends he lives in Los Angeles and then he disappear for months doing undercover work and he said we never he would even tell us who we work for but his wife and daughter who were in Sweden and other people who said it was a CIA he told before he died a couple years before his death three or four of his closest friends including his attorney that he had worked on an operation and he wouldn't tell them who but he had infiltrated the Manson family prior to the murders and it was. His dying regret was he could have prevented them but didn't he also said that he was at the crime scene after the killers had left before the police had arrived which was like a four or five-hour window and I was able to confirm not that he was there those five hours but that he was missing and that the police set up watch at his father's house he was living with the try to figure out what was going on he ended up helping Colonel taejon Tate's father who left his job in Military Intelligence to help police in the investigation even dressed up like a hippie dress up like a hippie and soda Reeve and Ray was a really hardcore right-wing guy I mean he was racist and and his daughter sent me pictures of him and she said once he dies in fact this is how serious this guy was he divorce read divorced his wife was a Swedish model first he sent her and his infant daughter back to Sweden from the United States in 61 cuz he thought there was going to be nuclear war and then in the mid-sixties he told his wife he had to divorce her and he couldn't have any relationship with his daughter because his daughter this is only vulnerability because of the work he did that would be how they heard even if they lived all the way in Sweden so the daughter Liza who I've never met but we started talking on the phone and she started sending me materials didn't meet him until a couple years before his death he reached out to her that I couldn't have any relationship with you because of my work but I want to do that now so he Florida Los Angeles introduced her to all of his friends and he died she went to his apartment and went through his things and found a picture of him dressed up as a hippie it's in the book and I mean it's hard to tell but it's in the parking lot and the cars are always late 60s models so this is one of the parts of the book where I work so hard to try to prove that the definite link interview probably 12 or 13 Manson family members and I show them that picture and they say he look like any number of guys you look like any number of guys that that came in and out of there they come for a day to screw us women would say Charlie would bring guys in and we didn't know if they were the ones we're providing drugs or who they were but yeah maybe or maybe not you know and they were all high most of the time too</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the block there's a murder in there that I think the Manson family committed that was covered up by the law enforcement cuz it's screwed up it would have screwed up the prosecution I want that looked into there's also at the end of the book there these texts Watson audio tapes that I found out about in 2008 when Watson turned himself in when he found he was alerted and in Texas he was at his parents house so they call the police call the local sheriff who was Texas cousin and his parents and said he's wanted for questioning in is unsalted murders this is November 29th nobody had been identified publicly as suspects the police were just starting to figure out that these people that killed their victims so to LAPD flew down to Texas Watson was brought into the station question by the LAPD put under arrest they had to extradite I'm so that the sheriff there Texas doesn't put them in a Cell the family call up a lawyer Bill boy who would actually Arizona tax on a college case when he stole a typewriter from a college and a prank Bill Boyd told me an interview in 2008 that that day he had text tell him the whole story or Charles is he called him about how he met Manson why the murders were committed how they happen he said he spoke to me for 20 hours and he goes I've got all those audio tapes in a safe in my office he told me that in 2008 he said he also described other murders that the family had committed that hadn't been connected to them so right away when you're on 2009 working on it that long I thought other murders that's important to me but more important did he tell his attorney why the murders really happen you know why they picked those houses you know this was the first account that was recorded the next one was Susan Atkins about a week later after she had gotten her new attorney that the prosecution planted they audio taped her telling her version which became the official version so Watson's would predate that by a week and when I found out that they were in that safe and he's telling me this on the phone I thought he can't play that to me because that would violate Watson's attorney-client privilege but I thought have to ask is there any chance that's what I could come down and listen to those tapes and he said that's when he realized he shouldn't have told me that all will you I couldn't do that without Charlie Charles Watson Charles permission I go you still in touch with me also I write to him every now and then he writes me he didn't represent him a trial after he was extradited and I thought what you please ask so that began three or four months of me pestering and he would never take the phone call and then finally after 4 months I call open the secretaries and I'm sorry mr. Boys in China on business today and I said what you have to tell him I'm not going to wait anymore I'm going to write to Charles and tell him what he told me I go if there's other bodies I mean I didn't let them know that I was more interested in the motive story but I said if I was interested in the other bodies are victims out there who've never been connected or even the remains were because there's a lot of evidence that there might have been people killed out in the desert and buried there I need to know that and she said okay I'll tell him my phone rang like literally 30 seconds after I hung it up and I had caller ID it was from his Texas office cuz this is Billy boy you cannot call Charles and tell him I told you that I sent mr. Boyd you haven't call me back before Monday cuz why I'm telling you now you can't do that I go well are you going to get his permission I can't wait anymore he says if you do that and you tell him I'll deny ever telling you I said it's all on tape you don't have permission to tape that cargo yeah you gave me permission at the beginning and that's on tape to the goddamn they hung up on me bankrupt and then it was until two or three years later and it's all in there the backstory but I finally went to try to get the tapes again and found out he had died found out that the tapes were in the possession of the trustee who was waiting for the bankruptcy to be evolved over resolved and it took me three or four months of back-and-forth and to try to get them to release the tapes to me and I made an argument for why they weren't protected anymore again long story short I was sharing information with the deputy da in Los Angeles who I thought was friendly he was until he wasn't and he was handling all the parole hearings of the Manson family guy named Pat Sakura the woman who was in charge of the tapes the trustee said it's secure calls me and tells me that it's okay for me to release them to you and explain how it's not a violation I'll do it I said Alaskan so I absolutely I want to talk to her and I said great a day later I got a call from security cuz you're not going to believe that she's releasing the tapes to us I know you because you don't worry I'll let you hear him when we got them then I have lost any kind of control and sure enough number one the trustee had to notify Watson's new attorney Watson put up a fight in court and it's in you can read about the other times I reported on that the year for about a year and one from the local Court of the state supreme court for the judge finally ruled that the LAPD should have the tapes they sent two officers down to get the tapes in 2013 they came back and then nobody at the DA's office would talk to me anymore the promise that have been made that I would be the first one to listen to them reneged those tapes a million journalist have made a Freedom of Information Act request for them they won't release them to Locked Up less mountains attorney want some he thinks it'll help her at her parole hearings because he thinks there's information on there to show that you've been telling the truth all these years he's gone to the state supreme court to other courts they block them down 20 hours first account of how and why these murders occurred and they're not releasing them I think it's because the truth is on there information on there to show that you've been telling the truth all these years he's gone to the state supreme court through the other courts they blocked them down 20 hours first account of how and why these murders occurred and they're not releasing them I think it's because the truth is on there</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is the speculation terms of gliosis connection was he given a narrative was did did you do think that they want to answer that he was compromised when he was given this case in 1969 it's in the book he has family out there but they know about this he was involved in a couple cases the first one before the trial that are crazy I mean when you see the stuff that happened between him and I you know all those years later it makes sense when you see what he was like before he became famous so in 1965 he had his first child Vincent bugliosi junior he decided that he wasn't the father that the Milkman was the father and back in those days you're too young to know people used to deliver milk to home remember hearing about it so he believed that the Milkman was a father he was a whopping coming this Deputy district attorney in Los Angeles and for about I think 12 or 16 months he stalked his Milkman trying to get him to take a blood test to prove that he fathered his wife's child it got so bad that they had to they stop letting their kids take the bus homeschool their two young kids they didn't know who he was he wouldn't tell them who he was all he would say was I was on the Milkman has left the job a month after his wife found out she was pregnant then says why then send his delirium decided that he was fired because he gotten you know clients are people who delivered milk to pregnant so he was writing them Anonymous letters following the kids I actually this is one thing I did hear I heard from the two little girl sent one who's now a grown woman read about this in my book and she sent me a letter and she goes you only got half of it he said he terrorized us he said my father she said my father than what we had a nervous breakdown she said he came to my school and pick me up and and he took me to a toy store bought all these toys me whatever I wanted brought me to the house and he had a driver and he met at the end of the driveway my mom came out and I was like so happy I was like five or six years old I had all these gifts and she goes get into the house getting to the house so what happened was Vince got caught I mean he eventually what was stalking and he sent his wife to the house to beg the milkman's wife to get her husband to do a paternity test and I've done all this from all these civil depositions when it came when the man sued him later Vince that the milkmaid eventually got his brother-in-law to follow them from one of his Steakhouse Pennswoods put the car outside the house he sent them letters like they changed her phone number he goes I noticed you change your phone number that wasn't nice I mean not so the Milkman followed Vance brother-in-law that got the plate number found out who he was and that he was at the DA's office called his personal attorney and the personal attorney called Vince and they meeting between Vince the Milkman the milkman's wife and this is Julio C and then admitted that he had been stalking them because he thought it was his wife here Tuesday as investigators calling this guy a material witness in a murder case to follow him get information private information on Lake big so Vince said he would pay them $100 and never do it again and the Milkman said we don't want your money just never bother us again so that way all about the end of 68 or early 69 the DA's office knew about this he should have been fired immediately instead he gets the biggest case at that point in the history of Los Angeles the tate-labianca trial this is where we get speculative you have a guy like Vince whose compromise he'll do what the hires up tell him to do and if you read in the book Apple younger was a district attorney at the time he was a shady guy who died OSS which was the predecessor to the CIA trained in Espionage don't think too much it's in the book that's where we got speculative it since was answering for something the explanation is because he didn't go into this case clean he had to do what he was told and to this day is the best selling True Crime book of all time and it's a wonderfully written block I mean I could take a page by Page and show your stuff is completely fabricated and made up and that contradicts the real record but you know best seller and that same year then was going to run for district attorney and the Milkman and his wife had never told anyone I guess outside of their family what it happened for 5 before but when I saw that fence was trying to be the most powerful long first person in the city of Los Angeles they went to his opponent and said you need to know this this man cannot get this job so they told the opponent and they had a press conference so the Milkman and his wife went public Vince responded by having his own press conference and telling the reporters here's here's what happened the Milkman We Believe call $300 in cash on my kitchen table when he was on the route so I'm just doing a personal investigation and through reporters that will did you hire let me did you contact the Pasadena Police cuz I know I just wanted to do it on my own and then it's other people pointed out later he was doing this this was 65 he was doing it through the end of 68 the statute of limitations on theft burglary robbery is 3 year it would even if he found out that he had someone the $3 they would have been able to prosecute it so the whole thing went with a live-in slide to the media and he lost the money lost that election then he ran again after Health escape this culture came out for Attorney General of California at that point the Milkman and the wife were going to go public again at the hey we have even more to tell about the Hoosiers I think of what the daughter wants to tell me she actually hasn't gotten in touch with me after the first email I said I want to hear what you have and see she said she's all these. but then a woman named return your car well that she was going to go public to she came out and said excuse me after Vince told the world that the Milkman has stolen $300 for him the Milkman his wife filed a civil suit against pins and Gail his wife because Gail also publicly said with ants in an interview that that's a true that was all about it at this petty theft they sue them for defamation and they settled and then pay them I think it was $12,000 in cash and hundred dollar bills and you know part of the agreement was they weren't allowed to talk about it they couldn't say they've gotten any money and he would only give it in cash so they couldn't trace it to him I ended up getting all the documents that took a long time but I got them then when they went public again when he was running for attorney general they were subject to you know being in violation of that but they said he can't you know them will tell everything he doesn't want to tell he lied under oath and deposition so did his wife about the stalking so in 73 Vince had an affair with a woman named Virginia Cardwell Virginia Cardwell was Catholic she got pregnant she told Vincent that she was pregnant with his child and then said she had to get an abortion and she said I can't get an abortion on the Catholic she was a single mother he said he would set it up he had a doctor it was still illegal and I he he gave her the money to pay the doctor and then he called her and she said she had gotten a abortion everything was fine then he called the doctor violating HIPAA rules the doctor said actually I've never heard from this woman I didn't give her the procedure so Vince went to her house and beat the hell out of her and I've got all those depositions to he he just according to the her Story 2 she reported that he dragged her across the hair about the four by the hair satin her and punched her and punched her again in the face told her she had to get an abortion she miscarried after that episode she went she went to the Santa Monica Police as soon as he left and reported it and nobody would have known about it but the reporter saw it on that you know the police wire service or whatever so the next day it was on the front page of all the LA papers that vents Puleo's he had been accused of battery of a man who said that he wanted her to have an abortion and she wouldn't so Vince went to the police told them she was lying she was a client that he had had one phone consultation with never met her face-to-face and she was trying to embarrass him because he wanted her to pay him two or $300 he defend her like he did the Milkman he he made up a story and worse this time he told that to the police this was an in their investigation of the battery he lied to the police that it did not happen but here's what happened the next day after the newspapers reported it and then said it was a lie and he told the police that Ben's went back to her apartment with his secretary and a typewriter and he held her hostage I know that sounds crazy it's in the book at the end held her hostage for I think three or four hours bagging her and then bullying her like he might hit her then so I can't remember to go to the police and say that she had made the whole story up his secretary was there cuz once he got her to agree to do it she wrote up backdated bill the bill for the money and had Virginia sign it so Virginia finally agreed to go to the police said look you're going to be charged with filing a false report which is a felon it was a misdemeanor but it could go to a felony and you I can take care of all that I've got the connections to the DA's office in Santa Monica what you did and he did take care of it so she called up the Santa Monica Police Department to say she was coming in to report that she had made the story up because she was angry about this money and the cop said right away he knew that something was wrong in the Tremor of her voice is it what kind of got you and Vince was on the other line he said no no no they can't come here this is no no no I'm coming and they said okay we'll see you when you get here and then they dispatched two cops to her apartment now this endeavor in public before I found a did become public about what happened Vince got away with denying it the cop that went to see what was going on in to get her Sunday Michael Landes he was retired in Santa Monica I got his name from the report he said oh yeah pencils at the house he wouldn't let us end he said he and his partner Steinberg were there and she's cowering behind them crying and we got her out of the house prior to the station and she told the the store that it was fake that and he said what we saw him there she goes you have no idea how dangerous he is I didn't I made it up please it was a false report so she got charged the next day's papers reported that this woman to come out and admitted that the whole thing was made up nobody said anything to the cops didn't talk to reporters about fence being at the house and then we know he prevailed he won then when he ran for Attorney General of California and 76 Virginia Cardwell went public and then then said told the same lie about her he'd never seen her face-to-face she was trying to get two or three hundred dollars from him for a phone, do not pay the money for a phone consultation he lost the Attorney General's race when she went public and again with the Milkman and mistress then she sued then dang he lied in the depositions and then when he got caught with the cop the other people who could show that they've been together and there was a history of that had an affair for like six months he was all that and paid her a substantial amount of money to go away so this is the kind of person who when I told Vince I was writing about this in my book he's like the number one I can't talk about either of those cases because they were resolved and there is non-disclosures and I do the things you know that's not true because number one Virginia is dead she had died so she can't see you and she went public and so did the wise owls that the Milkman in the mistress and I wouldn't you know I'm not interested in your sordid you know personal life but it's relevant because I'm arguing that you committed crimes in the prosecution of the Manson family suborn perjury hit evidence you know manipulator the defense by planning an attorney so I if I'm going to you know try to make this case and everyone's not going to believe it because you're Invincible EOC you know this prominent prosecutor author will I have to show that there's a pattern in this Behavior not only that you are lying under oath in the depositions in these two cases before you settle but you also lied to the police in the in the Cardwell case and you lied to the papers and both if I have that in my book then people be more prone to believe that you do the same thing in and the tate-labianca but you would break rules to win your connections did he have a Ghostwriter for Helter Skelter. Collaborate call Vince's wife came to her house and knocked on her door and said please do this my husband's making me crazy we know that he's your husband. Man isn't the father of my my boy but just do it to make him stop and the milkman's wife said we're not we don't want anything to do with you people just leave us alone and go away if you cuz you don't understand my husband is mentally ill he goes he'll never stop that's why there's nothing I can do to get him to stop at the end of our 6 hours I don't know put in the book I might not have he said to me no kill things I have some psychiatric issues and she's been trying to get me to go to a doctor for ever so you know I'm not saying that this is a reason some of this stuff might have happened but I do you know I don't even know why he would tell me that but yeah so I think that he was able to be manipulated because of these vulnerabilities compromised daughter and a mistress for the next 30 Years I interview the mistress I didn't put it in the book you know I didn't think it was necessary I guess now I'm telling it but it actually got reported after he died cuz the Mistress of told a few other people I'd known about her for years and I knew he had a daughter who was you know at the time of Vince's death she was in her thirties I think are you the mistress I didn't put it in the book you know I didn't think it was necessary I guess now I'm telling it but it actually got reported after he died cuz the mistress it told a few other people I'd known about her for years and I knew he had a daughter who was you know at the time of Vince's death she was in her thirties I think</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so these groups were trying to incite violence now we get to the motive of of of the official Narrative of the Manson Murders are the tate-labianca murders which is what the prosecutor vincible EOC presented at trial which was the famous Helter Skelter mode of Manson believed that there was going to be a race war and he wanted to incite this race war because he had convinced his followers that through messages he received from the Beatles White Album from there lyrics from Biblical Old Testament prophecies that he had been told that he was going to be the savior of the world and once a race war started he would hide his family in a bottomless pit in the desert and when the race war ended with the blacks winning the blacks would be frame for promoters they would the Manson family would emerge and repopulate the planet with their perfect top Offspring and dominates the blacks but whether or not it was the motive for the murders is I raised serious questions about the mansard would discuss it in that way that there was going to be a race war and that they would emerge and then their offspring yeah yeah except for the fact that I was questioned so the way Julio C was able to convicted Manson Manson wasn't at the Tate house when the murders happened he had in the official story dispatched Susan Atkins Patricia krenwinkel Leslie Kasabian and tex Watson to the house Palmer House of Terry Melcher they didn't know who live there but just to kill everybody and has mansinthe allegedly said leave something witchy he wanted it to look like blacks had killed these all he did was they were wealthy beautiful whites and he wanted to ignite the race war because of the Panthers got blame for these motors then the police will crack down and then they Revolt the revolution would happen they would be it would spread across the whole world and then when it was over and the blacks had prevailed they were too dumb Manson believed to be able to run the world that's when he will come out with his followers of their hole in the desert and take over the planet now Julio C said in interviews that I didn't have until after he and I stopped speaking which is when he started threatening me with lawsuits and other things in the in the 2006-7 I discovered two or three interviews he gave in the early seventies where he was asked if he believed that Manson really believe this craziness and Lucy Lucy said I don't think Charlie believes in it he got his followers to but he never believed in that he was too smart he was a con man what the interviewers didn't ask him in the follow-up was well if he didn't believe it why did he send his followers to kill these people the first night at the Tate house II night and was valassis the upper middle class the labiancas then you know what was the motive and that's one of my biggest regrets is that I slept and they were kind of obscure when was a pan house interview the other was original newspaper but that I didn't have them I thought I had done all the research I thought I read every interview he'd ever given but I didn't have it at hand to say all right then. I get that cuz I don't think Manson believe it either then what was the motive for the murders why were they sent there to kill and that's what the book Explorer so do you think bugliosi was operating with the knowledge that Manson was apart of these programs that's the big question yet he invited me to his house and Pasadena April of 99 we spent Lily 6 hours together he was so kind and generous time I thought I scored I had the prosecutor hadn't given interviews of he always gave interviews about this but he hadn't for a number of years agree to do it for whatever reason and during the course of that interview you know I arrived at his house went to Kitchen his wife gave me Italian cookies with coffee and lemonade then he and I went out to lunch in the valley somewhere he showed me some of the sites connected to the murders then we went back to the house and cocktail Sunset and towards the end of the six hours I did realize that even though he was talking Non-Stop and I'm recording everything he hadn't given me anything new or different I mean I just finished Helter Skelter I read it for the first time so I never been interested in the case till I got the assignment so I took what we call the Hail Mary pass in journalism which is you ask someone if there's anything they could tell you off the Record not for attribution that will help them to get something fresh cuz I was still searching for a go to the first month of reporting and then kind of thought a minute and then goes turn it off turn it off so I turned off the recorder and he did I could tell he was debating but then he told me something which I'm not sure if I don't think I reveal it to the last chapter is off the record with salacious pretty shocking in the larger picture and it doesn't change anything really but it showed me that he is a very count of something very important in the narrative and I took that away and I thought wow I'm going to delete it was off the Record in 2005 when I interviewed him for the second time and all things went to hell and he started threatening me and with lawsuits and writing letters to my publisher trying to get them to stop the book he wrote about what he told me and he claimed that I had dragged it out of him and embellished it and all this but once he put that in the letter the lawyers at the Publishers that was not on the record anymore because these documents will all be in a Civil Trial when he soon as you what you said he was about to do not off the Record by the police the first day after the murders they found it hidden up in a loft videotape videotaping home video taking was relatively new at that point not a lot of people had cameras but Roman Polanski did and in Helter Skelter Vince says in the book that the police took the tape viewed it and it was just Sharon and Roman making love and returned it to The Loft Roman was in London at the time of the murders he came back immediately and then about a week later he went up to the house and one of the first things he did was he when I pull off and he never even knew that they took it allegedly that that's a story found it and took it Vince told me originally off the Record that the tape wasn't of Roman and China making love it was Sharon being forced to have sex with two men against her wishes and he said Roman was the one who's making it cuz you could hear him in the in the background you know if you ready to pull you read those chapters when we did a lot of bad stuff to Sharon yeah he seem like a terrible person when you hear what he did what the reason why I can never come back to the country go well okay it makes sense it makes once I have that that's kind of the first rabbit hole I went down cuz I'm like well if this was different in the official narrative what else might they have changed so Vince and I were talking on the phone about every week for two months he was so accessible so I'll be interviewing people and one of the first things after that that I found was the perjuries by Terry Melcher on the stand I found I got access to two separate files and found that Melcher Doris Day Saint record producer youngboy wonder who lived in the house with his girlfriend candy Bergen on Cielo up until January 1st of 69 then moved the Malibu and Roman and Sharon moved into the house and February melchior was the part of the motor for why the house is picked and again this is getting into the weeds but it's hard to talk about any of this without the sex position Manson sent his followers up there to instill fear in Melcher by killing all the occupants of his former house who were strangers to them I don't believe that that's the official narrative but melchior testified at the Grand Jury and then at the trial that he had three fleeting encounters with Manson one of these boy drummer Dennis Wilson's to there I think and then one there and then to when he went to the Spahn Ranch in April and m69 to listen to them play music with the possible possibility of recording them and he didn't think they were talented enough and told the trolley that in so many words and then again this is the official narrative that's my man some kind of spy role in one crazy cuz he been rejected by Terry Melcher so he decided it was time for Helter Skelter the race war and again a lot of these things don't add up when you back why did he kill Terry Melcher at the house in Malibu cuz he knew where he had moved to widen just go to this other place and kill strangers maybe Terry wouldn't connect it all that bottom line was Terry on the stand and then all the official Accounts at this case of which there are many nights is helter skelter but lots of books his relationship with Manson ended in May of 69 he said he never saw him again when the murders happened at his former house it never occurred to him it had anything to do with him wasn't Manson I stopped believing that a month or two in and then I found these documents showing that meltra actually had gone to see Manson twice at the Spahn Ranch after the motors and then once all the way out at Death Valley where they had the Barker Ranch where they were hiding when they were finally captured in in the fall of 69 once I could document that that changed the whole I mean it didn't change that impacted the mode of a Mauser was app witness the camp is Charlie wasn't at the Tate house Manson Hut Arbolitos he had to come victim of conspiracy and other words ordering people to go up there and kill and he had to have a reason for that house at Terry provided it by saying yes I did go out there and try to record them and then eventually the question that came out but I never had anything to do with him again I had no idea I never saw him or heard from him motivation was Revenge she was using but it didn't make any sense because Melcher saw him after the murder several times I think you could get away with anything then because the antics of the family at the trial and everybody was so horrified by what was going on nobody was looking at this critically and questioning stuff cuz everyday you know Manson and the girls are getting thrown out of the courtroom for screaming for singing for dancing for mocking the proceedings so all this stayed under the radar but once I could prove that melt relied and then two or three more than I knew that I had to question the entire narrative so fully OC started monitoring my interviewing this is all laid out in the beginning of the book so by the fall of the first year of 99 I got a call from one of my sources Rudi Altobelli with another important witness he was the man who owned the house with murders happen he was traveling he was actually in Europe with Sharon who would come back about about three weeks before to have her baby and Rudy it told me from the very beginning he was very close to Terry Dennis Wilson in the third guy Greg Jacobson Craig Jacobson was another important witness who lied throughout the whole all of us that somebody in the trial just did a narrative needed Rudy had told me that that's called him what are you telling this O'Neill no one was supposed to know about that means promised me it would never come out so at that point I knew that I was onto something even even bigger and then I got a call from Vince and he left a message on the machine saying he wanted to talk to me what's important so I called him back and he said you know I'm hearing can't remember who told me another little game of his he would never be the guy said to me or one of my friends events that someone told her that you're questioning my tactics in my choices at the trial is that true you're not time with what's going on here I go I'm looking at stuff missing you know you knew where this was going I mean I know we haven't talked at that point we hadn't talked for about 6 weeks I think you have I want you to assure me that I'll be given the opportunity to answer any of these questions because what might appear irregular to you as a lay person can be easily explained by me as well of course not definitely swing back around to you before you left and I thought this was going to be out in August and we were in like October I think it'll yeah I got an extension it's a booking that you lied that it's not a magazine so I don't know I'm still getting paid by Premera cuz I was at that point and I had no idea it was going to be a book cuz we're still in the first six seven months so at that point we stopped talking Vince and I and it wasn't until 2005 when I got my book deal that I went back to him with these questions I thought hope naively that I would get him to break down and say yes it was all the CIA operation I was Opera stupid as really freaked out by how deep you got into this he's going to hurt me like I've never been hurt before and he's going to sue me $400 hundreds of millions of dollars is crazy or when you get to the end of the book you'll see the outcome of that day and what happened when he's begging me he's saying he'll give me a quote on the cover of my book if I don't publish this stuff and and then when I wouldn't agree to anything then the lawsuit sweat started happening so I naively I didn't think it was going to break down and say I was working for someone else I had no choice friends but instead he was evasive threatening screaming denying here to recorders I had two recorders he went off the Record every two minutes so we have to turn off all the recorders and then switch not turning his attention in Turner's back I don't know you didn't turn it off wait no that's mine is yours so woman and he's screaming and cursing at me going they were already on because we couldn't keep up with all the off-the-record she's then when I got home that night so I walked out of the house 6 hours exactly almost six hours just like the first time 6 years earlier he's grabbing me by the arm of this isn't quid pro quo this isn't quid pro quo but if you don't put this ridiculous nonsense in because you know a blur from Vince Polly always refer to himself in the third person 1020 times a day mean the man Z goes you'll see that in the book when I get home that night there's messages, call me and he called me I think it's a week we can have almost every day the next morning a few days later trying to he would believe me and then he said this is going to do to my family my kids and all that went on and on and on unless you have them I know I know and then he knew he said when we finally goes at the very very last phone call which is the week and a half later he goes so you really going to go ahead and do it this then I'm going to report what I have I go if you want at this point I thought I had sold the book so he knew I had a publisher I told him who it was and he asked for Hooters name there he said because I will be sending them a letter because I will work on this letter for hours it's going to be a complete rebuttal of everything you argued all of your arguments all your points it's going to ruin you they're going to cancel your deal cuz they're not stupid so he wrote the letter they got it and I think it was June or July after February of that that year 2005 and I got a call from my editor he said you got to talk to our attorneys I hate those we have a letter from fence I go I told you it was coming it's 34 pages single-spaced with 50 pages of attachments and I've never seen anything like this so he said talk talk to the attorney so they sent me over to the attorney and he said my first question. I never met the guy before he was my first question for you O'Neill is is he suffering from dementia I was a law student during the trial and he goes I follow the trial everyday in the paper I've read Helter Skelter he was brilliant because I can't believe the person that wrote this letter wrote that book so maybe you were dealing with somebody who is impaired I said he's mentally ill and have a lot of proof of that in the book he is not the match I go he's finishing his magnum opus a 20-year effort to write a book The rebutting the critics of the information about the Kennedy assassination I was got a book coming out at or and sure enough you know he wrote I think two or three more books after that I go he's just I caught him all of his arguments don't make sense he's contradicting himself that letter goes off in the directions that it sounds like it's written by a Madman I go to going to inhibit us because I don't know where we're opening the champagne 50 pages of attachment of the first letter then about 6 months later another letter I think there were four total I quote some of them in the book it was not and unfortunately he passed away in 2015 or 16 and I get a lot of criticism by Demi to get it from her when he died I know he was sick off and on for a couple years but I've been accused by my critics of not publishing the book until he died because of these threatened I wanted him to be alive I wanted him to be accountable and have to answer to all this the reason I didn't publish it when I was going to polish it was penguin my publisher canceled my deal in 2011 date motive do to get back to the house the main motive is to ignite Helter Skelter race for the sub motive was to instill fear in Terry Melcher because he had rejected Manson so you're saying well then if it wasn't those then what was it all right if you look at the cointelpro objectives which was to to diminish the to neutralize left-wing movement and make them look horrible evil bad and this is what drugs are going to do to your kids the kind of outcome that this these murders had was to make the hippies the boogeyman I mean the biggest Boogeyman in the United States history I don't know forever but at least until the 70s came Charlie Manson and when Manson was and his family were identified as suspects the first week of December 69 I mean it was like Earth shaking because all of a sudden nobody knew who had committed the murders that the case was open from tell first of December you have photos on the front page of every paper in the world of these hippie women you know nursing children living communally who are accused of these horrible brutal slang and the argument was that end with the reporters were reporting was they had gone crazy on LSD and free love and and and the hippie ethic and that was same thing Johnson Control power trying to do their trying to damage the youth Revolution the youth targeted that house though he saying what we have to do this is when they were mostly battling the panther, trying to neutralize the Panthers and La was go after the whites the elite White's the Hollywood white or supporting the Panthers or something called a white panther party that began in La 67 or 68 Jane Fonda Warren Beatty Cass Elliot those three were actually under surveillance by the FBI they were part of this group Donald Sutherland and they were basically a support Leonard Bernstein they supported the Panthers they raise money so in this one, which I think it was the winter of 68 it's got the date said that what we have to make the whites think is that when the revolution finally happens when the blacks rise up they'll be lined up with everybody else and slaughtered so if you look at that memo that was part of their operation which was to they did it by sending letters making you know the whites carrots or if you read the book that this could have been okay I'll Circle until Pro operation to turn you know the world the nation the culture against hippies the left-wing the Black Panthers and they picked that house because it was high-profile because Sharon Tate bought it actually they were like the social Center of Hollywood it wasn't just movie people who was the music people Terry Melcher and Candice Bergen live there for two years before that was a party house everybody went in and out of their kind of represented the elite of movies Music Hollywood you know white people so that would have been a very high-profile place to hit Target Joan Didion wrote in her book The White Album that the morning she learned about the murders and she knew most of the victim she goes it occurred because I knew that the 60s attended they were over I mean there was also Altamont and I mean not a whole lot else but that was like a cultural watershed moment that the morning she learned about the murders and she knew most of the victims who goes that occurred because I knew that the sixties attended they were over I mean that was also Altamonte and I mean not a whole lot else but that was like a cultural watershed moment</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and in the middle of all this isn't do f****** this the lady who said that Biden did something to her now she's saying it was sexual assault yeah but if they're smart they're going to swap by now right now they were wrong before like that here's why they're right now and they're wrong before anybody could come at anybody with an allegation for anybody could come in any high-profile when you say believeallwomen you have to live by that you got to believe Amber Heard tip of his finger on his pictures of the finger and is the audio recordings of the doctor looking for the fingertip they're looking for the tip the can't find the tip like where's the f****** fingertip the room oh my God look at the blood and you can hear them talking and she's like violently sobbing in the background, so they decide to give her three times whatever antipsychotic medicine there aren't that she's on so she's on this this dose they decided jacket up to 3x whatever the doses but meanwhile this I've had him me to do Mustangs to leave all women that's all anybody can can approach something you know the Press with a unsubstantiated allegation but somebody's high-profile I mean I understand that women aren't just willy-nilly lying about something but the picture changes when there's somebody is a politically divisive high-profile figure where there is a huge incentive to knock that person off right Brett Cavanaugh weather is Joe Biden is a huge incentive to derail that person so I think in that instance because I do believe that like most women are not just making things up that being said when you introduce politics there's a whole nother level the whole nother letter for sure I mean man who sexually assaulted women also for sure women have lied about being sexually assaulted those two things are they they're not mutually exclusive they go hand-in-hand right people are liars the people lie about the past on April people also or delusional people are also psychotic and schizophrenic people that try to get out of jail rapist you can't believe all people right you also can't believe all men will you also can't believe all women that's right you been Casey Anthony maybe just as bad as Fulton to pressure right close to the finish line that's weird Lady Gaga thing today with him and Lady Gaga where he's talking about how no one should ever put their hand on a woman and I'm watching this with the cuz I guess Lady Gaga was sexually assaulted but who the f*** is ever going to watch that and say you know what I was going to put my hand on a woman but now I'm not going to go back to that thing looks like Hillary Hillary haircut at look at it, looks a little I was just coming out now I guess people throwing it around now but if you were thinking about hitting a woman and Joe Biden is what keeps you from doing it I guess maybe if you're a woman who's being abused it could perhaps encourage you to go to the authorities right they couldn't perhaps I mean right but I would imagine but by saying but him saying no man should ever put his hands on a woman thinks they should disagree Public Service Announcement all that kind of s*** like okay who you doing that for like who who's out there going out. Joe Biden and he's like don't rape me like the people that we have ruling us I have been exposed as like Creations Rana these people everything they say scripted you know all of them are are in the pocket of big business interests and like and and these people have been exposed so now we don't believe anything</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do all of us in the political world Joe Rogan's political leanings are like the great mystery in Franklin over Biden all these people I just don't think it's a good idea to take some and put them in one of the most propositions the world has ever known that's what I'm saying is not an endorsement of trump is it is a me saying you shouldn't have a man who's clearly clearly in the throes of dementia I mean I'm not a doctor but when you can't form sentences in public and you forget what you're talkin about and you you're you wander off into these conversations if you're not smoking pot if you're not high do not pills like what's going on well there's cognitive decline he's an older man that has mental issues and you know not to be cruel to him he's he's suffering medically this is it is the real issue and the Democrats want to sweep that under the rug and Trump is already to animal parties already dismissing him I mean that there is a recent thing that Kyle kulinski posted a video on his Twitter talking about this is what happened when you don't discuss the elephant in the room and Trump saying used to do it and ask him a question or something to bind Rodeo I didn't write that he's like that's a democratic operative he didn't read it he probably doesn't even know what's going on right now and he's going to he's going to continue to do that and it's it's such a vulnerable point and I I don't know why the Democrats thought it would be a good idea to take someone who's clearly got a problem and this is the guy we've all seen it that's not normal it's not normal to get like when he's talking about the Creator and he literally loses what he saying he's like you know the thing like the Declaration of Independence and the idea that he's going to be able to get through this and be okay on the other side to run the country for for potentially 8 years is crazy here's a better one Epstein FC's killer nobody thinks that if you have various theories are various stories that people come out and talk about with that one yeah and I just actually yesterday listen to Eric Weinstein solo podcast Jeffrey Epstein I love you listen to caught it he he talks about his kind of conspiracy view of it I wish I was there I would have been faster because Eric is too smart he's almost like to smart is one of those guys you talk to him I call you poor bastard you're burdened your burden trying to make sense of the world around Apes you know and all the trauma of an idiot like we were talking about he still also the 13 the twenty-year-old kid so you seeing hit a few run-ins with authority which makes it which makes him suspicious of authority and I think the r life experience defines that so you can see I've seen in a lot of different ways depending on how you've experienced but if you were there quite a lot of people that have met Epstein basically she took a picture with him your reputation is Tainted he was good me know how many people I don't mean to make it sound positive or negative it is what it is is the devil's going to be Charming so the other thing is he genuinely showed curiosity towards scientific ideas even out there big scientific IT specialist but maybe just look at it from the perspective of is the big Theory the big Theory right is that he's some sort of a intelligence operative right so he's an intelligence operative his job to try to infiltrate the scientific communities and there must have been a directive if he really is an intelligence operative is not like they like hey interest Big Love of science just feel free to do that in the side know what what what the f*** was he doing if he's an intelligence operative what is it that the intelligence having sex with underage girls we can't be that you know this is one reason people believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of them were true with you with the Epstein case like you were one of the first people that mean as a literal you're a professional skeptic and you looked at the evidence you like well you know what this might be a conspiracy you know I might be a conspiracy it's probably a goddamn conspiracy there's been enough of them about that one because after I posted something about the other two cameras broke or whatever somebody wrote me from that prison saying all those cameras are always breaking inconsistent with hanging and much more consistent with someone strangling you include including the actual area where he was hanging from supposedly like it is consistent with someone strangling you from behind not consistent with you hanging by your own weight after Weinstein got his is Harvey Weinstein got his conviction I thought they better have a real suicide watch on this guy play more incriminating to him though you know I think what he's got is probably hey I had sex with all these starlets and turn them into big celebrities and is I bet he probably doesn't want that out especially at this stage of the game nothing I don't think I'm going to make him look good and I think the thing with Epstein is he knew way too much about too many powerful people there's just some so many connections it could be made with that guy and that you know what to do gay people are asking questions that people like Bill Gates don't want to answer prince Andrew or any of these people they like to get you know I don't want to talk about this yeah by Gage but prince Andrew of course find out if it's true Bill Gates flu in the Lolita Express cuz that's what I was reading today there people trying to ask Bill Gates but it's so hard to know what's true and what's not true today that's the thing is there's so much data and so I mean one of the things that's really sad about the loss of respect for mainstream journalism and mainstream media is what we count can't count on them and who's regulating the independence who's regulating these websites who's regulating his people that are just you know so called independent journalist they're just tweeting things and finding things putting things up on their website says it's so hard to tell who's telling the truth and who's not do you want to see people piss in America fuc with football f*** with LSU football or Georgia football college football see what happens you think things are bad now f*** with the college football you know this is a weird time to because right before the election you know election comes in November or imagine if it was going on right now and elections like next week your boy Bernie dropped out yep Rap by Nate Bean Trump know that's your bath that's the guy it shows you how crazy the system is that they wanted him but they wanted Vidant it to to be there guy that they don't they can't admit that he's in cognitive decline all the time I speak for a living I f***** up all the time phuckable time to but we're also talking Library hours and hours and hours at a time if I had a prepared thing that I was doing like I stand up I don't fuk up in a sharp as f*** if you haven't worn those conversations they're asking you if someone wants to ask me questions about things that I understand like MMA or like comedy like if you want to ask me questions about things that I think about it and talk about all the time if you're blocked on but yeah I can talk to you and really clearly about those things and make a lot of sense he can't dad about politics and he's been a politician forever and that's your s*** he's he's and you know he's a guy who's suffering is in Decline and they going to try to win them out and whoever his VP is weather is Kamala Harris or whatever, maybe whoever it is but that's who you're voting for because of the timing of this right now we're in the s*** right where the April s*** is the worst time of the corona lot of people are dying this a slight drop off in New York people dying less today than yesterday slight drop off yesterday from the day before so things are looking pretty good California I can be hopefully everything's up and running again economy starts coming back on track Trump makes a couple of great speeches about Biden is more indecline it's not going to get better nose those two face off Trump's going to light him up like a Comedy Central roasts already dismissing him he's there he's like he's asleep Biden saying like someone said Biden said that he didn't write that was Democratic operative he probably doesn't even know what it says destroy a three-year-old is true</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I was a conspiracy not or if I was a country that was conspiring to take over the world this is not a bad way to do it I don't think that's happening right now I want to be real clear but it's kind of the same result that we're experiencing right now we're the ones being forced to shut down with who-knows-what consequences but it's also the right thing to do so we're all like whoa you know it's another one of those things about being a person the right thing to do still feels crazy since I was like all right we're just going to sit around and I guess that's what you have to do you know it's kind of in one way encouraging is so many people are willing to stay home and people aren't rebelling like f*** you this is my country I'm going to work I'll take a chance everybody's going to get it anyway f*** you weigh less people doing that when you consider that the government is controlling 320 million people pretty crazy almost everyone's complying with staying home is only a few essential businesses and we're going to have to I think really have spacesuits to leave the house and work goddamn not going to probably be like this is metal plastic thing that wash off you're sort of saying like I I look into the future to see where we're headed and I don't see a really see much out there cuz I don't know where it is but it's not anything good cuz there's nothing there and I'll see like going to the movies again seems like that's probably close to out movies were already dying anyway they've already opened up the Billy like put those right into your house between bucks perfect way better yeah I don't know that it's just that those are all the fun things we used to do so I f*** it's also once everything's in place where they can treat people effectively and they have the adequate number of ventilators then are we going to go back to the way things were or we going to have new standards and place I don't know I don't know man that they look they did an unprecedented thing they locked down the entire country to save people's lives never happened before we're in New Territory and you know it's dangerous when a moron like me is making sense when I'm one of the people talking about something like this give us your take on how we got here because this is it's been very strange obviously the president completely miscalculated what was going to happen in the way he was explaining it to the news he was kind of saying that it was just a few cases and they'll be gone and now obviously New York City shut down the entire country is separated from each other everybody is isolating at home give us your take on how we got here will let you know that the truth is we knew this was coming or something like it we had a heads-up and and even a even a heads up before last year because this is now our third major coronavirus disaster of the 21st century we had what's called * severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 that started in China terrible epidemic in Toronto and actually took the the Rolling Stones to do a concert to bring the economy back to Toronto in 2003 and then it was mayor's coronavirus infection and 2012 and this is the third one so we actually do realize that coronavirus is we're going to become a new thing and we embarked on a big rotavirus vaccine program a decade ago and each time Parker so the point is this sung fortunately is becoming me normal for the globe is terrible coronavirus epidemics and we saw this one coming up and at the end of 2019 in China and I knew we're in for trouble because that's what coronavirus is do weather to was this the other two SARS and Mayors now we called this new Once ours too so the reserves one than mares and stars to so both stars 1 and mirrors made you so sick and that's such a high case fatality rate that anybody who got it was almost immediately hospitalized and basically out of the community that the difference with this one ironically is it is it's pretty lethal it's about five to ten times more lethal than regular hello seasonal flu but also there's a big group of people who don't get very sick at all and so you have this Serta Perfect mix where it's not the most lethal infection we've ever seen it's not the most transmissible infection we've ever see but it's high enough in both categories that are combined in this very toxic waste so what you have is you have a group of people who are getting very sick or in the Intensive Care Unit like older people those with diabetes and high tension even a group of younger people who are getting it very sick and then a larger group who only getting mildly sick who could still walk around the community and be out and about and stores and restaurants and infecting everybody and so this is what caused the problem it's a it's highly transmissible news on big group of people walking around spreading it and a smaller subset but a big sub said we're getting very sick and even dying in intensive care units what's playing on in New York City right now. What it whatever is stopping people from funding medical research I hope they open up the floodgates now I hope they realize you need more of these guys and then you a lot more money and they need to be way ahead of this s*** we have because this is one pandemic there are multiple different scenarios of how this happens again sure will there was another guy that died recently on a bus that they are identified as having a completely different bars in China but he got a virus that specifically hasn't jump from human-to-human it's only jump from rats to humans in the way it jumps from rats to humans is by ingesting animal feces or animal urine you know animal fluids somehow or Another live bat fluid in his body in and was dying on this bus and they pull the guy off and then you test positive for a totally different coronavirus it's killing him you think would happen I can imagine some guy gets Corona and he's got it f****** bad systems are shutting down this is it he's going to die and he wants to have sex again but he doesn't want to get anybody sick as dogs I think I cracked it and what if it's only his dogs but if everybody has to come to his ass in front of his dog we tried f****** a bunch of different dogs is there's no way to recreate this thing as we f*** Marty Marty but I thought Marty now we're all going to have to f*** Marty people everyday outside to Marty's house killing people to come too many times for Marta needs a break does it help if he blows you have put peanut butter on my deck see what happens no no no everybody's like the pounds or empty every dogs oh my God realize that freedom is itself an export and one of the great dangers is the China has been exporting the benefits of freedom from the United States into an authoritarian system so that they get the benefits of Both Worlds they get the benefits of our middle finger which I think is the secret of American innovation and they get the benefits of authoritarianism where they can do things that we can't because they can order people to do the unconscionable so my feeling is I'm on team civil liberties and team civil liberties have to be somewhat nationalistic more militaristic more command-and-control like who would you take orders from so in a lot of fields I take orders from you you're the big dog in the space you know and to the extent that you wanted to coordinate something I would use my channel I would subordinate to you and I would want sometimes people to subordinate to me if I have if I was taking a lead on something important when we have this fear of leadership because we're all so individualistic that we never want to take a note like whenever I'm training a new assistant or something one of my best practices is can I get your coffee you know it's very important to show that the ability to ask to serve somebody else in the ability to lead art I have to be a follower to be a leader in a liter to be a follower you can't you shouldn't be one of the other we need right now a more war we need more of a war footing we need for President we need we need War Senators we need people of this mentality because the nap is coming to an end and I do think Nancy Pelosi needs to resign and Bill de Blasio needs to resign I think that this Administration you know made some good moves and fumbled the ball and I believe that past administrations made some good moves and fumbled the ball and the imperative is to stop back propagating what you want to have what you want us to do like defeat prisoner's dilemma and come up with a lie that would cause us to act selfishly ration like if you tell me that a mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled then the ideas I okay so I guess I won't use the mask yeah because you lied to me in the idea that that's what you're trying to do to get you to do what I want like if you tell me that the mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled then the ideas I O Okay so I guess I won't use the mask yeah because you lied to me in the idea that that's what you're trying to do your fingers trying to say what would need to be true to get you to do what I want</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> who's originated the Surgeon General right now at Redfield I don't know I'm sure he's a competent physician I also think that there's a whole thing about pretending that masks don't work masks don't work in the general population please don't buy them or Healthcare people need them that is nonsense it's deadly nonsense deadly physician killing nonsense everyone I mean what we have is a situation in which we knew that the mask and personal protective equipment supplies are wildly off to say nothing of ventilators in ICU beds and now what do we do about it so we have rules like please don't bring masks to work because it's the patients or please don't wear homemade masks because they might actually be more germ-filled virus felt so you're back propagating what you wish to be true to get the action that you're looking for what we have is a prisoner's dilemma for everybody runs and buys up masks who like the people we need to be protected most of the heroes were actually dealing with covid patience and taking huge amounts of viral load so there's no question in my mind that those those are the people that is a society if you would level with us like there's a speech to give which would go like this my fellow Americans as Readiness are I am forced to Tender my resignation effective Friday this week I have failed to heed many of the warnings in our academic literature because our reserves are severely depleted imperative that we not suffer further loss of life and therefore I am forced to make an unusual request having failed you I'm asking everyone who stockpiled masks for personal use to think about doing something sacrificial for the good of us all our heroes are currently exposed to the coronavirus and taking huge amounts of viral load and I'm asking you to donate any unused masks that you have to this population as we are desperately trying to reach how much are stocks please continue to shelter-in-place and recognize that the benefit to you is minor in the benefit to us all as major and this will be following your heroic impulse to bring us back together as a nation this is it if that's where we are then it's time to revolt revolt I'll let her know what we need people to visit civil Civil Disobedience to put our Healthcare people I have not been off my property for weeks the reason I'm here in part is to do what little I can and it's very little to support the people who we who are literal heroes are life-and-death putting this out themselves In Harm's Way idea for Hospital administrators abusing our physicians and nurses makes me apoplectic with rage the fact these people are told that they can't talk to the press and they write to me in there their family and the children write to me my mother was asked to do this my Uncle Works in a prison he's not allowed to wear a mask is not allowed to bring a mask I send a message Baba blah blah blah for us to remember that we have the ability to turn over government this is we are so unprepared as a nation and we've been sold out for so long by our self-appointed leadership class who nobody wants that we either remember who we are and how this game is played at me this is like this is a pre-war footing and this can easily lead to war the transmission mechanism is you have everybody stay indoors because you're worried about deaths of accountability which is you know I don't think they're worried about the number of deaths I think they're worried about debts that the result from triage and that would result in career-ending action this is what you would say on the phone that you think that's really what's bothering them yes and then but if y'all have to stay home while they replenish our supplies then the economy goes into recession recession can become depression depressions the darn conflict in our armed conflict leads to war that would be a transmission mechanism from these stupid masks something that nobody can handle and my here's the thing we are coming up on Passover and we Jews have a tradition that I wish everybody had which is that we read one stupid story every goddamn year just a drill it into your head to make sure it's always fresh and this is when it's time to leave when it's time to change don't wait for the bread to rise this is what I say to every Jewish person like are you sitting around waiting for the bread to rise because they all know the story which is you eat the goddamn that's because the people who waited for the bread to rise are no longer with us their descendants are no longer with us and it is time to revolt this leadership class is unworkable to reason that you and I both came to the word Tulsa instantly. I don't think you took much deliberation is because Tulsi would know what to do when she's also the least encumbered she's at least burdened by everybody everybody in the system hates me yeah you know in the whole point where she would put heads on Pikes this is the moment for heads on Pikes and its importance of Vengeance thing the importances what is the cost to you killing people by failing to heed the academic literature if if a supply was was depleted and you didn't replenish it what is the cost to you there's lessons in how other countries have of you this and how they chose to act particular South Korea South Korea acted quicker smaller population than us but a much more impact the virus they shut things down very quickly yeah yeah and making sure that they visited anybody was known I mean they had a different system and it is people like you and me who loved our civil liberties I believe it in part Singapore's Draconian Society lives off of things that only we can do to our freedom so you have to realize that freedom is itself an export and one of the great dangers is the China has been exporting the benefits of freedom from the United States into an authoritarian system so that they get the benefits of Both Worlds they get the benefits of our middle finger which I think is the secret of American innovation and they get the benefits of authoritarianism where they can do things that we can't because they can order people to do the unconscionable so my feeling is I'm on team civil liberties and team civil liberties has to be somewhat nationalistic more militaristic more command-and-control like who would you take orders from so in a lot of field I take orders from you you're the big dog in the space you know and to the extent that you wanted to coordinate something I would use my channel I would subordinate to you and I would want sometimes people to subordinate to me if I have if I was taking a lead on something important we have this fear of leadership because we're all so individualistic that we never want to take an order like whenever I'm training a new assistant or something one of my best practices is can I get your coffee you know it's very important to show that the ability to ask to serve somebody else in the ability to lead art I have to be a follower to be a leader in a liter to be a follower you can't you shouldn't be one of the other I need right now a more war we need more of a war footing we need a war President we need we need War Senators we need people of this mentality because the nap is coming to an end and I do think Nancy Pelosi needs to resign and Bill de Blasio needs to resign I think that this Administration you know made some good moves and fumbled the ball and I believe that past administrations made some good moves and fumbled the ball and the imperative stop back propagating what you want with what you want us to do like defeat a prisoner's dilemma and come up with a lie that would cause us to act selfishly rash look like if you tell me that a mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled then the ideas I go okay so I guess I won't use the mask because you lied to me to get you to do what I want what he saying so if I say for example let's imagine that I don't want to put seatbelts in cars okay and I say you know Joe a seat belt could trap you should your car go into the water off of a bridge you could infect die from the seatbelt because you become entangled it would not be able to save yourself with this map thing but that masks actually can contain are viruses and they can pull. Can kill you but you believe that that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to say is a related rate problem let's talk about everybody gets sick and dies from contaminated masks everybody gets sick and dies from a false feeling of safety let's just go through a huge list of every bad thing or in terms of I don't breathe in either aerosolizer droplets whatever blah blah blah The Chew are real but you're focusing on like the seatbelt deaths of entanglement because you actually have a covert agenda and like and you're going to think I don't know exactly but if I had to speculate we're terrified of triage deaths deaths that occurred simply because we didn't have enough resources that was mandated to be stockpiled or talked about in the literature that's one thing that is what is liability which is all we were following the surgeon general's recommendation at the time now somebody suddenly found you know I like all the masks in the world I think that the Surgeon General would suddenly said the science would become conclusive because there would no longer be a worried about liability you just get those masks that meetball you'd get the mask to the people who need them and then you stopped transmission slow transitions transmissions by there's also a lot of just figuring it out as they go along there is figuring this out as it goes along as regards The Mask I believe that everybody knows that masks save lives on balance they know that the people who need the most have very weird rules there's this whole thing that the States versus the federal government there's this issue about price gouging and price mechanisms there all sorts of things stopping the mask problem from being sorted out one of which is the masks that are produced in China in the fact that we may have sent masks and personal protective equipment to China so there's a huge issue of accountability and responsibility and that we're back propagating our response how much we quarantine and how much we locked down what are we saying about about what the why the positions are being told not to wear masks when they're seeing patients A Deadly nonsense structural nonsense and it people like you and me don't call this out using like these crazy channel that we have then the narrative just stands until partially what we're doing is a parallel sentence making operation to the standard media which is Twitter said we will now be removing tweets if you contradict official authoritative Health sources so that's just what I did surgeon general's line sense-making operation to the standard media which is Twitter said we will not be removing tweets if you contradict official authoritative Health sources so that's just what I did surgeon general's lying cdc's line who is lying come at me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I have not been off of my property more or less in two weeks so it's crazy to see another human being the dogs get close to each other go back like let's say the end of July everyone announces we got this thing lockdown we have a viable treatment it's no different than the flu and get you this chloroquine with the Z pack or whatever the current treatment is tongues were almost like just acquaintances I don't think that's a good idea still cold and cooties and all that but I think I think everybody's losing their s*** they definitely are I've been talking to a lot of friends that are on the extremely cautious I'd say that and you know they're not going anywhere and they're wearing gloves and masks when they step outside their house to go do some in the backyard and they put the gloves and mask down and they spray it with Lysol and come inside and it's not healthy and it is also healthy I mean the idea that we have not been tested in so long it's good to remember also that the stuff is live and real and it is always been live and real and you know if it was possible to live without the stuff that would be one thing but the 75-year nap that we've been in since 1945 is itself the greatest threat to all of us in our preparedness is just a wonderful indicator where you actually get to see this is the koala your experts this is the quality of your leadership this is what they look like when put under stress that's true right that is a good that's a good thing and I'm impressed with the medical community I'm impressed with the people that are recognizing that this is a huge problem not so impressed with the administration of all these hospitals that have them prepared and terms of like masks and ventilators and a lot of these other things not so impressed with politicians but also it just seems like everyone you said was in this nap State and hadn't really been tested and really globally no one has been tested since the pandemic of 1918 like this right 68 which I had I had the Hong Kong flu and 57 we're sort of the best parallels to this you got the Hong Kong flu and I had the Hong Kong flu and was sick as a dog I was like three two from 68 to 70 remember it oh yeah and I was in San Francisco my Grandma had to come up from LA to care for me it was it was bad there's like one of my earliest memories and 1657 I think are the best comprable to this before we go back to 1918 and almost nobody remembers these things because very weird many people that never heard of The Conch conch flu when I started talking vaguely remembered it until you just said it one of my 52-54 remember the Hong Kong flu but I do you know what I mean like I don't remember it personally know you as a health geek are up on these sorts of things that so you understand the ways in which you know for example you can never flew where the I guess the cytokine storm you know is you're either the threat from your immune system is like bigger than the virus itself or all of these various things that happened but I think that this let's call it the big nap the big nap is itself the greatest threat to us in this is this is bad but it is also a shot across our bow and it ain't this what was happening in my mind when I was on here talking with the twin nuclei problem of selling Adam we didn't stop history is not like we're past Atomic were like we figured that out we just we just hit the pause button for a little while we hit snooze and the fear is also that nefarious play will take this opportunity to a road civil civil rights to Road civil liberties and then China to gain power in the US market to gobble up a lot of stocks why everything is down and try to increase their stake in our economy and try to push you know his hands lovingly around her throat because our Elite have been moving into greater and greater States of China dependence right and so with the BDSM community refers to his breath play and I don't like it I run plays like he kind of like half choke somebody how do you know that not that huge hierarchy rules and my claim is is the China is they Supply so much of our stuff we moved all of our manufacturing base into these crazy supply chain and we are completely dependent on a strategic rival and inner China is very careful if you remember when they when they hosted the Olympics to have these amazingly impressive displays that are always friendly what they're really saying is we have our s*** together and you don't and our system was hackable it was open as long for example if you have a company that has Duty twitch shareholders that the directors of the company must do whatever whatever is in the best interest of the shareholders and everything else doesn't matter then you can have a situation where a director has to move things to China because that is in the best interests of the shareholders even if it's absolutely not in the best interest of the United States this is what Ralph Gomery who used to head this phone Foundation once said in an address I was at at the National Academy of Sciences he just said as a director I am incentivized to do exactly the wrong thing for the United States of America so I'm going to put one hat on and tell you as an American we must not move all of this over to China and then I'm going to put my directors hat on I'm going to vote to move everything over to China because I have no choice and so you know Essence the smart good people all 11 of them we're always fighting this thing about you cannot become to China dependent and it's during the big nap there was no way to make this argument convincing you couldn't say look we have a serious strategic Problem by your gate continuing moves to bring China in is the solution to every equation we can't balance and that that is really the problem is that there wasn't any ability to say we are way too dependent on a strategic rival you saw this at the beginning of the pandemic everyone was afraid of what I don't want to be. Is that a phobic I don't appear like Chicken Little until all of our friend the nutcases the marginal weirdos the supposed grifters and gadflies are the people who most got this one right and early and all the respectable people like Nancy Pelosi telling people please go to Chinatown to celebrate the Chinese New Year Bill de Blasio of New York City despite Coronavirus get out there let you know. Leave your lives don't don't let this thing hold you back these people need to resign Nancy Pelosi should resign is one thing to say we don't have enough information about this it's another thing to say take the information that's coming in disregarded and get back in there and keep fueling the economy this is exactly our leadership class there probably think about this in short-term you can Onyx be the long-term implications of us off shelter play nobody can compute the consequences of not one person in the world knows what happens when you run this experiment the made-in-america argument was always like sort of frivolous almost xenophobic like why do you want things made in America what do you care do you not do not like people from other countries do not want to buy things from other countries it was like this made of it made in America thing was like people to disregarded it in a lot of ways but when you realize that all of our medical supplies like Soma Tomar Electronics so much of all of the stuff that you need to kind of keep things exactly the way they are it's cheaper to make it over there because they will like what we saw at Foxconn but they put Nets around the building to keep people from jumping off and eat the weirdest things people trying to argue that the suicide rate at Foxconn was essentially the same as a suicide rate in the general population talking about that's where they work there's Nets around where they work is so many people where they work jump off the building to end their life because their life sucks that bad that they kill themselves at work so rare it is to kill yourself at work probably pretty f****** rare you know, that is where you have to put Nets around the building and look we're getting really tired of people going to the roof and jumping off cuz it's the easiest way to kill yourself they're going to get more creative yeah the problem is we are all hooked up to this or cheap product profits when we can't figure out how to innovate enough to actually create the juice in her own system and therefore we have to rationalize so we've gotten into this idea of every year we have to have a newer better piece of electronically if you had to go the rest your life with an iPhone 11 how much would you suffer not that much although I would say that many of us are not that excited about the next phone that would that that itself is an antiquated rabbit what I'm saying is like to why can't they make it so that you can just fix this I mean like who the f*** fixes their phone you don't fix your phone you bring it into going back to like the questionnaire I think you not depression-era thinking it's like why can't things be sustainable the plants obsolescence in the need to update so that you never a problem if you need growth to power your system then in a weird way it makes sense not to build the optimal phone because if you were to build the optimal phone and then people stop renewing everything your system stay in your system weirdly breaks down so it makes sense that the levels of the phone that you wouldn't want to do that but weirdly in aggregate if you can't start innovate if you can't figure out a restart innovation in a big way now you're stuck with either having to learn to live in steady-state which none of us Americans have no program for living study state we need growth that was the whole point of the embedded growth obligation idea that it's suffused throughout every institution every Pension Plan assumes growth right all right so now we have this problem where we don't have the growth and we need the growth and then in a weird way the planned obsolescence is like fake growth it means that we're going to re-buy our phone even as if they were now highly Innovative so there's like a weird way in which we become dependent on nonsense where we don't have the growth and we need the growth and then in a weird way the planned obsolescence is like fake growth it means that we're going to Bree by our phones even as if they were now highly Innovative so there's like a weird way in which we become dependent on nonsense</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> 2004 have there been plans implemented to clean up and also restore waterways and all the different absolutely absolutely in now there's like a whole they realize this is an issue until there's a there's precedent there's very much so and and that largely came from what we saw you know in those early years the 2004 first stop on down there on Dexter Canyon Creek and then what we had on Ciara's all my partner was shot 2005 about then we started also see the bear poison Cindy's grows like the carbofuran bottles and just to give a background this stuff is so deadly it was made as an insecticide rodenticide just to kill anything that you put on any type of Agricultural Product and it was made originally back and I think like the 50s for legitimate Agriculture and then when they found out how toxic it was NEPA Bandit from you sore even possessions felony to have in the country and use it anywhere without special licenses through legitimate channels Ali banat like 15 years ago cuz I was so nasty but because it does keep everything off the marijuana plants I mean nothing can even get near it without dying almost instantly they still get in third world countries they can get it in Mexico and it gets smuggled across the border with the groups that the drug trafficking groups because it's so effective regardless how poison it is and we were starting to see more and more of that stuff as we were starting to grab more of a specialty to do in this job more you know thoroughly and safely and get into the cleanup of this is one of them I brought this up with Dan Crenshaw the other day and I talked about you and because he's against federally making marijuana federally legal and I said one of the problems with it being illegal is des and I was explaining these grow-ops at for the rest of the country where marijuana is illegal by the vast majority it like what was the number that you said the percentage that was his grown in California that's illegally sold through the rest of the country 70% marijuana population or marijuana product that you're buying if you live in in place like South Dakota went wherever I don't even know it's legal in South Dakota where is the illegal they're buying it from here exactly and it's because one of the reasons because our state laws say that won't first while we're close to Mexico so the cartel members can come up really quickly drive and then the other problem is that our state laws when we made marijuana legal recreationally here weeks severely lower the penalty for any legal grow-op became a misdemeanor correct that was the that was the thing you know when we started the the Department's special team that the spec ops marijuana enforcement team that had more goes into part of my job is being the co-founder of that and a team leader was Outreach so I was speaking to legislative groups before we legalize under prop 64 than the tide or medicinal marijuana laws that that came about that same time and I was talking to conservation groups that you and I would be I'll be part of preservation animal rights groups high school kids new assemblies right watch out you know if you're using weed make sure you're not using this stuff cuz it's so nasty things like that and my whole point was if we're going to regulate guys we see a common let's just regulates Mark let's not lessen any penalties for the trespass grow that the cartels are doing our public lands of private lands and also the other game groups and there's there's other groups you know that to a smaller extent but unfortunately when we did regulate and all that was passed two years ago they did Watertown so public land cultivation went to like you said it a felony to a misdemeanor and if you're at juvenal cultivator on public-private land in one of these juvenile you know cartel members and there's a lot of young ones learning if it's an infraction and that took a lot of emphasis away from that part of the problem and left us out there basically alone with a couple other agencies to fight it for the average person that would sound before you knew about the cartel that would sound like a good idea at will hey if marijuana is legal was probably had a big deal exactly the other problem is these people that are buying this marijuana in the rest of country it's highly likely that they're going to have some of that pesticide on it right and how bad is that stuff is that stuff ever killed someone from smoking this it legal marijuana we don't know if it's killed anybody directly because by the time it gets distributed throughout the country does dissipate a little bit but it's still highly toxic to put it in perspective about three years ago we had two Federal officers back he's not even in California in a public land grow that had all that toxic on it so they have cartel grows out there they do they do they actually Crow we have them in about 20-25 or 27 other states to a much lesser extent and something we need to look at is California I mean we're one of only six Mediterranean climates in the whole globe so we are great weed growing stages like our wine industry man we got great great weather for it so we can grow outdoor indoors I mean February almost December right and that's why it's growing here and that's why the black market Dothan you know the private land communities in the cartels are everywhere across the country with this stuff but they'll go wherever they can until you know diversify the network so we do have it in other states to a much lesser extent and it's something we need to remember is even though about half the country has these grows in mm2 to a lesser extent than California the same groups are under the same Enterprise they're doing human trafficking doing gun-running you know to fuel the fight down to Mexico methamphetamine production and now the new synthetic fentanyl that's just killing thousands especially on the East Coast are coming from these group so it's all one enterprising of course we focus on the Cannabis issue because that's what the factor while Lancer waterways it's right at the Hub so yeah it is it's it's Nationwide it's not a California problem and we may be really really careful even though we're talking about a team in California game wardens we're trying to tell when they the Cannabis issue because that's what the factor while answering waterways it's right at the Hub so yeah it is 6/8 Nationwide it's not a California problem and we may be really really careful even though we're talking about a team in California game wardens we're trying to tell a nationwide story because the nation needs to know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> first time I went to Japan with house paint until we go home and literally take one set of clothes out of a bag thrown in another bag and leave so we got to Japan and on this particular trip I brought my girlfriend at that time and I think Danny didn't leave his own homie or whatever but I'll be brought a bunch of guests and it really gets through customs and as I'm getting through customs the guy reaches into his one jacket I have any closes hand out and there's this I'm not going to but he's like what is that and I was like what can you speak English cuz he said it in Japanese so I said okay okay what is that was like my brain just was like well f*** man just stand looks like weed so it looks like weed you know I just f****** owned it that's just a little right f****** taping the f****** finger like I have like my my lady everything at the time everybody got the strip search they never strip-searched me they searched everything I had all my bags everything right they tested one nug of weed whatever I end up after several hours the record label paid off whatever their to pay off we got into the country and we're able to do our tour and the point in the story there was a f****** hate my guts the whole f****** Bunch when we get to the hotel I'm unpacking my back trying to figure out how the whole f****** thing happened and looking at the jacket and I reach into the pocket that was as nothing in there I think that's crazy I reach into the other pocket of the jacket I pull out a f****** ounce of f****** weed they never looked in the other pocket of the jacket but at the last tour like had enough left over just throw it in the pocket not thinking about it on one side for a long time but I got it I called the whole I called everybody that smoked in the crew down to the room after that and I was like your check it out man I really didn't mean this to happen but I probably had more good ass f****** weed in Japan than anybody at the time stop and think of that moment that moment if they didn't go in that one pocket and it went the other pocket first and they found that giant bag of weed we wouldn't be having this conversation we probably wouldn't know I don't think so that's a lot of weed who knows though Mouse paint this was like when the only story like it was like Paul McCartney is banned for life because he got caught with some weed that's that was like that when I don't know if it still exists but there was a point where he was banned for life cuz he got caught with weed over there working yeah that's a problem what's the number one problems number one problem with laws against things like we'd like as long as you can buy some Wiz Kids part of the number one problem a lot of it too is why these prisons are private eyes and they don't want to let a lot of these guys go home and get money for the amount of f****** people in their prisons this whole leg urban legend that I mean it's very believable about this letter that went around like a bunch of people in the in the in the hip hop music industry got not don't know maybe it was within the last decade where they describe like this guy claimed to be a member of the Elite Class of like Executives of the music business in there in the mid-90s and whatnot and there was a time when the private prison industry kind came and got involved in our lungs fast and then kind of help direct like things like rap music and then you remember these to be like public I don't know if you have big are you a fan of music you were at the time of Clans and Public Enemy lose all these proactive like you know counters to like the party drug dealer guys or whatever you're there was another side to it that we existed and was successful and flourished you know amongst it you know and that disappeared that begin like they're this letter that went around was I kind of claiming this guy was part of this thing and he left a meeting when they just got through the whole conspiracy thing I could go but it's like totally believable guys with director music and a f****** media in a certain direction to encourage f****** basically a cycle of f****** prison</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> article in the Atlantic about tracking you with cell phones and tracking you in comparison to trusted people that tested negative like that that that could be the way that we can release people from quarantine and this is because if you have to have a health app on their phone that's really do have to keep the app up-to-date there's one on every iPhone already yeah but I think this is a different kind of it's not you know it's a different kind of thing that like you have to have like you have to be certified that you tested clean for covid-19 it's on your phone Isabel certificate just accepted that people can be sick and we prefer Freedom over a hundred percent safety we've always accepted but my point is we've always accepted that and if we decide to keep going further down that rabbit-hole where we make someone carry device we can track their location you have to have a travel weird man up to what have you been partying all night and go to the airport then like I see you have cancer like no no I just did Coke slippery road if you tell people they have to have a phone everywhere they go right now you don't you can have a driver's license and or a passport and you can get on a plane and you're fine you don't have to have a phone you don't have to have a phone right now and I'm not saying you shouldn't have a phone but I'm saying if someone's going to tell you that you have to have a phone everywhere you go things are going to get slippery but what it was going to be able to track you 100% what if it's just like that's what you scanned and make sure you're healthy but that's the problem is this, but think about all Google has done and is not a knock on Google but all Google has done with basically just the information that they give two companies of what your activities are right this is the reason why when you're talking about things needs Google add pop-up why why is that why when you look up something you find those ads and everything was trying to tell you things figure out the modern what you're looking at you try to figure out what makes you tick why would they do that with this to why wouldn't you do that with this to why wouldn't I give if you could track people you could try out who's going to pay for that software and all that stuff would you rather and while they're doing their light you know everything they do what's this app on them but they can't leave behind the checks their health a group that has more power over an individual rather than another individual is not like the thing about having a massive group that can tell one person that they can or can't do something is it can be abused if everyone's even it can never abuse if we all follow the same rules and same laws then okay we all agree that you we all have the same amount of control and power over each other's lives but as soon as you have more control than the person who you're monitoring then things can get weird it's just natural people are weird they they control people they like controlling people they like abusing power a lot of people that have power abused power so if you give the power of constant surveillance and exchange for the freedom to be able to go everywhere you want in the relieving of quarantine we just want to know your Healthy no big deal like okay well let you out more likely what's more likely is a crazy thing happens and people automatically take advantage when they find an opportunity especially the more SoCal tickets at f****** conspiracy I take advantage of things that happen that's more likely what's more likely is a crazy thing happens and people automatically take advantage when they find an opportunity especially the more predatory amongst us</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I want you say it stand up in podcasting really yeah well podcast things right now its emerging as a different Beast see before people joke about it they will we doing like Howard Stern's to make fun of it I wanted you out your window what are you doing and you know what he was coming from you got to think he's a Pioneer and radio and traditional radio and he made his bones radio and he carved his path and radio then I'll send this thing comes along with anybody can do it the threat the threat but it's also see in a way I understand his perspective because in his day when he made it he had to compete against all these other Killers Arts you got all these other morning guys all over the country and then when he goes it's indicate so he'll invade Chicago he's invading Los Angeles trying to take over taking over but there was only a few slots right so you couldn't couldn't listen to his show later listen to it then so everyone's competing during these slots so you have the slot that is 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. that's drive time baby even now he doesn't know podcast and like I remember I used to listen to Howard for a long time and it probably like maybe a year ago they brought up something cuz you s*** on podcasting is to podcasters even make money and one of the guys got on there and I forget his Cruz name I think Joe Rogan if you like Snot long time listener first-time caller well doesn't matter what bum me out and again I'm a huge Howard Stern fan I think you and I think maybe I forget to send it to me by sense to you when Howard Stern it released that to his employees has like a a yearly like meeting with his employees someone recorded it damn it makes you feel so sick f*** did you realize how Hollywood Deuce by the idea of what first of all you need friends you need really good friends that are like you that are in your world I think one of them's is separates us all of us as comics from rest of Hollywood is like goddamn were glued to each other yes we're gluten we should on each other we laugh it would complement each other we love each other and call each other with each other different thing and no one that but also it's not a doggy dog know I know everybody is running out of that room telling everybody that murdered it and when is he Bill Burr Go on stage the main room and crush it you're coming out and saying it and I'm coming out and saying it and count saying it we're all excited like God damn that was awesome at holy s*** about telling people you see a love for the art and a love for each other did the camaraderie like the the wanting people to be good you realize like he doesn't have to just be about you and they didn't I don't think they I think that's what you were talking about competition earlier talking about Jordan and Tyson in the Balkans yes I think one guy like commit suicide news I guess I felt bad for that you know you don't like that that time that's what I had to do well that's what he did right whether he had to do it or not that's what he did what you know doing it it did work and you felt like you had to do and look he's also we have to be everything you have to look into you got to look at it with perspective and in my head would Howard Stern's always going to represent is that guy who paved the way like without him you got to realize there was nothing like Howard Stern before Howard Stern do it didn't exist you had on IMS was kind of risque and then Here Comes this really tall long-haired rock and roll type do doesn't give a f*** and you just want to have pornstars on my girls are riding vibrators and people farting songs in the microphones is madness and he's getting sued by the government man so that the government that their come huge judgements against the company that owns if he keeps going and he keeps Goin podcast all are you know Patrice used to say like Patrice you say about other Comics that like David tell Dave Attell got a lot of babies and what a man is that there's a lot of other Comics that would imitate David tell out of the fact that they were fans and they were insecure and if they're not plagiarist they just weren't good yet when I was young man I sounded I used to sound exactly like Richard jeni really heard myself on stage when I've been doing an open I caught myself doing like a bad Richard jeni impression with my material when I was like 21 or something 222 like, terrible it was such a Richard jeni fan at the time that is like mimicking him onstage purpose myself and a lot of mannerisms like Brian or delete anybody was he created this radio cab he created this chaos we had these these people this wack Packers were out of their f****** mind and he would interview them and and and talk to all these nuts f****** people that was the first one then remember yet but if he wasn't like oh how's your movie but we f****** and then he made it possible people to talk the way we talk and then Opie and Anthony were the next important phase because when Opie and Anthony where where hang where is Howard is The Man Behind the switchboard and Howard is in control of isn't is it is Universe with Opie and Anthony people just show up like I'd be on the air and it would be like four or five other Comics there and we would we would love it and Jim Norton download all the time whatever he's a very interesting. I loved his love of transexuals and he's honest and raw where were the first loose hang you know so I can get it would kind of be orchestrating a little bit we're like keeping everybody making sure you know keep an eye on everything making sure it didn't get out of hand and then Anthony is this very he's a guy who grew up doing construction and that's how I literally how it got in the radio but is also very intelligent very inquisitive since he's got like a regular guy sensibility but he's also very f****** smart and then he would have all these comics and then Norton was great, can South would be there in maybe Colin Quinn and Bill Burr and me and shaffir and all this madness man was nothing like that really know made podcast become what they are because like those guys Comics just hang out and talk no one ever like Comics just hang out and run the show before opening Anthony so the big steps to podcast and where Howard Stern is most important and then after how it's turned these are Howard Stern's babies Howard Stern's babies are like Opie and Anthony were Howard Stern's babies but they became their own thing just like a comic would imitate David Tao when he's a young guy up and then as he gets older he finds his own speed in this a lot of comics right now that are like top-level guys that I bet if you watch them 10-15 years ago they would sound a lot like someone else and then Opie and Anthony open up the door to podcast and cuz they made comics where they could just hang and then everyone's got their own style like Ron funches has his own style Erik Griffin has his own style you and Brian have your own style Theo's got his completely stopped all of us have these different thinks the girls got his style Christina pazsitzky have their Style Spartanburg yes the world is more Bountiful than it was back then it's not like Burt and Burr or competing against Bert was one run by one production company but Burton Barr will run by a different they're both going to be at noon and you have to listen to one of the other and Burton and it's f****** argument you now they're going to take us out of noon and that's that's that was what they had to do with it was a totally different Dynamic now it's a totally it's like we were trapped in these tunnels fighting for air and pop and we got to the top of the all the air you want is free are free are you can just put up a podcast video put up put up a makeup video makeup sketch fighting for Erin pop we got to the top of the tunnel in this all the are you want it's free are you can just put up a podcast video put up put up a make a video make a sketch and then it might get seen by a million people</div>

Imagine that having all these fights that you have to make and having all this pressure on you and you're also like a famous guy like Dana is only two president Family Dollars in the you get used to that you can use the help you do you do compensated well for it a man who doesn't give a f*** he's nuts did everyone Logan just f****** $5 as long as any other disease where we understood it better I would be way more confident you understand numbers though we do but we don't understand Michael Yo okay Michael you almost died almost. But he did it but he was in the hospital for a week but he's fine okay okay people who are less robust than Michael Yo to die so we got to figure out like what the f*** this virus is how is it get treated what's the most effective way and then then then it makes sense that we're a little bit more loose with our regulations 1% Michael Yo he's in this shape compared to the UFC fighter he's f****** Adele you know I'm saying like he's not in shape compared to Tony Ferguson works out alot you really does again computer Tony Ferguson that's fine anything you can do like that in the forest Island that's what I've been cool about this UFC thing if it really did go to f*** Island not anymore remote situation if it's a small island if you could control the whole island test everybody 100 how much money is the UFC and be spending on these private job how much money are they going to be making with the reality show about moving the UFC to the island cuz I'm watching that s*** f*** Tiger King I watching Dana White's with his crazy or screaming and running around trying to figure out a way to product Island international waters and that's what I do like bro that's one episode like this I'm hoping I'm hoping they obviously I'm hoping the current treatment is the one that works but two if that's not the one that works maybe they find something just as good I think we got a lot accomplished people that don't think it's a good idea but I'm not interested in putting myself at risk but my real concern was how do I know if I contracted it and then I bring it back how am I going to know and then I'll be honest to myself like I really wouldn't know so the only way I would be able to do it is to do it and then be in quarantine until I get tested it worth it packed it and then I'll bring it back how am I going to know and then I'll be honest to myself like I really wouldn't know so the only way I would be able to do it is to do it and then be in quarantine until I get tested that ain't worth it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's all very promising you know it's it's really interesting to because it would become such a hot political topic you know there's so many people that are angry at Trump but they were angry at Trump back when he was closing the travel from China which turned out to be a great idea and you know Donald Trump Jr tweeted today a compilation of CNN and all these other different networks giving out bad information way back in January information saying this is going to be fine don't worry Dana it's not as deadly as the flu each worry about the flu you know don't change your plans don't do anything so a lot of people got this wrong and but so many people are trying to make this a political point right now and it's really it's so so useless it's it that you know about pointing fingers and everything at this point in time they need to concentrate on getting mask equipment keeping people healthy if they can and then Edge people on how to keep your immune system strong and lets you know it's try to let's try to get people to understand the consequences of not taking care of your body it has to be the worst job in the world president no matter what you do everyone's going to have two people going to hate you advantage of the of the pandemic to increase their power and civil liberties you know in hungry and and and turkey and Israel China of course Putin in Russia gets lumped in there like in Yahoo so you're something like this I mean you just clamp down on all travel until he would have been totally accused of being an autocrat he's you know he wants to be a dictator look what he's doing okay so he doesn't do that and then he's accused of not doing enough when it looks like we should have done more and then he said well I'm not going to tell all the governor's what to do and then I'm going to honor states rights for now and of course he gets hammered for that it's like you know but that's actually that's not what an autocrat would do in Minecraft would say yeah I'm telling everybody what to do in a drop all the polarisation politically rally around the present even if you hate him and Senators voted for the Warren at univ for the invasion of Afghanistan and including Iraq including Hillary right so maybe we ought to do that I know people just can't stand Trump and then he's at the idea like saying something nice or supportive or not being critical seems hard to do but maybe this is way worse than 9/11 2001 it seems like you just keeps ramping up and Trump is such a naturally polarizing figure that it's gotten another the left vs right has gotten so extreme right now it's almost impossible for rational discourse and this is one of the reasons why it's a good time now to talk about your book giving the devil his due to graph of the people that self-identify as Centrist vs. now which more polarized she had this two-hump camel here and that's from 2019 94 2004 and then close to today when did is that a trump shift that little hoe no no no no about 2,000 it will really under Obama by 2008 the polarisation got worse and worst far-left far-right young strong Republican strong the Democrat whatever and said that that middle ground has been is been drinking the centuries have been drinking in the polls have been increasing some more more people are polarized conservative talk radio and television or media but but in general I think we've just been more polarized in the sense of not just saying while I disagree with you I think you're wrong but that you're evil your more polarized in the sense of not just saying while I disagree with you I think you're wrong but that you're evil you're you're you're immoral you know this is the worst thing that's ever happened to us and so on this kind of ramping up of the cat catastrophism do you know is not healthy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> identified though just a moment ago was that if people identify with their beliefs that is the specific say political platforms like an immigration abortion civil rights whatever secondary to the deeper core moral values that people hold I defined myself as a liberal and if I mess up as a Conservative Republican whatever and this but you don't need abortion thing I think you're wrong and here's what the impulses well but if I give if I gave up on that one then I'm going to lose all these other ones and then I have given up my identity rights out like when I get to debate creationist intelligent design theaters and so on you know I could tell that if I give people a choice like you have to choose between Jesus and Darwin for your life or not picking Darwin okay because it is sort of belief in their dogmas about Jesus that is their core beans who cares about Darwin and you know whoever the scientist was but if I say keep these as keep your whole religion I don't care what you believe what the science is really good on this and here's why you should follow the facts and you don't have to give up anything for it so I thought okay I'll listen Conservative then climate change is just a proxy for something else like I believe in free markets and free enterprise and I'm pro-business and those guys over there you know they want to attack that now unfortunately allegory success with his film and books and so forth then affiliated climate-science with a left-wing liberal cause there for conservatives have to go against it even though he knows how that much about climate science has become something else that you identify yourself is so we have to take that out of the formula like you keep your worldview that you define yourself as don't give up that but just follow the facts on these specific issues if you're right Wing you used most absolutely certain my skepticism about climate change right so when somebody publicly signals where they stand on say climate change what they're really saying is luck I'm I am publicly declaring my commitment to my team bet that's right in and saw a lot of cognitive science studies of reasoning shows that we we generally don't reason toward finding the truth but defending positions that are part of our team ideology or so Collective whole and in this case we've been talking about left and right but you know there's there's a religious idea or economic ideologies and so on that are part of that is that that's fine Defender team but you know what I try to do in the book has dissed entangle the specific issues let's just take them one by one like why can't I be personally against abortion I don't want to do that but I and I recognized say Ben Shapiro's Arguments for the rights of the fetus but I also think we have conflicting moral values are the rights of a woman and and the history of the way women have been treated and Men of always tried to Lord it order over women's reproductive choices historical this is always lead to bad things like infanticide and and back alley abortions and so on are on one side or the other I recognize and acknowledge your argument a really good band or whoever is a pro-lifer but I still hold this position I think there's a lot of progress that can be made socially to kind of reduce the tension when you say I acknowledge your position I understand it and Steel Man in the argument and then the person on the other side feels like I think that's a that is the best topic when it comes to that because it's when you get to a particular we get to a late-term abortions boy that's a very hard thing to defend morally and ethically and it's also one of things about the abortion topic is that it's so uniquely human in that it's such a messy topic it's not does not like here's a clear one don't murder people right don't guess it'll have to be yeah that's clean that's that's that's a clean subject abortion is not that clean like when is it okay is it okay when the fetus is not a fetus when it's just a bundle of cells most people like you when when do we decide will that such a messy subject and it's such a human subject and I like you I am on the side of pro-choice and I think that it is the woman's choice to decide whether or not she wants to keep the baby but I also recognize at a certain point in time that choice becomes very different the choice becomes very different when is a 6 month old fetus like what is what are we saying there if you if you are just I am pro-choice. Okay are you pro-choice up until the day of birth like when do you back it off when do you back it off and it it is a subject that people do not want to breach they don't want to touch and particular particular people on the left when it comes to deciding when it's okay when it's not okay because they feel like this is angling towards and elimination of a woman's right to choose and it angles towards this is very difficult conversation where are you you recognize that there is a difference between someone who's 7 months pregnant and someone who's 7 days pregnant there's a very very big difference and if we can't acknowledge that then we are being tribal we're being ideologic where's are sticking to our position because we feel like if we concede that this is a complex issue then we open up the door to possibly losing a woman's right to choose and losing these Reproductive Rights yeah I think part of the problem is that we tend to dichotomize most moral issues is right or wrong good or evil and in the problem is it the law has to draw the line somewhere we have to have a law and to get along teenage is this instead of that or the driving age is this the point of which you can have abortion is right here but most most of life is much more on a spectrum a Continuum so here I make the distinction in the book between binary thinking and continuous thinking most moral issues are on a continuum everybody know know where do you draw the line and another Messi human subject yep yep but if you think of it's like well it's a Continuum instead of a binary choice and you know whatever answer it's not just right or wrong good or evil that there's different places to set the the dial so something and hear the comparative method of looking at what different countries do is experiment thinking of those experiments like Japan has a very tight sweat it way down here they let almost nobody in Australia is a little looser but but the tighter than us and so on it kind of look at the consequences of letting just many people in or that many people and see what it does with all countries are different summer more diverse summer more homogeneous you have to account for that and I do not instead of binary thinking continuous thinking abortion you just articulated a perfectly I mean 7 days I'll come on you know it's just a bundle of cells Creed's thoughts on the Nugget place but we have to have a line somewhere so the lies to do that but that been forces us into that binary thinking which is not helpful between these two sides and I think that's so much of what people subscribe to when they do choose an ideology once they choose an ideology they they have this conglomeration of ID did they adopt and they adopt in order to be accepted by the tribe and its this is also a very unique aspect of human communication and civilization that we we have to adhere to the principles in the ideologies of that tribe so you just take on all these thoughts and it's one of the real problems with only having two choices in this country when it comes to politics and it comes to just styles of life you know and there's so many people that take great Relish in switching teams 2 is like I was a liberal my whole life then one day I woke up and realize I was being a moron and now and now I'm a pro-second Amendment Pro Trump Maga make America great keep America great it's interesting cuz those are sometimes the most the most passionate supporters of the new side whether they are there are newly liberal or newly conservative or you know some of the people that are the most interesting to talk to her people that used to be vegan carnivore with almost every style of living you can find a country style the people find appealing noticed people that used to be atheist to become Muslims and they they they they wear you know the hijab and they fully adhered to the Koran really really interesting because I've spent a lot of time watching religious Scholars online talk and watching them preach and watching it since something and as a person who is very agnostic when I watch that it's appealing to me there's a certain aspect of the confidence that they have when they're talking about what God wants or what you know what Allah has in store for you when you die or what you should do because it's written in this particular religious text the confidence that they have describe these things is very alluring even to me it's not like I'm going to join but I'm sitting there in front of my computer and I'm recognizing oh I see the appeal here but I see it I see how this works on people and I find it incredibly fascinating and I think it has two it has to have some sort of an evolutionary reason there's some sort of reason beside some sort of an evolutionary benefit that adhering and being accepting of the morals and the ethics in the ideology of the tribe is that that's how you stay alive that's how you find other like-minded people to stick with you</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> mr. Sherman how are you sir I'm fine thank you I'm still breathing good to see you again we were saying before we get started at the last time we saw each other was we went to dinner about six weeks ago and you're thinking that that might be the end of that kind of stuff that was my last time I've been in a restaurant actually and we made quit shaking hands and hugging to the extent that we used to although I don't think we'll ever ever go all the way to the say the Japanese model of social distancing but modifications like that the change of remote say meetings and education I mean I'm in the studio here in Santa Barbara where I've been recording lectures for my Chapman University class cups is in 101 and I just upload them and share them with the students and and then they watch him and then I said Wednesday take the quiz they send them back now that's not a complete replacement of a brick-and-mortar building with a small class seminar discussion say but but does not adequately replace a lot of traditional education that you don't really need to be in a classroom for do you think this is preparing us for the ultimate where we embrace the symbiotic relationship that we have with computers and become one with the machine and it seems like electronic community happening slowly already and this is kind of a jump starting it I mean already tech companies like Zoomer having to going to ramp up their game because you know the systems are crashing could pretty much everybody's doing Zoom meetings now theaters anymore and I love watching a movie on a big screen but you know that the screens we have at home now big television screens super high-def you know why not just watch movies at all so I don't think we're going to have much of a choice I was reading an article this morning but AMC Theaters might they might have to go under because of the really not good these companies are accustomed to having a certain amount of money coming in every month and I never no one anticipated anything like this or all businesses going to shut down gyms I mean how many gyms are going to go under how many yoga studios mini I mean it's a strange and trying time for people who have small businesses for sure that one of my cycling buddies owns the La Canada theater complex and of course rents out the the space two different retailers including the the theater the theater managers and he was telling me that they normally pay $93,000 a month in rent 7 and 1/2 million dollars a year or something so it's it all balances out but they just told him we're not going to make our rent this month so he has to go to his mortgage company or the bank that we gets pays off his mortgage and so I can't pay you this month because these guys can't pay me in case I multiply that by you know 10 million yeah well of course the government can't just print money and definitely then we're going to get huge inflation and then in that could be catastrophic compared to what we're doing to save people's lives dollar amount you can put on a human life there for total social isolation no matter what does the economy is what we're going to do now well it but at some point you know that you know there's a economic calculation like how many people are going to die saying the next year if we never open the economy we will but what point do you do that supply chain toilet paper stand and the idea of putting a dollar figure on a human life is repulsive to most of us I think intuitive laid in this context but in fact we do it all the time you know in terms of like an automobile company has to pay off the family of somebody who died in their car well there are people who do those calculations like what's the value of a human life and about 10 million dollars the family's got paid off I think it's $250,000 a person X the 3,000 something and you know it sounds so cold like who does those calculations well statisticians do that sort of thing and and attorneys and accountants work on that and judges and juries have to face it and you know that's kind of a normal part of other aspects of life that we're not used to thinking about most of us don't think about it but that's the kind of calculation going to have to do for what we're in now singing and attorneys and accountants work on that and judges and juries have to face it and you know that's kind of a normal part of other aspects of life that we're not used to thinking about most of us don't think about it but you know it's on point that's the kind of calculation going to have to do for what we're in now</div>

Cultural appropriation Tuesday is Taco Tuesday yeah that's cultural appropriation you know that the Mexican Community is being appropriated by these whites eating tacos like we're in Southern California where is there no tacos I mean this is it's like you know what today is and then he shows his talk Taco Tuesday and I was okay with you is he allowed to do it I mean the whole thing is preposterous it's delicious food you know it's not like we're saying white people created it or anything like that is so ridiculous in so many ways but one of the most ridiculous ways it is is that it prevents people from enjoying some amazing aspects of the diverse cultures that we all coexist with especially here in America this is such a illegitimate Melting Pot I think it's amazing that you can go to all these different places and that you know there's a guy I'm trying to remember his name Rick Bayless I believe his name is and he's a famous Mexican chef but he's not Mexican but he cooks Mexican food and he loves Mexican Cuisine he takes all these trips to Mexico to learn with the Mexican Masters and he has a famous restaurant in Chicago where he has a full authentic Mexican menu and people are furious at him because he already is this white guy selling Mexican food like what do you expect him to do like you have to be born a certain patch of dirt to enjoy a style of food and don't you think that he is actually boosting the signal and letting people know that there's some amazing things that come out of Mexico this is an homage to Mexican Cuisine he's not trying to claim it but you know hey this was invented Chicago you know this is not really Mexico PCS saying this is from Mexico we talked openly about the various parts of the country of Mexico where this style of cooking came from and and you knowing how it emanates and it is from the traditional ingredients and he cooks them in traditional ways and it's fantastic like really widely praised restaurant with amazing food and this guy gets hit on for it it's it's crazy cuz it used to be like in the 19th century there was this idea of kind of a pure European culture and other cultures Were Somehow not as good and they Define culture in a very specific way and then back again they're saying no no there's a pure correct culture that only the people born there can you adopt those cultural features that's the complete opposite of what liberals used to RGS the fact that we didn't have as many real problems as we used to and when you talk about Yale with Nick christakis I think this is thing that kids do when they're coming of age they're separated from their parents and they want establish that so many of these older people are wrong about the way life is never wrong we're going to show them what's right we have a new way of living we have a new way of thinking and we want this campus to be safe we want safe spaces and and a lot of it is about in control of their environment and enforcing their ideology and creating something that's in a lot of ways is very ego-driven because they're they're trying to show that they're making a change in the environment around them and they have good intentions while they're doing it it's just their brains haven't fully formed yet and they don't have a lot of life experience and this pattern this pattern shows itself over and over and over again it's a constantly repeating pattern constantly repeating pattern for these kids go away to college and become self-righteous and then try to impose their viewpoints on the older people it's very very comments and it has this these psychological building blocks to add that you can kind of see why they're doing this</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Trinity College Boy by Meister wrote that great book on evil when she actually went and interviewed serial killers and rapists in prison and said you why'd you do it and discover that they all had this perspective like well this is why I did it I had a crappy childhood or you know how I felt it you know that it was totally justified that guy dismay or she cheated on me or they all had justifications behind their argument if the perpetrator is just pure evil he did it because he enjoys suffering at the suffering of other people now there are some Psychopaths that do that but they're very small and number very tiny percentage of the population most people in prison that are killers they did it for moralistic reasons you know he took my parking spot so I slept with my girlfriend until I had to do something and defend my honor and one thing led to another and here I am in prison they almost moralistic reasoning so the problem is not that we don't have enough morality that actually we have too much morality too much moralizing about other people that are harming us so go back to the Free Speech issue at the moment you say we're going to create a category called hate speech okay what goes in that Ben Brightwell state supreme court to uphold this conviction of this guy named shank he was head of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia in 1918 he was Distributing Flyers to draft age men telling them that the conscription is equivalent of slavery because the 14th amendment protects your right to bodily autonomy and when the government says we're drafting you in the military and we're sending you to Europe this case for the European Great War we now on your body for the next four years okay so this is what so here's the famous lines from Oliver Wendell Holmes Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Schenck versus United States that we're all familiar with the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic the question in every case is whether the word used are used in such circumstances that are such a nature as to create a clear and present danger but they will bring about the substitution of evils that Congress has a white right to prevent it is a question of proximity and degree so clear and present danger and cause violence or something like that so that's going to be at the time I clear and present danger protesters of the draft and their argument their argument is pretty You can disagree with insano I think in times of national crisis we have to abolish set aside the Fourteenth Amendment and can script young men into the army and send them up toward potentially die that's alright to do it to protect our nation but we should be able to debate that but the moment that happened in 1919 then category creep or category expansion happened where more more things got put into the bin of clear and present danger Community or whatever so that category just got bigger and bigger and then go back to why liberals used to defend free speech and now it's more conservative doing it and Liberals are in favor of censorship begins with this idea of something like in the sixties where we began to become sensitive to the words we use to describe other people so the n word yeah yeah those are all hate speech to the bins starts getting larger and larger then all the sudden you end up with these list of microaggressions I reprint one in the book from UCLA University California system in 2014 issues this long list of things you can't say like where are you from or wow you're good at math to someone who's not Asian or why you speak English so well these are now considered hate speech feelings of being hurt and that is a form of clear danger to the sort of Serenity of our community and I'll send this category is now Hughes where are you from really on that list all the time because she's from Germany and she speaks perfect English has no accent and people go wow I can't believe you speak English so well or well I can't believe you're not from America or something like that and instead of being a Eli paid attention in school</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> talk to you about Michaels there's an article today in the Atlantic which is really interesting it's about technology it's contact tracking technology and this there's a real concern about this stuff first of all the idea is great that if you did this free America from quarantine this is always the risk right the risk is just give up a little bit of your civil liberties give up a little bit of your freedom and we're going to keep you safe and you know what brings you to the old Benjamin Franklin quote you know he who would give up Liberty for Freedom deserves neither neither liberty for safety stocked up that quote but this is very interesting because they're using it in South Korea and then using it in Singapore and the title of the article in the Atlantic is the technology that could free America from quarantine until today and they bring up this conundrum it mean nobody wants to give up civil liberties and civil he's lost her rarely regained and this is the real concern here that if you do allow people to track who you're in contact with and make sure they're okay your testing negative and you're in contact with people that also test negative so you're okay you're okay to travel now like this is this is a very weird thing and it gets very gray area how do you feel about this sort of thing I like privacy and that I do have a right to not be tracked and you know that you can't have cameras in my home or my yard and it's on in general I think across-the-board that's a good principal and Anna follows the Constitution I think there are times I think it is you know we do have a constitution we do have states rights we do have courts that litigate these sorts of things I could see a reasonable measure being taken for let's say we're going to do the following for 6 months until we see what happens with this pandemic and then once that's over then we're going to revert back now let's say the governor or the other presidents has one night going back well then you have courts then we can you sue the state are you sue the federal government for violations of civil liberties and then you can get them back what happened to NSA when Edward Snowden revealed how much tracking is actually going on I mean that's never been yeah yeah I know emails right yes and you know these started abortion so supposedly when Obama became president is like Xena the transparent president so we're going to stop doing that well. That's not the case we wouldn't have known that without. Snowden or the or the Pentagon papers and you know it's good to know what Mutual favorite subjects of conspiracy theories you know we didn't know about a lot of the things Kennedy was doing and Johnson all the way back to Eisenhower line about the Vietnam War for example until the Pentagon papers came out and then in the 90s that church committee on conspiracies from the 70s a lot of those documents were released and there was that that business about the operation Northwoods Kennedy Administration that people brought to him this idea of a false flag operation over Cuba make it look like the Russians were harassing our aircraft are airports as an excuse to invading Cuba or assassinating Castro and so it's like you know like when you had Alex Jones talks about false flag operations and most of us Skeptics doll that's a bunch of nonsense less than a year later right then all the shenanigans of American intelligence agents manipulating elections in South American but he's our son of a b**** anyway how to support the fascist dictator rather than the Communist dictators like what are we doing doing that anyway well that's what we do it's like wait a minute does the public know about this did Congress approve this know okay so you know this is one reason people believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of them were true</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so you know this is one reason people believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of them are true not all of them with you with the Epstein case like you were one of the first people that mean as a literal you're a professional skeptic and you looked at some of the evidence you like well you know what this might be a conspiracy been enough of them I'm still not sure about that one because after I posted something about the other two cameras broke or whatever somebody wrote me from that prison saying all those cameras are always breaking in a way that Michael Batten the famous autopsy doctor says is completely inconsistent with hanging and much more consistent with someone strangling you include including the actual area where he was hanging from supposedly like it is consistent with someone's trying you from behind not consistent with you hanging by your own weight after Weinstein got his is Harvey Weinstein got his conviction I thought oh boy but they better have a real suicide watch on this guy cuz I had sex with all these starlets and turn them into big celebrities and Cindy I bet he probably doesn't want that out especially this stage of the game nothing I don't think anything he's got going to make him look good and I think the thing with Epstein is he knew way too much about too many powerful people there's just some so many connections it could be made with that guy and that you know to this day people are asking questions that people like Bill Gates don't want to answer prince Andrew or any of these people they like to get you know I don't want to talk about this the gates by prince Andrew of course I flew on the Lolita Express that's the thing is there's so much data and so I mean one of the things that's really sad about the loss of respect for mainstream journalism and mainstream media is what we count can't count on them and who is regulating the independence who's regulating these websites who's regulating these people that are just you know so-called independent journalist they're just tweeting things and finding thinking of putting things up on their website since it's so hard to tell who's telling the truth and who's not and when I was giving the devil his due I had that this was kind of a challenge to me because I feel like there's so much fake news real fake news and bogus theories and in my areas of medicine and cancer cure and I feel like well but I'm a free speech fundamentalist I really believe you have people that short of just lying about somebody or giving away the nuclear codes or something like that thousand flowers bloom and just see what you know what sunlight on all of them and see which ones rise to the top because they're supported by evidence there's a risk to that that is to say no people will take bad information and I'll go shoot up a pizzeria or something that is to say that theory is that 5G is causing people to feel ill to take you out and that the government made up of the corporation's made up the story about the coronavirus as a distraction from 5G stupid and only five countries have 5G Towers why the f*** would you dummies why the f*** is you idiots think that 5G towers are causing covid-19 it's oh yeah you know that was accused with four G in 3-g and you know it is cell phones back in the late 90s and early 2000 there was a scare about you're holding the phone up to your own we all started doing that and that this is may be causing brain tumors and Jay from the cell phone itself or even these 5G Towers is not strong enough to break chemical bonds like DNA to cause mutations in cells to them become cancerous is not a physical mechanism A&amp;B the counter examples that you always have to what about the countries that don't have 5G different options in our Focus tends to be on the one cell so I always use this uristix for my class teaching 2 by 2 Matrix we have for ourselves so I did this with this there's this documentary film coming out about horror films that are haunted or cursed horror films that occur so like the which is the one where the actors died in the helicopter Act of The Twilight Zone The Movie and The Exorcist and the other films were bet you do bad things happen to the actors that are in horror films okay the problem with that is your only focusing on one cell that is horror films that are cursed what then there's horror films that are not cursed nothing bad happened to the actors in those and then there's non horror films regular films which bad things happened to the actors and then none films that are not cursed right someone we just focus on the one so it's easy to find examples that fit it but something like The Shining which is a super horror scary film you're nothing bad happened to the actors and or just take some other film like The Godfather with whatever that's not nothing bad happened you're just bet you just plucking out anecdotes do that cuz they love to believe in spiritual connections and they love to believe in Clairvoyance and they love to believe in haunted things I'm Jamie pull up the article in The Sciences Bill Gates breaks silence on Epstein admitting he made a mistake in judgment by meeting with the pedo Tycoon it says so story about it who knows but he is he is quoted in there yeah I don't know why I know that mean they're so I know some scientists and scientist because he had a lot of money and I can find your lab help help find your lab to the tune of millions of dollars and it's hard to resist that and then maybe you go down that road a little bit and then you start hearing these rumors about his personal life and he was like yeah but the money is good for the lab and what is it was a bad thing and it but it's too late you already went down that road so that when I say it's hard to judge people after the fact in hindsight bias and we look back and go how could anybody I've ever had any association with them it's like yeah but that's the stuff now that maybe not everybody knew the extent of it back years ago</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> shows that when you know somebody say who's gay you're less likely to be homophobic just the exposure to them and so the effect of them up to pass laws to get people to change like to abolish slavery in the United States we needed a war and some 150,000 people died about that and you know sometimes you have to send federal troops like that to desegregate Alabama schools that were segregated and remember the governor you know segregation now segregation tomorrow segregation forever and to make sure you do it sometimes you have to do that most of the change happens from the bottom up of just oppressed peoples saying you know what stop that don't do that I don't like it when you say that and it began with the n-word and just kept expanding where we ended up to today where you have this Big Ben of your microaggressions and so on but there was a logic to it like I'm just saying it's hurtful to do that and most of the effects have been good they've been positive just you know when Ellen comes out on her TV show that. Just a little thing there or when South Park yo makes fun of all different religions you know that perspective on things humor is good television scripts movie scripts the way characters talked you can pinpoint to the decade when a novel was written based on the words that are used to describe Jews blacks and women and but no one said they were going to pass laws to say you can't use these words describe choose by some women we all just change the way we talk about other people in a way that's more liberal that's more all-encompassing that's more egalitarian in that sense and and it's not clear how exactly what happened just incrementally a little bit by bit you know it's just trying to figure out when a word starting to be used it's like it's really hard to 911 or days that I remember in the late nineties there was a couple atheist that wanted to quit using the word atheist atheist and call us the brights we are the brights so that never took off you. Bye-bye trying to change language by Fiat from the top down okay here's the new real we're all going to use this word that doesn't work it's just expanding our consciousness-expanding tomorrow's feared it just including more people in your honorary circle of friends and family members are honorary family members or people that you will treat with respect that that has been happening just tiny bits everyday a little bit here and there and over the decades UCI your people that you will treat with respect that that has been happening just tiny bits everyday a little bit here and there and over the decades you see it when you look back at the numbers like The Thinker does but but it's hard to pinpoint the day that that happened</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah it weird to bring a strange strange moment in history as really is something you got to look at like you said something to me when I asked you last week how you're doing you said you just you're just trying to accept and I think that's the key if you can accept it then you can be proactive about it you can be creative about it you can just take whatever life force you have and and you know look at what what what are the possibilities here don't have any expectations that gets Shattered by reality except what it is or this is a new thing now it stay alive be nice to each other and do your best and try to get through this and hopefully at the other end when science and medicine has gotten a handle on this hopefully we can go back to normal life they'll be wonderful but right now we can't so it is what it is if you just want to run around screaming and hollering and freaking out about it and it's not good what would makes me are concerned than anything is what is life going to be like once the economy rolls back again how many people going to be out of work how many business can be shuttered how many you know how how f***** up is it going to be that gives me the most fear of the unknown because I know that a certain amount of people going to get sick in a certain large percentage of going to get better and unfortunately some people are going to die and all that's awful but I kind of see that that makes sense my mind I kind of see a disease people that that all makes sense what doesn't make sense is an economy that stops and then restarts again I've never seen that so for that I'm like what is that like it is I just know model to base it on because our economy today is so much different than it was you know even 10 years ago the international economy it is it's a it's a digital economy there's so much of it that we don't we don't know how it's going to I was going to play out you know and I know that a lot more people are going to stop going I think that businesses are saying oh we don't need offices for 100% of our people and parking spots know we'll just have 50% of people work from home like we just did for the last 3 months at work that would be very cost-effective for people that don't want to have gigantic offices and then also how freed how much Freedom it is if you you can work from home I mean for a lot of people if that's possible that would definitely be preferable Hellyeah I can tell you from writing on TV shows over the years has been some that I've written from home you know what I'm like a consultant that's just handing them I do so much more work when I have to actually hand it in through an email that when I'm sitting in a writers room with 12 other people throwing out of line once an hour on meeting f****** Sushi I mean I work my ass off because I got it yes that's a good point think about that in terms of creation of material one thing I've been guilty of over the last month I've been written Jax yet I might have a couple ideas I wrote down but I really have been riding when I haven't been doing stand-up and I decided what I wanted to do is I want to know what my take on this is the best way I can figure out what my take on it is is just have a natural take on it like actually go through this and and find out what it is first how long it's going to last what what are you what are your thoughts on this and at the beginning I didn't know my thoughts on at work because my thoughts on or stay safe make sure family stay safe friend stay safe you know do whatever you're supposed to do and let's find out how long is going to take what are the experts say talk to some experts what it what's the prognosis look like keeps getting pushed back now it's June have the same June things going to restart June like f*** was that like what is that like for people that are Check to Check 3 months April May June when when is it when is it go back 3 months from now and it's already been a month you know what went what day do june what am I doing 14 you got more cases then what do we do when we do we ever say f*** it was just go back to work what is that like what kind of drunken Wild West parties go back to work and start going back to bars and a different I'll be out in a bar in a nightclub how many people can be pregnant when is this all goes back this going to be a giant loads but we need to make s*** in the way that doesn't destroy the environment and one of the ways they are able to make s*** in other countries is then on the same regulations environmental regulations as they do here that's always been the big problem with shipping stuff overseas they also don't have the same regulations like when the Foxconn Scandal came out and they found out there was gnats around the building to keep people from play where we met, we have the person who makes them makes good living you know the back of the old days when these two have like great cars were made in Detroit they're all made in Detroit and Detroit was his huge City Detroit was one of the richest cities in the country cuz everything got shipped overseas or everything got shipped to two different places the unions are a great Theory they have work well in a lot of ways but they also have huge problems and if there's got to be a way to get unions back in place that can guarantee people health coverage and retirement without making a cost of doing business so high that it hurts the industry I don't know jackshit about finances so I don't know whether not receiving comments on that but it would be nice if he worked it out make s*** in America where we don't have to worry about things going down and let's let's learn from this to learn from this and start making medicine over here why is all the medicine made in China what do we need to balance out we need to balance out for some sort of apocalyptic event we got to be prepared what's necessary and what's luxury and we're getting we're keeping it simple and they're going to come out of it having a better gauge of what each of us needs individually as a country military out of the population don't know ventilators yeah yeah there's a lot of possibles out there that was the things that we wish we were shipping stuff overseas they just destroyed something today that like we were sending metal medical equipment to other countries oh we got stupid about Thailand we were actually shipping stuff to Thailand right now and then it was some kind of mix-up in the government's apologizing about it now</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you think Ferguson and khabib will go down something happens this weekend just in case she's a monster Justin gaethje is a monster he's a monster cetera find individual he is mean in a sport that violent it's an inherently violent sport he stands out as the most violent I mean you watched his knockout of Edson Barboza you watch out that m*********** attacks people he's there's a reckless abandon to his his calculated wildness that is a terrifying he's something special and he's better all the time the question is how much has he been training you taking a fight on very short notice to taken Define essentially two weeks notice also might be kind of weird to train now and is Coronavirus times training Partners I don't know who I respect very much said that Fighters shouldn't be fighting because I don't know what you said they shouldn't be fighting but he said if they do definitely felt it wasn't fair the fighters because they they don't have a full camp and not going to be able to show who they really are. It's a really good point this is you know awhile situation where there's a guy who's going to fight for the interim title he gets to call let me that's also how Nate Diaz beat Conor McGregor and their first fight remember that that was 11 days out they call Nate Diaz he's eating tacos f****** drinking tequila in Mexico and probably doing triathlons but out of shape like you were I would get but for Justin gaethje really depends entirely on how much time you spend in the gym now he's the plan right he's trying to be the UFC lightweight champion so he's probably not getting too out of shape and he probably knew that in this case there is a potential that one of those guys could drop out because they already made that fight for f****** times and it fell apart this is the fifth time it's falling apart which is nuts crazy so it might be the Justin gaethje knew that this was a possibility that he could be called in as a replacement he might be in full Camp mode we really don't know we have to talk to him, turn you all along with probably getting ready but I'd love to see him fight and there's a lot of guys that have been through a full camper there paid for a full camp and they're paid to make weight this is something that's happened several times in the UFC's history we're guys show up because they're their 222 fight and step in if something falls apart especially if you have a guy who made maybe struggles with weight cutting and you might fall apart and get pulled from fight or someone is may be injured or sick and I like a little nervous with this fine we're getting super fights every week we're getting super fights every week do you think on the island</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> here's a better one Epstein FC's killer that's one nobody thinks that that got hung himself no one how about that guy so if you have various theories are various stories that people come out and talk about with that one yeah and I just actually yesterday listen to Eric Weinstein solopod guessing Jeffrey Epstein I would have been faster in the city because Eric is too smart he's almost like to smart is one of those guys you talk to him I call you poor bastard you're burdened your burden trying to make sense of the world around Apes it Alex and all the trauma of in the yet like we were talking about he still also the 13 the twenty-year-old kid so you seeing he had a few run-ins with authority which makes it which makes him suspicious of authority and I think the r life experience Define that so you can see I've seen in a lot of different ways depending on how you've experienced if you were there tainted a lot of people's reputations basically if you took a picture with them your reputation is Tainted I do think that he was an exceptionally Charming person so he was good Amino the devil's going to be Charming so and the other thing is he genuinely showed curiosity towards scientific ideas even out there big scientifically especially if you ever thought about that intelligence operative intelligence operative part of his job to try to infiltrate the scientific communities and there must have been a directive if he really is an intelligence operative is not like they like hey interest belgians having sex with underage girls you can't be that or the idea of that Erik Bush's Fault by the way I'm talking to him on the podcast I do tomorrow which is why I'm talking about him a lot of preparing for like a three-hour conversation Eric Weinstein which will kill most you have to call people out in their b******* which is very hard to do with their Quest then I checked out ten minutes is that theory I'm so far behind I try to keep up but recognize and I'm not going through and then go back and then listen to it again I hate putting stuff into words simply allergic to saying simple stuff because it's not Bute Woody so he always liked drenches everything in humor and wit and thus like beautiful language was initiated when he's describing complex things he describes him to people that understand complex things. But that's also me this is a criticism is he almost he hates explaining the basics of something hit he just skips ahead right even for the initiated nice to go to the basics. Explain like what are the ground we're standing on skips right into the depth of things which is beautiful but sometimes requires you to listen fall thing is a mess up on the part of the intelligent so they didn't know they didn't know and I know that he felt like he get me remember when this was all started out when he started out doing that it was all before social media right so he probably thought that he had this incredible amount of power because of the fact that he was connected and by the intelligence Community if he was he probably thought he could get away with it makes you wonder you thought that he had this incredible amount of power because of the fact that he was connected by the intelligence Community if he was he probably thought he could get away with it makes me wonder all the horrible things that happened in this world before social media before the spread of information was crazy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> LOL X you might be wondering why what I'm wearing on my face I'm not wondering no no coronavirus time everybody so I'm assuming that's what you wearing on your face scientific study of how effective bras aren't filtering around that have put together a survey paper showing that masks work it started as a movement called Max fall #in the Czech Republic that's essentially one of the critical components of stopping the spread of coronavirus is everybody has to wear masks and the Sciences to fold so I mean I need to break this part but cuz there's an audio if you can't get it so much better nice so the before-and-after so you probably shouldn't be wearing a mask when you do podcast definitely not but everywhere else yes that's homemade masks work so there's a shortage of n95 respirator masks which should be exclusively used as PPE personal protective equipment by healthcare workers okay there's also a shortage of surgical masks which are these non-woven fabric masks that work very well for the thing I'm talking about but because there's a shortage of them we should not be buying them and should be saving them for healthcare workers and then open question was whether homemade masks like the one I just described work to stop as a filtration mechanism this is a confusing thing for the individual Centric society that we live in masks are the most what are they actually effective for what they're effective for is to prevent me if I'm infected asymptomatic from spreading the infection to you so that's where the movement of masks for all started which is your mask protect me my mask protects you and that year there is is not I'm not protecting I'm not creating a wall from the Restless I am contributing to the opposite of the bigger aggregate picture of it by not allowing infection to spread so masks is masks allow you to reduce that transmission rate to 1 to blow one so how long you to decrease the transmission rate while also long people to be in public before businesses I know boo Han is back up in business again but there's a lot of criticism about that and they're also saying they're seeing new cases I think the question I think you can be sooner than we think if we do the following things so one I'd hate to linger on this I'd love to talk to you about it but I'll make fun of you right back but just like fanny packs are exceptionally functional to carry on the things you need masks will be massive acquired slow the spread of this infection and would like one of the things start getting Governor's so politicians to wear them at our President Trump to wear them well this is the Boris Johnson and he was talking about you openly now he's in intensive care if he dies that will be the biggest wake-up call for everyone mean I hope he doesn't die but God damn people told me over there I don't know his policies I don't know I don't know I haven't been anyone in a long time I don't know how I feel about him but f*** people some people hate him that I would like saying things like they're hoping he dies he suffers and dies I've read oil the guy wrote woke Tatiana McGrath yeah is he but it was actually his own personal account he published some of the tweets of people have written about you don't have to put it up there I don't want up these people signal but it's just so heartless so yeah that's masks but testing really masks besides like washing hands masks testing and contact tracing so I don't know what it's like an open question what does it take to do that will you can't like that there's a strange effect to it at any other factors as a as an individualistic Society you wearing a mask not to protect yourself but but to protect others and that's the weird thing for us to do the truth that the that this is a nice positive as me wearing a mask says I care about not getting it's a really powerful social signal for when you're hanging hang out with people I think it's going on though I don't think people were just a large percentage of people is my assumption that are wearing that mask that are not wearing it because they think they're going to protect other people they're worried about getting it and I don't think who in the CDC this is where I I hate what they're doing with which is sort of there's truth and that there is ideas of how the truth will be misinterpreted by the public and so you shouldn't tell people the truth so there's a kind of sense like The Who and cdcf said that masks don't work for example or they said that we should be wearing Masters you say them for the healthcare workers at the beginning of the year World Health Organization set on the podcast yesterday it's terrifying stuff and you know and obviously newspapers were going off of that information and they were printing misleading stuff as well and the president didn't know no one know what's at the whole thing is very weird if you're if you're going based on what they were saying it didn't look like it's going to be nearly as bad as it is and then everyone has had to make adjustments I'm actually one I'm so freaked out about the loss of life and the loss of jobs and how people getting SIDS it's it's really weird that everything about it is weird it's weird In Our Lifetime to be a part of something that's just affecting the entire world like this but I've got a lot of messages from friends that are quarantined with their families and like we've never been closer and that we realize that we're in this together because we realize that you know during these crazy times you you realize what is important love that's Lord you were talkin about love and community and friendship make my neighbors have one so nice that one's way even now and everyone's like saying hi and you know talking from Over the side of the yard and how's everything you guys are right and anything we're right here there's a lot of this like comfort and warmth that you know I think I experienced a little bit of that post 9/11 where people get shocked they get shook up and then they realize what matters you know about masks it feels like you're protecting yourself from like you're removing yourself to me there's that look and we're going to wait for me dirty people get away from me so that a germaphobe kind of idea that's not what they are supposed to represent but that I'm sitting here on the science that says we have to all wear them and then thinking like how is that going to change interactions you're removing yourself with me there's a look and I can't wait for me dirty people get away from me so the germaphobe kind of idea that's not what they are supposed to represent but that I'm sitting here on the sign that says we're after all wear them and then thinking like how's that going to change interactions</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the virus thing just made me think they got something to my dad a lot about my by my grandfather and just brought it and made it so real to me cuz I studied the World War II a lot especially the Holocaust and all that but they like the fact that just learning about my grandfather just made it so real to me it kind of connected everything together plus there's a book I recommend people read is by Albert Camus the plague that he wrote right after what is I don't know if you know if he is he's like an existentialist philosopher existentialists believe that you know you have to live like life is absurd Life Is Life is suffering and there's no meaning to it all you just have to live the moment and take take each moment as it comes and live it to the fullest kind of kind of idea so he described this town that got overtaken by the plague in the book The Bike and that kind of similar to bubonic plague basically similar characteristics and writes about how everybody's reacts in different ways the main character is a doctor who basically sees the the absurdity of the suffering around him that there's no meaning to it all the sad thing about the virus like with the Nazis and with Wars there's an enemy you can kind of Trace back and understand what was happening with the virus it just seems like you can't come I know where it breaks the spine of the way we think of regular life like some people try to cling on to regular life as if nothing is happening which by the way it's kind of like what a lot of our society is doing right now we're not yet we haven't really felt the pain yet and hopefully won't but there's this kind of dumb the Calm before the storm kind of. And then some people become like more religious they start to search for the bigot meaning of life the material possessions and then the doctor represents the idea that no matter what he he gives themselves fully to his to his craft of helping other human beings and overall there's a story that this idea that suffering is just part of life and the only way there's a natural Temptation when this cruelty and suffering all around you to isolate yourself at 2 to withdraw from life because anything you do in life is going to lead to suffering you know dating like if you get married is going to lead to suffering because eventually you going to lose to the people you love so there's a natural desire to withdraw but in fact what she found the doctrine what he saw around him is that love and compassion like giving yourself fully to the love of other human beings until Community is the only way to what that kind of stuff right but to me it's a really profound story about like about love being the right response in a time of Crisis cell crisis in a crisis that hits everybody that you want to kind of hide from it but it actually were more suffering happens so it's a kind of profound book that Rihanna that I recommend people read most people have read like in Hemet High School for this book called The Stranger but that one in particular seems so connected to an allegory for World War so the plague in that case is the Nazis that it just hits out of nowhere and his book is really popular in 1947 he wrote it World War II I wait to talk about these at the virus that first infects the rats and then affects the week or humans and affects everybody it was the connection and then allegory analogy to the the Nazis and so I saw the connection between now and and the Nazis of course the scale there was World War II was much more intense and and finally just how like fragile this whole damn thing is like that my grandfather had probably is your percentage chance of living you know like most people died most soldiers died in the early years of 19th 1941 when the Nazis basically Stalin was using Russian soldiers and just human beings as human Shields the actress through bodies at the problem so the fact that my dad my grandfather survived his crazy like and I do all these things I'm here talking to you wearing a stupid I like all of that is connected to like he somehow survived all those look really affects me doing research you know I hope compact billions people one day you know think that those like a little Ripple effects on how fortunate I am to be part of that I need is just all seem to be connected to me call those look real Ripple effects me doing research you know I hope to impact like billions people one day you know think that those like a little Ripple effects on how fortunate I am to be part of that I need is just all seem to be connected to me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> she gotten a little before that it was Elon about about I think you said that the Tesla said something bad about Tesla not being good about tycoons about Porsche tycan cine lens that is very unimpressed with them but as you reminded me with me and somebody replied with a meme of not a meme a real video of Bill Gates jumping over a chair and they said I don't know I find him impressive and you can't he'll answer yeah that's pretty impressive Tech CEOs of major companies that have the I can be silly like that but you don't use it you don't mean I don't mean it in a positive way sweater with a collared shirt underneath a nerd as somebody as an ideal of a man you're an idiot like I was never like that about a lot of things now you're saying that but about is that science is not admired and ways cuz I've seen the alternative inspiration Soviet Union the way people admire scientists the way they admire great athletes great great creators of all kinds and nerd sometimes diminishes that and in ways that it it seems like a peculiar cork of a human being is just like it's a bit connected to like you know going to Comic Con conventions kind of Nerd VS dork dork dork is rarely positive dorf is good if it's. Self-deprecating car Salvador cost to f****** dork but it's very rare that dork is positive Wars nerd is often positive nerd is like guys science nerd heavy heavy like that's a fun way of saying someone's really smart about a certain thing but but I don't think the way around that is to eliminate words or even using certain words I think the way around that is just appreciate people that are really great at science that's the way around that it's not the words don't really matter its perceptions that matter and I don't I don't think necessarily that science has a bad perception it just doesn't have a glamorous enough perception how many people can name Oscar winners that are just really good at lying there's really good Pretenders but how many people can name Nobel Prize winners in science is very few right exactly and I guess the thing I was also speaking to and definitely keep using the word it doesn't preventing words is what to do with week that I always hated as a person who loves fighting like I like the appreciate like am I like the fact that people complimenting sort of the the pursuit of your scientific curiosity that is great but I just never liked it's good to think I've experienced in this country is nerd as an image is seen as weakness I could get to get picked on and I was and always annoyed me because give me intelligence and annoy me annoy me like lean into it like most people I know are kind of like don't work out much and it and it kind of lean into that idea those people workout is like I don't want to get into their thing those people suck they were always mean to me something like that you kind of create a narrative where like Jiu-Jitsu or fighting is like a brute thing just like you talked about with Greek statues having small penises barbarians with their big penises have a big penis dislike the same thing you don't want a guy with a woman or a guy you don't want a woman who's hot and smart you know it sounds like when people think of really beautiful women they automatically assume that woman's dumb and off of times that is not the case sometimes people just have awesome bone structure and if they you know stimulated themselves mentally if they pursued things that they had an interest in certain scientific or you know esoteric ideas and you things that they had an interest in certain scientific or you know esoteric ideas and you underestimated them you would be Bill really humiliated for super smart but super hot girl put you in your place let you know not only am I hot but tomorrow you stupid</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> CNN article that was wondering how long it's been around there were saying see if you can find this was covid-19 around Inhumans longer than is currently believed they think it might have existed for months. Years before it broke loose and became a pandemic mutate because it didn't read the article yeah where'd you learn that CNM Library news folks it's the news leading scientist tell CNN that it's what they listen to CNN but they they have perception that other people don't agree with just like everybody else but it may have existed in humans many months even years before it grew into a deadly pandemic CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports Bellacino's not doing a good job I decide I think the entire will they doing bad the incentives like they're they're choking out the investigative deep investigative journalism this is exactly you said that the clickbait like like look at the title look at the I think they're trying to stay alive but yeah but that's that's a problem I think it is a problem but I think in the defense of particulate online journalism trying to stay alive I don't think it's good time for journalism now I'm bleeding but I from what I understand the only thing that keeps New York Times functional is the podcast the podcast that broadcast it's huge and that the podcast runs a lot of money but that's not that means they need to innovate they needs to be they need to because of the cast we need the f****** York Times though the problem they need to figure out a way to make money off of it but we need we need the top of the food chain journalism right and that's what the x is always we need them so when someone is someone's done something for the times as not-so-good or flawed yeah okay but still not there. That one person that one article whatever it is is not the X the X stands for something right with the New York Times as supposed to stand for what what it always did when I was a kid and now to a lot of people still it's the cream-of-the-crop it's the very best journalism it's the very best is the ones that have the deepest inside the ones that nail It and Weep free of bias but there's by humans you know this is the problem CNN is the problem with any new source but we still need new sources but it's run by humans they need High salaries and there's a huge amount of people involved in making that system that is a CNN so there's several mechanisms acquired first like this podcast here podcast in general require very few people to run now that there's an infrastructure to communicate with a lot of people and then the Wikipedia model like Wikipedia is thousands of contributors that creates extremely strong factual information that's not like this is very little money required to run Wikipedia incredibly so so that there are some out there that are online though that are thriving because of the problems with Legacy Media it's an opportunity it represents YouTube temples of fantastic journalists he's he's really objective you might disagree with them or you might not find his perspective to be in the line with yours but that guy is he holds those journalistic ethics at the highest level to the highest standard with him it's everything and when you read his take on or see him make it take on things he is giving you the most honest objective take on it possible and really hard to get that from a network first of all through the hard to get what he does for a network because you're going to get these giant chunks where he'll heal he can talk about something for as long as it takes to describe what the issue is where is CNN has a segment man that's taking his f****** 7 minutes while you better be done by 7 minutes Trump is bad coronavirus deadly and holyshit Chris Cuomo's got it let's go to Chris he's in his basement and then see Christmas basement with Sanjay Gupta and they're holding up chest x-rays you know they think they have their segments man segments are b******* it's dumb you have these standards that you've created a long f****** time ago and this is the biggest handicap that Legacy Media has other than their inability to be free like a guy like Tim pool is there not independent they can't be free like he is you have too many working pieces too many producers too many people there telling you what the directions say this people that bring you the segments you're a talking head is a lot of s*** going on there man lot of s*** going on there but you have to innovate and make more you need to Aspire to it and not be polluted by other influences but I can see people like I think I'm objective but I have very different views than Tim pool on some things and not others actively so you looking at a thing of Jack till you're being honest about what what it says but you also have preconceived notions of what each individual aspect of that certain thing means and what's good what's bad that's where the subjective aspect of objectivity comes in when you look at certain things that happened there certain ways you can look at something and not have a bias but look at something and you have a preconceived idea of what aspects of it should or should not be tolerated and maybe times it takes someone else to come along so kill why do you hold these beliefs is yet you're absolutely right but the problem is that based on your skill set and your momentum in history you might look at a very particular aspect objectively and not see the bigger picture for sure like Tim pool has revealed and his focus on certain aspects of problems in the system and he continues to focus on them maybe not seeing the bigger picture that's impossible for anyone to see the bigger picture I think like I tend to I-10 to see in a lot of things the beauty of things and it does focus on the positive I focusing on and also the other thing is choosing the ways you talk about it so Louise you reveal that objectivity B+ and B- he can be very cold and fact-based you can be very flamboyant and very kind of excited that use a lot of visual with all those kinds of things in all of that changes the way the message is carried the void that's been created by this distrust and Legacy Media especially now. I don't know if you been paying attention but like YouTube there's so many people like my brother is not like put the camera themselves right and say their opinions that's crazy. It's over million I think it's kind of a lockdown Chronicles I think it's it's a symbol of where we're going right it's your you're becoming but when I do this thing I'm doing this thing for 5 days a week and I'm becoming more connected with people in some weird way that no one ever thought it was ever going to happen before where there's people that listen to my voice right now in their ear while they're running right a lot not a small amount if you could see the actual number of people right now with earbuds in running listening to this podcast ubill at whoa that's kind of crazy they hard you're running into the next Dimension that's what this is and it seems like it wasn't it seems like go on the internet then somewhere along the line came this weird thing that's what it is Now podcast for a weird thing especially one that reaches the numbers of people that this one reaches and for that to be in my hands is a weird position and I'm you know why what's happening 100-count f****** strange this is I didn't anticipate this I always anticipated this being some weirdo Fringe thing that very few people would connect with which line ever tried to censor it at all I tried to do a vast majority of it completely High out of my mind and hang out with fun fun people just talk s*** and have a good time and not have a different perspective some people have a public voice and a private voice. Try to have the same voice just be me just just do that Dad so I tell people when they say what was Joe like behind the scenes that be awesome if you're totally different almost like a super dick behind the scenes yeah yeah that be a bummer or like a totally different person like you put on that mini skirt and this is just one step that we didn't think was a step it's a podcast I thought it was just like a radio show that you doing the internet but it's not into the way humans are going and this is just one step that we didn't think was a step it's a podcast I thought it was just like a radio show that you doing the internet but it's not for some reason it's more involved and more entangled and more intense and then and then also it has an impact right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Healthcare in this is a healthcare issue obviously is so complicated and there's so many levels to it but it means I think one of them that we really have to dress is died in obesity there's a giant problem with diet and obesity in this country healthy food eating eating the proper food and you don't have a friend who said that they were talking about people who do drugs and people who drink and you know maybe they should access to those same Healthcare and maybe that's a good incentive to stop people from drinking and doing drugs and I said yeah what about people do fat what are people who are fat but you're going to use the same logic with them because you can't sat Jame so can you tell hate hate that so you can't get the same Healthcare that a healthy person does well if you get a healthy person who likes to drink and they did run and they did a job but they do like to drink and occasionally smoke a cigarette what are they fear than someone who's morbidly obese yes they are so why would we have a problem is people who don't self-care with a giant problem with that people who don't take the necessary steps personally now is this because of education is it because of ignorance is it because of a lack of awareness of the consequences of an unhealthy diet or eating poor Foods or consuming large amounts of alcohol or tobacco product I don't know what it is but that is a massive part of our Healthcare System is people who are not doing the proper things to their own body in terms of eating nutritious Foods hopefully they can afford in terms of exercise which is free for everybody and there's a lot of things you can do there free to take care of your body chapter 7 in my book I forgot I got to talk about my book and you know part of the part of the deal when we when we are founders wrote out the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and in and built the framework for this free society that we live in where government's role is to protect your rights as fundamentally the government's role you have god-given rights and these are life liberty property effectively speaking life liberty and property Kristen wrote The Pursuit of Happiness and they choose these words really carefully now part of the exchange there is is a necessity for citizens to live with a sense of Duty and to live as a citizen that this idea of citizenship and to do what is right to do what is good it's hard for me to imagine that people are just so uneducated that they don't know that they're unhealthy you know I think I think problem and you're getting it that problem I don't know if that's true I don't think it's that they don't care I think they have no discipline I don't think it's that they don't care there's there's a difference if they'd never been taught to push themselves there's a lot of people it's just so easy to guess that's one of the reasons why I love the title of your book fortitude is what people need and also they need to understand that there's a great value and doing difficult things and this what's it what chapters that is it what do something hard for you will listen man that's like you're a Navy SEAL on you you know it you got it you live it this is what we need we need more people who understand that I know it's hard to get up I know it's hard to do things I know it it's hard for me to but I still do want and you should do them to me it should be something that we encourage everyone to do and that we we all talk and then we all praise each other for and we all get excited about accomplishing these things and taking care of your physical body taking care of your meat vehicle if everybody just did that we would have his health care cost this country will be radically decreased about the fact that they took care of themselves and then had discipline to not overeat and had discipline to to try to choose a foods and to make a meal plan write things down made it can be done this we're not talking about breathing underwater we're talking about things that can be done by the average person like the notion of personal responsibility is talked about enough as it it's almost all the time immoral and I'm feeling and uncaring when we say you know when this whole I go to tell everybody to be pulled ourselves up by their bootstraps and whatever in like not that we use that term but but the point is is that actually important I don't think conservatives have done a good enough job over time explaining why it's so important and personal responsibility troll our own destiny it's if you're constantly in victimhood if you're constantly being told that that you can't control your own destiny that's fundamentally disempowering that's a terrible psychological states and what exact question is do you do you have or things that happen to you or are they within your control or outside your controller it's something like that in Germany the answer was was overwhelmingly things are happening to them outside of their control right like like you understand what I'm saying 3% of people said yes versus in Germany was like 50 or 60% believe we are in control of our own destiny we tend to overwhelmingly say more than European countries that if we work hard and and and play by the rules and do what's right that we will get ahead that we will find that opportunity and I think if you could immigrate right now what's your number one destination will it's the US of a like overwhelmingly the second place is Canada and Germany at like 6% of respondents the USA is like 21% of respondents the second place isn't even close and so for all of the left-wing like anger and and always saying prevalent for all this for all of that commentary it's it just it's just isn't true and so in any of the reason that use crisis language Okay the reason they tell you're going to die in 10 years climate change the reason they're always telling you that corporations are taking advantage of you in the 1% is just all of this policies put into place and you can't justify you can't justify revolutionising the whole system unless you convince people that the system is so bad and so corrupt that it needs to be revolutionized and created is undermining of this notion of personal responsibility if you're going to convince them that they need you to save them to me do you know each to each to their need each to their ability what you're telling people is that they don't have to work that hard but they deserve they have rights to all of these other services from other people it's their right we should distribute out accordingly everybody's perfectly equal what that does is it removes agency from people and it's truly a disempowering thing and we seen this throughout the throughout history because they just want to work hard and move up and they're just so excited about this meritocracy that we've that we've that we've built into our into our culture 8-bit about how communist Cubans come to America in the moment they step foot on soil they become Republicans it's really hilarious that it's true and they do appreciate that that aspect of this country I think you said earlier is that we live in the best time ever in history and I agree with that the consequences of it being such a great time or it's far easier to get by because it's far easier to get by people look for things to be more difficult than they actually are they look for things to be more stacked against them than they actually are they look for more of a woe-is-me standpoint when you find people that actually have a real difficult life they look for things to be hard they find hard things everywhere they look and often times you find those people that have a real struggle that it's a great documentary called Happy People by Werner Herzog it's about people live in Siberia and it is a brutal difficult existence in extreme cold but these people are overwhelmingly happy and it is really crazy documentary because their physical and their struggle just existence just to survive is so difficult that they found the sort of perfect vibration of existence where they're in the wilderness they're out there trapping and hunting and fishing and and farming and in and Gathering up enough food to survive in the extreme Winters and it's it it really shows you that human beings need difficult tasks we need things to be tough to do and we need to we go out there and do them to have a feeling of satisfaction and have a feeling of personal responsibility and the fact that you've actually done the things that you needed to do in order to survive it's built into us cuz I wouldn't wish that upon anybody I'm not saying you need to get blown up in the face and lose an eye to have the sort of Spiritual Awakening and how good it feels to go through something hard but you should you should have bitchily move into a a self-imposed suffering you're about to say something that have gone through as military or First Responders really difficult physical tasks to get to where you you are just that alone creates character creates a different kind of person and the type of people that gravitate towards those Endeavors those dishes they're special people they are but I didn't write this book for them and for everybody and Glisan seals have our hard thing and it's buds underwater demolition / SEAL training at 6 months of hell and it is it pushes you beyond limits you you ever thought you had hell week especially when you're done with that when you when you come away from hell week there really is the sort of Spiritual Awakening that you have higher confidence you feel prepared for anything even in the some of the worst situations you can think to yourself well it's not quite hell week is it much more perspective relaxing in perspective quite a bit also chapter 2 is is called perspective from Darkness Highpoint the stock doubt that too many of us have have gotten so comfortable we we removed suffering from our life to such an extraordinary degree and that's not a bad thing that's an element of the modern times that we live in and I'm happy we live there but the reality in my life I'm complaining because when I'm at 30,000 ft flying through the air to Wi-Fi isn't as fast as I'd like it to be like so we have very different complaints and it's good to every once in awhile just think you know what I have a pretty damn good and to remind yourself of that again to do something hard chapter is it's one of the Deep dive into the psychological literature which I just enjoy doing there's a or the Bible with all of these all of these texts these these ancient pieces of wisdom that have been around for a very long time they all talk about this bill talk about the value of suffering the value of enduring an Archer how this build character and it's actually quite literally makes you stronger and do something with a metaphysical sense in a psychological sense and a physical what hardship actually does but physically and metaphysically like those real real benefits to this but you have to do with Joe Rogan's wife because their true life experiences to bolster those those lessons but it just has to be harder than what you did yesterday and maybe it's physical you feel tougher the rest of the day there's you like you know what I just sat and 10 minutes of icy cold water I didn't do that the day before but I did it today and now I feel a little bit more like a badass like you know what I feel like it's small things it's this self-imposed suffering is so important for a lot something and I'm just saying you have to find that in and make it habitual can't just be warrants either the seals can gets off to we we all know that if you know we know who those guys are and because they stopped stopped listening from the value of self-imposed you have to find that in and make it habitual can't just be warrants either cuz he gets off to we we all know that if you know we know who those guys are and it's because they stopped that they stopped listening from the to the lessons from buds into the value of self-imposed suffering</div>
